We hypothesized that forest groves are the result of colonization of the open savanna by forest species, facilitated by the activity of leaf-cutting ants. In this paper we present results from a field study conducted on an ecotonal belt between a deciduous gallery forest and an open savanna in the western Llanos of Venezuela. In seven transects, trees, groves and leaf-cutting ant nests were counted, size parameters evaluated and distance from grove to forest measured. Soil chemical analysis and microclimatic measurements were performed in the forest, grassland and groves. Floristic composition of the woodland component of the savanna (scattered trees) was very dissimilar from that of the forest, but the composition of the groves was essentially a mixture of both woodland and forest species. Woodland trees were present in all groves, whereas forest trees were present only in larger groves. The size structures of populations of the two types of trees differed significantly according to the size of the grove; also, woodland tree population structure differed significantly between open savanna and groves. The frequency of groves with Atta laevigata nests increased with the size of the grove, and groves with forest trees were positively associated with the presence of nests. A. laevigata nests improved the soil of groves, increasing N, Mg, Ca and organic carbon, but other soil properties were not modified. Temperatures at ground level in the dry season were ameliorated in the groves compared with the grassland, and this effect increased with the size of the grove. We concluded that a dynamic process of grove formation is facilitated by the aggregation of a few woodland trees, followed by the successful invasion of forest trees and a leaf-cutting ant nest. The results did not show any clear sequence of arrival of the ants or the forest trees, but it seems clear that these two would act synergistically, improving conditions for each other. © 1995, Cambridge University Press.

Propagule sizes of red mangrove varied considerably at all three study sites along the south-eastern coast of Florida, with propagule fresh mass from 3,9 to 20.7 g for the scrub form and from 5.3 to 35.8 g for the tall form. Highly significant correlations were observed between propagule length and fresh weight at all three study sites and for two growth forms. The scrub form had significantly smaller propagules than the tall form. A greenhouse study showed that CO2 assimilation rates were not correlated with propagule mass, but total leaf area per plant increased significantly with increasing initial propagule mass in all three family lines of both the scrub and tall forms. Consequently, total carbon fixation rate by each seedling increased significantly with increasing propagule fresh weight in all cases, and the biomass increment significantly increased with increasing mass. Relative growth rate, however, was not correlated with propagule mass. The differences in leaf areas and biomass accumulation among seedlings from different sizes of propagules seem to have resulted from the differences in maternal reserve of hypocotyls.

The results obtained on the dominant grass species Hyparrhenia diplandra and data published previously show that C4 savanna grasses exhibit a remarkably high leaf photosynthetic capacity despite their low nitrogen content. A variation of leaf photosynthetic capacity in relation to leaf rank on stems is observed which is interpreted by ageing and shading effects within the canopy. Seasonal variations of the canopy CO2 assimilation rate is explained in relation to variations of leaf area index and canopy nitrogen content. Despite low nitrogen content or low leaf area index, maximum canopy net photosynthesis was high (24 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1 for LAI = 1.5). The high photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency exhibited by leaves of humid savanna grass species is a major attribute explaining high photosynthetic rates of the grass canopy in this environment. This result sustains the emerging opinion that tropical savannas could be highly productive despite the generally low nutrient status they experience. © 1995, Cambridge University Press.

The effects of irrigation and the rainy season on soil gases, water and physical properties were studied in a lowland moist forest in Panama. Two control plots experienced a normal four-month dry season and two experimental plots were irrigated during the dry season. The forest soils were well aerated. The average soil oxygen content at 20 cm never dropped below 15%. Irrigation in the dry season resulted in treatment effects on soil oxygen and water that persisted throughout the rainy season. The late rainy season soil oxygen content at 20 cm was 18.2% in the control plots and 16.8% in the irrigated plots. The late rainy season soil water content at 0–10 cm was 0.34 m3 m-3 in the control plots and 0.36-0.37 m3 m-3 in the irrigated plots. In the control plots, in the absence of any experimental manipulation, the soil physical properties changed within a single rainy season. Specifically, soil oxygen dropped and soil water increased during the eight-month rainy season. The observed alterations in soil physical properties probably resulted from changes in soil structure and the abundance of large pores. The rainy season or irrigation may decrease soil porosity by dispersing aggregates of soil particles, whereas soil desiccation during the dry season may enhance the formation of aggregates and large pores. As a result, the irrigated soils held more water and were less permeable to gas and water than soils experiencing a normal dry season. We conclude that the dry season may play an important role in maintaining soil structure. © 1995, Cambridge University Press.

The average body mass of reproductive females was smaller than in temperate woodlice and because of a positive scaling between body mass and fertility: brood sizes were rarely larger than 30 young and usually between 5 and 20. Reproductive allocation ranged from 16 to 27% of female pre-birth live mass and differed significantly between species. Associations between reproductive allocation and body mass were all positive although only significant in two of the populations. A small number of females produced more than one brood during the study and iteroparity appears the most likely reproductive tactic in these species. In woodlice a restriction on body size results m lower fecundity as brood size is ultimately determined by the size of the marsupium.

Twenty-five per cent of all white-eyed vireos observed foraging visited Bursera trees. In addition, presence and abundance of territorial white-eyed vireos in small forest patches were correlated with the size of the Bursera crop. Vireos were the most reliable dispersers of Bursera seeds. These birds visited 32 of 35 trees observed for at least three hours. They accounted for approximately half of all bird visits, and two-thirds of the seeds dispersed. Most of the other species rarely visited (5% of visits) or failed to remove seeds from the tree. Peculiarities of phenology and fruit structure may contribute to the tendency of Bursera to be dispersed by relatively few species. The capsules of Bursera fruits do not open when the fruit ripens; birds apparently locate ripe fruit using visual cues, although these are few. In addition, only a small portion of the crop ripens daily over a 7- or 8-month period. The vireo-Bursera simaruba relationship, found regionally on the Yucatan Peninsula, may result from the prolonged fruit ripening period (October-March), the relatively depauperate frugivore community and the relatively high density of small Bursera trees in the hurricane-disturbed dry forests. Small trees at all times, and all trees from October to February, depend upon territorial vireos for continuous, highly efficient local dispersal of a small number of fruits. In March and April residual fruits ripen rapidly and synchronously, attracting a greater variety of visitors for broad spectrum dispersal during a period of food scarcity. Thus, Bursera has an unusual two-phase phenological pattern, perhaps alternately to take advantage of both specialized and opportunistic dispersers. © 1995, Cambridge University Press.

These are hauled from the pitcher fluid by the ants and consumed. When large prey items are absent, the ants feed upon mosquito larvae which inhabit the pitcher fluid. The accumulation of excess prey in pitchers can lead to putrefaction of the contents, and disruption of the pitcher’s digestive system. Experiments on the possible benefits of the ants’ behaviour to the plant showed that the accumulation of excess prey and the putrefaction of the pitcher contents were significantly reduced in the presence of the ants. The accumulation of ammonia in pitchers was unaffected by the presence of the ants when small prey were added to pitchers, but was reduced significantly in the presence of ants when large prey were added.

Bursera, Spondias and Swietenia seeds in early successional habitat suffered significantly greater predation than in either older abandoned (30 y) or mature forest plots. Erythrina showed generally low loss to predation in all plots. Seeds attacked were more often removed from, rather than buried or eaten at, the dispersal site. In young secondary habitats, however, seeds of Bursera and Spondias were more frequently eaten at the site. Seeds dispersed individually rather than in larger aggregations (5, 10) were more likely to survive in mature forest and late secondary habitat. This advantage was lost in Bursera and Swietenia when they were dispersed to younger successional habitats. At the early seedling stage, recruitment of Bursera and Swietenia was highest in the older secondary habitats.

The relationship of mast seed production to monodominance for the two tree species was evaluated by investigating: (1) the relationship between seed density and seed survival, (2) the relative impact of mammal versus insect seed predators in high and low seed density areas, and (3) post-germination survival in the understorey. For the latter, tagged seedlings were monitored over 10 years and both species were censused in different understorey size classes.

These patterns do not appear to be due to a direct effect of rainfall as high reproduction and growth were recorded during the late dry season (October-November), even though rainfall and the availability of fruits of shrubs were low during that period. It is likely that reinitiation of reproduction during the dry season is due to an increase in the availability of invertebrates and/ or wind-dispersed seeds. Fire at the end of the dry season appears to affect the diet of the rats, causing an increase in the ingestion of invertebrates during the following wet season.

These stands are commonly bordered by rainforests of greater floristic and structural complexity, also on ultramafic soils. In two lowland stands, the population size structures of Nothofagus aequilateralis stems greater than 50 cm high had an approximately skewed bell-shaped distribution with a modal size class of 15–25 cm stem diameter, and with no evidence of old trees. This indicates that the establishment of Nothofagus has occurred over a limited time span, without sufficient recent regeneration to allow the future replacement of the existing canopy trees. The factors initiating the major period of regeneration are not certain, but large-scale disturbance is implicated and evidence of past wild-fire on both sites is consistent with this hypothesis. It is unlikely that significant regeneration of Nothofagus will occur as the stands mature and canopy gaps are created by the death of old trees, since saplings of other species already occur at high densities in the understorey and will probably pre-empt the resources made available by canopy gaps. Two other study sites were situated above 900 m asl. At Dzumac, in an apparently older stand dominated by N codonandra, there is some evidence of recent regeneration, predominantly confined to a single large canopy gap. The population size structure of N. baumanniae on the fourth site, on the summit of Mt Mou, shows a closer approximation to a reverse-J curve. Seedlings, however, are relatively uncommon on this site, and the numerous saplings may be suppressed rather than young. Analyses of topsoil provided no consistent evidence to suggest that mineral content is controlling the distribution of Nothofagus across vegetation boundaries. The environmental factors promoting the formation of these monodominant canopies are uncertain, but appear to involve large-scale disturbance by windstorm or fire. The population size structures suggest that the canopies of the two lowland stands, at least, are likely to become more species-rich, with a progressive decline in the frequency of Nothofagus. Therefore, these lowland monodominant forests cannot be regarded as equilibrium communities, irrespective of whether more detailed studies reveal environmental differences across the community boundaries. The status of the two high altitude sites is less certain. © 1995, Cambridge University Press.
