In 1986, B. Klein compared the dung and carrion beetle assemblages of clearcuts, fragmented, and non-fragmented forests in central Amazonia, reporting drastic short-term changes in community composition. Fifteen years later, we resampled the same sites using identical techniques and found that, with the regrowth of secondary vegetation between forest fragments, the initial differences had largely disappeared. As the secondary vegetation itself supports dung beetle assemblages similar to those of continuous forest, we conclude that, from the perspective of the dung beetles, the experimentally fragmented area had returned to a continuous state within approximately one decade. These results offer some good news for the conservation of tropical ecosystems, since they suggest that conditions favorable for functionally important arthropods may be quickly restored by secondary regrowth. They also suggest that the preservation of forest fragments and secondary vegetation may provide an important complement to the conservation of intact mature forest. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",93,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Amazonas | Brazil | Dung beetle | Forest fragmentation | Matrix habitat | Rain forest | Recovery | Secondary vegetation,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA,NA,NA

We wished to know whether selection generated by pollinators acted directly or indirectly on floral rewards, on advertisement traits, and/or traits affecting pollinator efficiency (their fit with flowers) in Dalechampia vines (Euphorbiaceae) and whether the advertisement (bract size) was correlated honestly with reward amount (measured by resin-gland area). In Gabon we studied bee visitation and pollen arrival rates to blossoms of D. ipomoeifolia Benth. and found that, despite the apparent visibility of the resin reward (and its volume), the strongest bee-mediated natural selection acted directly on bract size rather than gland area. Blossoms with larger bracts were visited more often by the only pollinators, female Heriades nr. spiniscutis (Apoidea: Megachilidae), and these blossoms received more pollen on their stigmas. Blossoms with larger resin glands were also visited more often and received more pollen overall, but this effect disappeared when bract size (which was phenotypically correlated with gland size) was controlled for statistically. These observational data were confirmed by experimental reduction of bract size, which significantly decreased pollen arrival rates. Thus, the bees appear to rely on the ""honest"" correlation between advertisement and reward in choosing the best blossoms to visit, and this behavior generates direct selection for larger bracts and indirect selection for larger resin glands. Bees visiting blossoms with larger separation between the gland and stigmas contacted the stigmas less frequently, and such blossoms received less pollen on their stigmas. Because gland area, bract size, and gland-stigma separation are positively correlated phenotypically, response to selection for larger bracts may be limited in this population by conflicting selection against large gland-stigma separation. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",91,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Dalechampia ipomoeifolia | Evolution | Floral advertisement | Genetic correlation | Heriades | Honest signaling | Indirect selection | Phenotypic selection | Pollination,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,3,NA,NA,NA,NA

This research studied the uptake and turnover of amino acid N by soil microbes and the capacity of forest trees to take up the amino acid glycine in comparison to NH4+ and NO3-. This research was conducted in three temperate forests located in northwest Connecticut, USA. The three forests differed in soil parent material and canopy tree species composition. At all three sites, amino acids were released from soil organic matter through the activity of proteolytic enzymes resulting in a pool of free amino acids in soil. Free amino acids were rapidly immobilized by soil microbes. A 15N-enriched-glycine-addition experiment also showed that a significant fraction of the amino acid N taken up by soil microbes was mineralized to NH4+ with substantial nitrification at one site. Tree species from all three sites had the physiological capacity to absorb the amino acid glycine but took up amino acid N, NH4+, and NO3- in proportion to their availability in the soil. At the site with the highest gross fluxes of N, nearly all the N in amino acids was mineralized, and fine roots assimilated inorganic N much more rapidly than amino acid N. At the two sites with slower rates of gross amino acid production, the pool of free amino acids was larger, and fine roots assimilated amino acid N almost as fast as inorganic N.

Classical approaches to this problem rely upon a goodness criterion optimized through an iterative algorithm or utilize a simultaneous classification or ordination of species and sites. The new procedure introduced here does not strive for a single optimal rearrangement. Instead, it generates a series of probability distributions, the Boltzmann distributions, for a large set of solutions that include both the optimal and suboptimal solutions. The procedure is governed by a hypothetical parameter, T, called the ""temperature."" For the value of zero, only the best rearrangements (if there are many) have nonzero probabilities. As the value of this parameter increases, less optimal rearrangements become more frequent in the associated series of distributions. When T approaches infinity, the distribution becomes uniform over all the possible matrix rearrangements. We propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method which converges reasonably fast to this distribution for any value of T. This chain provides a sample of matrices that can be characterized via several statistics based on the Boltzmann distribution. The relevance of the method is demonstrated using ecological data. We illustrate how much extra information can be gained from suboptimal solutions that may have biological meaning not revealed by the best solution. Although the objective is to give a distribution of solutions rather than a single optimal solution, the new method can actually outperform heuristic searching algorithms in finding the best arrangement. We provide source code for the MCMC method in the C language, which can be compiled under many operating systems (Windows, Linux/Unix, Macintosh OS) and used in command line mode.

We investigated this phenomenon with two competing container-dwelling mosquitoes. We tested the hypothesis that habitat drying alters the outcome of interspecific competition, predicting that the competitive impact of Aedes albopictus on Aedes aegypti would be severe in wetter environments, but greatly reduced in drier environments. We tested these predictions in a laboratory experiment within cages, with aquatic larvae residing in water-filled cups within the cage, and adults emerging within the cage and ovipositing on the cups. We raised each species alone or with the competitor. Environmental treatments were fluctuating (water in cups evaporated to 50% of the original volume and then cups were refilled), and drying (water in cups evaporated completely and cups remained dry for two weeks before refilling). There was a significant interaction between treatment and species combination for adult populations of both species. Interspecific competition was highly asymmetrical. In the wetter fluctuating environment, interspecific competition had a large negative effect on A. aegypti, but in the drying environment, interspecific competition had a large negative effect on A. albopictus, and relatively little impact on A. aegypti. The main cause of the shift in competitive advantage appeared to be a greater increase in egg mortality for A. albopictus under dry conditions, compared to A. aegypti. Thus, mortality impinging on noncompeting life cycle stages can alter the population level impact of interspecific competition. The hypothesis that dry conditions shift competitive advantage away from A. albopictus is supported in this experiment. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",89,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Abiotic factors | Aedes aegypti | Aedes albopictus | Environmental tolerances | Invasive species,20308,R01AI044793,0,FALSE,7,all,All Open Access,NIAID,National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

Diversity might enhance stability if different species have different disturbance susceptibilities (i.e., functional complementarity). Alternatively, diversity might decrease stability because, at high diversity, populations are predicted to be more temporally variable and therefore more vulnerable to extinction following perturbation. There is theoretical support for both hypotheses but limited empirical evidence. I examine these issues with experimental burning along a natural diversity gradient in a savanna where fire has been suppressed for 150 years. I examined how two components of stability, resistance (invasion by added and naturally recruiting species) and resilience (recovery of the predisturbance light levels, the primary limiting resource in this system), varied with diversity. I also examined how the abundance of dominant species and soil depth affected stability, as both are negatively correlated with diversity and could have hidden impacts (e.g., invasion resistance on shallow soils correlated with diversity but caused by moisture stress). Species-rich communities were stable because they contained fire-tolerant species that, despite their rarity, significantly increased in cover after fire, reduced light availability, and limited seedling survival. Species-poor communities were rapidly invaded, apparently due to the combined effects of (1) trade-offs between competitive ability and disturbance tolerance (dominants in species-poor areas were competitive but fire sensitive), and (2) low functional complementarity. Colonization by woody plants was also significantly higher in low-diversity plots; these species are known to form a new stable state that excludes all savanna taxa. The abundance of dominants and soil depth were negatively correlated with diversity because they appear to determine its spatial variation in the absence of fire, but diversity alone accounted for variation in stability. Without burning, most subordinates are confined to shallower soils where they play a minor role in controlling resource flows and production. Diversity, therefore, was more important for buffering the effects of change than controlling ecosystem function under undisturbed conditions. If applicable to other systems, the results indicate that species loss will compound the negative effects of environmental change on ecosystem function by limiting the ability of ecosystems to respond. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,British Columbia | Fire | Invasion | Oak savanna | Plant diversity | Resilience | Resistance | Stability | Trade-offs,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,9,NA,NA,NA,NA

First, their period is fixed, with individuals emerging as adults precisely after either 13 or 17 years (depending on species). Second, even when there are multiple species of either 13- or 17-year cicadas at the same location, only one or rarely two broods (cohorts) co-occur, so that periodical cicada adults appear episodically. Third, the 13- or 17-year periods of cicadas suggest there is something important about prime numbers. Finally, single broods can dominate large areas, with geographical boundaries of broods remaining generally stable through time. While previous mathematical models have been used to investigate some of these puzzles individually, here we investigate them all simultaneously. Unlike previous models, we take an explicitly evolutionary approach. Although not enough information is known about periodical cicadas to draw firm conclusions, the theoretical arguments favor a combination of predator satiation and nymph competition as being key to the evolution of strictly fixed periods and occurrence of only one brood at most geographical locations. Despite ecological mechanisms that can select for strictly fixed periods, there seem to be no plausible ecological mechanisms that select for periods being prime numbers. This suggests that the explanation for prime-numbered periods, rather than just fixed periods, may reside in physiological or genetic mechanisms or constraints. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",23,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,Allee effects | Evolution of periodicity | Magicicada | Rock-paper-scissors competition | Spatial dynamics,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,10,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the Sonoran Desert, two common species of generalist ants compete for access to extrafloral nectaries on the fishhook barrel cactus Ferocactus wislizeni, but their relative abundances vary seasonally; one ant dominates more cacti in winter/spring, and the other in summer/autumn. Recently, a third ant species, which also varies in abundance seasonally, has appeared at our study sites and is competing with resident ants for access to cactus nectaries. This empirical system motivated us to examine a metapopulation model of competition for patches in an open system with periodic forcing. We use the model to: (1) illustrate three ways in which competing species may differ in their sensitivities to environmental conditions that are consistent with seasonally displaced patterns of abundance; (2) ask under what conditions the invasion of a third competitor into a two-species system could alter the sensitivity of the system to environmental forcing at low vs. high frequency; and (3) show how differences among competitors in the pattern of seasonal forcing alone can dramatically alter the outcome of a competitor invasion. We discuss implications of these results for the ways in which seasonal variation among competing mutualists, and the benefits and costs of mutualism, may affect the functioning of generalized, facultative mutualisms. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",25,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Ant-plant mutualism | Coherence number | Competition | Environmental forcing | Ferocactus wislizeni | Metapopulation | Resonance | Seasonality | Transfer function,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,17,NA,NA,NA,NA

We measured seasonal changes in rates of microbial Fe(III) reduction, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis in tidal freshwater and brackish marshes on the Patuxent River, Maryland, USA, and assessed the ability of plant roots to influence these processes by regenerating electron acceptors and supplying electron donors. In both marshes, the importance of microbial Fe(III) reduction was greatest early in the summer and decreased through the study period. Coincident with the seasonal decline in Fe(III) reduction, methanogenesis (freshwater marsh) or sulfate reduction (brackish site) increased in importance. At the brackish marsh, the partitioning of anaerobic carbon metabolism between Fe(III) reduction and sulfate reduction was similar within and below the root zone, suggesting that rhizosphere processes did not control anaerobic metabolism at this site. Instead, seasonal biogeochemical patterns at the brackish marsh were affected by factors such as water table depth and iron-sulfur interactions. At the tidal freshwater site, our results suggest that changes in rates of Fe(III) reduction and methanogenesis were directly affected by plant-mediated processes. In midsummer, Fe(III) reduction accounted for a greater fraction of total anaerobic metabolism in rhizosphere-influenced surface soils than in soils below the root zone. High rates of Fe(III) reduction occurred at the expense of methanogenesis. This study documented strong temporal variations in the outcome of microbial competition for electron donors that ultimately affected the balance between Fe(III) reduction and methanogenesis within tidal freshwater marsh soils.

We observed that rates of nest predation were not influenced by parental activity at nests and parents could successfully feed nestlings in enlarged broods. Although larger broods produced the most fledged juveniles, these individuals were less likely to survive to dispersal than were juveniles that fledged from smaller broods. Consequently, nest productivity did not vary with clutch size. Post-fledging mortality was not related to nestling mass two to three days prior to fledging. Rather, differences in the allocation of parental investment per juvenile among differently sized broods appeared to influence juvenile survival probability.

We hypothesized that spatially heterogeneous intensity in mouse foraging and/or limited moth dispersal might allow moth persistence. Using a spatially explicit, individual-based, empirically parameterized model, we show that neither spatially heterogeneous predation by mice, nor limited moth dispersal alone allows moth persistence at typical mouse densities. However, synergy between both factors allows moth population persistence at naturally occurring mouse densities. For example, in models with 40 mice/ha, both limited moth dispersal with spatially homogeneous predation risk and spatially heterogeneous predation risk with unlimited moth dispersal had a 0% chance of moth persistence, but the combination of limited dispersal and heterogeneous predation risk resulted in a ∼75% chance of moth persistence. Furthermore, both for limited moth dispersal with spatially homogeneous predation risk and for spatially heterogeneous predation risk with unlimited moth dispersal, moth persistence was only guaranteed at very low mouse densities, while the combination of limited moth dispersal with heterogeneous predation guaranteed moth persistence within a broad range of mouse densities.

It was concluded that this pattern is due to an optimization process acting in ecological communities. Here we construct minimum spanning trees using Monte Carlo simulations of a simple model that has two parameters that control the proportion of basal species and limit food-chain length, respectively. We show that when the food-chain length is of a similar size to that reported for real food webs, the universal scaling relations readily emerge in the model.

Infections were present in three out of 137 (2.18%) individuals; the pathogen was detected in two Rana catesbeiana and a single Rana sphenocephala, all collected between 1978 and 1981.

Analysis of population trajectories of nine amphibian species over 26 years at SRS showed that four species declined significantly over this period, including R. sphenocephala.

This pattern appears to be linked to a drying trend at SRS through the 1990s, although it is unclear whether this was caused by climate change. This study demonstrates that the presence of B. dendrobatidis in amphibian communities where some species are declining does not always implicate chytrids as a cause of the decline.

This reduction in native predators, competitors, and parasites may result in ecological release in the introduced range. However, biological interactions also can limit the establishment and spread of nonnative populations. The extent to which such biotic resistance occurs is poorly resolved, especially for marine ecosystems. Here we test whether a native predator, the blue crab Callinectes sapidus, affects the abundance and geographic range of the introduced European green crab Carcinus maenas in eastern North America. Both crab species occur in shallow, soft-sediment habitats of bays and estuaries, and their ranges overlap in eastern North America. First, we tested for a negative relationship in the abundances of the two species from trap samples across a 640-km (5.78° latitude) coastal transect. Second, we estimated variation in predation pressure on tethered Carcinus maenas across latitude and as a function of Callinectes sapidus abundance. Third, we measured predation rates on Carcinus maenas by Callinectes sapidus in field and laboratory experiments. Our results support the hypothesis that the native predator Callinectes sapidus provides biotic resistance to invasion and prevents the southward spread and establishment of Carcinus maenas. Within and across bays, Carcinus maenas were significantly less abundant at sites and depths with Callinectes sapidus compared with areas lacking Callinectes sapidus. Moreover, no Carcinus maenas were found in Chesapeake Bay, where Callinectes sapidus were most abundant. Predation of tethered Carcinus maenas increased with Callinectes sapidus abundance. In laboratory and field experiments, Callinectes sapidus preyed readily on Carcinus maenas.

We develop the concept of habitat-stage elasticity, EβS, which gives the proportional sensitivity of the stochastic growth rate to perturbations of stage transition rates in each state (β) of the habitat. We employ it to understand why a specialist gall-making seed predator has relatively low impact on the fitness of a subtropical shrub. The plant lives in a forest characterized by patchy, recurrent disturbances caused by hurricanes. Both predation rate and plant demography vary with canopy openness. In the most closed-canopy state, the seed predator destroys 90% of the fruits, and demographic quality, the dominant eigenvalue of that state's matrix, is low, while in the most open-canopy state, predation is negligible and demographic quality high. The seed predator is locally extirpated by strong hurricanes, recolonization taking several years. The effect of the predator on the stochastic growth rate is negligible at both low and high hurricane frequency. Its effect peaks (6%) at an intermediate hurricane frequency. The stochastic growth rate varies in its sensitivity to the predator in different states of the habitat due to a product of two factors: the frequency of the state in the environment and the contribution of fecundity to its elasticity. The latter factor encapsulates the expected sequence of future states of the habitat. In our system, the contribution of fecundity to elasticity of the darkest state increases with hurricane frequency, even though the probability of encountering that state decreases, because today's dark habitats are more likely to become lighter ones. The contribution of fecundity to the two lightest states does not vary with hurricane frequency. In contrast, its contribution in intermediate states at intermediate hurricane frequencies is most dynamic, since uncolonized states may become colonized states and insensitive states may become sensitive states.

We investigate a three-species Lotka-Volterra model of omnivory in which a predator and a prey share the same resource (i.e., intraguild predation). We demonstrate that intraguild predation sometimes destabilizes food webs and induces chaos, even if the functional responses are linear. The route to chaos is the familiar period-doubling cascade.

We tested this hypothesis by reconstructing historical sockeye salmon populations for the last 300 years in Bristol Bay, Alaska. Stable nitrogen isotope chronologies in lake sediments and sockeye catch and escapement histories show that commercial fisheries intercepted about two-thirds of MDN bound for freshwater spawning grounds since about 1900. Reconstruction of lake algal production using fossil pigments shows that this loss of MDN has reduced lake algal productivity to about one-third of its level before commercial fishing. However, contrary to expectation, recent sockeye population sizes (sum of spawning escapement and fishery catch) in the last century were equivalent to those before the advent of commercial fishing.

In this study, I use and modify a patch occupancy model to evaluate the effects of synchronous extinctions correlated with flooding and patch-size-dependent migration on the regional dynamics of a neotropical beetle, Cephaloleia fenestrata. Various methods have been used to evaluate patch occupancy models. Previous authors most commonly have evaluated patch occupancy models by logistic regression of incidence functions. Likelihoods produced from regression methods, however, neglect autocorrelation in spatial occupancy patterns even though spatial autocorrelation is common in ecological data. In this study, I used a Monte Carlo method of model evaluation, which accounts for spatial autocorrelation. Results suggest that patches undergo synchronous extinctions correlated with flooding and this affects regional dynamics of C. fenestrata. Immigration probability positively correlated with patch size, and emigration probability negatively correlated with patch size, also affecting C. fenestrata regional dynamics. The patch occupancy pattern was positively spatially autocorrelated at only two of the sites, but was nearly significant at another. The logistic regression method was a reasonable alternative to the Monte Carlo method for model evaluation. Other model evaluation methods (fits to model development data, proportion of occupied patches, and turnover rates) were inconsistent (at best) quantitative measures of a model's fit to independent data. When used to select among competing models, however, the fits to model development data were reasonably good indicators of fits to independent data.

Here, we provide such an analysis with the overall goal of quantifying the relative importance of inter- and intraspecific interaction strength in a primary, lowland dipterocarp forest located at Danum, Sabah, Malaysia. Using data on 10 abundant overstory dipterocarp species from two 4-ha permanent plots, we evaluated the effects of neighbors on the absolute growth rate of focal trees (from 1986 to 1996) over increasing neighborhood radii (from 1 to 20 m) with multiple regressions. Only trees 10 cm to <100 cm girth at breast height in 1986 were considered as focal trees. Among neighborhood models with one neighbor term, models including only conspecific larger trees performed best in five out of 10 species. Negative effects of conspecific larger neighbors were most apparent in large overstory species such as those of the genus Shorea. However, neighborhood models with separate terms and radii for heterospecific and conspecific neighbors accounted for more variability in absolute growth rates than did neighborhood models with one neighbor term. The conspecific term was significant for nine out of 10 species. Moreover, in five out of 10 species, trees without conspecific neighbors had significantly higher absolute growth rates than trees with conspecific neighbors. Averaged over the 10 species, trees without conspecific neighbors grew 32.4 cm2 in basal area from 1986 to 1996, whereas trees with conspecific neighbors only grew 14.7 cm2 in basal area, although there was no difference in initial basal area between trees in the two groups. Averaged across the six species of the genus Shorea, negative effects of conspecific larger trees were significantly stronger than for heterospecific larger neighbors. Thus, high local densities within neighborhoods of 20 m may lead to strong intraspecific negative and, hence, density-dependent, effects even in species-rich communities with low overall densities at larger spatial scales.

However, an unsolved problem concerns the inherent stochasticity involved in many animal search displacements and its possible adaptive value. When animals have no information about where targets (i.e., resource patches, mates, etc.) are located, different random search strategies may provide different chances to find them. Assuming random-walk models as a necessary tool to understand how animals face such environmental uncertainty, we analyze the statistical differences between two random-walk models commonly used to fit animal movement data, the Lévy walks and the correlated random walks, and we quantify their efficiencies (i.e., the number of targets found in relation to total displacement) within a random search context. Correlated random-walk properties (i.e., scale-finite correlations) may be interpreted as the by-product of locally scanning mechanisms. Lévy walks, instead, have fundamental properties (i.e., super-diffusivity and scale invariance) that allow a higher efficiency in random search scenarios. Specific biological mechanisms related to how animals punctuate their movement with sudden reorientations in a random search would be sufficient to sustain Lévy walk properties. Furthermore, we investigate a new model (the Lévy-modulated correlated random walk) that combines the properties of correlated and Lévy walks. This model shows that Lévy walk properties are robust to any behavioral mechanism providing short-range correlations in the walk. We propose that some animals may have evolved the ability of performing Lévy walks as adaptive strategies in order to face search uncertainties. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",444,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Correlated random walks | Foraging theory | Lévy walks | Random search strategies,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,42,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Breeding success showed the same contribution as adult survival for Emperor Penguins, whereas the proportion of breeders had the next stronger contribution for Snow Petrels. The sensitivity of population growth rate to adult survival was very high and the adult survival variability was weak for both species. Snow Petrel males survived better than females, whereas Emperor Penguin males had lower survival than females. These differences may be explained by the different investment in breeding. Emperor Penguin adult survival was negatively affected by air temperature during summer and winter for both sexes; male survival was negatively affected by sea ice concentration during summer, autumn, and winter. On the other hand, there was no effect of environmental covariates on Snow Petrel adult survival. The Emperor Penguin population has declined by 50% because of a decrease in adult survival related to a warming event during a regime shift in the late 1970s, whereas Snow Petrels showed their lowest numbers in 1976, but were able to skip reproduction. Indeed, the retrospective analysis of projection population matrix entries indicated that breeding abstention played a critical role in the population dynamics of Snow Petrels but not Emperor Penguins. Snow Petrels did not breed either when air temperature decreased during spring (probably reducing nest attendance and laying) or when sea ice decreased during autumn (reducing food availability). Emperor Penguin and Snow Petrel breeding population sizes were positively influenced by sea ice through its effect on adult survival for Emperor Penguins and on the proportion of breeders for Snow Petrels.

The invasion of Bromus also resulted in a decrease in richness and a species shift in plants, microarthropods, fungi, and nematodes.

We attributed the Hilaria response to differences in soil nutrients present before the invasion, especially soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as these nutrients were elevated in the soils that produced the greatest Hilaria biomass.

At Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, two main soil types derived from sandstone (ridges) and alluvium (valleys) differ in nutrient and water availability and are characterized by forests differing markedly in species composition, structure, and understory light availability. We use both survey and reciprocal transplants to examine physiological adaptations to differences in light, nutrient, and water availability between these soil types, and test for the importance of resource-use efficiency in determining edaphic specialization. Photosynthetic surveys for congeneric and confamilial pairs (one species per soil type) of edaphic specialists and for generalists common to both soil types show that species specializing on sandstone-derived soil had lower stomatal conductance at a given assimilation rate than those occurring on alluvial soil and also had greater instantaneous and integrated water-use efficiencies. Foliar dark respiration rates per unit photosynthesis were higher for sandstone ridge than alluvial lowland specialists. We suggest that these higher respiration rates are likely due to increases in photosynthetic enzyme concentrations to compensate for lower internal CO2 concentrations resulting from increased stomatal closure. This is supported by lower photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiencies in the sandstone ridge specialists. Generalist species had lower water-use efficiencies than sandstone ridge specialists when growing on the drier, sandy ridgetops, but their nitrogen-use efficiencies did not differ from the species specialized to the more resource-rich alluvial valleys. We varied light environment and soil nutrient availability in a reciprocal transplant experiment involving two specialist species from each soil type. Edaphic specialist species, when grown on the soil type for which they were not specialized, were not capable of acclimatory shifts to achieve similar resource-use efficiencies as species specialized to that soil type.

In this paper, I directly test the first hypothesis, and indirectly test the second via a modeling exercise. Employing shorter averaging times than used previously, it is shown that abscission in T. officinale is controlled by horizontal wind speed. Indeed, it is related to the square of the wind speed, as might be expected if drag is the motive force. I also show that this augmentation of wind speed by the abscission bias should sufficiently increase the shear-induced turbulence so that shear rivals convection as a source of updrafts in open habitats.

Both direct and indirect effects can have strong fitness impacts on the native species and can result in cascading effects throughout the invaded community. Many exotic plant species escape from the herbivores with which they co-evolved, but in our study system, the exotic Egyptian alfalfa weevil (Hypera brunneipennis) has been introduced to California and is able to feed both on the exotic plant Medicago polymorpha and on the California native Lotus wrangelianus. Because these two plant species share this common herbivore, the possibility of strong herbivore-mediated indirect interactions between these introduced and native plant species is plausible. We used observational studies and manipulative field experiments to determine whether exotic Medicago affects herbivory on the native Lotus and whether Medicago reduces the fitness of Lotus through direct competitive effects and/or herbivore-mediated indirect effects. Both observational and experimental data indicate that Medicago increases weevil herbivory on the native Lotus. Additionally, Medicago reduced Lotus fitness through direct as well as indirect mechanisms. In 2002, Medicago reduced Lotus fitness even when herbivores were experimentally reduced, suggesting direct competitive effects of Medicago on the native Lotus. In contrast, in 2003, Medicago reduced Lotus fitness only in the presence of herbivores, indicating that the fitness effects in that year were largely indirect and mediated by herbivores. Our results demonstrate that the net fitness consequences of indirect and direct effects of exotic plant species on native plants can vary temporally, depending on the abundance of members of the herbivore community.

A tractable experimental design to determine such effects and their interactions for demersal (seafloor oriented) fishes and similar sedentary species is cross-factoring multiple densities of new recruits with the presence and absence of predators. This design allows one to distinguish between density-dependent mortality due to competition alone, predation alone, or an interaction between the two, especially when supplemental field observations are available. To date, 14 species of marine fish have been examined with some variant of this design, and for 12 species predation was demonstrated to be the sole or major cause of density dependence. However, as competition may be slow acting relative to predation, the importance of competition can be underestimated in short-term experiments. On the Great Barrier Reef, we conducted a long-term field experiment in which multiple densities of new recruits of a planktivorous damselfish were cross-factored with the presence or absence of resident piscivorous fish on patch reefs. During the first 10 months, no density-dependent mortality was detected, regardless of whether resident predators were present or absent. By the end of the experiment at 17 months, per capita mortality was strongly density dependent and highly compensatory in both predator treatments; all reefs ultimately supported nearly the same adult density regardless of experimental treatment. Examination of treatment effect sizes suggested that competition was the main source of density-dependent mortality, with predation being merely a proximate agent of death. We hypothesize that predators were ineffective in this system compared with similar studies elsewhere because prey density was low relative to ample prey refuges provided by highly complex corals. Combined with previous studies, these findings indicate that density-dependent mortality in demersal marine fishes is often caused by interplay of predation and competition, whose roles may be altered by variation in habitat complexity and larval supply. These conclusions are relevant to marine fisheries models, which typically assume that density dependence is due solely to intraspecific competition. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",207,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Competition | Coral-reef fishes | Demersal marine fishes | Density dependence | Fisheries biology | Growth | Mortality | Predation | Prey refuges | Survivorship,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,50,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We investigated how baseline levels of the steroid hormones, corticosterone and testosterone, were associated with choice of colony size and the likelihood of moving to a different site in later years in colonially nesting Cliff Swallows (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota) in southwestern Nebraska, USA, in 2000-2004. We sampled hormone levels of birds caught at colonies and, using mark-recapture, monitored their movement and choice of colony size through subsequent years in the study area. Maximum likelihood estimation and multistate model fitting (with program MARK) revealed that birds with baseline corticosterone levels above the average for the colony and time of sampling were less likely to choose a colony of the same size or larger in a later year than were birds with corticosterone levels below the average. This result held for Cliff Swallows in both fumigated (parasite-free) sites and colonies naturally infested with ectoparasites. Relative baseline corticosterone level was unrelated to the likelihood of movement between different colony sites, and corticosterone level measured after birds were held for 60 minutes was unrelated to either colony-size choice or the probability of movement. Males whose testosterone levels were above the average for the colony and time of sampling were more likely to choose a colony of the same size or larger in a later year than were ones whose testosterone levels were below the average, but the opposite pattern was found for females. The results indicate that steroid hormone level is a predictor of whether a Cliff Swallow will settle in a relatively small or large colony, and support the hypothesis that variation in colony size reflects, in part, a distribution of birds with inherently different neuroendocrinological characteristics. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",19,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Cliff Swallow | Coloniality | Corticosterone | Dispersal | Habitat selection | Multistate mark-recapture | Petrochelidon pyrrhonota | Social behavior | Steroid hormone levels | Testosterone,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,51,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We found that the food uptake by Brachionus depended on the algal concentration with the relationship best described by a Holling type 3 functional response. We detected significant consumer effects on the functional response only at an extraordinarily high Brachionus density (∼125 rotifers/mL), which by far exceeds concentrations normally encountered in the field.

We investigated the combined effects of past disturbances, current vegetation, and topography on spatial variability of the severity of a fire that burned approximately 4500 ha of subalpine forest during the extreme drought of 2002 in northwestern Colorado. Ordinal logistic regression was used to spatially model fire severity in relation to late 1800s fires, a 1940s spruce beetle outbreak, forest cover type, stand structure, and topography. The late 1800s fires reduced the probability of burning in 2002, and the 1940s beetle outbreak slightly increased the probability of fire, particularly at high severity. Aspen (Populus tremuloides) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands, which established after the late 1800s fires, were less likely to burn, whereas Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii)-subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) stands were more likely to burn. The highest elevations (≥3100 m) had the lowest probability of burning, whereas intermediate elevations (2900-3100 m) had an increased probability of burning at high severity. The influences of the late 1800s fires and 1940s beetle outbreak on stand structure and forest cover type may be more important than their direct effects on fuels. The most important predictors determining fire severity were stand structure, forest cover type, the late 1800s fires, and elevation. Although, in other studies, the effects of pre-burn stand conditions and topography declined with increasingly severe fire weather, in the case of the 2002 fire in Colorado, these predictors explained 42% of the variability of fire severity.

Climate impacts forests through direct effects on tree demography (mortality and overstory recruitment) and indirect effects on disturbance regimes. Here, we compare multicentury chronologies of tree recruitment from a 307-ha ponderosa pine forest in southwestern Colorado to reconstructions of fire years, hydroclimate, and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Few trees predate a regional multiyear megadrought centered in the 1580s. A prolonged pluvial in the early 1600s resulted in a pulse of tree recruitment that corresponds to recruitment seen over much of the Southwest. Other cohorts in the early 1700s and mid-1800s established during multidecadal fire-quiescent periods. These periods correspond to shifts in ENSO that apparently resulted in dampening of interannual wet/dry oscillations responsible for fuel buildup and drying. Fires, mediated by stochastic climate variation, acted as a density-independent regulation on tree populations since establishment was not limited by overstory tree density, but rather by fire-caused mortality of seedlings and saplings during periods of more frequent fires. Even-aged cohorts in ponderosa pine forests likely have little if anything to do with episodic mortality caused by more severe fires, but rather relate mainly to episodic recruitment opportunities. Fire cessation after Euro-American settlement in the late 1800s resulted in an increase in tree density and changes in forest composition, which are major factors that have contributed to recent severe wildfires in other Southwestern forests.

In contrast to most terrestrial systems, aquatic plants ""compete"" with abiotic light absorbents. Light supply to pelagic producers and, consequently, algal carbon to nutrient stoichiometry are therefore affected by background turbidity (light absorption by non-algal components, Kbg) and mixing depth (vertical extension of the mixed water column, z). Still, light as a dynamic variable has been neglected in models exploring the ecological consequences of flexible algal stoichiometry. In addition, there are hardly any field experiments exploring effects of light supply on planktonic systems. We present a dynamical model that accounts for the simultaneous dependence of algal production on light supply and internal algal nutrient stores and derive predictions on how a suite of state variables (algal biomass, light climate, algal nutrient stoichiometry, dissolved nutrient concentration, and nutrients in sediment) should be affected by z and K bg. We compare these predictions with results of an enclosure experiment in a phosphorus-deficient lake, in which we manipulated z and K bg. Algal biomass decreased at higher Kbg and showed a unimodal response to z (being limited by sinking losses at shallow z and by fight at deep z). The biomass peak shifted toward lower z with increased K bg. The seston carbon:phosphorus ratio decreased with increasing z and Kbg. Dissolved mineral phosphorus was undetectable in all treatments. Total water column phosphorus and sedimented phosphorus increased with increasing z but were unaffected by Kbg. These data are in almost complete qualitative congruence with model predictions over the examined range of mixing depths (1-15 m).

One of the most prominent, the Enemy Release Hypothesis, posits that invading species benefit compared to their native counterparts if they lose their herbivores and pathogens during the invasion process. We previously reported on a common garden experiment (from 2002) in which we compared levels of herbivory between 30 taxonomically paired native and introduced old-field plants. In this phylogenetically controlled comparison, herbivore damage tended to be higher on introduced than on native plants. This striking pattern, the opposite of current theory, prompted us to further investigate herbivory and several other interspecific interactions in a series of linked experiments with the same set of species. Here we show that, in these new experiments, introduced plants, on average, received less insect herbivory and were subject to half the negative soil microbial feedback compared to natives; attack by fungal and viral pathogens also tended to be reduced on introduced plants compared to natives. Although plant traits (foliar C:N, toughness, and water content) suggested that introduced species should be less resistant to generalist consumers, they were not consistently more heavily attacked. Finally, we used meta-analysis to combine data from this study with results from our previous work to show that escape generally was inconsistent among guilds of enemies: there were few instances in which escape from multiple guilds occurred for a taxonomic pair, and more cases in which the patterns of escape from different enemies canceled out. Our examination of multiple interspecific interactions demonstrates that escape from one guild of enemies does not necessarily imply escape from other guilds. Because the effects of each guild are likely to vary through space and time, the net effect of all enemies is also likely to be variable. The net effect of these interactions may create ""invasion opportunity windows"": times when introduced species make advances in native communities. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",307,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Biotic resistance hypothesis | Congeneric pairs | Darwin's naturalization hypothesis | Enemy escape | Herbivory | Insect diversity | Invasion biology | Phylogenetic approaches to community ecology | Plant-insect interactions | Plant-virus interactions,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,65,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

A high percentage of seeds of four out of five species buried in the field remained viable for two years, while the fifth, Carrichtera annua, showed a sharp decline in seed viability, reaching nearly zero survivorship. Our results indicate that, in this system, annual plant communities result from germination of a fraction of seeds present in the soil seed bank, when autumn or winter rainfalls occur.

Previous studies by M. E. Hay, J. E. Duffy, and others have shown that mesograzers can acquire enemy-free space by inhabiting and consuming seaweeds that are chemically defended against larger, more-mobile consumers. However, their studies, carried out in North Carolina and two tropical regions, consider only a small number of mesograzer species and focus primarily on fishes, even though some other large consumers can destroy mesograzers' host seaweeds. We asked whether the previous findings could be generalized to (1) mesograzers at the community level, (2) large consumers other than fishes, and (3) a different ecosystem in another region, namely, diverse temperate rocky reef communities in Australia and New Zealand. Results from both Australasian regions were similar. In multiple-choice feeding assays larger grazers (three fishes, four gastropods, and three sea urchins) varied in breadth of preferences, but most often preferred to eat green algae of the family Ulvales and the red alga Pterocladiella capillacea, all of which were restricted to the intertidal zone. Most of the mesograzers surveyed (seven amphipods, three isopods, a gastropod, and a sea urchin) preferred to eat the seaweed species from which they were collected, many of which were either inaccessible or less palatable to many larger grazers. This difference in mesograzer vs. larger grazer feeding preferences was consistent with the findings of Hay and Duffy et al. However, community-level patterns of mesograzer distribution and abundance were not consistent with the extensions of the theory developed here. Seaweeds that were less palatable to the larger grazers did not tend to support more mesograzer individuals, mesograzer species, or specialist mesograzers (for either the entire mesograzer assemblage or just for sedentary mesograzers), but the evenness of entire mesograzer assemblages was significantly higher on seaweeds that were less palatable to larger grazers. We argue that spatial refuges on Australasian rocky reefs and differences in the biology of both the seaweed and animal species in Australasia vs. previously studied locations enable palatable seaweeds to persist in the face of herbivory by larger grazers, which reduces the selective pressure on mesograzers to inhabit unpalatable species. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",45,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Algae | Amphipod | Chemical defense | Echinoid | Fish | Gastropod | Grazing | Herbivory | Isopod | Mesograzer | Plant-herbivore theory | Spatial refuge,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,67,NA,NA,NA,NA

Two of the most important are the critical and frequently difficult tasks of distinguishing a priori between habitat and nonhabitat, and then delimiting suitable habitat patches in a study area. We combined classification tree analysis, a subset of classification and regression tree (CART) modeling, with digital data layers of environmental variables in a geographic information system (GIS) to predict suitable habitat and potential new population occurrences for turkeybeard (Xerophyllum asphodeloides), a rare liliaceous understory herb associated with southern Appalachian pine-oak (Pinus-Quercus) forests, in northwestern Virginia. Sample values from eight environmental data layers and population survey data were used in the modeling process to produce a cross-validated classification tree that predicted suitable habitat in the study area. Elevation, slope, forest type, and fire frequency were the four main explanatory variables in the model. Approximately 4% of the study area was classified into five suitable habitat classes, with a misclassification error rate of 4.74%. The final 13-leaf tree correctly classified 74% of the known presence areas and 90% of the known absence areas, and ground-truthing surveys resulted in the discovery of eight new occupied habitat patches. Results of this study are important for conservation and management of X. asphodeloides, as well as for the applicability of the habitat modeling techniques to enhancing the study of metapopulations and disturbance regimes in Appalachian forests. In addition, they confirm the potential and value of CART and GIS-based modeling approaches to species distribution problems. Our model was successful at defining suitable habitat and discovering new populations of a rare species at the landscape scale.

However, very little information is available about the environmental factors and individual factors that affect the foraging success of marine predators. We studied the distribution of prey encounters, foraging success, and efficiency in different water masses and during two stages of the breeding season when energy requirements differed in Wandering Albatrosses (Diomedea exulans) of known experience and sex. The birds were simultaneously fitted with satellite transmitters, stomach temperature sensors, and activity recorders. Only 27% of prey were captured in patches (distance between two prey < 1 km); the rest were caught at an average distance of 64 km. Prey in patches were smaller than isolated prey and were caught mainly at night. Diet analysis indicated that albatrosses preyed mainly upon adult squid: squid taken at night were smaller (bioluminescent species), whereas those taken during the day were larger (nonbioluminescent species). Birds spent more time foraging farther from the colony during incubation than during brooding, when their energy requirement was highest, but foraging effort (landings per hour, or kilometers per hour), foraging success (grams of prey per hour), and efficiency (grams of prey per landing per hour) were similar during the two stages. The rate of prey encounter and foraging efficiency did not differ between water masses or between oceanic and shelf-slope waters. We found no differences between the sexes in terms of foraging success and efficiency. Young, inexperienced individuals had foraging success and efficiency similar to those of older, experienced birds but had a different strategy: they foraged more actively and caught more prey at night than did experienced birds. These results suggest strongly that Wandering Albatrosses rely on prey that are highly dispersed, catch few prey within the same patch, and do not adjust foraging effort according to energy requirements. The unpredictability of the location of prey and the type of prey caught by Wandering Albatrosses indicate that the species has a unique foraging strategy compared to most seabirds, which generally concentrate in more predictable foraging areas. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",125,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Age- and sex-specific foraging | Bioluminescence | Central-place foraging | Crozet Islands | Diomedea exulans | Experience | Foraging success | Indian Ocean | Prey patchiness | Squid | Telemetry | Wandering Albatross,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,70,NA,NA,NA,NA

We focus here on the contribution of nutrient enrichment to the overgrazing of macrophyte-dominated systems, which has often been linked to predator and competition release of urchins due to overfishing. However, the contribution of nutrient loading to the progression and persistence of this phenomenon should also be considered. In an effort to understand the contribution of nutrient loading to the overgrazing phenomenon and associated simplified community in a Caribbean seagrass bed, a detailed isotopic (δ13C, δ15N) assessment of the food web structure was conducted at both a nutrient-enriched and a control site. The general pattern at the enriched site indicated significantly lighter δ13C signatures (i.e., phytoplankton influenced) for non-generalist primary consumers (i.e., specialist grazers, subsurface deposit feeders) and for the sediment organic material (SOM) when compared to the control site. The contribution of phytoplankton and associated particulate organic material to the SOM was also different, 7% vs. 44% at the enriched and control site, respectively. The loss of the autochthonous seagrass detritus pool, in the wake of high densities of generalist urchins (>66 000 individuals/ha) and low overall consumer diversity, appears to have been partially replaced by opportunistic ""alternatives,"" epiphytes but mainly phytoplankton, that benefit directly from elevated input of anthropogenic, allochthonous nutrients. The availability of such alternative, allochthonous resources to generalist urchins could potentially allow for the persistence of simplified seagrass communities. Here, elevated densities of urchins enable a persistent suppression of autochthonous benthic-macrophyte production through grazing and the consumption of newly recruited competitors and predators. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",73,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Allochthonous nutrients | Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment | Autochthonous detritus | Benthic macrophytes | Caribbean seagrass bed | Diversity | Macro-invertebrate grazers | Overgrazing | Phytoplankton | Sea urchins | Seagrass detritus | Stable isotopes,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,71,NA,NA,NA,NA

The two species of preferred algae were found to have a higher starch and lower protein content than the non-dietary G. chilensis. The fish regulated their intake and utilization of the algae such that similar amounts of protein were ingested and assimilated from all three species, but less starch was ingested and assimilated from the non-dietary G. chilensis than from the preferred species. Gut throughput times correlated positively with starch availability in the algae but were lower for all treatments than previous studies would suggest are associated with fermentative digestion.

In the northern Patagonian landscape of forests and shrublands we examined the effects of vegetation type (tall forest vs. tall shrubland) and abiotic factors (elevation, topography, and precipitation) on fire occurrence at a broad scale and on fire spread at a fine scale. We used satellite images (1985-1999) and aerial photography (1950-1999) to map fires in relation to pre-burn vegetation type and abiotic factors. Fire extent is greatest at intermediate elevations and locations of intermediate precipitation. Fire extent is limited by lack of fuel quantity at the lower end of the precipitation gradient and by infrequent or insufficient fuel desiccation at the upper end. Tall shrublands are proportionally more affected by fire than are adjacent mesic forests of Nothofagus dombeyi and N. pumilio. Patches of subalpine forests often tend to serve as natural fire breaks, except under the most severe fire weather. Tall shrublands are dominated by species that resprout vigorously so that fuels quickly recover. In contrast, forests are dominated by species dependent on seed reproduction that sometimes fails after severe fires so that shrublands tend to replace burned forests. The greater propensity of shrublands to burn is a positive feedback that is favorable to fire and that accelerates the replacement of forest by shrublands. Infrequently occurring severe weather is important in the burning of otherwise relatively fire-resistant subalpine forests. Past burning, associated both with drought and early forest clearing, expanded shrublands at the expense of forests so that in the modern landscape an increase in anthropogenic ignitions and the positive feedback of fire and shrublands are synergistically accelerating conversion from forest to shrubland. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",176,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Fire ecology | Landscape ecology | Logistic regression model | Nothofagus | Patagonia | Shrub resprouting | Spatial analysis,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,74,NA,NA,NA,NA

If these predators also consume native species, then the invader's indirect effect via predators (i.e., apparent competition) could be more harmful to natives than the effect of resource competition from the exotic. We apply general community ecology theory to determine the conditions under which the net effect of predation on the exotic species is to extirpate the native competitor.

We compared herbivory and defenses of young leaves for I. goldmanii, a more derived species that follows a ""defense"" strategy, and I. umbellifera, a more basal species that follows an ""escape"" strategy. The two species suffered similar rates of herbivory (22% of the leaf area eaten during expansion) but were attacked by different communities of herbivores. I. goldmanii relied heavily on extra-floral nectaries and on a diversity of effective secondary metabolites, while I. umbellifera minimized damage through rapid leaf expansion and synchronous flushing. The major classes of secondary compounds in both species were flavanoids and non-protein amino acids; however, there were large differences in structure, biosynthetic pathways, and efficacy against herbivores. Growth rates of lepidopteran larvae were significantly lower when fed artificial diets with crude extracts from I. goldmanii as compared to I. umbellifera. Flavanoids accounted for the majority of growth reduction in both species. I. umbellifera had more unusual flavanoids and a non-protein amino acid not reported from plants, but the more common flavanoids found in I. goldmanii were more bioactive against herbivores. I. goldmanii also had greater ant visitation to extrafloral nectaries, suggesting that there was no trade-off between biotic and chemical defenses. In contrast, young leaves of I. umbellifera expanded more rapidly, minimizing the window of vulnerability before toughening. Resources for rapid expansion may have been reallocated from chloroplast development as I. umbellifera delayed the greening process until after full leaf expansion. Leaves were also produced synchronously, which can satiate herbivores and reduce damage. These defense differences, are reflected in almost completely nonoverlapping herbivore faunas and the more frequent occurrence of generalists on I. umbellifera. To understand why defenses have evolved, it is important to view them in light of the herbivore community as well as in the context of the other co-occurring traits.

The goal of this study was to quantify the population dynamics of the invasive, subtropical shrub, Ardisia elliptica (Myrsinaceae), growing in a disturbed area of Everglades National Park, Florida, USA. We used bootstrap sampling and randomization tests to test hypotheses about spatial and temporal variation in population dynamics. Five populations spanning a range of habitats were studied for three years. Significant spatial and temporal variation in fruit production, relative growth, fates of vegetative individuals, and population growth rates were detected; however, spatial variation among populations had an overall stronger effect than temporal variation. Population growth rates were greater than 1 or not different from 1, implying that populations are on average increasing in size. Similar to most other shrubs, prospective analysis showed that stasis of large stage classes had the highest elasticities. However, a retrospective analysis indicated that it was variation in growth to larger stage classes that contributed the most to observed variation in population growth rates.

However, these studies are just beginning to be extended to the genotype level and to our knowledge have not incorporated the effects of herbivory or genotype-by-herbivore interactions. With a two-year field study, using genotypes that differed by as few as three restriction length polymorphism (RFLP) molecular markers, we found three major patterns when we mixed leaf litters from different genotypes both with and without previous herbivory. First, leaf litter genotype mixtures, regardless of herbivory, demonstrated nonadditive rates of decomposition and nutrient flux. Second, mixed genotype litter without herbivory decomposed faster than the same genotypes with herbivory. Third, in genotype mixtures, with and without herbivory, we found that net rates of immobilization of both nitrogen and phosphorus can differ from expected values (based on genotype means) by as much as 57%. These results show that mixing litter genotypes can alter rates of decay and nutrient flux and that the effects are reduced with herbivory. Nonadditive effects at the genotype level that we report here are nearly as large as what has been recorded for plant species mixtures and may have important, though under-appreciated, roles in ecosystems.

Studies of N dynamics typically focus on aboveground litter production, but in semiarid ecosystems, fine-root production greatly exceeds shoot production. We explored the contribution of root and shoot litter to N cycling in adjacent grassland and aspen (Populus tremuloides) forest at the northern edge of the Great Plains. We used a new approach to measure N inputs from root litter production: we combined root productivity data from minirhizotron images with N content data from several root diameter and color classes. We also measured the production and N content of aboveground litter. The novel contribution of our study comes from the simultaneous measurements of above- and belowground productivity and N input from litter production in adjacent forest and grassland habitats. Aboveground litter production was threefold greater in forest than in grassland (330 vs. 136 g·m-2·yr-1), but fine roots accounted for 80-90% of total litter production. As a result, total production was not significantly different between habitats, and the N contribution from total litter production was surprisingly similar between grassland (16.8 g·m-2·yr-1) and forest (17.1 g·m -2·yr-1). Thus in spite of great differences between habitats in aboveground litter production, N inputs from total litter production cannot explain the higher availability of N in forest soils. However, we found differences between habitats in root litter quality (forest, 1.14% N; grassland, 0.81% N, as well as in the seasonal and vertical distribution of root production. Grassland root production was significantly greater than forest root production in early summer in the top 20 cm of soil.

Previously, we investigated how hummock formation by Triglochin maritimum in physically stressful salt marsh pannes influences the plant community that grows only on hummock tops and found that species diversity was dependent on indirect positive effects of T. maritimum engineering. Here we examined how Carex stricta, the tussock sedge, drives superficially similar spatial patterning of plants in relatively benign tidal freshwater marshes at the opposite extreme of an estuarine salinity gradient. In C. stricta marshes, the entire vegetative community is located almost exclusively on top of tussocks while inter-tussock spaces are bare mud buried in C. stricta wrack. We manipulated tussock height, belowground substrate, and aboveground competition for light to investigate the mechanisms by which C. stricta influences the wetland plant community. We also conducted wrack-removal experiments and phytometer assays to examine the importance of wrack deposition in this community and to investigate the spatial distribution of herbivore pressure, respectively. Transplants of four common species performed well in all treatments, except natural inter-tussock spaces buried in wrack. Removal of wrack from inter-tussock spaces enabled substantial seedling emergence and vegetative cover within one growing season. C. stricta therefore drives plant distribution primarily through indirect negative impacts of wrack accumulation in inter-tussock spaces. Once tussocks are established, plants obtain a secondary benefit when growing on tussocks, as the inter-tussock spaces become runways for small mammalian herbivores that concentrate feeding in low protected areas. These results differ dramatically from nearby salt marshes where T. maritimum facilitates community diversity by alleviating physical stresses. The mechanisms and outcomes of hummock-forming engineers may thus vary predictably across estuarine salinity gradients where hummock formation has facilitative and important impacts in physically stressful environments, but negative and less essential impacts in physically benign environments. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",70,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Abiotic gradients | Carex stricta | Coastal marshes | Ecosystem engineer | Salinity gradient | Tidal freshwater marsh,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,81,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper explores the scale-dependent effects of recent perturbations on the biotic variability of lagoonal reefs in Panama and Belize. We used new and previously published core data to compare temporal patterns of species dominance between depth zones and between geographic locations. After millennia of monotypic dominance, depth zonation emerged for different reasons in the two reef systems, increasing the between-habitat component of beta diversity in both taxonomic and functional terms. The increase in between-habitat diversity caused a decline in geographic-scale variability as the two systems converged on a single, historically novel pattern of depth zonation. Twenty-four reef cores were extracted at water depths above 2 m in Bahía Almirante, a coastal lagoon in northwestern Panama. The cores showed that finger corals of the genus Porites dominated for the last 2000-3000 yr. Porites remained dominant as the shallowest portions of the reefs grew to within 0.25 m of present sea level. At intermediate depths of 5-10 m, however, declining water quality in the Bahía enabled the lettuce coral Agaricia tenuifolia to replace Porites during the last several decades. In Belize, the staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis dominated the rhomboid shoals of the central shelf lagoon for millennia. As the shallowest portions of the rhomboid shoals approached sea level around 500 years ago, Porites spp. replaced Ac. cervicornis in an intrinsically driven successional sequence. At intermediate depths, white-band disease killed Ac. cervicornis in the late 1980s, precipitating a transition to dominance by Ag. tenuifolia. Phase shifts between coral taxa and the emergence of coral zonation in both locations were mediated by the sea urchin Echinometra viridis, which controlled algal growth.

Here, we focused on tolerance against cyanobacterial toxins and asked whether this tolerance was an induced defense developed during Daphnia's lifetime, whether it was a trait that is constantly expressed, and whether such tolerance to the toxin can be transferred to the next generation through maternal effects. These questions were addressed by feeding a single clone of Daphnia magna a diet with and without algal toxin and recording changes in fitness (as intrinsic rate of population increase). Analysis of F1, F2, and F3 generations revealed that the increased tolerance to toxic Microcystis was an inducible defense developed during an individual's lifetime, and that this trait could be transferred from mother to offspring. This maternal effect was expressed in several fitness parameters, including shorter time to maturity and first reproduction, and higher numbers of offspring compared to inexperienced individuals.

The two estuaries, Barataria Basin and Breton Sound, have been isolated from the Mississippi River at their upstream ends for most of the last century due to levee construction, but for the last 13 years, Breton Sound has been reconnected to the Mississippi River via a gated diversion at Caernarvon, Louisiana. Thus, Barataria Basin was the reference estuary and Breton Sound was the river-impacted estuary. We focused on POM because it was relatively easy to collect and analyze, and because POM dynamics gave a good ecosystem-level overview of phytoplankton responses to riverine nutrient forcing and hydrologic forcing. A combination of C:N and PO13C analyses indicated that most POM was phytoplankton with smaller contributions of sediment. Estuarine concentrations of particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON) were typically higher than end-member freshwater or marine inputs, indicating the importance of within-system phytoplankton growth likely fueled by rapid nutrient regeneration in these warm, shallow and well-mixed estuarine systems. Isotopic analyses generally showed typical estuarine gradients in the reference Barataria Basin estuary, but the river-influenced upper Breton Sound had elevated PO13C and PO15N values useful for following the spatial extent of river impacts. Rapid river-assisted flushing in Breton Sound probably prevented widespread development of algal blooms in response to introductions of the nutrient-rich river water, but study of some isolated lakes suggested that when longer residence times apply, introduction of river water to coastal estuaries can lead to eutrophic conditions and in some cases, harmful algal blooms.

Although, size can be an important variable in determining demographic parameters such as survivorship, growth, and reproduction, other factors such as genetic variation and access to resources can play key roles. We determined that size was not the only state variable that explained the survivorship, reproduction and future growth of the annual kelp, Alaria nana. A. nana shows persistent differences among individuals in growth (growth autocorrelation) that could be characterized with a negative residual (relatively poor growth) or positive residual (relatively good growth) from the relationship between size and growth. In two separate years of demographic study, we show that, during good growth conditions, growth autocorrelation is relatively strong, while poorer growth conditions associated with the 1997 El Niño event resulted in less consistency among individuals in growth state. To quantitatively describe this population, we used a size based matrix model with an added state to reflect previous growth status. We show that a matrix projection model with growth state better captures the size structure of a natural population of A. nana and the fate of individuals than one that uses only size. Without growth state, a size-based model underestimates the number of individuals that get large and thus the potential growth rate of the population. When we used our model to approximate among-generations pattern, and included a loop analysis algorithm, we found that fast growth to the largest size class contributed greatly to population growth in the relatively good year but that there were not such obvious benefits to getting large in the El Niño year.

The important role of omnivores is implicated by the paradoxical results of a food-supplementation experiment. The experiment was designed to test theories that predict how habitat change affects the distribution of habitat-selecting species. According to theories of habitat selection, a quantitative change in habitat (as caused by supplemental food) should increase consumer population size and alter habitat selectivity. Related theories of patch use predict that consumers should increase their use of enriched patches. A two-year experiment on two species of small mammals in Canada's boreal forest failed to alter population densities of red-backed voles, but did cause a dramatic shift in vole habitat use. Rather than increasing their use of feeding stations as predicted by classical theory, voles avoided them. Deer mice did not respond to the experimental treatments. The paradoxical results occurred because omnivorous black bears altered prey behavior by increasing predation risk at feeding stations. Revised theory confirms the indirect omnivore effect, and demonstrates that the behavioral paradox is far more likely for omnivores than for other types of predators.

Here I report a series of investigations that comprehensively evaluate the influence of conspecific density on key traits (survival, growth, and reproduction) in the intertidal barnacle Balanus glandula. Density was manipulated in mid-intertidal barnacle populations living on both natural rock surfaces and on settlement plates, and monitored in natural populations. Survival was positively related to density: populations at the lowest density level were 19 times more likely to experience ≥95% mortality than those at the highest level. In contrast, growth and individual reproductive output were negatively related to density: animals at lower experimental densities (16-50 adult barnacles/100 cm2) grew to 1.6 times the diameter of individuals living at higher densities (200-460 adult barnacles/100 cm2), and larger barnacles produced larger brood masses than smaller individuals. Overall, the frequency of brooding barnacles in experimental and natural populations was greatest at intermediate densities. Estimation of the basic reproductive rate for the experimental animals on the settlement plates indicated that the primary effect of increased conspecific density was enhanced survival, and consequently, a larger mean number of larvae produced per original recruit. Thus in this case, the positive intraspecific effects of high-density aggregations outweighed the negative effects.

Three kinds of dynamic models were used to estimate allochthony: a process-rich, dual-isotope flow model based on mass balances of two carbon isotopes in 12 carbon pools; simple univariate time-series models driven by observed time courses of δ13CO2; and multivariate autoregression models that combined information from time series of δ13C in several interacting carbon pools. All three models gave similar estimates of allochthony.

Because the photosynthetic costs associated with this habit are elevated, the selective advantages of carnivory should vary depending on the balance between light, moisture, and nutrient (prey) availability. Here we test whether the patterns of selection operating on the carnivorous habit of Pinguicula moranensis change among four populations located along an environmental gradient for soil nitrogen and prey availability, photosynthetically active radiation, and moisture, and whether or not these changes are in accordance with adaptive expectations. We characterized the phenotypic variation in two carnivory-related attributes (the densities of capture and digestive glands) and their relationship with the efficiency and the fitness benefit of prey capture along the environmental gradient.

Oviposition by field-caught keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii, Colubridae) in tropical Australia yielded data on clutches from 318 adult females (3151 eggs) over three years, and mark-recapture studies (1804 nights surveyed) quantified survival rates of neonates from those laboratory-incubated clutches.

Overall, the rate of water uptake by a female's eggs was more important for her reproductive success (number of surviving progeny) than were variables such as mean egg mass. Hence, this population experiences intense selection not only on ""conventional"" life-history traits such as egg size and number, but also on maternal nest-site choice and on the physiological mechanisms that control water exchange between the egg and the nest substrate. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",35,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Australia | Colubrid snake | Fitness | Incubation | Keelback snake | Life history | Offspring size | Phenotype | Reproductive success | Reptile | Selection | Tropidonophis mairii,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,91,NA,NA,NA,NA

We compared patterns of seed rain of nine species of trees disseminated by large birds, monkeys, and wind in a closed canopy forest in Cameroon. We used maximum-likelihood methods to fit seed rain data to four dispersal functions: inverse power, negative exponential, Gaussian, and Student t. We then tested for differences in dispersal characteristics (1) among individuals within species, and (2) among species dispersed by the same vector. In general, an inverse power function best described animal-dispersed species and the Gaussian and Student t functions best described wind-dispersed species. Animal-dispersed species had longer mean dispersal distances than wind-dispersed species, but lower fecundities. In addition to these distinct differences in average dispersal distance and functional form of the seed shadow between animal- and wind-dispersed species, seed shadows varied markedly within species and vector, with conspecifics and species within vector varying in their dispersal scale, fecundity, and clumping parameters. Dispersal vectors determine a significant amount of variation in seed distribution, but much variation remains to be explained. Finally, we demonstrate that most seeds, regardless of vector, fall directly under the parent canopy.

In contrast, nearly all individuals experience the chronic effects of predation risk. When threatened by predators, prey adopt defensive tactics whose costs can lead to reduced growth, maturation rates, survivorship, fecundity, or population density. This nonconsumptive impact of predation risk on prey is known as a ""trait-mediated interaction"" (TMI) because it results from changes in prey traits such as behavior or physiology. Ecological theory suggests that the strength of TMI effects will reflect a balance between the conflicting demands of reproduction vs. predator avoidance. Competitor density and resource availability are expected to alter the balance between these conflicting forces. We conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured TMI effect size while varying competitor and/or resource density. The threat of predation had an overall negative effect on prey performance, but the strength of this effect varied with the level of competition. High competition exacerbated the negative effect of intimidation on prey density but moderated the negative effect of intimidation on prey life history and growth.

Given the existence of distinct open niches and the relaxation of interspecific competition, niche theory suggests two possible mechanisms: resource competition between conspecifics and trade-offs in resource use efficiency. We investigated the importance of these explanations in a foraging polymorphism recently developed by Zenaida Doves (Zenaida aurita) on the West Indian island of Barbados. In this polymorphism, individuals either aggressively defend feeding territories from conspecifics or feed in large unaggressive groups with conspecifics. Combining field observations and a cage experiment, we found no evidence that the polymorphism is primarily driven by age- or sex-related differences, or that it results from morphological feeding specializations or dietary preferences. Instead, our results support the hypothesis that individual specializations arise from contest competition. In the study area, competition for territories was intense, with very little undefended space left between territories and owners frequently involved in territorial contests. Replacement of territory holders from year to year was low compared to the number of potential recruits, implying that many doves were incapable of securing a territory. Approximately half the doves at territorial sites did not hold a territory but wandered between them as floaters. Compared with territory holders, floaters were smaller and had shorter wings, traits that in this species mediate territory defense. Yet floaters did not differ from group feeding doves on these morphological traits. This suggests that group feeders are floaters that shift to an alternative resource. The new resource appears to be suboptimal, as indicated by the fact that group feeders were in worse body condition than doves from the territorial sites. Taken together, our results suggest that the resource polymorphism in Zenaida Doves is primarily driven by competition for territories, which forces less competitive individuals to use alternative, subobtimal resources. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Competition | Ecomorphology | Foraging specialization | Social learning,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,96,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we tracked the seasonal movements of 35 nonbreeding Black-browed Albatrosses Thalassarche melanophrys from South Georgia, including 24 birds followed in two consecutive years. This revealed consistent patterns of status-related, sex-specific, and individual variation in wintering strategies, and provided the first description of the summer distribution of failed/deferring breeders. Individuals exhibited a striking degree of site fidelity, returning to the same region (southwest Africa or Australia) and showing correlated centers of distribution, as well as remarkable consistency in the chronology of their movements, in consecutive years. Nonetheless, a degree of behavioral flexibility remained, and particularly on the return migration, birds moved between, or bypassed, alternative intermediate staging sites depending on local circumstances. Initiation of the outward migration varied according to breeding status, timing of failure, and sex: deferring breeders and those that failed early departed two months before successful birds, and successful females departed 1-2 weeks earlier than males. Sex-related latitudinal variation in distribution was also apparent, with females wintering farther north within the Benguela system. Moreover, the only migrant to Australia was a male, supporting an apparent tendency for male-biased breeding dispersal inferred from genetic analyses. Distribution and timing of movements appeared in general to relate to avoidance of competition from congeners and conspecifics from other populations.

The most well-documented of such gradients is a weakening of direct density dependence and an increase in the tendency of populations to cycle the farther north they occur, a phenomenon that has been attributed to gradients in predation and seasonality. Among large mammals, however, for which evidence of cyclicity is less clear, geographic gradients in population dynamics are limited to spatial variation in the strength of density independence. The population dynamics of caribou and muskoxen in Greenland, for example, display latitudinal gradients in the response of populations to large-scale climatic fluctuation. To my knowledge, the existence of spatial gradients in density dependence has not been explicitly investigated in large mammals. Here I present an analysis of the dynamics of 27 populations of caribou and reindeer in Greenland, Finland, and Russia, spanning 21 degrees of latitude (51.7°-72.7° N) and 215 degrees of longitude (56.4° W-159.5° E), to identify spatial gradients in density dependence and independence. Results of autoregressive time series analysis show a clear gradient in the strength of direct density dependence exhibited by these populations that declines from southern to northern latitudes. Although this pattern mirrors the latitudinal gradient evident in Fennoscandian rodent dynamics, an analysis of the dimensionality of these time series suggests that few, if any, of the populations are limited by predators. The existence of an inverse latitudinal gradient in the magnitude of the influence of large-scale climate on the dynamics of these populations suggests there may be a tension in the strength of density-dependent vs. density-independent limitation experienced by them. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",62,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Caribou | Density dependence | Density independence | Latitude | Longitude | Rangifer tarandus | Reindeer,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,98,NA,NA,NA,NA

Specifically, we examined correlations among the geographic location of sampling plots separated by either 135-3515 m (mesoscale) or 4-134 m (fine scale), the abiotic environmental characteristics of the plots, and their constituent fern species. Ferns had predictable distributions along a soil moisture gradient at both spatial scales: six of eight common fern species showed repeatable environmental optima along the soil moisture gradient. By sampling in such a way as to decouple the correlation between distance and environmental variation, we showed the dominant role of environmental variables such as soil moisture in determining fern distributions at the mesoscale. At the fine scale, however, strong spatial autocorrelation in the abiotic environment precluded assigning any definitive role for either dispersal or environmental determinism alone in affecting fern distributions. The expectations of neutral theory that are rooted in dispersal limitation and those of niche theory that are rooted in environmental adaptation converge at fine spatial scales where natural environments have strong spatial structure. The structure of the environment at fine spatial scales may foster the persistence of dispersal-limited plants in the community; neighboring environments are likely to be similar, and thus suitable for propagules dispersing short distances. While patterns of fern distribution in this locality are not consistent with purely neutral or random models of species coexistence, alternative models that rely on strict niche requirements without accounting for dispersal effects and the inherent spatial structure of the environment are inadequate because they neglect the important interaction of these factors.

Climate-induced changes in the abundance of species in lower trophic levels can cascade up to apex predators by depressing vital rates. However, the characteristics and predictability of predator demographic responses remain largely unexplored. We investigated the detectability, limits, and nonlinearity of changes in Antarctic fur seal pup production at South Georgia over a 20-year period in response to environmental autocorrelation created by global climate perturbations; these were identified in time series of monthly averaged sea surface temperature (SST). Environmental autocorrelation at South Georgia was evident with frequent SST anomalies between 1990 and 1999, during a decade of warm background (time-averaged) conditions. SST anomalies were preceded by, and cross-correlated with, frequent El Niño-La Niña events between 1987 and 1998, which was also a decade of warm background conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Nonlinear mixed-effects models indicated that positive anomalies at South Georgia explained extreme reductions in Antarctic fur seal pup production over 20 years of study. Simulated environmental time series suggested that the effect of anomalies on Antarctic fur seals was only detectable within a narrow range of positive SST, regardless of the distribution, variance, and autocorrelation structure in SST; this explained the observed nonlinearity in responses in pup production, which were observed only under persistent high SST levels. Such anomalies at South Georgia were likely associated with low availability of prey, largely krill, which affected Antarctic fur seal females over time scales longer than their breeding cycle. Reductions in Antarctic fur seal pup production could thus be predicted in advance by the detection of large-scale anomalies, which appeared to be driven by trends in global climate perturbation. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",133,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,"Antarctic fur seals | Bird Island, South Georgia | Climate perturbations | Demography | El Niño | Environmental autocorrelation | Fur seal pup production | Mixed-effects models | Power spectrum | Sea surface temperature, SST | Southern Ocean | Variance components",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,100,NA,NA,NA,NA

Prior to the manipulation, upgraded and control redstarts had stable-carbon isotope values in their blood indicative of scrub habitat occupancy and were comparable in body mass. Relative to control birds that overwintered exclusively in scrub, upgraded redstarts incorporated mangrove isotopic signatures, maintained body mass from winter to spring, departed earlier on spring migration, and returned at a higher rate in the following winter. Furthermore, insect biomass on upgrade territories was significantly greater than on control territories, suggesting food availability as a proximate mechanism underlying gradients of nonbreeding habitat suitability.

However, seed dispersal facilitation among plant neighbors that share seed dispersal agents has received little study. Seed dispersal facilitation among neighboring plants can be defined as an increase in the number, distances, and/or places reached by a plant's seeds that is due to the presence of co-fruiting-plant neighbors with which it shares frugivore seed dispersers. 1 experimentally tested the potential for seed dispersal facilitation and competition among co-fruiting-plant neighbors using Solanum americanum and Cestrum diurnum, two plant species that co-occur in open habitats of Puerto Rico and whose seeds are dispersed by the same bird species. 1 constructed S. americanum neighborhoods with and without C. diurnum (i.e., mixed and non-mixed) while controlling plant ripe-fruit crop and surrounding fruiting landscape in six replicate fields. 1 quantified seed dispersal using a grid of seed-collecting trays bearing bird perches placed at four distance classes from experimental plant neighborhoods.

However, there were significantly more bird droppings with seeds collected from mixed neighborhoods than from monospecific S. americanum neighborhoods. Although the quantity of seed dispersal was no different among treatments, S. americanum seeds were distributed into more ""packaging units"" and reached more sampling trays when neighbored by C. diurnum. This was explained by the higher number of frugivores that visited mixed neighborhoods compared to Solanum-only neighborhoods, and by an associated increase in agonistic interactions in mixed neighborhoods. Therefore, the seed dispersal pattern of S. americanum was facilitated by the presence of fruiting C. diurnum neighbors.

This reflects no apparent relationship between body size and trophic position among prey taxa. Primary consumer taxa (algivores and detritivores) in this system are characterized by diverse size and morphology, and thus predatory fish of all body sizes and feeding strategies are able to exploit taxa feeding low in the food web.

Here, we synthesize recent evidence on latitudinal and bathymetric gradients of species diversity in benthic mollusks, one of the most diverse and intensively studied marine taxa. Latitudinal gradients in coastal faunas show poleward declines in diversity, but the patterns are highly asymmetrical between hemispheres, and irregular both within and among regions. The extensive fossil record of mollusks reveals that latitudinal gradients have become steeper during the Neogene, partly because of a rapid diversification in tropical coral reefs and their associated biotas. Much of the inter-regional variation in contemporary latitudinal trends depends on the longitudinal distribution of reefs and major Neogene vicariant events. Thus, coastal faunas reveal a strong evolutionary-historical legacy. Bathymetric and latitudinal gradients in the deep ocean suggest that molluscan diversity is a function of the rate of nutrient input from surface production. Diversity may be depressed at abyssal depths because of extremely low rates of organic carbon flux, and at upper bathyal depths and high latitudes by pulsed nutrient loading. While the deep-sea environment is not conducive to fossilization, relationships between local and regional diversity, and the distribution and age of higher taxa indicate an evolutionary signal in present-day diversity gradients.

A critical consideration in estimating the latent structure is imperfect detection, which causes the observed abundance index to be less than or equal to the latent abundance class. We specify a multinomial sampling model for the observed abundance index that is conditional on the latent abundance class. Estimation of the latent abundance class distribution is based on the marginal likelihood of the index data, having integrated over the latent class distribution.

By contrast, theory in community ecology draws from a tradition of determinism: focusing on the processes (competition, predation) that promote the coexistence of groups of species (i.e., coexistence), while generally ignoring environmental variation in these processes (process noise or environmental stochasticity). Here 1 considered the role of deterministic and stochastic sources of variation in a predator-prey interaction on the probability of prey population extinction. Using discrete-time stochastic versions of a classic predator-prey model I show that even low levels of predator process noise increase the probability of prey extinction. Surprisingly, predator process noise has stronger negative effects on prey persistence than stochasticity in the population growth rate of the prey species itself. This conclusion is robust across a wide range of deterministic model behaviors, suggesting that the effects of stochastic variation in predator abundance on prey persistence may be pervasive. I then applied these insights to the management of endangered prey populations threatened by a nonnative predator and examined the relative efficacy of three predator control techniques at reviving declining prey populations. These techniques included immediate eradication and reduction of predator populations through either ""proportional"" harvest or ""trigger"" harvest. Under a proportional harvest regime, a constant proportion of predators were removed each year, with little attention paid to the natural variation experienced by predator populations. By contrast, I implemented trigger harvest by reducing predator abundance to a fixed threshold abundance level only in years in which the predator exceeds this harvest threshold. Trigger harvest reduces both the relative abundance and variance of predators, whereas proportional harvest only reduces the abundance of these species. My analysis suggests that the reduction of predator variance through trigger harvest can revive declining prey populations and, in some cases, revive them more effectively than a proportional reduction of predator abundance: the default control strategy when eradication cannot be achieved. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",31,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Coexistence theory | Environmental stochasticity | Extinction risk | Introduced species | Population viability | Predator | Prey | Process error | Process noise | Trigger harvest,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,111,NA,NA,NA,NA

We examined the degree to which potential mutualists of a seaweed provide complementary vs. redundant benefits to their host to begin to assess the effects of mutualist diversity on host performance. The gastropods Anachis lafresnayi (Costoanachis lafresnayi) and Mitrella lunata (Astyris lunata) are common associates of the red alga Chondrus crispus in subtidal locations in southern New England. Field surveys showed that where these snails were rare, Chondrus was sparse and covered with a heavy growth of sessile invertebrates, but where snails were common, Chondrus was abundant and free from fouling overgrowth. In manipulative field experiments, plants with no snails had the most overgrowth (measured both as percent cover and total mass) and lost 25% of their mass in five weeks. Plants with either species of snail alone were also heavily fouled and lost mass. Those with only Mitrella were overgrown by solitary ascidians, whereas those with only Anachis were overgrown by bryozoans, suggesting that both snails remove epibionts, but they differ in the suite of epibionts they are capable of removing. As a result, only Chondrus with both species of snail present remained unfouled and gained mass over the course of the experiment. Field tethering experiments showed that both snail species can gain a refuge from crab predation by associating with Chondrus. Our results show that these two snail species are not interchangeable and they provide complementary benefits to their host because they differ in their prey preferences.

We assessed DON cycling in a N-limited headwater forest stream via whole-ecosystem additions of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and labile dissolved organic matter (DOM), hydrologic transport and biogeochemical modeling, and laboratory experiments with native sediments. We sampled surface and subsurface waters to understand how interaction among hydrologic exchange, DIN, DON, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) influence stream N losses at summer baseflow. Added DON was taken up rapidly from the water column at rates exceeding DOC and DIN. A significant fraction of this DON was mineralized and nitrified. Combined DON and NO3-N uptake lengths resulted in spiraling lengths of ∼210 m, suggesting the potential for multiple transformations of labile N loads within catchment boundaries. Simultaneous addition of DIN increased DOM uptake, but more so for C, resulting in an upward shift in the C:N ratio of uptake. Sediment incubations also showed a strong biotic influence on DOC and DON dynamics. Despite efficient uptake of added DOM, background DON and high molecular mass DOC concentrations increased downstream, resulting in higher DOM loads than could be accounted for by groundwater discharge and suggesting net release of less bioavailable forms from the channel/hyporheic zone. At the same time, subsurface DOM was characterized by very low C:N ratios and a disproportionately large DON pool despite rapid hydrologic mixing with dilute and high C:N ratio surface waters. Analysis of expected DON loads from conservative hyporheic fluxes indicated that watershed losses of DON would have been seven times greater in the absence of apparent benthic demand, suggesting tight internal cycling of subsurface DON.

One such model, grounded on theory (biological relativity to water-energy dynamics) is the interim general model (IGM1) of the climatic potential for woody plant richness. Here we present a second-generation model (IGM2), and genus and family versions of both models. IGM1 describes horizontal climate-richness relationships based on climate station data and systematic species range maps, with IGM2 additionally incorporating vertical changes in climate due to topographic relief. The IGMs are mathematical transformations of empirical relationships obtained for the southern subcontinent of Africa, whereby the re-described regression models apply to the full range of global variation in all independent climate parameters. We undertake preliminary validation of the new IGMs, first by mapping the distribution and relative spatial variation in forecasted richness (per 25 000 km2) across the continent of Africa, then by evaluating the precision of forecasted values (actual vs. predicted) for an independent study system, the woody plants of Kenya. We also compare the IGMs with a recent example of purely statistical regression models of climate-richness relationships; namely, the ""global"" model of A. P. Francis and D. J. Currie for angiosperm family richness. We conclude that the IGMs are globally applicable and can provide a fundamental baseline for systematically estimating differences in (woody) plant richness and for exploring the hierarchy of subordinate relationships that should also contribute to differences in realized richness (mostly at more discrete scales of analysis). Further, we found that the model of Francis and Currie is useful for predicting angiosperm richness in Africa, on a conditional basis (somewhere, sometime); we examined the relationship that it describes between climate and richness.

We discuss some of the problems involved in testing for latitudinal bias in diversification rates and present an example phylogenetic analysis for endemic bird genera of the New World. The results provide evidence for higher diversification rates in clades inhabiting lower latitudes, both when genera are considered independent and when phylogeny is controlled for using independent contrasts. High rates of diversification are also associated with larger geographic area and higher net primary productivity, although these do not fully account for the latitudinal effect. The latitudinal pattern is stronger in younger clades, supporting the prediction of a simple model in which the signal of latitudinal bias in diversification rates diminishes as clades age and become saturated with species.

Such measurements of genetic variation based on quantitative genetic theory rely on assumptions of environmental constancy. These assumptions are not likely to hold in nature. Instead, natural environments are structured, and systematic variation in environmental conditions is an important determinant of phenotypic variation. Here we provide an introduction to quantitative genetics using a reaction norms approach, because we believe that this provides us with a good framework for combining ecology and genetics. We subsequently review the literature on genetic variation for clutch size of birds, and we show that, in spite of the inherent limitations of the methods employed, there is strong evidence that clutch size has a heritable component in natural populations of several species. However, the number of studies on the amount of genetic variation for clutch size in different species and across a range of environmental conditions is still far too small to study patterns in the relationship between heritable variation and properties of species and/or their environments. Furthermore, the role of both correlations and interactions with the environment in these estimates requires much more attention. Above all else, however, we need more information on the structure and magnitude of the environmental variation present in these studies. Future work should focus on how to obtain such data, and how to subsequently incorporate them into the proposed reaction norm framework. This requires the search for, and measurement of, relevant ecological variables. Also a more detailed investigation of the within-individual variation and the use of animal model methodology may prove to be valuable.

We examined variation in species richness, abundance, and interactions among leaf-chewing herbivores and the dominant salt-marsh plant Spartina alterniflora along the Atlantic Coast of the United States. High-latitude S. alterniflora plants are more palatable to herbivores than are low-latitude plants. Within this range of latitude, diversity and density of the dominant leaf-chewing consumers, snails and grasshoppers, in Spartina-dominated portions of the marsh varied little. Low-latitude plants, however, experienced much greater levels of leaf damage from consumers than did high-latitude plants. Per capita feeding rates of low-latitude snails (Littoraria irrorata) and grasshoppers (Orchelimum fidicinum) in the laboratory were greater than feeding rates of high-latitude snails (Melampus bidentatus) and grasshoppers (Conocephalus spartinae). In field experiments, low-latitude snails strongly suppressed S. alterniflora growth, but high-latitude snails had no effect on primary production. Thus, latitudinal differences in the effect of herbivores on plants (i.e., interaction strength), driven by differences in per capita effects among species, rather than differences in diversity or density, may contribute to selection for latitudinal differences in plant palatability.

We investigated the relative contributions of primary and secondary seed dispersal of Sierra bush chinquapin (Castanopsis sempervirens; Fagaceae) to seedling establishment. Rodents (mostly yellow pine chipmunks, Tamias amoenus) harvested chinquapin nuts rapidly during a three-week period starting in mid-August and scatterhoarded most nuts (81%) in the ground. Most initial (primary) caches contained one nut (range = 1-5 nuts) buried 10-23 mm deep within 46 m of source shrubs. Rodents subsequently retrieved 95% of these nuts and recached at least 33% elsewhere (secondary caches), at lower densities and up to 64 m from source plants. By winter, 41% and 21% of nuts harvested from shrubs remained in scatter caches in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Only 10 caches (4 primary and 6 secondary caches) present in winter 1999 (7.8%), and no caches from winter 2000, produced seedlings the following spring. All seedlings died during the first growing season because of rodent grazing and desiccation. Despite low seedling survival in this study, chinquapin appears to be dependent upon scatterhoarding rodents for seedling recruitment. Secondary dispersal is an important aspect of chinquapin dispersal. Secondary caches contributed more to chinquapin seedling recruitment than primary caches; 2.5% of primary caches and 5.6% of secondary caches produced seedlings. This study suggests that, for propagules that move repeatedly during dispersal, a clear understanding of the dynamics of seed dispersal can be gained only by following seed movements, determining the transition probabilities between different stages of dispersal, and assessing the contribution of each stage of seed dispersal to plant recruitment. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",56,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Castanopsis sempervirens | Chinquapin | Food hoarding | Granivory | Scatterhoarding | Secondary seed dispersal,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,121,NA,NA,NA,NA

Stringent ecological conditions are likely to have important consequences for the evolution of life history traits, but direct empirical tests are few. We compare the demography of three populations of ptarmigan on an environmental gradient spanning alpine, subalpine, and arctic habitats. Female Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) and White-tailed Ptarmigan (L. leucurus) breeding at subalpine and alpine sites had smaller clutches and lower probabilities of nesting success, fledging success, and renesting than Willow Ptarmigan nesting at a low-elevation arctic site. Annual fecundity, measured as female fledglings per breeding female, did not overlap among the three populations and was ranked: alpine (0.40 ± 0.08, mean ± SE, 95% CI = 0.26-0.58) < subalpine (1.33 ± 0.10, 1.13-1.54) < arctic (2.04 ± 0.18, 1.68-2.39). There was a nonsignificant trend for apparent survival rates (φ) of breeding females to vary in the opposite direction: alpine (0.46 ± 0.04) > subalpine (0.43 ± 0.03) > arctic (0.37 ± 0.06). Population growth rates predicted significant declines for the alpine population (λ = 0.65 ± 0.07, 95% CI = 0.52-0.79), but not the subalpine (λ = 1.00 ± 0.07, 0.86-1.14) or arctic populations (λ = 1.13 ± 0.20, 0.78-1.54). The adjusted estimates of survival necessary to sustain a stationary population indicated that actual variation in female survival was more pronounced than the observed rates: alpine (0.71) > subalpine (0.43) > arctic (0.33). Together, the fecundity and survival values provide evidence that even congeneric populations can exhibit a continuum between high reproductive and survivor life history strategies. Variation in ptarmigan life history traits was consistent with population differences in predation rates on eggs and breeding females, and it was not related to duration of the breeding season, climatic conditions, or food availability. Ptarmigan demography also covaried with body size, but not in the predicted pattern.

The presence of vaccenic type FAs (ω7 family) was indicative of a bacterial diet in general.

Fungal-feeding Collembola comprised a higher proportion of linoleic acid, whereas the profile of plant feeders showed an increased amount of oleic acid. The FA 20:1 ω9 was only present in Collembola with nematodes as prey.

We investigated age- and sex-specific changes in the kidney fat reserves of a large sample of Himalayan tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus), a highly sexually dimorphic and polygynous mountain ungulate, during and following the mating period. Subadult male tahr (2-4 years old) obtain copulations opportunistically by ""coursing,"" whereas adult males (>4 years old) spend more time traveling and searching for females, and obtain copulations after engaging in more time-consuming ""tending"" and ""blocking"" displays. If there is a cost to these reproductive behaviors, we predicted that (1) the kidney fat index (KFI) of reproductive males (≥2 years old) should decline during the mating period relative to females and nonproductive males, and (2) that the KFI of adult males should decline more than that of subadult males. We formulated our predictions into a series of candidate models, including three covariates also likely to affect fat reserves, and compared support for these models using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). The best-fitting model revealed that fat reserves in females and nonreproductive males changed similarly: Fat reserves increased during the mating period, in late autumn and early winter, reached a peak in mid-winter, and then declined throughout the remainder of winter and early spring. In contrast, the fat reserves of reproductive males declined during the mating period, as predicted, and remained low throughout winter. The extent of decline in fat reserves was greater in adult males than in subadult males, also as predicted.

We addressed these issues by examining the effects of limpets on algal recovery in littoral rock pools. An initial experiment indicated that algal cover was a negative accelerating function of density of limpets, although this effect was weak. Superimposed to this effect there was a clear trend of variability in algal cover among pools that decreased with increasing density of limpets. These results suggested that mean intensity and spatial variance of grazing could affect algal colonization both within and among pools. This proposition was tested with a novel experimental design in which the mean intensity and the spatial variance of grazing were manipulated in factorial combinations. The experiment was repeated twice to examine possible generalities of outcomes. In both runs spatial variance of grazing enhanced spatial variance in algal cover, although this effect occurred under weak intensity of grazing in the first run and in combination with strong intensity of grazing in the second run. In contrast, intensity and variability in grazing operated independently on mean algal cover, with strong intensity depressing colonization of algae and large variance increasing colonization consistently in time. By manipulating the mean intensity and the spatial variance of grazing simultaneously, we were able to explain spatial patterns in algal cover that would have been classified as unexplained variation otherwise.

In this paper, I first argue that the actual operational definitions of this concept as applied to animal movement are not fully consistent with its formal definition. For instance, I question that a high likelihood of movement among the different points of primary habitat implies a high connectivity and contend that such a view can lead to misinterpretations. I also address two more hurdles to the measurement of functional connectivity: the fact that functional connectivity may not be equal along all axes and directions of movement and individual variation in functional connectivity within a given landscape. These points bring me to suggest that the concept of functional connectivity be bridged to the one of travel costs used in behavioral ecology. This would help define unequivocal operational definitions of functional connectivity as its measurement would then be dictated by its ecological role within specific models (e.g., travel costs within group membership models of foraging theory). I argue further that this ecological role shall in turn determine the motivation underlying the movement of individuals, implying that the latter should preferably be standardized when measuring functional connectivity in the field, I finally present some methods to do so.

Molecular evidence suggests that American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and red maple (Acer rubrum) persisted during the late glaciation as low-density populations, perhaps within 500 km of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Because populations were closer to modern range limits than previously thought, postglacial migration rates may have been slower than those inferred from fossil pollen.

Any reasonable dissimilarity measure can be used, and the method provides a natural extension from canonical analysis of principal coordinates (CAP) to nonlinear canonical analysis through the use of a link function, much like the extension of linear models to generalized linear models. The form of the nonlinear link function needs to be specified and will depend on the particular ecological system and the nature of the gradient. For example, an exponential decay curve could be used to model community structure after an environmental impact as a nonlinear function of time. This curve is used in our first example, where community structure is modeled as a nonlinear function of habitat size. Our second example uses a logistic curve to model change in community structure through a region of habitat transition from grassland to woodland. Computationally, this methodology uses a standard nonlinear optimization procedure to find the values of the parameters that maximize the correlation of the principal coordinates (obtained from an appropriately chosen distance measure) with the chosen form of nonlinear gradient. A simple randomization procedure is used to test the significance of the fitted nonlinear gradient over and above the fit of the linear gradient, and bootstrap confidence intervals for parameters are readily obtained.

Consequently, the topic has invited a vast commentary. One result of scaling research is so-called scaling laws that describe how observations scale (e.g., as power laws). Importantly, such scaling rules seldom derive from a process-based understanding of why they emerge. Alternatively, the task of scaling is often addressed via simulation models. This is a scaling operation about which we are somewhat less confident, although recent advances in computing power and computational statistics provide for some promising new solutions. Here, I focus on methods for scaling simulations developed at fine grain and small extent, to their implications over much larger extent. The intent in scaling is to simplify the model while retaining those details essential for larger-scale applications. This approach should lead to scaling rules that are well founded in fine-scale ecological process and yet useful for making predictions at the larger scales of management and environmental policy. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",140,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Aggregation | Graph theory | Hierarchy | Landscape pattern | Markov model | Metapopulatlon | Scale | Spatial heterogeneity | Succession,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,136,NA,NA,NA,NA

From July 2001 to July 2003, 48 plants were grown in an old-field site following a three-factor randomized blocked design where treatments were: ant (ants present and absent), nutrient (without and with nutrient addition), and light (sun and shade). During the experiment, in the absence of ants, plants growing in sunlight were shorter, developed fewer leaves and leaflets, were more damaged by herbivores, had half the total dry biomass, and died more frequently than plants visited by ants. In contrast, ants had no effect on the growth, survival, and total biomass of shaded plants. Therefore small-scale heterogeneity in the light environment turned mutualism (+,+) into commensalism (+,0).

Landscape pattern analysis was the first attempt to deal with multiple species, and it led to a range of landscape management strategies. Advances in landscape ecology, driven largely by the pragmatic needs of conservation, are building approaches to multispecies management that have stronger ecological foundations. However, their treatment of uncertainty is in its infancy. In this paper, we provide examples to illustrate some of these issues. We conclude that one of the most important sources of uncertainty is the choice of the modeling frame.

Underlying the majority of studies regarding any type of clutch size variation (i.e., individual, seasonal, latitudinal) of altricial birds is the premise that the primary cost of reproduction stems from feeding offspring. However, both altricial and precocial species of birds display latitudinal and seasonal variation in clutch size. Additionally, individual variation in costs of laying and incubation, recently demonstrated, indicates that understanding latitudinal and seasonal clutch size trends will require increased attention to earlier phases of reproduction. Given the strength and ubiquity of the clutch size patterns, many environmental factors, such as food supply and predation, have been proposed to account for the patterns, but temperature has been largely overlooked. Gradients in many variables may be important because the primacy of selection pressures may also vary in space and time. Furthermore, physiological systems may constrain responses to selection pressures. Thus, it is possible that intraspecific geographic and seasonal patterns in clutch size are at least partially influenced by temperature-dependent physiological processes. Therefore, we suggest that it is important to examine physiological responses of birds (e.g., embryo development, incubation energetics) directly influenced by physical properties of the environment, which exhibit predictable types of spatial and temporal variation (e.g., temperature, humidity, day length). We review two recently proposed, complementary hypotheses that are excellent candidates for this approach. By one mechanism, the thermal inertia of large clutches makes them favorable in cooler weather (the clutch-cooling hypothesis of J. M. Reid et al.). By the other, the reduction in egg viability under warm temperatures favors small clutches (the egg-viability hypothesis of S. H. Stoleson and S. R. Beissinger). Using general linear mixed models, we found that large-scale nesting patterns of Eastern Bluebirds and Red-winged Blackbirds are consistent with the egg-viability hypothesis in that females appear to initiate incubation before clutch completion when they lay large clutches at low latitudes. Although attempts have been made to overcome the logistical obstacles associated with studying large-scale phenomena through meta-analyses and multiple small-scale study sites, we demonstrate the significant potential of new technologies combined with volunteer-based studies to validate these hypotheses as we outline directions for future research. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",84,Journal,re,Review,100,4,4,Clutch size variation | Cornell Nest Record Program | Critical temperatures | Egg viability | Hatching failure | Incubation period | Latitude gradients | Onset of incubation | Seasonal constraints,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,141,NA,NA,NA,NA

This can be caused either by the positive spatial autocorrelation among the locations of individual organisms due to ecological spatial processes (e.g., species dispersal, competition for space and resources) or by spatial dependence due to (positive or negative) species responses to underlying environmental conditions. Both forms of spatial structure pose problems for statistical analysis, as spatial autocorrelation in the residuals violates the assumption of independent observations, while environmental heterogeneity restricts the comparability of replicates. In this paper, we discuss how spatial structure due to ecological spatial processes and spatial dependence affects spatial statistics, landscape metrics, and statistical modeling of the species-environment correlation. For instance, while spatial statistics can quantify spatial pattern due to an endogeneous spatial process, these methods are severely affected by landscape environmental heterogeneity. Therefore, statistical models of species response to the environment not only need to accommodate spatial structure, but need to distinguish between components due to exogeneous and endogeneous processes rather than discarding all spatial variance. To discriminate between different components of spatial structure, we suggest using (multivariate) spatial analysis of residuals or delineating the spatial realms of a stationary spatial process using boundary detection algorithms.

Nevertheless, remarkably little work has focused on the costs and benefits that ecosystem engineers obtain from traits that underlie their ecosystem engineering capacity. We addressed this topic by comparing two autogenic engineers, which vary in the degree in which they affect their abiotic environment via their physical structure. That is, we compared two plant species from the intertidal coastal zone (Spartina anglica and Zostera noltii), whose shoots are exposed to similar currents and waves, but differ in the extent that they modify their environment via reduction of hydrodynamic energy. Our results indicate that there can be trade-offs related to the traits that underlies autogenic ecosystem engineering capacity. Dissipation of hydrodynamic forces from waves was roughly a factor of three higher in vegetation with stiff leaves compared to those with flexible leaves. Drag was highest and most sensitive to hydrodynamic forces in stiff vegetation that does not bend with the flow. Thus, shoot stiffness determines both the capacity to reduce hydrodynamic energy (i.e., proxy for ecosystem engineering capacity) and the drag that needs to be resisted (i.e., proxy for associated costs).

However, little is known about the controls of algal community composition and primary production before, during, and after ecosystem state change, because long time series that monitor biological change through the transition are scarce. Using proxy data sets derived from sediment cores from two shallow hypertrophic lakes in Denmark, variance-partitioning analysis (VPA) was used to determine the relative importance of changes in total phosphorus (diatom inferred), planktivorous fish density (zooplankton inferred), and submerged macrophyte communities (as macrofossil abundance) as determinants of algal abundance and community composition (as sedimentary pigments) over ecosystem state transitions since 1750 (CE) for Lake Lading and 1900 for Lake Søbygaard. Past variation in densities of planktivorous fish explained 12.3% and 18.2% of historical algal community change in lakes Lading and Søbygaard, respectively, while a further 22.3% and 6% of algal variability was explained by variation in macrophyte abundance. Total phosphorus (TP) alone explained nonsignificant amounts of variance (1.5%, 3.6%) but had a significant effect in combination with macrophytes and fish (27%, 13.4%).

Recent work, however, raised the possibility that dispersal among mountain ranges is an important process in the biogeography of boreal mammals in the Great Basin. We test this proposition using genetic variation in a representative species, the yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris). A total of 332 marmots was sampled from 10 ranges and genotyped at six microsatellite loci. If the intervening desert lowlands are impermeable barriers to dispersal, then there should be no relationship between genetic distance and geographic distance among mountaintop populations, and genetic diversity should be diminished because gene flow would not be available to replace alleles lost over thousands of generations of isolation. Our results did not support these predictions. There was a strong correlation between genetic and geographic distance, demonstrating an isolation-by-distance pattern, and genetic diversity was high. Our results suggest that marmot populations in the Great Basin may be linked by dispersal, providing a mechanism to replenish genetic variation lost by drift.

We used floral extracts to determine the source of sexually dimorphic odor and pollinator responses. Specifically, we used extracts of whole flowers and specific floral parts in choice tests to determine that pollinators preferred the scent of hermaphrodite flowers over those of females and that this discrimination was due primarily to the scent of hermaphrodite anthers. These data conclusively show that scent can be a major driver of pollinator behavior in gender dimorphic plants. Our results also indicate that scent is an important modulator of pollinator behavior even in a small flowered, weakly scented species visited by generalist pollinators, and not just peculiar to intensely scented, deceptive, or specialized pollination systems. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",102,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,2-phenylethanol | Dioecy | Floral volatiles | Fragaria virginiana | Fragrance | Gynodioecy | Pollen | Pollen scent,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,152,NA,NA,NA,NA

Studies testing adaptive functions of brood reduction assume that eggs are protected by their shells and waiting for parents to initiate incubation in a manner that creates optimal hatching patterns, but the viability of early laid eggs may diminish over time due to putative effects of ambient temperature. We tested effects of exposure to ambient temperature on the viability of unincubated bird eggs using an altitudinal climate gradient in Puerto Rico: daily maximum temperatures nearly always exceed developmental zero in the lowland forest, whereas temperatures rarely exceed developmental zero in the cloud forest and at intermediate altitudes. We removed 382 freshly laid Pearly-eyed Thrasher (Margarops fuscatus) eggs, placed them in holding boxes at three sites for 1-7 days, and returned them to nests to be incubated. Additional control eggs (n = 39) tested effects of both handling and movement on hatching success, and unmanipulated eggs (n = 139) provided a measure of natural hatching success. Hatching success of control eggs (82.0%) and unmanipulated eggs (84.9%) did not differ, indicating no impacts of handling on hatchability. Hatching success of experimental eggs exposed for one day (78.6%) was high but declined very strongly after exposure for three days (41.9%), five days (11.5%) and seven days (2.1%). Hatchability of eggs held at the cloud forest did not differ from eggs held at the lowland site but was lower for eggs exposed at mid-elevation. Hatching success was positively related to minimum temperature and marginally related to mean temperature and proportion of time above developmental zero. Exposure duration, treatment site, and maximum temperature were the only significant effects identified by stepwise logistic regression. Eggs held at the lowland site had shorter developmental periods than eggs held at other sites. Most embryo mortality (80.8%) occurred at very early stages. Our results demonstrate that viability of unincubated eggs exposed to moist tropical conditions declines strongly but suggest that ambient temperature is not the sole cause.

A serendipitous natural experiment provided an opportunity to test the trophic cascade hypothesis for wolves (Canis lupus) in Banff National Park, Canada. The first wolf pack recolonized the Bow Valley of Banff National Park in 1986. High human activity partially excluded wolves from one area of the Bow Valley (low-wolf area), whereas wolves made full use of an adjacent area (high-wolf area). We investigated the effects of differential wolf predation between these two areas on elk (Cervus elaphus) population density, adult female survival, and calf recruitment; aspen (Populus tremuloides) recruitment and browse intensity; willow (Salix spp.) production, browsing intensity, and net growth; beaver (Castor canadensis) density; and riparian songbird diversity, evenness, and abundance. We compared effects of recolonizing wolves on these response variables using the log response ratio between the low-wolf and high-wolf treatments. Elk population density diverged over time in the two treatments, such that elk were an order of magnitude more numerous in the low-wolf area compared to the high-wolf area at the end of the study. Annual survival of adult female elk was 62% in the high-wolf area vs. 89% in the low-wolf area. Annual recruitment of calves was 15% in the high-wolf area vs. 27% without wolves. Wolf exclusion decreased aspen recruitment, willow production, and increased willow and aspen browsing intensity. Beaver lodge density was negatively correlated to elk density, and elk herbivory had an indirect negative effect on riparian songbird diversity and abundance. These alternating patterns across trophic levels support the wolf-caused trophic cascade hypothesis. Human activity strongly mediated these cascade effects, through a depressing effect on habitat use by wolves. Thus, conservation strategies based on the trophic importance of large carnivores have increased support in terrestrial ecosystems. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",316,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,Carnivore | Community ecology | Conservation | Herbivory | Human activity | Park management | Predation | Predator exclusion | Trophic cascade | Wolf,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,155,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Fifteen (63%) of the bird species exhibited numerical changes in abundance apparently associated with emergences of the local periodical cicada brood, and intraspecific spatial synchrony of bird abundance was significantly greater between populations sharing the same cicada brood than between populations in the ranges of different broods. Species exhibited at least four partially overlapping temporal patterns. (1) Cuckoos (Coccyzus spp.) occurred in high numbers only during emergence years and subsequently declined in abundance. (2) Red-bellied Woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus), Blue Jays (Cyanocitta cristata), Common Grackles (Quiscalus quiscula), and Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) increased significantly 1-3 years following emergences and then declined.

Furthermore, removing Cirsium and Veratrum where herbivory was permitted decreased the richness of associated communities, but inside a livestock exclosure removal of these species increased community richness.

Pollen and charcoal data from small forest hollows are used to complement regional data in the study of the spread of Picea abies and Fagus sylvatica into southern Scandinavia during the last 4000 years. P. abies spread as a migrating front and preferentially invaded successional Betula stands, which had become particularly wide-spread in the region during the last 1000 years as a result of human activity.

Using a comprehensive database on the geographical distributions of the large fauna of endemic shorefishes from the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP). we delineated latitudinal diversity gradients (LDGs) of species with different range sizes and assessed how the mid-domain effect, energy supply, environmental variability, and habitat availability predicted the various LDGs. We used statistical methods that account for spatial autocorrelation within each variable and consider collinearity among them. We found marked variation in LDGs among species with different range sizes: species with large ranges contributed the most to the convex form of the entirefauna LDG while species with small ranges generated most deviations from that form. The mid-domain effect was the strongest determinant for the entire-fauna LDG, largely due to the strength of its effect on widespread species. Habitat variables were the best predictors for LDGs of small-range species but had no significant effects on the entire-fauna pattern. We found that any relationship between energy supply and LDGs likely is spurious and arises from statistical effects of (1) the marked spatial autocorrelation of the residuals in those relationships and (2) strong covariation between energy supply and the mid-domain effect, two factors that have never been analyzed together in marine studies (and seldom in terrestrial studies). There was no indication that environmental stability was an important LDG determinant at any level within the fauna. We found that latitudinal (Rapoport) trends in range size in this fauna arise as corollaries of the mid-domain effect. The disparate contributions of species with different range sizes to diversity patterns demonstrate the failure of traditional, whole-fauna LDGs to adequately represent all faunal components and their determinants, particularly those of small-range (and more threatened) species. We argue that, just as analyses of whole-fauna patterns within a region obscure variation in determinants among faunal components, analyses of patterns at transoceanic (multiregional) scales are likely to conceal important regional variation in determinants of diversity gradients. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",86,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Diversity | Energy/habitat/stability effects | Fishes | Geographic range | Mid-domain effect | Rapoport's rule | Spatial scale,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,161,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we systematically explore the effect of spatial heterogeneity on regime shifts for three different models, which we run on a one-dimensional lattice with different spatial distributions of an environmental factor (e.g., soil fertility, water level). If dispersion between patches is negligible, the response to gradual change in some overall stressor (e.g., precipitation, nutrient load) is straightforward. Because of the environmental heterogeneity, each patch shifts to the other stable state at different values of the overall control variable. Therefore, the response of the ecosystem as a whole is gradual (i.e., the average of many asynchronous small shifts) instead of catastrophic. However, in response to a reverse change in the global stressor, the system always shows hysteresis, as each individual patch shifts back to the original state at a different value of the control parameter than the critical threshold for the forward shift. If dispersion between patches occurs, the response to change in the overall control parameter becomes dependent on the spatial pattern of environmental heterogeneity. If the environmental parameter is randomly distributed in space, the overall response tends to remain surprisingly catastrophic, and hysteresis is hardly reduced as compared to the homogeneous case. By contrast, in a smooth environmental gradient, the response of the overall system is gradual, and hysteresis is much smaller. In fact, hysteresis is largely reduced to the initial phases, in which none of the patches have shifted to the alternative state yet. As soon as the first patch shifts, a domino effect occurs, pushing over the neighboring patches. In conclusion, our results suggest that spatial heterogeneity may weaken the tendency for large-scale catastrophic regime shifts if dispersion is unimportant or if local environmental characteristics vary along a smooth gradient. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",213,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Hysteresis | Lattice model | Mobile link organisms | Multiple attractors | Regime shifts | Spatial heterogeneity,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,162,NA,NA,NA,NA

Reefs enhanced the abundance of resident invertebrates (e.g., polychaetes, nemerteans, epibenthic anemones, bivalves, and resident decapods) that comprise >90% of juvenile fish prey biomass. However, the increase in food availability due to reef presence did not affect abundance of juvenile fish in either of the vegetated habitats, suggesting that resources may not limit juvenile fish when restored in these habitats. Only mudflat reefs augmented juvenile fish abundances, most likely due to a combination of greater resource availability and relative isolation from functionally equivalent habitats. In addition, lower abundances of piscivorous fish in mudflat reefs relative to control areas likely contributed to this pattern.

For example, predator-induced traits typically provide superior predator resistance but slower growth, while competitor-induced traits provide better growth but inferior predator resistance. While the mechanisms underlying predator resistance have been identified, the mechanisms underlying differential growth have remained elusive. To determine whether competitor and predator environments affect individual growth by induced changes in foraging morphology, we raised wood frog tadpoles (Rana sylvatica) under a factorial combination of competitors and predators and assessed changes in mouthparts that might affect growth. In general, competitors induced relatively larger oral discs, wider beaks, and longer tooth rows, while predators induced relatively smaller oral discs, narrower beaks, and shorter tooth rows. These effects were interactive; the largest competitor-induced responses occurred under high predator density and the largest predator-induced responses occurred under low competition. Further, one of the tooth rows that commonly appeared under low predation risk was frequently absent under high predation risk. These discoveries suggest that predator and competitor environments can have profound effects on prey foraging structures and that these effects set up growth trade-offs between phenotypes that favor the evolution of phenotypically plastic responses. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",107,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Competition | Foraging morphology and individual growth | Inducible defense | Phenotypic plasticity | Polyphenism | Predation | Rana sylvatica | Trophic polymorphism,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,167,NA,NA,NA,NA

The implications of these results were previously explored with parametrically flexible models that made specific assumptions about the functional form of direct density dependence and the form and timing of delayed density dependence. Although these models were characterized by apparently different stability conditions, they pointed at the same conclusion: that the occurrence of population cycles under this hypothesis relies on the strength of the interaction between density and aggressiveness around the system's equilibrium. To investigate if this important result is valid more generally, we develop a minimally specified model by lifting most of the assumptions on direct and delayed density dependence. Stability analysis of this functionally flexible model confirms that unstable dynamics are indeed more likely if small perturbations from equilibrium density have a strong impact on aggressiveness, and it unifies the stability conditions previously derived for the more specific models under a single, general condition. Further, we derive global, necessary, and sufficient conditions for instability and express them in terms of proportional changes in aggressiveness and density. For the first time since the inception of the hypothesis, the necessary condition quantifies the minimum strength of the intrinsic mechanism that would be required to cause unstable dynamics. We predict that unstable population dynamics are possible if proportional perturbations from equilibrium density are at least matched by proportional changes in aggressiveness. Existing field data indicate that the necessary condition for intrinsic cycles is satisfied in Red Grouse populations. In contrast, the sufficient condition is considerably more strict, implying that intrinsic instability is not an inevitable feature of the system. We conclude that the model is consistent with the demographic patterns of cyclic population fluctuations in Red Grouse and other birds of the grouse family. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",13,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Aggressive behavior | Density dependence | Intrinsic hypotheses | Kinship hypothesis | Lagopus lagopus scoticus | Mathematical model | Necessary and sufficient conditions for instability | Population cycles | Red Grouse | Territoriality | Unstable population dynamics,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,168,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ecological specialization should create unexpectedly strong species associations, reflected by high positive or negative correlations between species that are adapted to similar or different kinds of site. Two systematic surveys of plant communities do indeed show stronger associations than are expected in randomly assembled communities. Neutral community models, however, also predict nonrandom patterns of co-distribution. Local selection in heterogeneous landscapes, where species are sorted into the sites to which they are best adapted, will produce even stronger associations, provided that different kinds of site are correlated in space, forming repeated combinations or ""habitats."" In practice, however, this effect is readily detectable only for intense selection in coarse-grained landscapes. In contrast, classification of species or sites into prior categories consistently produces positive associations, and thereby demonstrates the existence of non-neutral processes structuring communities. It is concluded that the bulk properties of communities, such as overall diversity, may be strongly affected by local dispersal and stochastic drift and, for this reason, are adequately represented by neutral models in many cases, despite the operation of systematic processes of local selection.

We argue here that all three of these outcomes involve evolutionary processes. Genetic differentiation within species is ubiquitous, commonly via adaptation of populations to differing environmental conditions. Detectable adaptive divergence evolves on a time scale comparable to change in climate, within decades for herbaceous plant species, and within centuries or millennia for longer-lived trees, implying that biologically significant evolutionary response can accompany temporal change in climate. Models and empirical studies suggest that the speed with which a population adapts to a changing environment affects invasion rate of new habitat and thus migration rate, population growth rate and thus probability of extinction, and growth and mortality of individual plants and thus productivity of regional vegetation. Recent models and experiments investigate the stability of species tolerance limits, the influence of environmental gradients on marginal populations, and the interplay of demography, gene flow, mutation rate, and other genetic processes on the rate of adaptation to changed environments. New techniques enable ecologists to document adaptation to changing conditions directly by resurrecting ancient populations from propagules buried in decades-old sediment. Improved taxonomic resolution from morphological studies of macrofossils and DNA recovered from pollen grains and macroremains provides additional information on range shifts, changes in population sizes, and extinctions.

I explore the utility of paleoecological studies for addressing questions about the predictability of ecosystem responses to climate change using Alaskan tree line ecosystems as a case study. Published studies were used to develop a regional analysis of patterns of recent tree line advance, and to estimate lags between recruitment onset and forest development beyond tree line. Tree line advance is ubiquitous, but asynchronous in time, occurring significantly earlier in the White Mountains in interior Alaska than in western Alaska or the Alaska Range. The mean lag between initiation of recruitment and forest development was estimated at approximately 200 years, similar to what modeling studies have found. Although continued advance of white spruce forests is the most likely scenario of future change, variability in the rate of forest response to warming may be likely due to limitation of spruce establishment in highly permafrost-affected sites, changes in seed dispersal and early establishment, and recent changes in the growth responses of individual trees to temperature. All of these factors may cause spruce populations to exhibit nonlinear responses to future warming, and uncritical extrapolation from recent trends is thus unwarranted. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",134,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Alaska | Alpine tree line | Arctic tree line | Boreal forest | Climate change | Lag | Permafrost | Picea glauca | Tree line advance | Tundra,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,175,NA,NA,NA,NA

In lakes, the generalist grazer genus Daphnia often has marked effects on the abundance of primary producers, the rate of primary production, and rates of nutrient cycling. The effects are particularly distinct during the clear-water phase (CWP) when algal biomass is driven to extremely low values as Daphnia densities undergo an annual population increase. Here we show that the timing of the CWP in Onondaga Lake, New York, USA, has depended upon which Daphnia species were present in the water column. An analysis of the ephippia and diapausing eggs from the sediments reveals that long-term changes in the zooplankton species assemblage tracks a history of chemical (especially salt waste) pollution. Prior to 1930 the assemblage was dominated by native D. pulicaria and D. ambigua. From 1930 to 1980, these species were replaced by D. exilis and D. curvirostris, two salinity-tolerant exotic species native to shallow salt pools of the southwestern United States and coastal brackish ponds of Europe, respectively. As industry was progressively shut down by government action over the period from the 1970s to the 1980s, the exotic species disappeared, and the two native taxa returned (plus D. galeata mendotae, which is also native to the region). As we have shown previously, the exotic species were identified either by hatching and rearing diapausing eggs (D. exilis) or by analysis of eggs using mtDNA (D. curvirostris). We interpret their role in seasonal algal dynamics in Onondaga Lake retrospectively using data collected in prior studies of the lake. The native Daphnia currently cause a typical spring CWP in late May and early June, whereas the exotic species caused an unusual late-summer (August-October) CWP during the period of maximum cyanobacterial density. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",30,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Algae | Clear-water phase | Consumption | Diapausing eggs | mtDNA | Onondaga Lake | Paleolimnology | Zooplankton,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,176,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Unlike prior laboratory studies, the N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton in Michigan ponds clustered around and below the Redfield ratio (7.2:1 by mass), despite wide variation in N:P supply ratios (2:1-63:1 by mass) and the presence of grazers. In a mesocosm experiment, the N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton cells again deviated from a nearly 1:1 relationship with N:P supply. Phytoplankton seston exhibited lower N:P content than expected at high N:P supply ratios, and often higher N:P content than anticipated at low N:P supply ratios, regardless of herbivore presence. Similar deviations consistently occur in the N:P stoichiometry of algae and plants in the other diverse systems.

Numbers of native and exotic species were positively correlated at large (50 m2) and small (10 m2) plot sizes, a trend that persisted when relationships to environmental gradients were controlled statistically. Both native and exotic species richness increased with soil pH and decreased along a gradient of increasing nitrate availability. Exotic species were restricted to the upper portion of the pH gradient and had individualistic responses to the availability of soil resources. These results are inconsistent with both the diversity-resistance and resource-enrichment hypotheses for invasibility. Environmental conditions favoring native species richness also favor exotic species richness, and competitive interactions with the native flora do not appear to limit the entry of additional species into the understory community at this site.

The experiment maintained an atmospheric CO2 concentration 200 μL/L above ambient levels in replicated (n = 3) FACE rings throughout the six-year period. This CO2-induced C sink was associated with greater inputs of organic matter in litterfall and fine-root turnover. There was no evidence that microbial decomposition was altered by the elevated CO2 treatment. Consistent with ecosystem recovery following decades of intensive agriculture, the C and N content of the mineral soil increased under both the elevated CO2 treatment and the ambient CO2 control during the six-year period. This increase is attributed to accumulation of plant residues derived from fine roots with relatively high turnover rates rather than accumulation of refractory or physically protected soil organic matter (SOM). The elevated CO2 treatment produced no detectable effect on the C and N content of the bulk mineral soils or of any particulate organic matter size fraction. Because the fumigation gas was strongly depleted in 13C, the incorporation of new C could be traced within the ecosystem. Significant decreases in δ13C of soil organic carbon (SOC) under the elevated CO2 treatment were used to estimate the mean residence times of intra-aggregate particulate organic matter and mineral-associated organic matter as well as the annual C inputs required to produce the observed changes in δ13C.

Problems with the design of early experiments have made it difficult to determine whether reductions in ecosystem functioning in low diversity treatments were due to the number of species present or merely to the reduced likelihood of including particular (""key"") species or functional groups. We established a field experiment, using cage enclosures, to test whether the number or identity of grazing gastropods present would affect the diversity and productivity of intertidal algal communities. We found that there was no relationship between ecosystem functioning and diversity per se, but that different species had idiosyncratic effects. This appears to be a common feature of intertidal systems, which often contain strongly interacting species. In this case, the limpet Patella ulyssiponensis was the most influential primary consumer. Additional treatments enabled us to test the potential for other grazers to compensate for its loss. Early results (after four months) suggested that compensation was possible, implying potential redundancy of P. ulyssiponensis. This effect disappeared after 13 months, however, highlighting the context dependence of so-called redundancy and underlining the importance of long-term field-based experiments in this area. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",186,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Algae | Biodiversity | Ecosystem functioning | Gastropod | Grazer | Ireland | Patella ulyssiponensis | Removal experiment | Rocky shore | Species identity | Species loss,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,182,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using spatiotemporal maps of damping-off epidemics caused by Rhizoctonia solani in replicated microcosms of >400 randomly mixed radish and mustard seedlings, we first show that as an epidemic progresses through a mixed plant population it changes the contact structure between infected (I) and susceptible (S) plants, so that resistant plants are challenged progressively more frequently, thereby slowing the epidemic. We estimate the transmission rates for each of the four S-I pair combinations. All transmission rates rose initially with time and then declined, with overall lower rates for the more resistant mustard species. However, the interspecies transmission rates were unexpectedly high. We show how these rates relate to relative changes in infectivity and susceptibility of each host species, and how a species that is weakly susceptible in a pure stand can still act as a strong donor of disease in a mixture, thereby lowering the efficacy of the mixture to reduce disease.

In our study, 30-cm peat cores were removed from an ombrotrophic bog in boreal, continental western Canada. Surface vegetation in the cores remained intact and included a continuous bryophyte cover dominated by Sphagnum fuscum. In addition, some cores were collected such that either ericaceous shrubs (Ledum groenlandicum) or sedges (Eriophorum vaginatum) were present. We investigated how the presence of each vegetation type influenced soil respiration and the microbial mineralization of root exudates using a pulse 14C labeling of vegetation in the intact peat cores. The role of root biomass and root respiration in CO2 emission and C allocation was quantified for each type of vegetation and compared through both measurement and modeling. Our results show that vascular plants contributed 35-57% of total CO2 efflux from the peat surface, primarily derived from rhizosphere processes, including root respiration as well as microbial mineralization of root exudates.

Thus, if a herbivore could detoxify a PSM faster, it might eat more. This theory has been difficult to test because the mechanisms by which herbivores detoxify most PSMs are largely unknown. We investigated whether common brushtail possums alter aspects of their feeding in response to an increased capacity to detoxify benzoic acid, a common PSM. Animals detoxify benzoic acid primarily by conjugating it with glycine to form benzoyl glycine (hippuric acid). Therefore, adding glycine to a diet that contains benzoic acid provides a simple way to study how detoxification constrains feeding in mammals. Brushtail possums offered supplementary glycine metabolized benzoate faster and, in response, ate more. Furthermore, when given a choice, brushtail possums selected a diet containing both benzoate and glycine over diets with a high concentration of just one of these supplements. The possums' aversion to glycine may explain why their ability to select a favorable diet combination from feeders containing diets with each of the supplements seemed less acute: they preferred diets containing benzoate alone over those containing glycine and did not mix their diet even though it would have allowed them to eat more benzoate and thus more food. Administering the anti-emetic drug, ondansetron (a specific 5-HT3 receptor antagonist), did not alter the amount eaten of diets containing benzoate, glycine, or both, suggesting that 5-HT3 receptors do not regulate benzoate or glycine intake. The results show that common brushtail possums recognize changes in their detoxification capacity and alter their feeding response accordingly. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",53,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Benzoic acid | Detoxification | Herbivore | Plant secondary metabolite | Serotonin,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,186,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study sampled patches of shell debris and the surrounding sediment at increasing distances from the patches to determine the role of the patches in driving beta biodiversity. Sampling was conducted at three similar sites within 1 km in a marine reserve in New Zealand. The shell debris significantly affected beta diversity at all sites, although the magnitude of the effect was dependent on patch size, density, and debris particle size.

It is of particular interest in the Arctic, due to recent warming trends and anticipated continued warming for the region. This long-term, multispecies study confirms that changes in temperature affect the functioning of plants in their natural environment. It also demonstrates that the influence of temperature should be considered in the context of natural variability within a given location. The study examined natural temperature gradients, interannual climate variation, and experimental warming at sites near Barrow (71®18' N, 156°40' W) and Atqasuk (70°29' N, 157°25' W) in northern Alaska, USA.

The response of seven traits from 32 plant species occurring in at least one site is reported when there were at least three years of recordings. Plants responded to temperature in 49% of the measured traits of a species in a site. The most common response to warming was earlier phenological development and increased growth and reproductive effort. However, the total response of a species, for all traits examined, was individualistic and varied among sites. In 14% of the documented responses, the plant trait was correlated with thawing degree-day totals from snowmelt (TDDsm), and temperature was considered the dominant factor. In 35% of the documented responses, the plant trait responded to warming, but the interannual variation in the trait was not correlated with TDDsm and temperature was considered subordinate to other factors. The abundance of temperature responses that were considered subordinate to other factors suggests that prediction of plant response to temperature that does not account for natural variability may overestimate the importance of temperature and lead to unrealistic projections of the rate of vegetation change due to climate warming. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",94,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Alaska | Arctic | Climate warming | Degree-days | Experimental warming | Growth | Interannual climate variation | Natural gradients | Phenology | Plant response | Reproductive effort | Tundra,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,191,NA,NA,NA,NA

Female pigs build reproductive nests out of understory vegetation; at Pasoh these nests are constructed primarily of woody saplings several meters tall that pigs snap or uproot, causing substantial local damage. We documented the prevalence of nest building by pigs at Pasoh within a 25-ha area from 1995 to 1998 and investigated the impacts of this mammalian behavior on the understory plant community. In total, 643 pig nests were enumerated, providing an estimate that 6.0 nests·ha-1·yr-1 were constructed in the survey area.

Despite the large number of studies that have examined the effect of emergence time on different components of plant fitness (survival, growth, and/or fecundity), the potential evolutionary response to selection on seedling emergence date is still poorly known. In this study, we review 55 of those studies by a random-effects meta-analysis, considering the phylogenetic relatedness among taxa. We test the following hypotheses: (1) early emergence increases seedling survival, growth, and fecundity, (2) early emergence is more advantageous to large-seeded species than to small-seeded ones, as the former can compensate for the lower number of seeds by increasing seedling survival, (3) perennial plants benefit more than annuals from early emergence, as the iteroparity of the former allows them to risk seedling emergence to the best conditions each year, whereas the semelparity of the latter forces them to spread the risk of emergence over time, and (4) the effect of emergence time may depend upon the experimental conditions (field vs. controlled experiments in a greenhouse or laboratory). Our results show that early emergence differentially affects components of plant fitness, with no effect on seedling survival but large benefits to seedling growth and fecundity. Such effects vary depending upon intrinsic factors like seed size or life-form, and also upon methodology (census time and experimental conditions). Large-seeded species gain from emerging early by growing more during their first growing seasons, although they survive and reproduce similarly to small-seeded species. The survival benefit of early emergence is greater in perennial than in annual species, thus supporting hypothesis 3. The relationship between emergence time and seedling growth appears to be stronger under controlled conditions than in the field, probably as a result of the unlimited nutrient and water resources of the former. In field conditions, in contrast, limited resources probably decelerate the growth of early seedlings, precluding the detection of differences between these and late seedlings. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",290,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Comparative method | Life-form | Meta-analysis | Phylogenetic signal | Seed size | Seedling emergence,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,195,NA,NA,NA,NA

Along the Atlantic Coast of the United States, low-latitude salt marsh plants are less palatable than high-latitude conspecifics. To test the hypothesis that latitudinal variation in palatability would occur in the absence of geographically different environmental cues (i.e., that differences in palatability are constitutive rather than induced by climate or herbivore damage), we grew high- and low-latitude individuals of three species of salt marsh plants from seeds (Solidago sempervirens) or rhizome cuttings (Distichlis spicata and Spartina alterniflora) in a common-garden greenhouse environment, and compared their palatability to herbivores over time. We also quantified leaf toughness and nitrogen content over time in order to help explain results of feeding assays. High-latitude plants were always more palatable to herbivores than low-latitude conspecifics. Latitudinal variation in plant traits depended on the plant species. Toughness varied as a function of latitude for Spartina, with low-latitude plants being consistently tougher than high-latitude conspecifics. For all generations of Spartina, and for seed-propagated Solidago, high-latitude plants had a higher nitrogen content than low-latitude conspecifics. The fact that latitudinal differences in palatability and traits of salt marsh plants persisted in a common-garden environment suggests that this variation is constitutive, and likely under genetic control, rather than a plastic response to environmental cues. These results are consistent with the theory that latitudinal differences in herbivory have selected for geographical variation in plant palatability, although we cannot rule out other selective forces that may also vary across latitude. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",70,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Biogeography | Common-garden experiment | Herbivory | Latitude | Plant-herbivore interactions | Salt marsh,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,196,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although time series analysis has helped to validate the relative importance of these two explanations, very little of this theory has been confirmed by experiment. Here, we demonstrate the dual synchronizing effect of dispersal and temporal environmental variation. We used an experimental model system based on the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus and its algal prey Chlorella vulgaris. We constructed temporal prey fluctuations with two periodic components that matched the generation time and life span of the rotifer. By varying the amplitude of these two periods we created prey variability with ""white"" (both periods had equal power) and ""red"" (the longest period had greatest power) spectra. In the absence of dispersal only the red fluctuations induced synchrony in the population dynamics of the rotifer. Dispersal had a strong and rapid synchronizing effect. The combination of red (but not white) fluctuations and dispersal resulted in the highest levels of synchrony. These results confirm the predictions of recent theory, but they also suggest that the temporal structure of environmental variability determines its capacity to synchronize population dynamics over large spatial scales. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",43,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Dispersal | Environmental variability | Microcosm | Moran effect | Predator-prey dynamics | Synchrony,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,198,NA,NA,NA,NA

We tested the hypothesis that the mutualistic association between fire ants and aphids enhances the impact of fire ants on the herbivorous and predaceous arthropod community of cotton. We found that the presence of aphids attracted foraging fire ants onto cotton plants. This shift from ground to foliar foraging resulted in more frequent interactions between fire ants and arthropods associated with cotton. The survival of herbivores (caterpillars) and predators (ladybird beetles and lacewings) was lower in the presence of fire ants and aphids compared with fire ants alone in greenhouse experiments. Similarly, fire ants and aphids deterred plant bugs from spending time on cotton foliage. Using large-scale field manipulations of fire ants along with naturally occurring aphid populations, we found that the ant-aphid mutualism accounted for much of the variation underlying ant impact on cotton herbivores and predators. For example, in 2001, ∼27% of herbivore taxa and 54% of predator taxa were adversely affected by the mutualism. The overall community response, however, was highly conditional with strong temporal variation in the effects of the ant-aphid association. Our results indicate that the relationship between fire ants and aphids serves as a key interaction that alters the structure of cotton arthropod communities.

From a single-trait perspective, we highlight that it is becoming clear that some trait types do not display significant levels of genetic variation, and we raise the possibility that species with restricted ranges may differ qualitatively from more widespread species in levels of genetic variance in ecologically important traits.

Yet, increased efficiency with declining soil nutrients has not been demonstrated empirically in lowland tropical rain forests, where plant growth is thought to be strongly limited by soil nutrients, especially phosphorus (P). We tested for higher P uptake and use efficiency across a 16-fold soil P gradient in lowland Borneo by measuring the P content of aboveground net primary productivity (fine litter production plus new tree growth; ANPP) for 24 months. Extractable soil P was positively related to litter production, tree growth, and ANPP. Efficiency of P response (ANPP/available soil P), uptake (P uptake/available soil P), and use (ANPP/P uptake) increased monotonically with declining soil P and was significantly higher on P-rich soil than P-poor soil. Increased P uptake and use efficiency with declining soil P enabled higher than expected plant productivity on low P soils and thus strongly influenced spatial patterns of aboveground productivity throughout this lowland landscape. A complementary P use efficiency index, the integrated canopy P (Pc) use efficiency of production (ANPP/Pc x residence time of P c), was similar across the P gradient, but underlying dynamics varied significantly with soil P: on rich soils, ANPP/Pc was high and Pc residence time was low, while the converse held on poor soils. These contrasting strategies enabled rapid tree growth on nutrient-rich soils, where P limitation is relatively weak, and higher P conservation on nutrient-poor soils, where P limitation is relatively strong.

In this paper, we report results from a three-year study on the effects of replicated experimental burns in summer (wet) vs. winter (dry) seasons, on vital rates of Chamaecrista keyensis, a narrowly endemic understory perennial herb of pine rockland forests of the Lower Florida Keys. C. keyensis in the burned treatments had lower first-year survival than in unburned treatments, and plants in the summer-burn treatments had lower first-year postburn survival than those in the winter-burn treatments. These annual survival patterns, however, were reversed by the third year postfire, when plants in summer-burn plots had the highest survival. The number of plants lost due to winter, but not summer fires, was replenished to the control unburned population level by three years postburn. Fires, particularly summer fires, stimulated vegetative growth of C. keyensis. In addition, summer- and winter-burn treatments each stimulated C. keyensis fruit production when compared to unburned treatments. In general, plants that existed before the fires had greater annual survival and fruit production, but smaller vegetative growth, than plants that came into existence after the fires. These two cohorts of plants have nonetheless similar responses to the three fire treatments. The winter-burn treatments produced greater seedling recruitment than the summer-burn or control treatments over three years postburn. Slight differences in the timing of burns within the wet season caused large differences in the demographic responses of C. keyensis, suggesting that the definition of summer season vs. winter season might be too broad for management purposes. Overall, winter burns and early summer burns had advantages over late summer burns and no-burn treatments. This suggests that C. keyensis may have evolved under a fire regime that included lightning-caused early summer burns, as well as non-lightning winter burns. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",11,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Chamaecrista keyensis | Conservation biology | Disturbance ecology | Endemic species | Fabaceae | Fire ecology | Historical fire regime | Lower Florida Keys | Pine rockland | Plant demography | Seasonal timing of fire | Vital rates,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,202,NA,NA,NA,NA

We raised isofemale lines from three populations from different climate regimes (high- and low-elevation rivers and an estuary) in a split-brood, common-garden design in three temperatures. We measured life history and growth traits and calculated population growth rate (as a measure of fitness) using an age-structured projection matrix model. We found a strong effect of temperature on all traits, but no evidence for divergence in the average level of traits among populations. Levels of genetic variation and significant reaction norm divergence for life history traits suggested some role for adaptation. Plasticity varied among traits and was lowest for size and reproductive traits compared to age-related traits and fitness. Plasticity in fitness was intermediate, suggesting that invasive populations are not general-purpose genotypes with respect to the range of temperatures studied.

However, species differ in fundamental niche optima; thus the intensity of stress is relative among species and important only in the context of these relative differences. We tested the hypothesis that the facilitative response of a species is relative to how much abiotic conditions deviate from the optimum conditions for that particular species (stress), and the competitive ""response"" ability of the species (i.e., its ability to tolerate the inhibitory effects of neighbors). In a field experiment, we examined the responses of three co-occurring species with different ecological optima, Bromus erectus, Brachypodium rupestre, and Arrhenatherum elatius, to the alleviation of a primary limiting resource (water), and to biotic interactions in a mesoxeric grassland in eastern France. We found that A. elatius had a strong positive response to watering, the response of B. rupestre was moderately positive, and B. erectus did not respond significantly, suggesting that water stress was only important for the first two species. Most importantly, the net outcome of the interaction between each species and its neighbors depended on the degree of water stress it experienced in its natural habitat. For survival, in the control plots we found no significant interactions for B. erectus (not stressed) whereas B. rupestre and A. elatius (stressed species) were facilitated. Enhancing water availability suppressed facilitation of B. rupestre and A. elatius and led to competitive exclusion of B. erectus. In contrast to survival, there was no facilitation for growth in the control plots, and competition intensity increased for all three species with watering. In our experiment the competitive response of a species was inverse to its ability to tolerate stress, indicating a trade-off between these components of the species response.

Here, we searched for evidence of spatially density-dependent predation on the continuous reefs of the Netherlands Antilles in a study of a dominant planktivore, the blue chromis (Chromis cyanea). Across space, we quantified both the patterns of loss from site-attached aggregations of C. cyanea through time and the behavioral reaction of predators to these aggregations. Looking across C. cyanea densities, we found that loss from aggregations was not characteristic of direct density dependence, but instead was commonly inversely related to density. Individual C. cyanea in larger aggregations were less likely to be lost from the group than were individuals in smaller aggregations. Thus, the observed density dependence increased spatial heterogeneity of C. cyanea. Predators showed behaviors that were consistent with these demographic patterns. Using remote videography, we quantified predator visitation and strike rates across a range of C. cyanea aggregation sizes. Predators consistently visited and struck at individuals in C. cyanea aggregations in a pattern that was strongly inversely density dependent, suggesting that aggregation is an effective means of minimizing per capita risk of predation for prey reef fish.

We found that sites with comparatively mild climates have greater plant biomass, and at these sites strong competition corresponds with overdispersed distribution of plants, reducing intraspecific patchiness and in turn increasing local richness. Sites with cold climates have little biomass, and at these sites a high proportion of species benefit from strong facilitative effects of neighbors, leading to an aggregated distribution of plants. Sites with intermediate, or relatively moderate climates are intermediate in biomass, and at these sites interactions are weak (or competition may be counterbalanced by facilitation), corresponding with a nearly random distribution of plants. At these sites species richness is lower than average. We propose that the relationship between interspecific spatial pattern and community richness reflects niche differentiation and/or construction, which allows for the coexistence of more species than would be possible with random, unstructured spatial distributions.

We investigate consequences of such variation in intake on growth and growth efficiency (growth per unit intake) in juvenile hybrid striped bass. We observed, after statistically accounting for the effects of total consumption and initial body size, that individuals receiving a low ration followed by a higher ration (the fluctuating ration) grew faster than individuals receiving a temporally constant ration (the normal ration). To interpret this increase in growth efficiency, we consider a set of alternative models representing different physiological hypotheses of the growth process. Using a simple growth model, an analytical result shows that the fluctuating ration as typically applied in experiments (a low ration followed by a high ration), independent of any change in physiology, increases growth efficiency relative to individuals on the normal ration. Growth efficiency increases because cumulative maintenance costs are lower for individuals that stay small initially and then grow rapidly in comparison to individuals that grow steadily. Further, a statistical analysis of alternative models inferred that fish receiving a variable ration show higher assimilation and/or conversion efficiencies of food and lower mass-specific maintenance costs. Our analysis suggests that the lower cumulative maintenance costs incurred over a time interval with low consumption followed by high consumption act in association with higher assimilation-conversion efficiencies, and lower overall mass-specific maintenance costs to increase growth efficiency in hybrid striped bass. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",44,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Bioenergetics | Compensatory growth | Energy budget model | Experiment | Hybrid striped bass,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,212,NA,NA,NA,NA

In general, bias in estimated survival was greatest when nests were most likely to be discovered late in the nesting cycle. Assuming that hatching and fledging events occur at the midpoint of an observation, or with uniform probability during an observation, also resulted in large biases.

This illustrates the importance of including information on temporal trends in population size when assessing the viability of a population. We used these relationships to examine whether time to extinction can be predicted from interspecific life history variation. Two alternative hypotheses were examined. (1) Time to extinction should decrease with increasing clutch size or decreasing survival rate because of the larger stochastic components in the population dynamics of such species. (2) Time to extinction should increase with decreasing clutch size or longer life expectancy if extinction rates are most strongly influenced by variation in the specific population growth rate. In the present data set, time to extinction increased with decreasing clutch size because of larger stochastic influences on the population dynamics of species with large clutch sizes located toward the fast end of the ""slow-fast continuum"" of life history variation.

Data for uncommon or rare species will be presence/absence data or counts of abundance that contain a greater number of zero observations than would be predicted using standard, unimodal statistical distributions. Such data are generally referred to as zero-inflated data and require specialized methods for statistical analysis. Statistical approaches to modeling zero-inflated data include nonstandard mixture models; two-part, conditional models; and birth process models. In this paper, we briefly summarize two of these methods and illustrate the two-part, conditional approach to the problem of modeling count data with extra zeros. An advantage of this approach includes separate fits and separate interpretations of both components of count data; that is to say, the presence/absence component and the abundance component (given presence) can be analyzed separately. This can be valuable not only for simplicity, but also such a two-step method may assist ecological understanding in cases where the basis for species presence might be separated from the underlying reasons affecting the population size of that species at those sites where it is present. We present two case studies of the application of the two-part conditional model for modeling count data with extra zeros. One deals with modeling relationships between counts of the rare and endangered arboreal marsupial, Leadbeater's possum (Gymnobelideus leadbeateri) and habitat variables in the wet eucalypt forests of southeastern Australia.

In this study, we explored the function of scent-marking at latrines by coastal river otters (Lontra canadensis), through investigating spatial distributions of otters with respect to gender, sociality, and the distribution of their food resources. We then calculated the amounts of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) transported to latrine sites based on otter foraging behavior and the function of scent-marking at latrines. Locations of 55 radio-tagged otters in Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA, were obtained through aerial telemetry over a period of four years. Data on fish densities and marine habitat features were concurrently obtained from scuba transects and aerial surveys. A plastic social organization in river otters resulted in different foraging strategies and scent-marking behaviors. Social otters were more closely associated with schooling fishes and used latrines for intra-group communication, whereas nonsocial otters, which concentrated on intertidal and subtidal fishes, probably signaled mutual avoidance. In contrast, females appeared to use latrines for the defense of territories. Social otters used fewer sites with greater intensity, whereas nonsocial otters used more sites with lower intensity. These different functions of scent-marking and associated behaviors of otters resulted in high variability in nutrient inputs to different latrine sites.

In a three-year free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment, two species of 30-year-old alpine conifers (Larix decidua and Pinus uncinata) were studied to test this hypothesis in situ in the Swiss Central Alps (2180 m above sea level). CO2 enrichment was combined with foliage removal to test the effect of altered source-sink relationships on tree growth and leaf level responses. Elevated CO2 enhanced photosynthesis and increased nonstructural carbohydrate (NSC) concentrations in the needles of both species. While the deciduous larch trees showed longer needles and a stimulation of shoot growth over all three seasons when grown in situ under elevated CO2, pine trees showed no such responses. Irrespective of CO2 concentration, defoliation in both species stimulated photosynthesis and increased stomatal conductance in remaining current-year needles in the treatment year and reduced leaf nitrogen concentration in the year following defoliation. Defoliated larch trees had fewer and shorter needles with reduced NSC concentrations in the year following defoliation and showed no stimulation in shoot elongation when exposed to elevated CO2. In contrast, defoliation of evergreen pine trees had no effect on needle NSC concentrations, but stimulated shoot elongation when defoliated trees were exposed to elevated CO2. After three years, our results suggest that deciduous larch is carbon limited at treeline, while evergreen pine is not. However, as indicated by the defoliation treatment, the carbon economy of these trees can clearly be modified by extreme events. The expected changes in growth of these treeline trees with improving carbon availability as atmospheric CO2 continues to increase will thus depend on both the interplay between biotic and abiotic processes, and the species or tree functional types involved. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",115,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Alpine | Biodiversity | Elevated CO 2 | Larix decidua | Pinus uncinata | Shoot growth | Source-sink balance | Timberline,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,228,NA,NA,NA,NA

We addressed these assumptions with data from six grassland sites using univariate and multivariate analyses of a variety of indices (species evenness, richness, rarity, dominance, and Simpson's diversity index). Univariate correlations between plant species evenness and richness were weak and negative at each site. Principal-component analyses consistently revealed two significant components of variation in diversity. Richness and evenness were largely orthogonal, with Simpson's diversity loading between them.

However, most techniques for estimating detection probability require moderate sample sizes, which may not be achievable when studying rare species. In order to improve the reliability of inferences from studies of rare species, we suggest two general approaches that researchers may wish to consider that incorporate the concept of imperfect detectability; (1) borrowing information about detectability or the other quantities of interest from other times, places, or species; and (2) using state variables other than abundance (e.g., species richness and occupancy).

An overview of this theory is provided, with emphasis on recent developments that both make more efficient use of the available data on extremes and enable applications that are more ecologically realistic. Consistent with the emphasis on scale in ecology, scaling properties of extremes are emphasized. It is argued that the existence of distributions whose extreme upper tail is ""heavy"" (i.e., decreases at a relatively slow rate) implies that ecological disturbances are sometimes regarded as more ""surprising"" than they ought to be. The application focuses on modeling disturbances in paleoecology. Two examples are considered: the first, a sediment yield time series for Nicolay Lake in the high Arctic, reflects only the influence of hydrologic disturbances; the second, a sediment rate time series in the Chesapeake Bay, includes both climatic and anthropogenic influences. Strong evidence supports a heavy-tailed distribution for the Nicolay Lake sediment yield, but not necessarily for the Chesapeake Bay sediment rates.

Although these indirect effects have been shown to mediate trophic cascades in ecological communities, our understanding of how habitat refuge influences the strength and direction of cascading effects is limited. We examined whether or not oyster toadfish (top predator) affect mud crab (intermediate predator) foraging on juvenile hard clams (infaunal prey) in oyster reefs, a physically complex habitat that can provide refuge for both intermediate predators and basal prey. In particular, we manipulated toadfish presence in mesocosms containing experimental oyster reefs and quantified both mud crab and juvenile clam mortality. Toadfish significantly reduced mud crab foraging on clams and increased clam survivorship even though mud crabs foraging on the surface of the reef sought refuge from toadfish deeper within the oyster-shell matrix where they were more proximal to clams. This counterintuitive result suggests that toadfish suppression of mud crab foraging activity is far stronger than toadfish-avoidance behavior that potentially increases crab-clam encounter rates. Therefore, TMIIs can reinforce trophic cascades even in refuge habitats where intermediate predators and their prey are physically isolated from top predators.

The design of the experiment permits one to assess the influence of patch size and landscape position on successional dynamics. The general trajectory of succession follows that typical of succession in much of the eastern United States. In the initial years of the study, there was relatively little effect of patch size or distance to sources.

Temporal stability in community composition has generally been greater in large patches. Spatial heterogeneity in community composition has increased during succession, but with different patterns in large and small patches.

The progress of such efforts is determined by the logical coherence among central concepts, theories, and predictions on one hand, and experimental design, statistical analyses, and interpretation of results on the other. Here, we specifically explore an example of how differences in the way ecological concepts are defined lead to differences in the formulation and statistical testing of hypotheses and ultimately to differences in conclusions about the relative importance of ecological processes. In marine intertidal habitats, the notion that wave exposure has an important structuring role is widely agreed upon. Nevertheless, generalizations about its effects and use for accurate prediction of assemblages are often limited. This may partly be explained by the frequent use of categorical rather than quantitative definitions of wave exposure. We compared the conclusions about the importance of wave exposure from (1) analyses of variance based on relative classification of wave exposure and geographic location to those of (2) regression analyses based on continuous measures from 16 locations on the Swedish west coast. Variability in richness was substantially better explained by the regression analyses, while for the cover of individual taxa there was no consistent difference between the two analytical approaches in terms of explained variability. The two approaches detected significant spatial patterns for the same taxa, but conclusions about the nature of these patterns were often divergent. Categorical analyses of relative measures of wave exposure and geographic location indicated that interactive effects and differences between geographic areas were predominant. Regression analyses of absolute, continuous measures suggested that mean significant wave height was a better predictor than geographic location and interactive terms. Thus, the choice of definition of wave exposure has important consequences for how causes of spatial patterns of intertidal assemblages are perceived. Categorical analyses appear to provide clearer indications as to which factors are important while the use of continuous predictors sometimes provides a better fit to the data.

We analyze from a statistical physics perspective the network structure of model food webs and of 15 community food webs from a variety of environments, including freshwater, marine, estuarine, and terrestrial environments. We perform a theoretical analysis of two recently proposed models for food webs, the niche model of R. J. Williams and N. D. Martinez and the nested-hierarchy model of M.-F. Cattin et al. We find that the two models generate distributions of numbers of prey, predators, and links that are described by the same analytical expressions. Our analytical treatment reveals that a model's capacity to reproduce empirical data is principally determined by its ability to satisfy two conditions: (1) the species' niche values form a totally ordered set and (2) each species has a specific exponentially decaying probability of preying on a given fraction of the species with lower niche values. To test this hypothesis, we generalize the cascade model of J. E. Cohen and C. M. Newman so that it satisfies condition 2 and find that the new model is able to reproduce the properties of empirical food webs, validating our hypothesis. We use our analytical predictions as a guide to the analysis of 15 of the most complete empirical food webs available. We demonstrate that the quantitative unifying patterns that describe the properties of the food-web models considered earlier also describe the majority of the empirical webs considered. We find good agreement between the empirical data and the models for the average distance between species and the average clustering coefficient.

Here I examine how population extinction risk is affected by variation in the underlying individual phenotypes, using a branching-process approach. I define the long-term individual extinction risk as the chance of ultimately leaving no descendants, and the cumulative individual extinction risk as the chance of leaving no descendants by a specified time. I use these to show that if there is a phenotypic correlation between parents and their offspring, variation in these quantities always reduces both the long- and short-term population extinction risk. Such variation in individual extinction risk arises from individual variation in demographic parameters and may have both genetic and environmental causes. Using a well-known approximation of the difference between the log arithmetic and log geometric means, I derive expressions for the sensitivity and elasticity of the approximate log extinction risk to changes in the mean and variance of the individual extinction risk, and to changes in population size. One conclusion is that increasing the variance among individuals in extinction risk can sometimes be at least as important in reducing population extinction risk as increasing the population size itself.

We investigated the spatial and temporal dynamics of pine (Pinus ponderosa) food webs that included the omnivorous ant, Formica podzolica, using direct observation and stable isotopes. Formica podzolica is a predator of herbivorous and predatory arthropods, and a mutualist with some aphids. Observations in 2001 of foragers showed that in early summer (June) ants fed upon equal parts non-mutualist herbivores (31% prey biomass), mutualist aphids (27%), and predators (42%); ant trophic position was thus between that of primary and secondary predator (trophic level = 3.4). In late summer (September), ant feeding remained relatively constant upon non-mutualist herbivores (53%) and mutualist aphids (43%), but ant feeding upon predators fell (4%), thus shifting ant trophic position to that of a primary predator (trophic level = 3.0). Feeding on honeydew increased from 25% of ants in early summer to 55% in late summer. By increasing the frequency of their interactions with mutualist aphids, ants maintained a constant supply of arthropod prey through the summer, despite a two-thirds decline in arthropod biomass in pine canopies. Stable isotope analysis (δ15N, δ13C) of six pine food webs dispersed over 150 ha placed ant trophic level at 3.3 for early summer in 2002. There was significant variation among these trees in ant trophic position (range 3.2-3.6), but no indication of positive spatial autocorrelation.

Despite this biased sampling, the Horvitz-Thompson estimator for adaptive cluster sampling provides unbiased estimates of population means or totals, and variances of those estimates.

We investigated whether the observed trophic cascade might have a behavioral basis by exploring environmental factors influencing the movements of 13 female elk equipped with GPS radio collars. We developed a simple statistical approach that can unveil the concurrent influence of several environmental features on animal movements. Paths of elk traveling on their winter range were broken down into steps, which correspond to the straight-line segment between successive locations at 5-hour intervals. Each observed step was paired with 200 random steps having the same starting point, but differing in length and/or direction. Comparisons between the characteristics of observed and random steps using conditional logistic regression were used to model environmental features influencing movement patterns. We found that elk movements were influenced by multiple factors, such as the distance from roads, the presence of a steep slope along the step, and the cover type in which they ended. The influence of cover type on elk movements depended on the spatial distribution of wolves across the northern winter range of the park. In low wolf-use areas, the relative preference for end point locations of steps followed: aspen stands > open areas > conifer forests. As the risks of wolf encounter increased, the preference of elk for aspen stands gradually decreased, and selection became strongest for steps ending in conifer forests in high wolf-use areas.

To understand the factors that regulate the success of alien plant species we sampled alien plant biomass and species composition in 66 sites representing a wide variety of habitat types within Bruce Peninsula National Park, Ontario, Canada. We quantified the response of existing alien biomass to a suite of habitat variables including habitat productivity, standing biomass, species richness, soil nutrients and disturbance factors. Standing biomass in the sites varied from O to nearly 60 000 g/m2 and annual productivity ranged from O to nearly 800 g·m-2·yr-1. The response of both absolute and relative alien biomass (dominance) to the independent variables was assessed using univariate plots and multivariate canonical correspondence analysis. The results show that total standing alien biomass and site disturbance history can predict alien dominance, but other factors including primary productivity, nutrient levels, and site species richness cannot. In the multivariate analysis, species composition of both aliens and natives was best explained by nutrient levels, disturbance type, biomass, and, to a lesser extent, productivity.

In this study, I examined the effect of termite assemblage composition and abundance on decomposition of wood litter of an indigenous species (Croton megalobotrys) in five terrestrial habitats of the highly seasonal semiarid Okavango Delta region of northern Botswana, to determine whether natural variation in decomposer community composition and abundance influences decomposition rates. 1 conducted the study in two areas, Xudum and Santawani, with the Xudum study preceding the Santawani study. I assessed termite assemblage composition and abundance using a grid of survey baits (rolls of toilet paper) placed on the soil surface and checked 2-4 times/month. I placed a billet (a section of wood litter) next to each survey bait and measured decomposition in a plot by averaging the mass loss of its billets. Decomposition rates varied up to sixfold among plots within the same habitat and locality, despite the fact that these plots experienced the same climate. In addition, billets decomposed significantly faster during the cooler and drier Santawani study, contradicting climate-based predictions. Because termite incidence was generally higher in Santawani plots, termite abundance initially seemed a likely determinant of decomposition in this system. However, no significant effect of termite incidence on billet mass loss rates was observed among the Xudum plots, where decomposition rates remained low even though termite incidence varied considerably. Considering the incidences of fungus-growing termites and non-fungus-growing termites separately resolves this apparent contradiction: in both Santawani and Xudum, only fungus-growing termites play a significant role in decomposition. This result is mirrored in an analysis of the full data set of combined Xudum and Santawani data. The determination that natural variation in the abundance of a single taxonomic group of soil fauna, a termite subfamily, determines almost all observed variation in decomposition rates supports the emerging view that biotic influences may be important in many biomes and that consideration of decomposer community composition and abundance may be critical for accurate prediction of decomposition rates. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",66,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Botswana | Community composition | Decomposition | Ecosystem function | Macrotermitinae | Mopane woodland | Okavango Delta | Savanna | Termites | Termitomyces,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,245,NA,NA,NA,NA

One approach is to infer habitat selection processes from differences in population densities between habitats using methods such as isodar and isoleg analysis. Another approach is to directly observe the movements of individuals. However, habitat selection models based on movement data often fail to adequately incorporate spatial processes. This is problematic if the probability of selecting a particular habitat is dependent upon its spatial context. This would occur, for example, where organisms exhibit home range behavior and the choice of habitat is dependent on its location relative to the home range. In this paper we present a spatially explicit habitat selection model for movement data that incorporates home range behavior as a spatial process. Our approach extends a previous model by formulating the probability of selecting a habitat as a function of its distance from the animal's current location and home range center. We demonstrate that these enhancements lead to more parsimonious models when applied to a koala radiotracking data set from eastern Australia.

It is generally thought that such hatching plasticity involves a trade-off between embryonic and hatchling predation risk, e.g., hatching early to escape egg predation comes at the cost of increased vulnerability to hatchling predators. However, most empirical work has focused on simply detecting predator-induced hatching responses or on the short-term consequences of hatching plasticity. Short-term studies may not allow sufficient time for hatchlings to exhibit compensatory responses, which may extend to subsequent life stages and could alter the nature of the trade-offs associated with hatching plasticity. In this study, we examine the consequences of predator-induced hatching plasticity through the larval stage to metamorphosis in the East African reed frog, Hyperolius spinigularis. To do this we conducted an experiment in which we manipulated initial larval size and density (mimicking the effects of egg predators) and the presence of aquatic predators. We expected that predator-induced hatchlings (because they are less developed and smaller) would experience higher per capita predation rates and a longer larval period and thus would exhibit lower survival to metamorphosis in the presence of aquatic predators than larger, more developed, later hatched larvae. Surprisingly, we found that predator-induced hatchlings survived better, not worse, than hatchlings from undisturbed clutches. These results motivated us to develop a model parameterized from additional experiments to explore whether a combination of mechanisms, compensatory growth, and density- and size-specific predation, could give rise to this pattern. Predicted survival probabilities from the model with compensatory growth were consistent with those from the field experiment: early hatched larvae grew more rapidly through vulnerable size classes than later hatched larvae, resulting in higher survival at metamorphosis. Thus, in this system, there does not appear to be a trade-off in vulnerability between egg and larval predators. Instead, our results suggest that the cost that balances the survival benefit of hatching early to evade egg predators arises later in the life history, as a result of smaller size at metamorphosis. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",73,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Compensatory growth | Density-mediated indirect interaction (DMII) | Functional response | Hatching plasticity | Hyperolius spinigularis | Multiple predators | Phenotypic plasticity | Size-selective predation | Trait-mediated indirect interaction (TMII),20308,undefined,0,FALSE,247,NA,NA,NA,NA

Parasitic Jaegers (Stercorarius parasiticus) breeding in Shetland, United Kingdom, have declined substantially in numbers over the last 15 years, although the causes of this decline remain unclear. By carrying out a supplementary feeding experiment during the chick-rearing period, we tested the hypothesis that food availability has contributed to this decline. Data were collected on adult territory attendance, chick growth rates, and breeding success during the experimental season, and adult return rates, body condition, and laying dates during the following season. Differences in carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in the natural and supplementary food, analyzed in the chicks' feathers, showed that chicks received one-fifth of their protein requirements from the supplementary food, but this amount varied between broods. Compared with controls, supplemented pairs showed higher attendance on the territory, improved breeding success, and higher return rate. This emphasizes that adult return rate is more sensitive to food availability than has been assumed previously. Control birds may have maintained too high a current reproductive effort at the expense of future reproduction, perhaps due to the unpredictability, of their main food source, sandeels, which seemed abundant early in the season but scarce during chick rearing.

We tested for variation in the nature and intensity of interactions between Eucalyptus saligna and nitrogen-fixing Falcataria mollucana along a gradient of soil nitrogen and phosphorus supply in Hawaii, USA. Neighborhood indexes were used to describe competitive and facilitative interactions between trees, and spatially explicit models of individual tree growth and survival were developed to look at the effects of soil nutrient supply on those interactions. The dynamics between neighboring trees depended strongly on soil nutrient supply. Large trees generally grew faster than smaller trees, but this pattern was moderated by interactions between nutrient availability and the intensity of competition and facilitation. Falcataria survival decreased by up to 30% with increasing Eucalyptus on low-nitrogen soils, but increased by nearly 70% on soils with higher nitrogen levels. Intraspecific interactions reduced Falcataria growth by up to 100% on high-phosphorus soils, yet facilitated the growth of focal trees growing on low-phosphorus soils by up to 60%. The effect of Falcataria neighbors on Eucalyptus growth also depended on phosphorus supply: increased Falcataria reduced predicted growth of the focal tree by 20% on low-phosphorus soils, but increased growth by 8% on high-phosphorus soils. Relationships between species were more dynamic at the scale of individual trees than previously indicated by stand-level assessments.

Annual survival of birds sampled earlier in the season, however, generally declined with increasing corticosterone level. More birds than expected, given the survival functions, had the very low corticosterone levels in nonfumigated colonies later in the year, suggesting perhaps a compensatory benefit unrelated to survival for very low corticosterone levels.

Variable annual seedfall will, however, reduce this probability when post-dispersal seed fate is negatively density dependent on the local density of seeds, and seed dispersal and density dependence act identically across years. Intuitively, more variable annual seedfall causes the representative seed to experience a greater density of conspecific seeds and suffer greater density-dependent effects. This handicap must be overcome for the per seed probability of recruitment to be greater in years with greater seed production. We quantified spatial and annual variation in seedfall and seedling recruitment, evaluated density dependence and economies of scale during the seed-to-seedling transition, and investigated the synergistic consequences of density dependence and variable annual seedfall for seedling recruitment on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Weekly censuses of 200 0.5-m2 seed traps documented seedfall for 15 years and 108 plant species. Annual censuses of 600 1-m2 seedling plots documented recruitment for nine years and 32 species.

Many studies have shown that adult cowbirds directly cause host offspring mortalities. Cowbird young may indirectly cause additional mortalities by increasing competition in the nest. The sex ratio of surviving host offspring will be skewed if one sex is a poorer competitor and thus more likely to die.

We computed analytic approximations of the expected values for each of the parameter estimators involved in direct estimation and used those values to calculate bias and precision for each parameter estimator. Estimates of λi were robust to homogeneous rates of tag loss. When tag loss rates varied by tag age, bias occurred for some of the sampling situations evaluated, especially those with low capture probability, a high rate of tag loss, or both. For situations with low rates of tag loss and high capture probability, bias was low and often negligible. Estimates of contributions of demographic components to λi were not robust to tag loss.

Here, I tested the hypothesis that trout create habitat sinks by manipulating trout densities and estimating local population growth rates (λ) of Callibaetis. In addition, Callibaetis emergence rates were estimated in the mayfly generation before the manipulation. Among ponds, λ ranged from 0.062 to 2.631, and nine Monte Carlo simulations scenarios revealed that four ponds had λ significantly below replacement (sinks) while the presence of source ponds was less conclusive. The manipulation of trout did not result in a detectable treatment effect, perhaps because of low statistical power resulting from high within-treatment variation in trout densities. However, point estimates of λ and emergence rates were negatively and exponentially related to trout density, such that nearly all ponds with more than 1 trout/100 m2 were sinks.

We used seed production data from nine-elevations and a site- and species-specific net carbon (C) availability model from two elevations (1050 m and 1340 m) to examine how three variables (temperature, soil moisture, and net C availability) during three key periods (resource priming, flowering primordia development, and flowering) influence seed production. These three strongly interrelated variables have all been considered determinants of seed production but have not previously been tested together in a single analysis. Seed production increased over the 30-year period, with the greatest increases at high elevations; this increase was driven by a greater frequency of intermediate-sized seeding years. We then determined how temperature, soil moisture, and net C availability determined seeding, and examined whether temporal trends in the seeding data could be linked to similar temporal trends in temperature, soil moisture, or net C availability. High seed production was related to cool summers with high soil moisture during resource priming, warm summers during flower primordia development, and low net C availability during flowering. Positive temporal trends in temperatures during the period of flower primordia development accounted for the increase in seed production, suggesting that increasing temperatures are promoting more frequent seed production at high elevations. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",87,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Carbon dioxide | Evergreen | Global change | Masting | Montane | Mountain beech | New Zealand | Reproduction | Respiration | Soil moisture | Temperature | Warming,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,257,NA,NA,NA,NA

Habitat selection is a closely related problem: the best location for nocturnal foraging could be too risky during daytime, and habitat that is safe and profitable in daytime may be unprofitable at night. We pose a theory that assumes animals select the combination of daytime and night activity (feeding vs. hiding), and habitat, that maximizes expected future fitness. Expected fitness is approximated as the predicted probability of surviving starvation and predation over a future time horizon, multiplied by a function representing the fitness benefits of growth. The theory's usefulness and generality were tested using pattern-oriented analysis of an individual-based model (IBM) of stream salmonids and the extensive literature on observed diel behavior patterns of these animals. Simulation experiments showed that the IBM reproduces eight diverse patterns observed in real populations. (1) Diel activity (whether foraging occurs during day and/or night) varies among a population's individuals, and from day to day for each individual. (2) Salmonids feed in shallower and slower water at night. (3) Individuals pack more tightly into the best habitat when feeding at night. (4) Salmonids feed relatively more at night if temperatures (and, therefore, metabolic demands) are low. (5) Daytime feeding is more common for life stages in which potential fitness increases more rapidly with growth. (6) Competition for feeding or hiding sites can shift foraging between day and night. (7) Daytime feeding is more common when food availability is low. (8) Diel activity patterns are affected by the availability of good habitat for feeding or hiding. We can explain many patterns of variation in diel foraging behavior without assuming that populations or individuals vary in how inherently nocturnal or diurnal they are. Instead, these patterns can emerge from the search by individuals for good trade-offs between growth and survival under different habitat and competitive conditions. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",75,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Diel activity | Diurnal | Foraging | Habitat selection | Individual-based model | Nocturnal | Salmonid | Theory,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,258,NA,NA,NA,NA

We previously applied a two-species lottery model assuming differences between species in environmental sensitivity to generate the predictions that the better competitor will show greater fluctuation in recruitment and be the less common species, predictions supported unanimously by data from a Mexican deciduous forest. Here, we expand on that model and explore the implication from our earlier study that competition among tree species may be focused, rather than the more commonly assumed diffuse, by applying a version of the model dealing with diffuse competition. We found focused competition to be the better explanation of the available data. Our results constitute a serious challenge to the entrenched opinion that competition among tree species is diffuse and to the proposition that competition may be unimportant in structuring tree communities. Another component of the earlier work was the comparison of closely related species. Although species may be ecologically similar for reasons other than phylogenetic relatedness, the additional underlying genetic similarity and the shared evolutionary history of close relatives makes them good candidates for the processes driving storage dynamics.

Recent studies illustrate the importance of top-down effects by small to intermediate-sized herbivores in structuring salt-marsh communities. How long-term effects of herbivory are modified by productivity of the system is a largely unexplored area. We studied how herbivory by geese and hares affected plant species replacement by erecting exclosures along a natural productivity gradient in a temperate salt-marsh system. After seven years, the largest shifts in species composition were observed when both hares and geese were excluded from plots. Only excluding geese did not have a large impact on species replacement, indicating that geese alone did not control the vegetation. Herbivory slowed down succession by retarding the establishment and spread of late-successional species on the low salt marsh. Effects of herbivory were less clear on the high marsh. Vegetation change after excluding herbivores was most pronounced in the most unproductive regions of the salt marsh. As a result, different successional trajectories emerged when herbivores were absent or present at the onset of salt-marsh succession. At sites of intermediate productivity, where grazing pressure was highest, no effect of herbivory on species composition was found. We hypothesize that the high dominance of grazing tolerant species at these sites retarded the invasion of late-successional species. The intensity of herbivory did not accurately predict the importance of herbivory in structuring plant communities.

Important questions to be addressed include to what extent nutrients covary, how flexible nutrient ratios are within a population or species, how reproduction influences nutrient ratios, and how much the ratios of nutrients to mass and nutrients to each other change through ontogeny. This information is needed to assess the physiological and ecological consequences of plant nutrient composition and to what extent plants function as balanced systems in acquisition and allocation of resources. We studied the variation in nutrient stoichiometry (i.e., the ratio between contents of different nutrients within a plant) in relation to three factors: (1) environmental availability of nitrogen, (2) plant size, and (3) reproductive status. We investigated these questions in 11 populations of the carnivorous plant Pinguicula vulgaris in northern Scandinavia. Dry mass and N and P content were measured for reproductive and vegetative portions of flowering individuals and for winter buds corresponding to four reproductive states: control reproductive individuals, experimentally vegetative individuals (from which flower buds were removed), adult vegetative individuals, and individuals below the threshold size for reproduction. [N], [P], and to a lesser extent, N and P content were positively related to soil N, but not to prey capture. Nutrient stoichiometry was also size dependent; in general, small plants were relatively enriched in N and relatively depleted in P compared to larger plants. Reproductive status affected not only size, but also nutrient stoichiometry of the resulting winter bud. Winter buds derived from reproductive individuals had a higher [N] and lower [P] than those of the different types of nonreproductive individuals.

In the continental United States, climate, grazing by large mammals, fire, and topography are important ecosystem drivers that structure North American tallgrass prairie, with major impacts on plant community composition and vegetation structure. Frequency of fire and grazing by bison (Bos bison), through effects on plant community composition and altered spatial and structural heterogeneity of vegetation in tallgrass prairie, may act as bottom-up processes that modulate insect community species richness. As previously seen for plant species richness, I hypothesized that grazing had more impact than fire frequency in determining species richness of insect herbivore communities. I examined this prediction with grasshoppers at Konza Prairie, a representative tallgrass prairie site in which fire frequency and bison grazing are manipulated over long terms with landscape-level treatments. Topographic position (upland vs. lowland) and fire frequency (1-, 2-, 4-year intervals, and unburned) did not significantly influence grasshopper species richness or indices of diversity, while grazing had significant effects. On average, I found ∼45% more grasshopper species and significantly increased values of Shannon H′ diversity at sites with bison grazing. Species abundances were more equally distributed (Shannon's Evenness Index) in grazed sites as well. No significant interactions among burning and grazing treatments ' explained variation in grasshopper species diversity. Grasshopper species richness responded positively to increased heterogeneity in vegetation structure and plant species richness, and negatively to average canopy height and total grass biomass. Variation in forb biomass did not influence grasshopper species richness. A significant positive relationship between grasshopper species richness and overall grasshopper density was observed. Species richness increased marginally as watershed area of treatments in grazed areas increased, but not in ungrazed areas.

Recent evidence for specificity in the elicitation of induced plant responses by different attackers suggests that dynamics of host use in the field may be more complex than previously anticipated, because host suitability for colonizing herbivores may depend on which herbivore species has initially damaged a plant. In each of two years, we manipulated the first herbivore to attack Solanum dulcamara plants in an experimental population using several different arthropod species and subsequently monitored colonization by natural herbivores over the course of the growing season. We additionally performed weekly herbivore counts in wild S. dulcamara populations following natural variation in herbivore arrival. Plant-mediated interactions occurred primarily between two leaf-feeding beetles, Psylliodes affinis and Plagiometriona clavata. In both manipulative and observational experiments, P. clavata oviposition was reduced on plants initially damaged by P. affinis (or a third leaf-feeding beetle, Lema trilinea) relative to plants that were initially undamaged. Lowered P. clavata occurrence continued through subsequent life-history stages, resulting in decreased emergence of second-generation P. clavata adults on these plants. The occurrence of P. affinis was also lowered on plants damaged by conspecifics in both manipulative and observational experiments. Resistance against P. affinis also followed applications of jasmonic acid, an elicitor of plant defensive responses. Conversely, early-season damage by P. clavata did not influence plant quality for either later conspecifics or P. affinis. Initial herbivory by the spittlebug Aphrophora saratogensis or generalist taildropper slugs (Prophysaon sp.) likewise had no influence on P. clavata and P. affinis colonization, whereas L. trilinea damage did not affect later arriving P. affinis. Hence, only a subset of early-season damagers influenced herbivore occurrence on S. dulcamara. Preference tests examining P. affinis feeding and P. clavata oviposition confirmed that specificity in elicitation of induced plant responses produced the divergent herbivore occurrence patterns observed in the field. Overall, the existence of plant-mediated competitive asymmetry between herbivore species on S. dulcamara highlights the dynamic nature of plant resistance and its potential role in organizing herbivore communities. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",115,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Bittersweet nightshade | Competition | Herbivory | Induced responses | Phytophagous insect communities | Plagiometriona clavata | Plant-mediated interactions | Psylliodes affinis | Solanum dulcamara | Specificity,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,266,NA,NA,NA,NA

There were interactions between the effects of rearing temperature and oviposition temperature for age-at-first- reproduction, fecundity, egg development, egg hatching, and two composite measures of fitness, generating complex reaction norms. The most dramatic example of this was a large maternal effect on egg hatching; females raised at low temperature produced eggs that had substantially reduced hatching when laid at high temperature. Our experimental design also allowed us to explore the adaptive significance of acclimation. Beetles reared at intermediate or low temperature had the highest fitness at multiple oviposition temperatures.

We hypothesized that the predictive power of models that relate patch immigration rate to patch size and isolation will be reduced when spatial structure in the landscape matrix (the nonhabitat portion of the landscape) affects organism movement through the landscape. We used a simulation model to evaluate this hypothesis for three different aspects of matrix spatial structure (contrast among matrix cover types, number of matrix cover types, and grain of matrix spatial pattern) and for two different types of movement behavior, representing a specialist and a generalist species. We tested the hypothesis for one aspect of matrix structure (number of matrix cover types) in a translocation field study of the eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus, a habitat specialist) and the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus, a habitat generalist). When the matrix was composed of a small number of cover types, patch size and isolation accounted for up to 75% of the variation in patch immigration rate in the simulation study, and for 61% of the variation in interpatch movement in the field study. However, when the matrix was composed of a large number of cover types, the amount of explained variation dropped to as little as 33% for the simulation study and to 17% in the field study. Our results suggest that patch characteristics, such as patch size and isolation, may be poor predictors of interpatch movement when the landscape matrix is heterogeneous and when the organism responds to boundaries between different matrix cover types.

Although usually viewed as pairwise interactions, obligate mutualists also interact with other community members that may impact the mutualism. In this study, we examined the community context of the obligate mutualism between the plant Yucca filamentosa and its yucca moth pollinator Tegeticula cassandra to determine the relationships among plant traits, the community assemblage, and fruit set. In addition to attracting its pollinator, Y. filamentosa in central Florida also attracts two insect florivores: the hemipteran Leptoglossus phyllopus and the beetle Hymenorus densus. We surveyed flowering Y. filamentosa in 2001 and 2002 to determine the abundance of the three insect species throughout the flowering period. We also measured fruit set and four plant traits thought to be important in attracting the moth pollinator. Path analysis revealed that T. cassandra was the most important determinant of relative fruit set for both years. Peak pollinator abundance was significantly earlier than peak flowering. Consequently, we found a negative relationship between plant flowering date and pollinator abundance. Furthermore, taller plants also attracted more pollinators. Leptoglossus phyllopus had a significantly negative impact on relative fruit set in 2001 but not in 2002, whereas H. densus had no effect in either year. Abundance of the two florivores was more closely tied to peak flowering of Y. filamentosa than was the peak abundance of the pollinator moths. Although both florivore species reached high densities on Y. filamentosa, their effect on relative fruit set through floral abscission may be partially masked by the characteristically high abscission rates found in yuccas. As a result, florivores may be feeding on flowers that are already destined to be abscised.

Phenotypic changes associated with inbreeding are likely to alter interactions between inbred plants and other organisms, but few studies have investigated this potential. We found that inbreeding in the entire-leaf morning glory, Ipomoea hederacea var. integriuscula, altered this plant's ability to resist and tolerate attack by insect herbivores. The effects of inbreeding on plant defense, however, varied among insect species, and plant defense theory helped explain this variation. If the effects of inbreeding on plant phenotype are analogous to those of environmental stresses, then the plant vigor hypothesis predicts specialist herbivores will perform better on outbred plants, and the plant stress hypothesis predicts that generalist herbivores will perform better on inbred plants. We conducted a series of greenhouse experiments in which we reared two species of specialist tortoise beetles, a generalist moth . species, and a generalist aphid species on inbred and outbred morning glories to test these hypotheses. We found that specialist tortoise beetles performed significantly better when reared on outbred plants and that aphid populations grew significantly faster on inbred plants as predicted by the plant vigor and plant stress hypotheses, respectively. Beet armyworm caterpillars, however, performed better on outbred plants, not inbred plants as predicted. These results suggest that plant defense theories may be useful for predicting the effects of inbreeding on plant-herbivore interactions, but differences in herbivore feeding habit (leaf chewing vs. phloem feeding) may also help explain variation in the effects of plant inbreeding on insect herbivores. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",47,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Aphis gossypii | Charidotella bicolor | Deloyala guttata | Herbivory | Inbreeding | Ipomoea hederacea | Plant defense | Plant stress | Plant vigor | Self-fertilization | Spodoptera exigua,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,271,NA,NA,NA,NA

We examined the importance of plant genotype and environmental factors operating at large (habitat) and small (microhabitat) spatial scales in affecting a multitrophic arthropod community on plants. We planted 926 plants from 14 genotypes of Oenothera biennis into five natural habitats that represent the range of environments in which this plant locally occurs. Genotypic differences among plants accounted for as much as 41% of the variation in arthropod diversity (Simpson's diversity index) and also affected arthropod evenness, richness, abundance, and biomass on individual plants. However, the effects of particular plant genotypes on the arthropod community varied across habitats (i.e., there were significant plant genotype-by-habitat interactions). Plant genotype explained more variation in the arthropod community than did environmental variation among microhabitats, but less variation than habitats, as predicted by the scale-dependent hypothesis. Herbivores and omnivores were more strongly affected by plant genetic variation than predators, consistent with the notion that phytophagous insects undergo stronger reciprocal interactions with plants than do predators. We detected heritable variation in arthropod community variables and the ability for the herbivore community to select on plant traits, suggesting that evolution in O. biennis can lead to changes in the arthropod community. Genetic variation in plant size, architecture, and reproductive phenology were the plant traits most strongly correlated with arthropod community variables.

To better understand how burning influences the cycling of N in prairie, 15N was injected to soil as NH4+, and the partitioning between plant and soil N pools was followed over five growing seasons in annually burned and unburned prairie. Applied 15N was rapidly immobilized with <2% and 11% of the 15N remaining in inorganic forms six days after application in burned and unburned prairie, respectively. Seventy-seven percent (burned prairie) and 70% (unburned prairie) of the applied 15N was initially recovered as soil organic N (oN), with a majority accounted for in microbial biomass. Plants contained ∼20% of the applied N with the largest portion recovered from roots regardless of burning.

Vascular plant species were classified into native and alien, the latter divided in archaeophytes, introduced before AD 1500, and neophytes, introduced after this date. The use of minimal adequate models in the analysis of covariance allowed determination of the net effects of mutually correlated environmental variables. Models for particular species groups explained 33-48% of variation in species numbers and 27-51% in proportions; however, explanatory variables affected native species, archaeophytes, and neophytes differently. The number and proportion of neophytes increased in 1955-2000, whereas the number of native species and archaeophytes declined (in archaeophytes more slowly in the warm than in the moderate to cool altitudinal floristic region). In warm and dry regions and on dry soils, where most archaeophytes find optimum conditions, fewer native species are able to persist in weed communities than in colder and wetter regions. Archaeophytes respond like neophytes to some variables (climate, seasonal development of crop) and alternatively like native species to other variables (increasing agricultural intensification through time, human population density). Archaeophytes are common in old crops introduced with the beginning of agriculture (cereals), but are poorly represented in relatively recently introduced crops (rape, maize), where neophytes are most numerous. These patterns reflect the history of plant invasions in Central Europe. Neolithic agriculture, introduced from the Near East in the sixth millenium BC, brought archaeophytes with crops and, by creating intense and continuous propagule pressure and imposing new agricultural management, facilitated their invasion.

Such studies have relied heavily on the use of strontium isotopes as a proxy for base-cation cycling.

Survival of first-time breeders was lower than that of inexperienced nonbreeders, indicating a cost of first reproduction. Survival of inexperienced individuals (both breeders and nonbreeders), but not of experienced ones, was negatively affected by poor environmental oceanographic conditions. The costs of reproduction for first-time breeders were particularly marked during harsh weather conditions. Survival and the probability of breeding in the next year for experienced birds were higher for breeders than for nonbreeders. Similarly, the probability of breeding in the next year for first-time breeders was higher than for inexperienced nonbreeders. This suggests heterogeneity in quality among individuals. Experienced breeders had a higher body condition than first-time breeders and nonbreeders. Body condition did not affect the probability of surviving or breeding in the next year. These results can be interpreted in the light of a change in the proportion of individuals with different survival (selection hypothesis: low-quality individuals die sooner). The inferiority of first-time breeders may be linked to a higher proportion of lower-quality individuals in younger age classes.

The aim of this study was to compare the relative effects of these four components of biological diversity across pond food webs using aquatic mesocosm experiments in which all four community properties were manipulated independently. Functional groups were defined in terms of trophic groups, and consisted of aquatic macrophytes, periphyton grazers, and invertebrate predators. Species composition and species richness were manipulated within functional groups. Ecosystem response variables included the final biomass of the manipulated taxa (macrophytes, grazers, and predators), ecosystem rates (productivity and decomposition), and trophic structure (phytoplankton and periphyton biomass). Results reveal strong effects of species composition on a significant proportion of ecosystem response variables. In contrast, species richness, functional group richness, and functional group composition altered the biomass of the manipulated taxa, but had no additional effects on other ecosystem variables.

We used a spatially explicit simulation model and data from a field experiment to examine the effect of induced resistance on the distribution of herbivores and their damage among plants within a population. The model is appropriate only for rapid (as opposed to delayed) induced resistance, assumes that resistance affects herbivore behavior but not performance, and assumes no interplant communication. It is also appropriate only for induced resistance that decays in the absence of herbivore damage. The simulation tracks herbivores on a linear array of plants or plant parts with reflecting boundaries and allows manipulation of the timing of induced resistance and the initial distribution of herbivores. Our model suggests that increasing lags and thresholds for the production of induced resistance causes increasing aggregation of herbivores and their damage, but in the absence of either a lag or a threshold, induced resistance can lead to an even distribution of herbivores. The formation of even or aggregated distributions of herbivores depends not on initial distributions, but on the characteristics of the induced resistance.

Here, we consider how fire alters plant-insect interactions in a longleaf pine ecosystem in central Florida, USA. We hypothesized that fire in the short term would directly depress herbivore abundance, and that the rate of re-colonization by herbivores would depend upon distance from the edge of the recently burned area. Thus, fire should generate spatially varying herbivory. Orthopterans are dominant insect consumers in our system, and many species are flightless, either as juveniles or adults; these species are particularly likely to show constrained post-fire mobility. We quantified insect abundance and herbivory levels on eight common understory plants in the edge and interior of three recently burned sites. As predicted, insect abundance at the edge of burned areas was much higher than in the interior. In addition, all plant species experienced at least twice the level of herbivory in the edge than in the interior of burned sites. This demonstrates that disturbance can create strong spatial variation in the magnitude of trophic interactions.

Our aim is to develop a data-rich multidimensional dynamical budget of nutrient acquisition and allocation in survival and reproduction in the host-feeding, synovigenic bruchid ectoparasitoid Eupelmus vuilletti (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae) over the entire lifetime of the animal in order to address the above questions. We quantified sugar, glycogen, protein, and lipid reserves of single females at birth and death and their daily maintenance needs. We recorded each host-feeding and oviposition event over entire lifetimes and quantified the amounts acquired and invested in eggs using microcolorimetric techniques. We then built two nutrient budgets, with and without hosts, encompassing 20 measured biochemical parameters and tested their predictions using time of death. Carbohydrate reserves are burned at a high rate for maintenance and can be used to predict lifetime in absence of hosts. The model without hosts is adequate, but the one with hosts is not, as it predicts a continuous increase of proteins from the massive host-feeding intake, contrasting with the observed decline. A good prediction of time of death could be achieved in that model by assuming that the large amounts of ingested proteins and carbohydrates from host-feeding are used for maintenance, thereby enabling females to spare lipids for reproduction. We tested this assumption in a treatment with hosts and supplemental sugars, in which the maximal number of produced eggs is expected to be almost exclusively a function of lipids when other nutrients can be obtained to cover maintenance costs.

Induction of phlorotannins was significant in both tissue types but was more pronounced in basal stipes, which have a higher fitness value. Basal tissues also had significantly higher constitutive defense levels than did apical tissues. No effects of algal tissue type or grazing history on the growth rate of the gastropods were detected. However, the number of viable eggs was significantly lower for gastropods feeding on basal shoots, and there was a significantly lower proportion of viable eggs produced by gastropods that were offered previously grazed seaweed tissues.

In contrast, mounting evidence indicates that bot fly (Cuterebra sp.) infestation enhances the survival of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus). We propose that life history trade-offs, namely, between reproduction and survival, can explain this counterintuitive observation. By using an extensive data set spanning a decade, 12 sites in two states, and over 30 000 mouse captures, we offer a new perspective on the effects of bot fly parasitism on white-footed mice. Analysis of persistence time corroborated earlier studies that showed significantly higher survival rates of infested mice. Although a higher proportion of infested than uninfested females were in breeding condition, secondary reproductive success appeared to be negatively impacted by parasitism via declines in the number of litters and the total number of offspring produced by infested females. Population growth rates were negatively correlated with infestation prevalence, further indicating a negative effect of parasitism. Based on the negative impact of parasitism on reproduction, we propose that enhanced survival of infested mice can be explained by the diversion of resources from reproduction to body maintenance. Parasite-induced life history shifts in which mice decrease current reproduction to promote future reproduction, such as increasing the age at maturity, may also contribute to the decline in population growth rate observed in years of high infestation prevalence. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",37,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Bot fly | Bot fly impact on Peromyscus hosts | Cuterebra | Host-parasite interactions | Life history trade-offs | Parasite | Parasitism | Peromyscus leucopus | Population dynamics | Reproduction | Survival | White-footed mouse,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,288,NA,NA,NA,NA

The answer is ""surely not always,"" since some disturbances may be so devastating that recovery will be impossible. If communities do recover, then how fast is that recovery? Do different subsets of species return at the same rate? Is that rate a simple exponential recovery - meaning that the change toward the original state is fastest when the community is furthest away and it slows as the community converges? Or is recovery a more dynamically complex process? These questions are theoretically interesting and practically important. The theoretical questions are if there is a particular state - some exact composition - to which a community is likely to return, if there might be several (or many) possible such states, or if community composition is essentially haphazard. The practical implication is that if disturbed ecological communities do not tend to return to a previous state, it may be impossible to undo human impacts on natural ecosystems. We follow the fate of species assemblages following the removal of vegetation for mining. We show that these assemblages in restored subtropical coastal dune forests in South Africa do converge with a regional equilibrium state and that convergence is possible within a reasonable period.

These procedures were evaulated for conditions in which heterogeneity and hidden bias were induced by confounding with missing variables associated with other improtant processes, a problem common in statistical modeling of ecological phenomena. Simulations for a large (N = 10 000) finite population representing grid locations on a landscape demonstrated various forms of hidden bias that might occur when the effect of a measured habitat variable on some animal was confounded with the effect of another unmeasured variable. Quantile (0 ≤ τ ≤ 1) regression parameters for linear models that excluded the important, unmeasured variable revealed bias relative to parameters from the generating model. Depending on whether interactions of the measured and unmeasured variables were negative (interference interactions) or positive (facilitation interactions) in simulations without spatial structuring, either upper (τ > 0.5) or lower (τ < 0.5) quantile regression parameters were less biased than mean rate parameters. Heterogeneous, nonlinear response patterns occurred with correlations between the measured and unmeasured variables. When the unmeasured variable was spatially structured, variation in parameters across quantiles associated with heterogeneous effects of the habitat variable was reduced by modeling the spatial trend surface as a cubic polynomial of location coordinates, but substantial hidden bias remained. Sampling (n = 20-300) simulations demonstrated that regression quantile estimates and confidence intervals constructed by inverting weighted rank score tests provided valid coverage of these parameters. Local forms of quantile weighting were required for obtaining correct Type I error rates and confidence interval coverage.

Indirectly, these data also provide information about the vital rates (e.g., birth rates, mortality rates) underlying these dynamics, but extracting this information from the data can be difficult. Here, we present a method for estimating fluctuating vital rates from ecological time series by using a model to re-code information in observed dynamics into information about unobserved vital rates. This model construction differs from most current models by replacing strong assumptions about the functional relationships dictating population dynamics with more conservative assumptions about how vital rates change with time. Thus, this method is a tool for analyzing time-series data that avoids strong assumptions about the mechanisms driving population dynamics. Our work is motivated by studying the biological control of pea aphids in alfalfa in south-central Wisconsin. Pea aphid populations are consistently held below economic threshold, although the source of this regulation is unclear. Here, we analyze monitoring data to understand the role that a specialist parasitoid plays in aphid biocontrol. Our modeling methodology allows us to estimate the vital rates that determine aphid dynamics (in particular, parasitism) without making arbitrary assumptions about the relationship between parasitism and aphid or parasitoid density. We find that, while parasitism depresses aphid population growth rate substantially, declines in aphid population growth rates do not coincide with increases in parasitism.

Yet, recent theory suggests that competition intensity and niche differences remain important under high DIM, even when competitive dominance is modified. Productivity is also thought to interact with DIM, potentially enhancing species coexistence. I explored these issues using a laboratory system composed of a diverse assemblage of bacteria as prey, and four species of competing protozoan bacterivores. Productivity manipulations were crossed with varying levels of DIM imposed on the bacterivores (in both polyculture and monoculture). DIM altered patterns of competitive dominance. At low DIM, Paramecium aurelia and Paramecium caudatum dominated, while Colpoda inflata (a species absent at low DIM) was able to invade and dominate at high DIM. Productivity did not promote shifts in dominance and hindered Colpoda performance. Examination of competition effect sizes provided clear evidence of competitive reversals and the importance of competition under low and high DIM. Variable competitive outcomes appeared to be mediated by changes in the strength of apparent competition effects on bacterial diversity, in accordance with theory. Bacterial diversity was low at low levels of DIM, due to strong consumer effects.

Virtually all previous experiments have used mobile insects confined in cages and have studied the effects of one, or at most two, species of mycorrhizae on one species of insect. The purpose of this study was to introduce a greater level of realism into insect-mycorrhizal experiments, by studying the responses of different insect feeding guilds to a variety of AM fungi. We conducted two experiments involving three species of relatively immobile insects (a leaf-mining and two seed-feeding flies) reared in natural conditions on a host (Leucanthemum vulgare). In a field study, natural levels of AM colonization were reduced, while in a phytometer trial, we experimentally colonized host plants with all possible combinations of three known mycorrhizal associates of L. vulgare. In general, AM fungi increased the stature (height and leaf number) and nitrogen content of plants. However, these effects changed through the season and were dependent on the identity of the fungi in the root system. AM fungi increased host acceptance of all three insects and larval performance of the leaf miner, but these effects were also season- and AM species-dependent. We suggest that the mycorrhizal effect on the performance of the leaf miner is due to fungal-induced changes in host-plant nitrogen content, detected by the adult fly. However, variability in the effect was apparent, because not all AM species increased plant N content. Meanwhile, positive effects of mycorrhizae were found on flower number and flower size, and these appeared to result in enhanced infestation levels by the seed-feeding insects. The results show that AM fungi exhibit ecological specificity, in that different species have different effects on host-plant growth and chemistry and the performance of foliar-feeding insects.

When rainfall intensity overwhelms the water infiltration capacity of the plant interspace or the plant patch, overland water flow links otherwise separated patches at many different scales via the transport of nutrients in water, soil, and organic matter. For example, material carried from the plant interspace is often deposited under an adjacent plant. Alternatively, material from both of these patches may be carried to rills that feed ephemeral channels, thence to seasonally intermittent and, finally, perennial streams. These inputs can either be retained by the stream-riparian ecosystem or be exported in surface flow. However, in larger perennial streams, the fate of these material inputs is confounded by the impact of storm-driven flows on the extant aquatic biota, as flash floods can also represent succession-initiating disturbances to the stream-riparian ecosystem on a wide range of time scales. In contrast to uplands where precipitation initiates the microbial response, nutrient transfers can support a flush of plant uptake and microbial processing, triggered by high nutrient concentrations and changed nutrient form (e.g., nitrate or ammonium). The nature and strength of the linkages between the different ecosystem components define the structure and function of arid ecosystems. Losses of materials are natural processes, but it is problematic when "" conserving"" systems become ""leaky"" via anthropogenic disturbance and losses exceed gains. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",244,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,5,5,Activity pulse | Biological soil crusts | Desert | Infiltration | Nutrient cycling | Precipitation,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,300,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most theoretical and empirical studies of predation focus on the consequences of predators consuming their prey. Predators reduce prey population densities through direct consumption (a density-mediated interaction, DMI), a process that may indirectly affect the prey's resources, competitors, and other predators. However, predators can also affect prey population density by stimulating costly defensive strategies. The costs of these defensive strategies can include reduced energy income, energetic investment in defensive structures, lower mating success, increased vulnerability to other predators, or emigration. Theoretical and empirical studies confirm the existence of these induced costs (trait-mediated interactions, TMIs); however, the relative importance of intimidation (TMI) and consumption (DMI) effects remains an open question. We conducted a meta-analysis assessing the magnitude of both TMIs and DMIs in predator-prey interactions. On average, the impact of intimidation on prey demographics was at least as strong as direct consumption (63% and 51% the size of the total predator effect, respectively). This contrast is even more pronounced when we consider the cascading effects of predators on their prey's resources: density effects attenuated through food chains, while TMIs remained strong, rising to 85% of the total predator effect. Predators can thus strongly influence resource density even if they consume few prey items. Finally, intimidation was more important in aquatic than terrestrial ecosystems. Our results suggest that the costs of intimidation, traditionally ignored in predator-prey ecology, may actually be the dominant facet of trophic interactions. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",1209,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Behavioral effects | Density-mediated interactions | Higher-order interactions | Predation risk | Predator-prey ecology | Trait-mediated interactions | Trophic cascades,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,302,NA,NA,NA,NA

We envisage that this pattern is brought about by a prolonged mobilization of induced defenses in longer lived plants, which can better afford periods of low reproductive output than can short-lived plants. On the basis of this hypothesis we expect animals with similar diets to show similar cycle lengths, irrespective of taxonomy and size.

We explore how habitat selection behavior is affected by the risk of mortality en route and by deferred search costs (i.e., costs incurred during search that reduce fitness after arrival in the new habitat), using a model designed for long-distance natal dispersers searching for scarce patches of suitable habitat embedded within a matrix of unsuitable habitat. In this situation, increases in the risk of mortality during search reduce disperser selectivity, where selectivity is reflected by the period during search when dispersers are only willing to accept a high-quality habitat. However, the effects of deferred costs on selectivity depend on other factors with pronounced effects on selectivity, including encounter rates with high-quality habitats, relative habitat quality, and total search time. Surprisingly, under some sets of conditions, increases in deferred costs lead to increases in disperser selectivity. Overall, the effects of mortality and deferred costs on selectivity are small relative to the effects of other factors on selectivity. For instance, our model suggests that selectivity is much more strongly affected by total search time than by search costs, and it predicts a positive relationship between total search time and disperser selectivity across individuals in the same population, even in the face of considerable interindividual variation in risk of mortality or deferred search costs. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",192,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Deferred costs | Dispersal | Habitat quality | Habitat selection models | Mortality risk | Search costs | Search time | Selectivity,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,307,NA,NA,NA,NA

Establishment by seed is extremely rare in the Rocky Mountain region, where most clones that exist today are thought to have established hundreds or thousands of years ago. However, recruitment of new genetic individuals through sexual reproduction has occurred periodically throughout the Holocene, and widespread establishment of seedling aspen occurred in Yellowstone National Park, USA, following the extensive 1988 fires. We combined extensive survey methods with manipulative experiments to investigate the patterns and mechanisms of new aspen genet establishment, growth, and survival during their first decade of development. Excavation and aging of 173 aspen stems in 1996 demonstrated that 65% had established within the first three years after the 1988 fires, and that none predated 1988. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) genetic analyses revealed that 92% of the plants were genetically distinct individuals, and 8% were ramets. Annual surveys of 22 permanently marked aspen seedling plots revealed that 24% of 417 seedlings tallied in 1996 had died by 2000. However, mortality varied greatly among the 22 plots, from <10% to >40%, with greater mortality at lower elevations and where soil organic matter was low. To evaluate the mechanisms underlying seedling persistence or mortality, we constructed exclosures in three sites to protect aspen seedlings from ungulate browsing, and applied four experimental treatments from 1996 to 1998: (1) clipping of current year's growth to simulate browsing, (2) removal of potential competitors including lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta van latifolia) saplings and herbaceous plants, (3) clipping and competitor removal, and (4) control, i.e., no treatment except protection from browsing. Clipping prevented stem elongation, but removing competitors had no significant effect on height growth of aspen seedlings. Even with protection from browsing, most aspen stems grew slowly (mean increment <25 cm from 1996 to 2000), and many died from causes unrelated to herbivory. Nevertheless, some individuals were >2 m tall in 2003 and appeared vigorous. The aspen cohort that germinated after the 1988 fires appears to be in the earliest stage of a long-term population process, a process that likely will entail a shift from many genetically distinct individuals but few ramets, to relatively few genets having numerous ramets. We predict that many or most of the post-1988 aspen seedlings will die within the next few decades, with little lasting effect on broad-scale vegetation patterns or postfire successional trajectories.

A key assumption is that corridors facilitate exchange rates of organisms between otherwise isolated patches. If the organisms are pollinators, corridors may be important for maintaining genetically viable populations of the plants that they pollinate. We tested the hypothesis that corridors increase the movement of insect pollinators into patches of habitat and thereby increase pollen transfer for two species of plants, one pollinated by butterflies (Lantana camara) and the other by bees and wasps (Rudbeckia hirta). We worked in an experimental landscape consisting of 40 ≥1-ha patches of early-successional habitat in a matrix of forest. Within each of eight experimental units, two patches were connected by a corridor (150 X 25 m), and three were not. Patch shape varied to control for the area added by the presence of a corridor. Differences in patch shape also allowed us to test alternative hypotheses of how corridors might function. The Traditional Corridor Hypothesis posits that corridors increase immigration and emigration by functioning as movement conduits between patches. The Drift Fence Hypothesis posits that corridors function by ""capturing"" organisms dispersing through the matrix, redirecting them into associated habitat patches. Using fluorescent powder to track pollen, we found that pollen transfer by butterflies between patches connected by a corridor was significantly higher than between unconnected patches (all values mean ± 1 SE: 59% ± 9.2% vs. 25% ± 5.2% of flowers receiving pollen). Likewise, pollen transfer by bees and wasps was significantly higher between connected patches than between unconnected patches (30% ± 4.2% vs. 14.5% ± 2.2%). These results support the Traditional Corridor Hypothesis. There was little support, however, for the Drift Fence Hypothesis. To generalize our results to a larger scale, we measured the probability of pollen transfer by butterflies as a function of distance along a 2000 X 75 m corridor. Pollen transfer probability exponentially declined with respect to distance and successfully predicted pollen transfer probability on the scale of our previous experiment.

We explored how tree diversity in these fragments has been affected by (1) impoverishment of the mammal community and (2) changes in abiotic conditions following island formation ca. 90 years ago. To test effects of changes in the mammal community, we assessed seed and seedling survival for nine tree species in five forests: small islands with no mammals; small islands with spiny rats but no larger mammals; medium islands (intermediate mammal community); Barro Colorado Island (intermittently present puma and jaguar); and mainland forests (intact mammal community). To test effects of abiotic stress, we chose experimental sites at wind-exposed, wind-protected, and interior forest sites. We predicted that fragments with less diverse mammal communities would be characterized by (1) fewer seeds dispersed and cached, (2) lower long-term seed survival, and (3) higher rates of seedling herbivory by mammals. Where alteration of the environment has caused greater exposure to dry-season winds, we predicted that (4) germination and seedling establishment and (5) dry-season seedling survival would be low. Further, we expected that (6) dry-season seedling survival would increase if soil moisture levels were raised, but that (7) wet-season seedling survival is independent of wind exposure. In the larger forests, seed and seedling survival were low, and differences in mammal community composition had little effect. Small islands that supported only rats had the same low seed survival as larger forests. Elimination of all mammals resulted in much higher seed survival, and slightly higher seedling survival. Germination and seedling survival were lower at wind-exposed than at protected sites, but irrigation had no effect on dry-season seedling survival. It appears that the dominant species on Gatún Lake fragments have passed through a series of filters: seeds must first avoid being eaten by spiny rats, survive the first dry season, and then avoid seedling herbivory by rats.

A number of studies have shown that the temperature sensitivity of litter decomposition can vary depending on litter type and extent of decomposition. However, the underlying causes of this variation are not well understood. According to fundamental principles of enzyme kinetics, the temperature sensitivity of microbial decomposition should be inversely related to litter carbon quality. We tested the accuracy of this hypothesis by adding ground plant shoot and root material to soils incubated under controlled conditions and measuring the temperature sensitivities of decomposition at three time points throughout a 53-d incubation. As the overall quality of the litter organic C declined, litter decomposition became more sensitive to temperature. This was true regardless of whether differences in C quality were due to inherent differences in litter chemistry or due to differences in the extent of decomposition. The same pattern was observed when specific C compounds of varying quality were added to soil, suggesting that substrate C quality has a significant and predictable influence on the temperature sensitivity of microbial decomposition. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",519,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Co 2 | Litter decomposition | Mineralization | Q 10 | Respiration | Soil carbon | Temperature,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,315,NA,NA,NA,NA

We conducted a field experiment to examine the impact of resource manipulations and seed addition on the invasibility and diversity of a low-productivity grassland. We manipulated resource levels both by a disturbance treatment that reduced adult plant cover in the spring of the first year and by addition of fertilizer every year. Seeds of 46 native species, both resident and nonresident to the community, were added in spring of the first year to determine the effects of recruitment limitation from local (seed limitation) and regional (dispersal limitation) sources on local species richness. Our results show that the unmanipulated community was not readily invasible. Seed addition increased the species richness of unmanipulated plots, but this was primarily due to increased occurrence of resident species. Nonresident species were only able to invade following a cover-reduction disturbance. Cover reduction resulted in an increase in nitrogen availability in the first year, but had no measurable effect on light availability in any year. In contrast, fertilization created a persistent increase in nitrogen availability that increased plant cover or biomass and reduced light penetration to ground level. Initially, fertilization had an overall positive effect on species richness, but by the third year, the effect was either negative or neutral. Unlike cover reduction, fertilization had no observable effect on seedling recruitment or occurrence (number of plots) of invading resident or nonresident species.

One particularly important interaction between these processes in patchy semiarid lands is how vegetation patches serve to obstruct runoff and then how this retained water increases patch growth that, in turn, provides feedbacks to the system. Such ecohydrological interactions have been mostly demonstrated for semiarid landscapes with distinctly banded vegetation patterns. In this paper, we use data from our studies and from the literature to evaluate how strongly four ecohydrological interactions apply across other patchy semiarid vegetations, and how these interactions are affected by disturbances. We specifically address four questions concerning ecohydrological interactions: (1) if vegetation patches obstruct runoff flows during rainfall events, how much more soil water is stored in these patches compared to open interpatch areas; (2) if inputs of water are higher in patches, how much stronger is the pulse of plant growth compared to interpatches; (3) if more soil water in patches promotes greater biological activity by organisms such as earthworms that create macropores, how much does this improve soil infiltrability; and (4) if vegetation patches are damaged on a hillslope, how much does this increase runoff and erosion and decrease biomass production? We used the trigger-transfer-reserve-pulse framework developed for Australian semiarid woodlands to put these four questions into a landscape context. For a variety of patchy semiarid vegetation types in Australia, Europe, and North America, we found that patches significantly stored more soil water, produced more growth and had better infiltrability than interpatches, and that runoff and erosion can markedly increase on disturbed hillslopes. However, these differences varied greatly and appeared to depend on factors such as the intensity and amount of input events (rainstorms) and type of topography, soils, and vegetation. Experimental and modeling studies are needed to better quantify how these factors specifically affect ecohydrological interactions. Our current findings do support the conclusion that vegetation patches and runoff-erosion processes do strongly interact in many semiarid landscapes across the globe, not just banded landscapes. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",614,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,5,5,Hydrology | Landscape ecology | Landscape function | Runoff | Soil erosion,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,318,NA,NA,NA,NA

To assess potential herbivory impacts associated with wild ungulates following the removal of gray wolves (Canis lupus), long-term cottonwood recruitment and stand dynamics were studied. While results indicated that the establishment of young cottonwoods is an ongoing process in Yellowstone's northern range, their relatively small stature and hedged appearance were indicative of high browsing pressure by wild ungulates, principally elk. At five study sites, the diameter at breast height (dbh) of all cottonwood trees ≥5 cm was determined; increment cores were also obtained for developing tree age vs. dbh relationships. At the La Duke Spring and Devils Slide Sites, which represent refugia sites since elk have limited access (due to local terrain conditions and cultural developments), cottonwood recruitment has been occurring during the last half century, indicating that climatic factors have not prevented cottonwood recruitment during that time. However, over this same period cottonwood recruitment no longer occurred at sites within the Soda Butte and Lamar Valleys. The overall decline in cottonwood recruitment at these locations occurred following the extirpation of wolves from Yellowstone National Park in the 1920s. At the Buffalo Ranch Site, where ranching of buffalo [bison] (Bison bison) and activities associated with culling of elk were centered, cottonwood recruitment continued after the loss of wolves but stopped following the curtailment of ungulate management activities at these facilities in the late 1960s.

Investigators have speculated that such postfire mosaics of vegetation structure may persist until the next large disturbance, but the fate of the initial structural variability of postfire communities is currently poorly understood. We studied lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Englem. ex Wats.) stands in Yellowstone National Park (Wyoming, USA) unburned by the 1988 fires to determine how variation in stand structure changes with increasing stand age. The coefficient of variation in stand density decreased from 231% in 12-yr-old stands to 91% in stands aged 50-100 yr, and to 37% for stands ages 200-250 yr. Substantial variability in age distributions both within and among age classes suggested that both gradual infilling of initially sparse stands and self-thinning of initially dense stands are important processes affecting variation in stand density. Variation in stand density was explained primarily by stand age (P < 0.0001) and by geographic location (P < 0.01). Field estimates and reconstructions of stand density trajectories suggest the importance of biotic processes and the contingent effects that produce initial patterns of stand density. Variation in stand density is substantially reduced 125 yr following fire and remains relatively unchanged beyond approximately 200 yr.

Here we quantify the demographic and selective effects of herbivory by native insects and the introduced floral feeder Rhinocyllus conicus on Platte thistle (Cirsium canescens), a sparse monocarpic thistle endemic to North America. Rhinocyllus first invaded the Platte thistle population in 1993. Since then, its numbers have increased exponentially, while the Platte thistle population size has decreased. Data from 11 years were analyzed to determine how demographic rates varied with plant size and damage by native insects and Rhinocyllus. Individual growth, survival, flowering probability, and seed set were all size dependent. Damage to vegetative structures did not influence demographic rates; damage to flower heads did because Platte thistle is seed limited. These analyses were used to parameterize a series of integral projection models (IPMs) that investigated the effects of floral herbivory on the population growth rate λ, equilibrium population size, and the evolutionary stable (ES) flowering strategy. The IPMs showed that native insects have significant impact on the equilibrium population size and λ, but not the ES flowering strategy, because they use the flowers of different-sized plants indiscriminately. In contrast, Rhinocyllus has the potential to drive Platte thistle extinct. Rhinocyllus preferentially fed and oviposited on the flowers of larger plants and therefore selected for a reduction in flowering size. However, as the thistle population went into decline, this pattern reversed.

Using a simplified water-balance model, we propose a framework for conceptualizing how woody plant encroachment is likely to affect components of the water cycle within these ecosystems. We focus in particular on streamflow and the partitioning of evapotranspiration into evaporation and transpiration. On the basis of this framework, we suggest that streamflow and evaporation processes are affected by woody plant encroachment in different ways, depending on the degree and seasonality of aridity and the availability of subsurface water. Differences in landscape physiography, climate, and runoff mechanisms mediate the influence of woody plants on hydrological processes. Streamflow is expected to decline as a result of woody plant encroachment in landscapes dominated by subsurface flow regimes. Similarly, encroachment of woody plants can be expected to produce an increase in the fractional contribution of bare soil evaporation to evapotranspiration in semiarid ecosystems, whereas such shifts may be small or negligible in both subhumid and arid ecosystems. This framework for considering the effects of woody plant encroachment highlights important ecological and hydrological interactions that serve as a basis for predicting other ecological aspects of vegetation change - such as potential changes in carbon cycling within an ecosystem. In locations where woody plant encroachment results in increased plant transpiration and concurrently the availability of soil water is reduced, increased accumulation of carbon in soils emerges as one prediction. Thus, explicitly considering the ecohydrological linkages associated with vegetation change provides needed information on the consequences of woody plant encroachment on water yield, carbon cycling, and other processes. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",543,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,9,9,Carbon cycling | Ecohydrology | Evapotranspiration | Vegetation change | Woody plant encroachment,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,323,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Using original Public Land Survey (PLS) records in northern Wisconsin, USA, we study spatial patterns of wind and fire disturbances during the pre-Euroamerican settlement period (ca. 1850). Our goals were: (1) to determine how effectively wind and fire disturbance can be reconstructed from the PLS, (2) to assess the roles of wind and fire in shaping vegetation patterns, (3) to evaluate landscape to regional controls of wind and fire regimes, and (4) to assess the potential for interactions between these disturbances. Our analyses indicate that only relatively intense fire and wind disturbance can be reliably detected from the PLS (62-68% canopy removal). Heavy windthrow was more prevalent than fire disturbance in presettlement forests, and wind-disturbed patches were comparatively smaller and more complex in shape. Disturbance rotation periods ranged between 450 and 10 500 years for heavy windthrow and between 700 and 93 000 years for stand-replacing fire. Occurrences of wind and fire disturbance were related to geographic province and to regional soil patterns; analysis further suggests a negative interaction between the two disturbance types. Given that severe wind disturbance was infrequent, mature to old forests of late-successional species dominated much of pre-Euroamerican northern Wisconsin, but wind disturbances may have allowed regional persistence of less shade-tolerant species, such as Betula alleghaniensis. Pine-dominated vegetation was limited to regions with more frequent fire, but frequencies of stand-replacing fire derived from survey records were insufficient to maintain these successional vegetation types; we suggest that frequent surface fires, not recorded in the PLS, along with infrequent stand-replacing fire, maintained these vegetation types. The extensive nature of the PLS provides a powerful baseline for addressing changes in forest conditions and disturbance regimes associated with climate and land use for both the present and more distant past.

Using meta-analysis, we examined the relationship between the indirect effect of predator manipulation on plants and 18 biological and methodological factors quantified from these studies. We found, in contrast to predictions, that high system productivity and low species diversity do not consistently generate larger trophic cascades. A combination of herbivore and predator metabolic factors and predator taxonomy (vertebrate vs. invertebrate) explained 31% of the variation in cascade strength among all 114 studies. Within systems, 18% of the variation in cascade strength was explained with similar predator and herbivore characteristics. Within and across all systems, the strongest cascades occurred in association with invertebrate herbivores and endothermic vertebrate predators. These associations may result from a combination of true biological differences among species with different physiological requirements and bias among organisms studied in different systems.

However, blanket protection of species within a reserve may shelter nonindigenous species that are normally affected by harvesting, intensifying their impacts on native species. I studied a system of marine reserves in the San Juan Islands, Washington, USA, to examine the extent to which marine reserves are invaded by nonindigenous species and the consequences of these invasions on native species. I surveyed three reserves and eight non-reserves to quantify the abundance of intertidal suspension-feeding clam species, three of which are regionally widespread nonindigenous species (Nuttallia obscurata, Mya arenaria, and Venerupis philippinarum). Neither total nonindigenous nor native species' abundance was significantly greater on reserves. However, the most heavily harvested species, V. philippinarum, was significantly more abundant on reserves, with the three reserves ranking highest in Venerupis biomass of all 11 sites. In contrast, a similar, harvested native species (Protothaca staminea) did not differ between reserves and non-reserves. I followed these surveys with a year-long field experiment replicated at six sites (the three reserves and three of the surveyed non-reserve sites). The experiment examined the effects of high Venerupis densities on mortality, growth, and fecundity of the confamilial Protothaca, and whether differences in predator abundance mitigate density-dependent effects. Even at densities 50% higher than measured in the field survey, Venerupis had no direct effect on itself or Protothaca; only site, predator exposure, and their interaction had significant effects. Analyses incorporating environmental variables tracked at each site indicated that crab biomass most heavily influenced clam responses, causing lower growth of both species and higher mortality of Venerupis, whose annualized loss rate was 50% when exposed to predators. A laboratory prey choice experiment indicated that Cancer productus, an influential intertidal crab predator, favored small adult Venerupis at least 1.7 times over Protothaca. Venerupis' high susceptibility to excavating crab and human predators, as well as its faster growth compared to Protothaca can be explained by its shallower burial depth.

In this paper, we attempt to quantify the contribution of hurricanes to Caribbean coral cover decline over the past two decades using meta-analyses. Our study included published and unpublished data from 286 coral reef sites monitored for variable lengths of time between 1980 and 2001. Of these, 177 sites had experienced hurricane impacts during their period of survey. Across the Caribbean, coral cover is reduced by ∼17%, on average, in the year following a hurricane impact. The magnitude of this immediate loss increases with hurricane intensity and with the time elapsed since the last impact. In the following year, no further loss is discernible, but the decline in cover then resumes on impacted sites at a rate similar to the regional background rate of decline for nonimpacted sites. There is no evidence of recovery to a pre-storm state for at least eight years after impact. Overall, coral cover at sites impacted by a hurricane has declined at a significantly faster rate (6% per annum) than nonimpacted sites (2% per annum), due almost exclusively to higher rates of loss in the year after impact in the 1980s. While hurricanes, through their immediate impacts, appear to have contributed to changing coral cover on many Caribbean reefs in the 1980s, the similar decline in coral cover at impacted and nonimpacted sites in the 1990s suggests that other stressors are now relatively more important in driving the overall pattern of change in coral cover in this region.

The stands were 9-12 years old and had experienced from 1 to 10 or more cycles of shifting cultivation. Accounting for differences in soil fertility, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) demonstrated that aboveground live biomass increment (ABI, in megagrams per hectare per year) was significantly greater after four cycles than after six or more cycles. ABI was lowest after two cycles, highest after one or four cycles and intermediate after 6-10 cycles. Differences were driven by the density and biomass of trees >10 cm dbh, which followed a similar pattern. Although the diameter increment and contribution to total biomass of trees >10 cm dbh increased significantly with inherent soil fertility, variation in the rate of biomass accumulation depended primarily on the number of prior cultivation cycles. An ANCOVA with soil fertility as the main effect was not significant. One hypothesis to explain observed patterns of ABI associated with changes in tree density is a shift, over many cycles, in the dominance of seed-banking vs. resprouting species. Previous work has shown that total phosphorus did not decline after six or more cycles; however, a shift from available to occluded forms may be related to lower ABI in sites with the longest cultivation history. An 11% decline in ABI could substantially alter the carbon-sequestration value of secondary tropical forests as they enter their second century of persistent human disturbance.",52,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,"Biomass accumulation | Carbon sequestration | Cultivation history | Deforestation | Life-history turnover | Phosphorus | Shifting cultivation | Tropical secondary rain forest | West Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,329,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet the shifts are quite variable and seem to depend on many factors, including lake morphometry, temperature, and dominance of macrophytes. Here we evaluated the role of these factors using an empirically based model that included more mechanistic detail than earlier models of regime shifts in trophic state. Mean depth and temperature strongly influenced the susceptibility of lakes to regime shifts and lake restoration. The macrophyte effect of preventing P recycling from sediments was critical to the susceptibility of shallow lakes to regime shift. With warmer temperatures, eutrophication was more likely and restoration was less successful due to increased internal P recycling from the sediment. Lakes with intermediate depths were most susceptible to regime shifts and were least restorable. These lakes were too deep to be protected by macrophytes in their littoral zones and were too shallow to mitigate P recycling through hypolimnetic dilution.

We used a simple, yet powerful, approach to examine the long-term process of canopy recruitment. We compared early growth in proven ""winners"" (extant canopy trees) with that of ""contenders"" (extant saplings 75 cm tall to 5 cm dbh). The resulting analyses relate early radial growth (after reaching 50 cm height) to survival, implicit in the long-term persistence of winners. We focused on the three major tree species of subalpine forests in the northeastern United States: shade-intolerant mountain birch (Betula cordifolia), shade-tolerant balsam fir (Abies balsamea), and highly shade-tolerant red spruce (Picea rubens). For all species, extant canopy trees grew faster than extant saplings at equivalent ages and sizes. For shade-intolerant B. cordifolia, no surviving canopy trees, or even saplings, had slow early growth. Even in shade-tolerant A. balsamea and P. rubens, surprisingly few individuals with slow early growth were represented in the canopy, even though both saplings and canopy trees survived slow growth for up to 50 years later in life. Thus, long-term success in reaching the canopy was strongly determined by fast early growth rates, across all species and life histories.

Sexes reacted differently to larval constraints, and the coupling of larval constraints to adult fitness also was sex specific.

Seven old-growth stands were studied over a 10-yr period using 0.6-1.0 ha plots. Annual mortality of trees >10 cm dbh was 0.5-1.4% among stands (mean 0.7%), The highest mortality rate among canopy trees was exhibited by trees >80 cm dbh. An increase in mortality rate with canopy tree size was evident for two (Tsuga canadensis and Acer saccharum) of the three most abundant species in the forest. The increase in mortality with tree size had implications for canopy turnover and detritus input. Gap disturbance frequency was estimated at 0.008-0.019 forest area/yr, giving a return interval of ∼130 yr or less. Standing death was the most common mode of mortality (59%). Annual rates of snag formation were 1.4 snags/ha for trees >10 cm dbh and 0.4 snags/ha for trees >50 cm dbh. The density of large snags (>50 cm dbh) was 5 snags/ha. Snags accounted for 8% of the total standing tree basal area and 23% of the coarse woody detritus mass (total of 48 Mg/ ha). The mean annual rate of coarse woody detritus input was 3.0 Mg/ha. A decay rate constant was estimated at 0.07, yielding a detritus half-life of 10 yr. Although mean mortality rates and canopy turnover in old cove forests were moderate in comparison with other old forests of eastern North America, input and accumulation of coarse woody detritus were high for the region.

Although A. russatus is diurnally active, it retains the physical activity and body temperature rhythms of nocturnal mammals. We studied the two species in four 1000-m2 enclosures at Ein Gedi, Israel: two experimental enclosures with A. russatus kept alone, and two controls with individuals of both species kept together. We monitored activity with Sherman traps and by studying foraging microhabitat use and efficiency using giving-up densities (GUDs) in food trays. The trays contained broken sunflower seeds mixed in local soil and placed in three microhabitats: under boulders, between boulders, and in the open. Trapping revealed that, in the absence of A. cahirinus, the usually diurnal A. russatus was active both day and night. However, during the day A. russatus still foraged in significantly more patches and to significantly lower GUDs than during the night. Both species, but in particular A. russatus, preferred to forage in the boulder habitat. Spiny mice foraged in the same number of trays in the under- and between-boulder microhabitats, but to lower GUDs in the under-boulder microhabitat, both during the day (A. russatus) and during the night (both species). The nocturnal A. cahirinus exploited more patches with greater efficiency than did A. russatus either during the day or during the night. This result suggests that foraging trade-offs that give each species a competitive advantage along some portion of the resource axis cannot be a mechanism of nocturnal coexistence between the two species.

In essence, the models predict that increasing economic defendability of a resource should lead to increased frequency of aggression among competitors. We question this prediction because it is based on the assumption that individuals that do not possess a resource and must decide whether to attempt aggressive appropriation of another individual's resource face the same economic decision as those that already have possession of a resource and must decide whether to defend against an appropriator's attack. Using an evolutionary game analysis, we explore how changes in group size, clump density, patch richness, and predation hazards affect both the decision to appropriate and defend a resource and interact to predict effects on the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness of individuals. Our model predicts that increasing group size should result in a dome-shaped response of frequency of aggression and a slight decrease in aggressiveness. Increasing clump density is predicted to increase both the frequency of aggression and aggressiveness while increases in clump richness result in reduced aggressiveness at high richness values and a decelerated increase in the frequency of aggression. Finally, predation risk is predicted to increase the frequency of aggression only slightly but to lead to increases in aggressiveness. We compare these predictions to earlier resource defense models.

Specifically, dietary specialists are predicted to evolve mechanisms that reduce costs and enhance excretion of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) that they frequently consume, but are less energetically and/or mechanistically efficient at eliminating novel PSMs. Although examples of trade-offs associated with dietary specialization have been documented among insects, trade-offs have not been investigated in mammalian herbivores. To initially investigate the physiological trade-offs associated with specialization in mammalian herbivores, we determined the impact of ingesting novel PSMs on the energy budgets of a juniper specialist (Neotoma stephensi) and generalist (N. albigula) woodrat. These results were then compared to the impact of juniper intake, the plant species preferred by the specialist, on energy budgets in these same species. Energy budgets were evaluated by measuring apparent metabolizable energy intake (AMEI, energy consumed - energy excreted) and energy expended on basal metabolic rate (BMR) and voluntary wheel running in specialist and generalist woodrats fed a formulated diet with and without PSMs from the novel plant creosote (Larrea tridentata). Both specialists and generalists were energetically impacted by the intake of a diet containing novel PSMs, primarily through decreased intake of creosote diet and increased excretion of energy in the urine. However, specialists were impacted to a greater extent than generalists. Specialists decreased body mass, whereas generalists maintained body mass. Specialists also reduced intake and AMEI when consuming creosote diet compared to control to a greater extent than generalists. In turn, specialists had one-sixth the energy available for energy dependent activities than generalists on a diet containing novel PSMs. These results are in stark contrast to the comparisons between specialists and generalists consuming PSMs from their natural diet.

Along the Middle Rio Grande (New Mexico, USA), impoundment and levee construction have created riparian forests that differ in their inter-flood intervals (IFIs) because some floodplains are still regularly inundated by the flood pulse (i.e., connected), while other floodplains remain isolated from flooding (i.e., disconnected). This research investigates how ecosystem responses to the flood pulse relate to forest IFI by quantifying nutrient and organic matter dynamics in the Rio Grande floodplain during three years of experimental flooding of the disconnected floodplain and during a single year of natural flooding of the connected floodplain. Surface and subsurface conditions in paired sites (control, flood) established in the two floodplain types were monitored to address metabolic and biogeochemical responses. Compared to dry controls, rates of respiration in the flooded sites increased by up to three orders of magnitude during the flood pulse. In the disconnected forest, month-long experimental floods produced widespread anoxia of four-week duration during each of the three years of flooding. In contrast, water in the connected floodplain remained well oxygenated (3-8 ppm). Material budgets for experimental floods showed the disconnected floodplain to be a sink for inorganic nitrogen and suspended solids, but a potential source of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Compared to the main stem of the Rio Grande, flood-water on the connected floodplain contained less nitrate, but comparable concentrations of DOC, phosphate-phosphorus, and ammonium-nitrogen. Results suggest that floodplain IFI drives metabolic and biogeochemical responses during the flood pulse.

The ""driver"" model predicts that invaded communities are highly interactive, with subordinate native species being limited or excluded by competition from the exotic dominants. The ""passenger"" model predicts that invaded communities are primarily structured by noninteractive factors (environmental change, dispersal limitation) that are less constraining on the exotics, which thus dominate. We tested these alternative hypotheses in an invaded, fragmented, and fire-suppressed oak savanna. We examined the impact of two invasive dominant perennial grasses on community structure using a reduction (mowing of aboveground biomass) and removal (weeding of above- and belowground biomass) experiment conducted at different seasons and soil depths. We examined the relative importance of competition vs. dispersal limitation with experimental seed additions. Competition by the dominants limits the abundance and reproduction of many native and exotic species based on their increased performance with removals and mowing. The treatments resulted in increased light availability and bare soil; soil moisture and N were unaffected. Although competition was limiting for some, 36 of 79 species did not respond to the treatments or declined in the absence of grass cover. Seed additions revealed that some subordinates are dispersal limited; competition alone was insufficient to explain their rarity even though it does exacerbate dispersal inefficiencies by lowering reproduction. While the net effects of the dominants were negative, their presence restricted woody plants, facilitated seedling survival with moderate disturbance (i.e., treatments applied in the fall), or was not the primary limiting factor for the occurrence of some species. Finally, the species most functionally distinct from the dominants (forbs, woody plants) responded most significantly to the treatments. This suggests that relative abundance is determined more by trade-offs relating to environmental conditions (long-term fire suppression) than to traits relating to resource capture (which should most impact functionally similar species).

Nitrogen processing in soils is critical to understanding these changes, since soils typically are the largest N sink in forests. To elucidate soil mechanisms that underlie shifts in N cycling across a wide gradient of N supply, we added 15NH415NO3 at nine treatment levels ranging in geometric sequence from 0.2 kg to 640 kg N·ha-1·yr-1 to an unpolluted old-growth temperate forest in southern Chile. We recovered roughly half of 15N tracers in 0-25 cm of soil, primarily in the surface 10 cm. Low to moderate rates of N supply failed to stimulate N leaching, which suggests that most unrecovered 15N was transferred from soils to unmeasured sinks above ground. However, soil solution losses of nitrate increased sharply at inputs >160 kg N·ha-1·yr -1, corresponding to a threshold of elevated soil N availability and declining 15N retention in soil. Soil organic matter (<5.6 mm) dominated tracer retention at low rates of N input, but coarse roots and particulate organic matter became increasingly important at higher N supply. Coarse roots and particulate organic matter together accounted for 38% of recovered 15N in soils at the highest N inputs and may explain a substantial fraction of the ""missing N"" often reported in studies of fates of N inputs to forests. Contrary to expectations, N additions did not stimulate gross N cycling, potential nitrification, or ammonium oxidizer populations. Our results indicate that the nonlinearity in N retention and loss resulted directly from excessive N supply relative to sinks, independent of plant-soil-microbial feedbacks. However, N additions did induce a sharp decrease in microbial biomass C:N that is predicted by N saturation theory, and which could increase long-term N storage in soil organic matter by lowering the critical C:N ratio for net N mineralization. All measured sinks accumulated 15N tracers across the full gradient of N supply, suggesting that short-term nonlinearity in N retention resulted from saturation of uptake kinetics, not uptake capacity, in plant, soil, and microbial pools.",63,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,15 N stable isotope | Ammonium nitrate | Dissolved organic nitrogen | Nitrification | Nitrogen fertilizer | Nitrogen saturation | Nutrient budget | Old-growth temperate forest | Roots | Soil organic matter,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,343,NA,NA,NA,NA

Two previously published data sets for other taxa are also considered. We adjusted band sums (number of species per latitudinal band) for longitudinal area by constructing species-area curves for each band. Area-corrected richness patterns differed substantially from raw band sums, although both confirmed a strong, mid-tropical peak in richness. An MDE model accounted for 47% of the adjusted pattern, whereas area alone explained 13% of variation. Area-adjusted band sum data proved preferable to coastal transect data from the same data set. MDE was relatively more important in smaller latitudinal domains and/or for taxa with relatively large ranges. On fundamental grounds, we concluded that MDE randomizations based on empirical ranges are more appropriate than those based on theoretical range size distributions.

The monotonic species-area relationship was found in lakes in developed watersheds but not in pristine lakes.

Herbivores must not only detoxify PSMs, but they may also deal with energetic constraints such as reduced food intake, mass loss, increased excretion of energy, and increased metabolic demands. We hypothesized that the energetic consequences of consuming PSMs will significantly compromise apparent metabolizable energy intake (AMEI) and energy expenditure in mammalian herbivores. Furthermore, we hypothesized that foraging strategy would influence the degree to which plant consumption impacts energy budgets, such that dietary specialists would be less impacted than generalists when both are consuming the plant species preferred by the specialist. Hypotheses were tested by comparing AMEI and energy expended on basal metabolic rate (BMR) and locomotion in a juniper specialist (Neotoma stephensi) and generalist (N. albigula) woodrat fed control diet and diet containing juniper foliage (Juniperus monosperma). In general, the intake of PSMs in juniper increased the energy excreted in urine and feces in both specialist and generalist woodrats. Specialist woodrats minimized the costs associated with the intake of juniper by ingesting more juniper diet, thereby increasing energy intake, and reducing energy expended on BMR and locomotor activity. Generalist woodrats also decreased locomotor activity on a juniper diet but did not increase intake and maintained BMR. In turn, specialist woodrats had twice as much energy available for activities such as reproduction when consuming a juniper diet than generalists. These results suggest that the intake of PSMs impinges on AMEI and compromises energy expenditure, but that the impact of PSMs on energy budgets is relative to ecological experience with PSMs. Moreover, compensatory feeding, metabolic depression, and low activity may be strategies employed by specialist woodrats that can mitigate the cost of processing PSMs, but these strategies may be constrained in generalist woodrats.",99,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,AMEI | BMR | Generalist | Locomotion | Mammalian herbivore | Neotoma albigula | Neotoma stephensi | Plant secondary metabolite | Specialist,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,346,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using the residuals from a regression of body mass on a linear measure of body size is one of the most common methods of measuring condition and has been used in many vertebrate taxa. Recently, the use of this method has been criticized because assumptions are likely violated. We tested several assumptions regarding the use of this method with body composition and morphometric data from five species of small mammals and with statistical simulations. We tested the assumptions that the relationship between body mass and body size is linear, and that the proportion of mass associated with energy reserves is independent of body size. In addition, we tested whether the residuals from reduced major axis (RMA) regression or major axis (MA) regression performed better than the residuals from ordinary least squares (OLS) regression as indices of body condition. We found no evidence of nonlinear relationships between body mass and body size. Relative energy reserves (fat and lean dry mass) were generally independent or weakly dependent on body size. Residuals from MA and RMA regression consistently explained less variation in body composition than OLS regression. Using statistical simulations, we compared the effects of violations of the assumption that true condition and residual indices are independent of body size on the OLS, MA, and RMA procedures and found that OLS performed better than the RMA and MA procedures. Despite recent criticisms of residuals from mass-size OLS regressions, these indices of body condition appear to satisfy critical assumptions. Although some caution is warranted when using residuals, especially when both interindividual variation in body size and measurement error are high, we found no reason to reject OLS residuals as legitimate indices of body condition.",786,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Body condition | Body mass | Body size | Clethrionomys gapperi | Fat | Microtus pennsylvanicus | Neotoma cinerea | Peromyscus maniculatus | Reduced major axis | Regression analysis | Residuals | Tamias amoenus,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,347,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, low soil seed densities may result from low seed production, and even modest seed longevity can buffer against fluctuating seed production, potentially limiting density-dependent mortality and ensuring that seeds are available for germination when recruitment success is likely. To investigate whether seed banking affects woody seedling dynamics in the southern Appalachians, we monitored seed rain, seed bank, and seedling densities to (1) determine the prevalence of seed banking among southern Appalachian woody species, (2) quantify annual seed mortality rates for three seed-banking species using a Bayesian statistical approach, and (3) assess whether or not the ability to seed bank affects recruitment rates. We found that the seeds of eight woody taxa (Acer rubrum, Betula spp., Liriodendron tulipifera, Nyssa sylvatica, Robinia pseudoacacia, Rubus spp., Sassafras albidum, and Vitis sp.) remain viable in the soil for more than one year. Seeds of six taxa (Amelanchier spp., Acer pennsylvanicum, Carya spp., Quercus prinus, Quercus rubra, and Tsuga canadensis) were never found in the soil seed bank, despite high seed production and germination. For three species, a substantial proportion of seeds available for germination came from dispersal events two or more years in the past (Acer rubrum 12-37%, Betula spp. 59-73%, Liriodendron tulipifera 40-76%), even though annual seed mortality was high (Acer rubrum 70-98%, Betula spp. 21-81%, Liriodendron tulipifera 12-59%). In years when no seeds fall in local microsites (approximately one in five years), seed banks are the only source of seedling recruitment for these species. Comparing our results to those of previous studies led to valuable insights: first, that seeds of Acer rubrum and Betula spp. suffer high mortality while being incorporated into the seed bank; and second, that seed decay varies greatly over relatively small spatial scales (i.e., within a watershed).

Specifically, two contrasting hypotheses were addressed: (1) herbivores increase the availability of soil nutrients and subsequently primary productivity, and (2) herbivores decrease nutrient availability and primary productivity because they increase the dominance of non-preferred, nutrient-poor, tree species. Although C:N increased with herbivore density, the annual increase in basal area (an indicator of aboveground productivity) increased with herbivore density. According to an analysis of the tree communities on the study islands, herbivory may also be causing a shift in the tree community toward non-preferred species, and thus, over a longer time scale, both nutrient availability and productivity are expected to decline.

We explored the effects of density-dependence and changing climate on growth of juvenile sockeye salmon and the densities of their zooplankton prey in the Wood River system of southwestern Alaska. We fit dynamic time-series models to data collected between 1962 and 2002 describing growth of juvenile sockeye, timing of spring ice breakup, and summer zooplankton densities. The timing of spring breakup has moved about seven days earlier now than it was in the early 1960s. Our analyses suggest that most of this shift has been a response to the warm phase of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation that persisted from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s. This progression toward earlier spring breakup dates was associated with warmer summer water temperatures and increased zooplankton (especially Daphnia) densities, which translated into increased sockeye growth during their first year of life. The number of spawning adults that produced each year class of sockeye had a strong negative effect on juvenile sockeye growth rates, so that the size of the density-dependent effect was, on average, twice as large as the effect of spring breakup date.

We tested the relative importance of local conditions, connectivity, and dynamics of host tree patches on the metapopulation dynamics of a red-listed epiphytic moss, Neckera pennata, in Sweden. Repeated surveys of the species and its host trees were conducted at three sites over a period of six years. There was a positive effect of connectivity, and colonizations mainly occurred in the vicinity of occupied trees. Colonizations were also less likely on strongly leaning trees. Local extinctions sometimes occurred from small trees with low local abundances but were most often caused by treefall. Simulations of the future (100 years) dynamics of the system showed that the metapopulation size will be overestimated unless the increased local extinction rate imposed by the dynamics of the trees is accounted for.

We synthesize research from the fields of ecology and hydrology to address the issue of deep drainage in arid and semiarid regions. We start with a recently developed hydrological model that accurately simulates soil water potential and geochemical profiles measured in thick (>50 m), unconsolidated vadose zones. Model results indicate that, since the climate change that marked the onset of the Holocene period 10 000-15 000 years ago, there has been no deep drainage in vegetated interdrainage areas and that continuous, relatively low (<-1 MPa) soil water potentials have been maintained at depths of 2-3 m. A conceptual model consistent with these results proposes that the native, xeric-shrub-dominated, plant communities that gained dominance during the Holocene generated and maintained these conditions. We present three lines of ecological evidence that support the conceptual model. First, xeric shrubs have sufficiently deep rooting systems with low extraction limits to generate the modeled conditions. Second, the characteristic deep-rooted soil-plant systems store sufficient water to effectively buffer deep soil from climatic fluctuations in these dry environments, allowing stable conditions to persist for long periods of time. And third, adaptations resulting in deep, low-extraction-limit rooting systems confer significant advantages to xeric shrubs in arid and semiarid environments. We then consider conditions in arid and semiarid regions in which the conceptual model may not apply, leading to the expectation that portions of many arid and semiarid watersheds supply some deep drainage. Further ecohydrologic research is required to elucidate critical climatic and edaphic thresholds, evaluate the role of important physiological processes (such as hydraulic redistribution), and evaluate the role of deep roots in terms of carbon costs, nutrient uptake, and whole-plant development. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.",146,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,7,7,Deep drainage | Ecohydrology | Groundwater recharge | Xeric shrubs,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,353,NA,NA,NA,NA
