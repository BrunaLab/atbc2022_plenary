Empirical research on dimorphic plant species supports this hypothesis. To date, of 44 dimorphic angiosperms for which RA has been reported in the literature, RA is greater in females than males in 40 species, is equal in four, and in no species is it greater in males. 2 In many instances where differential RA occurs, sexual dimorphism in morphological or physiological traits has been reported. This dimorphism is often attributed to the differing costs of reproduction or to selection to counteract such costs. 3 We investigated RA and other morphological and physiological characters in Gynatrix pulchella, a dimorphic species that we found ranges from dioecious to subdioecious or gynodioecious, depending on season and locality. Our results showed that contrary to our predictions functionally male plants allocated significantly more biomass to reproduction than female plants across three populations. Greater male RA was due to a combination of larger, more numerous flowers and lower leaf biomass per branch than females. 4 There were no detectable costs of greater RA in males in terms of decreased overall growth or increased mortality. Additionally, leaf nitrogen content was greater in males than in females and there were no between-sex differences in gas exchange. 5 The finding that male plants allocate significantly more resources to reproduction than females in G. pulchella is apparently a unique case. However, equivalent RA for the sexes does occur in gynodioecious species and we suggest that higher male RA in gynodioecious plants may be more common than predictions based on sexual systems involving pure males. 6 Our results challenge accepted theory that allocation to reproduction should be greater in female plants than in males. In light of these findings, predictions regarding which sex should allocate more to reproduction need to be revised to accommodate the diversity of plant sexual systems. © 2006 The Authors.",43,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Dioecy | Gynatrix pulchella | Gynodioecy | Reproductive allocation | Reproductive costs | Resource allocation | Sexual dimorphism | Sexual system | Subdioecy,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,1,NA,NA

Predicted changes in climate point to a continuation of the recent observed trends in increased precipitation and high-flow events in Northern Europe. 2 The study focused on the dispersal characteristics of M. guttatus, and especially the roles of vegetative fragmentation with increasing water velocities, subsequent fragment survival, regeneration and colonization, as well as the buoyancy, survival and germination success of seeds. 3 M. guttatus was found to fragment readily under velocities typical of high flow conditions and even small fragments had high survival, regeneration and colonization capacity. 4 Large numbers of small (< 0.02 mg) seeds are produced; however, seeds have a short buoyancy period so the timing and magnitude of high-flow events is crucial in determining potential dispersal distances. Seeds germinate readily both in water and on sand with an average 33% germination within 9 days. 5 The dual strategy of dispersal by vegetative fragments and seeds, together with the opportunity of dispersing the two types of propagules during different periods of the year, facilitates local dominance by M. guttatus as well as long-distance colonization. As a result, the rate of spread of M. guttatus into inundation communities along rivers is likely to increase with more frequent high-flow events, especially if these coincide with the growing season. Thus, predicting the response of riparian invasive species to environmental change requires not only an understanding of the role of climate in plant demography but also the impact of changes in hydrology on rates of spread. © 2006 The Authors.",90,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Biological invasion | Climate change | Flooding | Fragment | Regeneration | Riparian | Spread,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,2,NA,NA

Catena topography creates variation in soil texture and grazing that may have important physiological implications for these species. Through a combination of laboratory and field experiments, we tested whether variation in soil texture and grazing differentially affected growth, photosynthesis, leaf enzyme activities and nitrogen assimilation of the two species. 2 In the laboratory, simulated grazing (weekly clipping at 7 cm above soil) increased photosynthesis and enzyme activities for D. macroblephara. Clipping also increased photosynthesis for T. triandra, but did not affect enzyme activity. D. macroblephara and T. triandra were affected oppositely by soil texture; enzyme activities and photosynthesis were greater for D. macroblephara in sandy soils but greater for T. triandra in fine-textured soils. 3 Across a natural catena gradient, species abundances of D. macroblephara and T. triandra were negatively correlated with each other and related to grazing frequency in opposite ways, D. macroblephara positively and T. triandra negatively. In a field experiment, rates of 15NO3- uptake for unclipped plants of D. macroblephara and T. triandra were similar and did not vary with soil texture. However, when clipped, 15NO3- uptake was stimulated in both species but in opposite ways across a gradient of percentage sand, positive for D. macroblephara and negative for T. triandra. 4 These results suggest that species responded to defoliation and variation in water availability created by different soil textures. At sites where D. macroblephara and T. triandra co-occur, catena variation in soil texture and grazing may provide spatial variation in habitat suitability. Moreover, herbivory may promote species coexistence by facilitating differential physiological responses to topographic and soil heterogeneity. 5 This study illustrates how interactions between a direct biotic process and an indirect environmental variable can cause different plant physiological responses that may promote species coexistence in a heterogeneous environment. © 2006 The Authors.",32,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,15 N uptake | Catena position | Defoliation | Environmental heterogeneity | Enzyme activity | Photosynthesis | Soil texture | Species coexistence | Topographic variation,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,3,NA,NA

In the field, however, 1-year-old plants tended to have higher levels of herbivory than 5-year-old plants. 6 There was a trend towards lower herbivory in trees that had been fertilized. Additionally, leaves from fertilized trees were significantly less palatable to specialist herbivores. 7 In 1-year-old plants, the abundance of ants in domatia had no effect on herbivory of nearby leaves. In contrast, ant abundance and herbivory were negatively correlated for 5-year-old trees, demonstrating that ants provide effective defence only for older plants. 8 These results suggest that understanding ant-plant-herbivore relationships requires examining how biotic and abiotic factors and their interactions change with plant ontogeny.

Habitat overlap can facilitate competition for suitable sites and threaten the persistence of parental taxa, especially those in small populations. 2 Here we examine ecological differentiation between the endangered North American red mulberry (Morus rubra), introduced white mulberry (M. alba) and red × white hybrids in a reciprocal transplant experiment. Fitness of red, white and hybrid mulberry was estimated as survival and above-ground biomass of seedling and juvenile life stages, transplanted into open (white habitat) and shaded (red habitat) forest environments. In addition, all taxa, including reciprocal hybrids (R × W, W × R), were compared in a common garden in full sun. 3 In the reciprocal transplant study, red mulberry was consistently less fit than white and hybrid mulberry regardless of transplant habitat; F 1 hybrids were as fit as white mulberry. In the common garden, red mulberry and hybrids with red mothers had lower fitness than white mulberry and hybrids with white mothers. Reciprocal hybrid crosses differed significantly with respect to survival and cumulative fitness, but not biomass. 4 Red mulberry is not ecologically differentiated from white or hybrid mulberry in the three transplant environments examined; rather, it is consistently the least fit taxon. Therefore, all else being equal, hybridization with white mulberry and the subsequent presence of hybrids will place red mulberry at a strong disadvantage during establishment. 5 The results highlight the potential effect of hybridization by introduced species on the abundance of native species, particularly at the northern extremes of its geographical range, where populations are small and native environments may be degraded or at the limits of ecological tolerance. © 2006 The Authors.",26,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Demographic swamping | Establishment disadvantage | Fitness | Habitat differentiation | Hybridization | Introduced species | Moraceae | Morus alba | Morus rubra | Small populations,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,5,NA,NA

The empirical evidence of seed limitation is, however, still weak, and mostly correlative. Unambiguous evidence can only be provided by long-term transplantation experiments. 2 We used an 11-year experiment, in which seeds of six perennial forest herbs were sown into 43 patches that were either occupied or unoccupied by the target species, to investigate the importance of seed limitation. In addition, we determined whether short-term (1-4 years) and long-term (11 years) experimental assessments provided similar results. Given that long-term experiments are generally not possible, we examined whether environmental factors and vegetation composition can correctly identify suitable habitats. 3 Our results show that the distribution of the forest herbs investigated were limited by the availability of seeds, and that this pattern was qualitatively consistent, over time. However, the number of initially unoccupied patches with successful recruitment decreased with time. 4 The fact that a similar trend in recruitment success was found in sowing experiments in initially occupied patches suggests that the decrease in recruitment success over time cannot solely be attributed to habitat suitability. Environmental factors, such as soil nutrients and vegetation composition, were in some cases correlated with recruitment success, but the strength of these relationships was often weak. 5 Our results support the notion that seed availability is an important limitation of plant species abundance and distribution. The results also point to several difficulties related to the empirical assessment of seed limitation. We therefore suggest a protocol that should enhance the quality of future experiments. © 2006 The Authors.",85,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Colonization | Dispersal limitation | Metapopulation dynamics | Patch occupancy | Perennial herbs | Plant distributions | Recruitment | Seed sowing | Soil nutrients | Transplantation experiments | Vegetation composition,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,6,NA,NA

While plant chemistry and structural defences have received the most attention, plant architecture may also be important. We examined patterns and consequences of insect herbivory for two distinct architectural morphs (prostrate or erect) of the perennial shrub, Baccharis pilularis (Asteraceae, coyote bush) in coastal California, USA. 2 For B. pilularis, differences in plant height, branch architecture and leaf size persisted in a common garden, consistent with previous evidence suggesting a genetic basis for dimorphism in plant architecture. 3 In both naturally occurring plants and in a common garden experiment, the composition of the herbivore assemblage varied strongly with plant architectural morph. Prostrate plants attracted higher densities of a gall-forming midge (Rhopalomyia californica, Diptera), whereas erect plants supported more moth galls (Gnorimoschema baccharisella, Lepidoptera) and experienced greater folivory. Furthermore, architectural traits were correlated with herbivory levels both across and within architectural morphs. 4 Prostrate plants had greater reproductive output (flowers or seeds) than erect plants in the presence of herbivores. However, under experimental reductions of herbivory spanning 40 months, the morphs had similar reproductive output, demonstrating that herbivores have the potential to act as agents of selection on the dimorphism in plant architecture. 5 These results confirm that intraspecific variation in plant traits can shape the composition of herbivore assemblages. Furthermore, in this system, herbivores alter the performance of the architectural morphs, suggesting a dynamic system of feedbacks between the population genetic and community levels. © 2006 The Authors.",51,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Baccharis pilularis | Community genetics | Genetic polymorphism | Intraspecific genetic diversity | Natural selection | Parasitoid | Tri-trophic interaction,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,7,NA,NA

The emphasis on forests in general is important for two reasons. First, forests often occupy areas receiving high rates of atmospheric deposition of N. Second, compared with herb-dominated communities, about which much is known regarding response to excess N, forests generally display greater biological and structural complexity. The more specific focus on the herbaceous layer - here defined as all vascular (herbaceous and woody) plants ≤ 1 m in height - is warranted because most of the species diversity of forests occurs in the herb layer. 2 Most responses of forest ecosystems to N saturation, defined here as ecosystem supply of N exceeding ecosystem demand for N, can be characterized by two complementary hypotheses, each emphasizing different facets of ecosystem structure and function. One focuses on ecosystem processes, such as net primary productivity, whereas the other addresses seasonal patterns of concentrations of NO3- in stream water. Although neither hypothesis considers the effects of chronically elevated N deposition on forest herbs, both share a prediction - a dramatic increase in availability of NO3- - that is relevant to forest herb response. Such a shift towards NO3- dominance has important implications for changes in herbaceous layer dynamics. For example, increases in soil NO3- pools can increase invasibility by exotic species. Also, because preferential use of NH4+ vs. NO3- can be highly species-specific among forest herbs, predominance of NO 3- availability can bring about further changes in herb layer species composition. Also important to forest herbs is the tendency for enhanced mobility of NO3- to increase mobility and decrease availability of essential cations, such as Ca2+. 3 The response of plant species of the herbaceous layer of forest ecosystems to excess N availability can arise from N-mediated changes in several processes. Here I identify six - competition, herbivory, mycorrhizal infection, disease, species invasions and exotic earthworm activity - and discuss how they respond to excess N and how this response affects the herb layer of forests. With the exception of the activity of exotic earthworms (which is correlated with, but not necessarily caused by, high N deposition), there is compelling evidence that all processes respond sensitively to N deposition and that this response generally leads to drastic shifts in species composition and decreases in biodiversity of forest herb communities. 4 A hypothesis is suggested - the nitrogen homogeneity hypothesis - that predicts loss of biodiversity in forest ecosystems experiencing chronically elevated N deposition. This hypothesis is based on the decrease in spatial heterogeneity of N availability that is typically high in forest soils under N-limited conditions. © 2006 The Author.",304,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Biogeochemistry | Forest herbaceous communities | Nitrogen saturation | Vegetation science,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,8,NA,NA

The aim was to investigate how the light capturing ability per above-ground biomass and leaf nitrogen changes in an entire community and to reveal whether different species respond similarly to changes in soil conditions and competition. 2 Species becoming dominant at high soil resources have intrinsically low leaf area ratios (LAR) and lower tissue nitrogen concentration, and hence relatively high nitrogen use efficiency. These traits lead to dominance when soil resources allow rapid growth so that benefits arising from the ability to locate leaves above neighbours and thereby increasing asymmetry of competition, become more crucial. 3 In contrast to our expectations, above-ground efficiency of nitrogen use on the community level (aNUE) increased along the productivity gradient. Species level nitrogen use efficiency was unaffected by variation in site productivity; the increase in community aNUE was solely as a consequence of changes in species composition. 4 Light absorption per unit of above-ground mass, ΦM, declined significantly at the community level and also in most species, indicating that light use efficiency increased with increased site productivity and LAI. 5 Light absorption per unit of leaf nitrogen, ΦN, as an indicator of the ratio NUE/LUE showed no clear pattern on the community level because both NUE and LUE tend to increase with increased productivity. At the species level, ΦN tends to decrease because NUE did not change with stand productivity. 6 Some subordinate species responded by enlarging their LAR to increased competition. Additionally, these species were the most responsive in their leaf chlorophyll/nitrogen ratio to changes in light conditions, which shows that physiological plasticity is important for species that are unable to compete for light with the ability to position their leaves above those of other species. 7 This study shows how plasticity in above-ground growth pattern and nitrogen allocation differs between species with respect to increased soil fertility and competition, leading to distinctive strategies of survival. Light partitioning analysis reveals that increased competition for light, resulting in changes in species composition, is the key factor that leads to decoupling of species and community level acclimation. © 2006 The Authors.",30,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Canopy | Coexistence | Competition | Dominance | Leaf area ratio | Light partitioning | Light use efficiency | Nitrogen | Plasticity | Species composition,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,9,NA,NA

Here a balance sheet of seed predation is drawn up for Pinus sylvestris, based on mortality caused by its main seed predators. This species is of special interest because trees carry seeds throughout the year and can therefore support specialist as well as generalist seed predators. Also, its regeneration in Scotland is weak and some of its main seed predators (red squirrels, crossbills, wood ants) are themselves threatened. 2 Field data from two P. sylvestris forests were used to estimate rates of predation on seeds due to pre- and post-dispersal predators, including both specialists and generalists. The rates of predation changed systematically over time and were fitted to time-dependent functions. The resulting functions were incorporated into a model, which was solved numerically to determine the fate of a cohort of seeds. 3 On average, approximately 20% of seeds in the cohort were consumed by pre-dispersal seed predators, approximately 25% of seeds by post-dispersal seed predators, and approximately 55% of seeds were still alive at the end of 2 years. This reduces the seed pool for regeneration of P. sylvestris, but is unlikely to be a serious problem for regeneration. 4 Seed survival was most sensitive to the rate at which seeds became invulnerable to further seed predation, and to the rate of seed dispersal from cones on trees. Seed survival was less sensitive to seed predation. However, among seed predators, carabids feeding on loose seeds and birds eating seeds in open cones were the most important. 5 Cones open as they dry out, and the timing of seed dispersal is therefore weather-dependent. Late opening of cones had a deleterious effect on seed survival because it led to an increase in pre-dispersal seed predation. Thus, in a period of climate change, patterns of seed predation would be expected also to change, altering the success of regeneration. © 2006 The Authors.",20,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Crossbill | Native pinewoods | Natural regeneration | Red squirrel | Scots pine | Seed dispersal | Seed fate | Seed survival,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,10,NA,NA

To test this issue and explore the conditions that foster resistance, we experimentally added Norway maple (Acer platanoides L.) seeds to intact forests for 3 years and monitored emergence, survivorship and height growth for 5 years. 2 Seed additions (250 seeds-1 m2) were replicated in situ in combinations of light (deep shade vs. small gaps), soil fertility (NO 3 and pH), and variation in soil moisture as influenced by topography (hill slopes vs. flat areas at slope bases) in five eastern deciduous forests in central New York and southern Connecticut. We then parameterized a model with this data to project long-term rates of sapling recruitment. 3 Seedlings had high survival and low growth rates in the deep shade, suggesting that this species readily forms a seedling bank in intact forests. By age 5, annual survivorship reached 93% in deep shade and 98% in small gaps. Median seedling heights were ≤ 10 cm in all treatments after 5 years, though the largest seedlings were markedly taller in gaps. Mean year 5 densities of all experimental seedlings (ages 3-5 years) were 14 seedlings-1 m 2 (± 2.4 SE) in the shade and 19 seedlings-1 m 2 (± 3.5 SE) in small gaps. 4 While seedlings colonized in all conditions, resistance to invasion varied markedly; resistance was highest in deeply shaded, acidic conditions (pH < 4.5). Small gaps initially promoted invasion, but by age 4 shade survivorship rates were equivalent to gaps. Higher soil pH (especially > 6) also significantly increased survivorship, particularly in deep shade. Shading's main effect was to suppress height growth. Overall, the model predicted impressive sapling recruitment; even in deeply shaded, acidic conditions, approximately 1% of seeds emerge and survive to become saplings. 5 Intact forests only weakly resisted A. platanoides colonization, but strongly suppressed its rate of invasion. As such, the frequency of disturbance, though ultimately unnecessary for A. platanoides invasions, will strongly influence its near-term invasiveness.

Half of the HIP trees were treated when first defoliated with boric acid to reduce the A. gallica inoculum potential (BHIP trees). The ability of in situ rhizomorphs to colonize plant material was similar for LIP and BHIP, but was lower than in HIP trees, indicating that the boric acid treatment reduced the level of A. gallica inoculum. 3 Tree growth was similar between treatments as determined by dendrochronological comparisons. Although defoliation greatly reduced both tree growth and sapwood starch reserves at the beginning of autumn, growth response to defoliation and sapwood starch concentration at the beginning of autumn were similar for LIP, BHIP and HIP trees. 4 HIP trees suffered considerably greater crown deterioration and mortality following defoliation than either BHIP or LIP trees (62%, 32% and 5% mortality rates, respectively). The trees that died had very low sapwood starch concentrations. In addition, at similar levels of sapwood starch, HIP trees were much more likely to die than LIP or BHIP trees. 5 Two other factors influenced tree mortality. Past stress that reduced the tree growth a few years prior to the start of the experiment was shown to alter the tree's ability to cope with defoliation. Oak mildew selectively infected the defoliated trees and increased the severity of the defoliation stress. 6 Thus, trees subjected to high level of A. gallica inoculum had a lower ability to overcome the defoliation stress. These findings support the forest decline models developed by Manion in 1991 and show that it is important to take into account the role of opportunistic pathogens in tree mortality processes. © 2006 The Authors.",78,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Armillaria gallica | Carbohydrate reserves | Community interactions | Defoliation | Forest decline | Opportunistic pathogens | Quercus robur | Starch | Time-lag effect,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,12,NA,NA

This loss of diversity may reduce the evolutionary potential to adapt to changing environments, and may cause immediate loss of fitness (cf. inbreeding depression). Together with other population size-dependent stochastic processes, this may lead to increased probabilities of population extinction. 2 This set of processes and theories forms the core of conservation genetics and has developed into the conservation genetics paradigm. Many empirical studies have concentrated on the relationship between population size and genetic diversity, and in many cases evidence was found that small populations of plants do indeed have lower levels of genetic diversity and increased homozygosity. Although less empirical attention has been given to the relationship between low genetic diversity, fitness and, in particular, evolutionary potential, the paradigm is now widely accepted. 3 Here we present five areas of the paradigm which could be refined, i.e. the 'rough' edges of the conservation genetics paradigm. 4 Treating population size and isolation not as interchangeable parameters but as separate parameters affecting population genetics in different ways could allow more accurate predictions of the effects of landscape fragmentation on the genetic diversity and viability of populations. 5 There is evidence that inbreeding depression may be a genotype-specific phenomenon, rather than a population parameter. This sheds new light on the link between population inbreeding depression and the expected increased probability of extinction. 6 Modern eco-genomics offers the opportunity to study the population genetics of functional genes, to the extent that the role of selection can be distinguished from the effects of drift, and allowing improved insights into the effects of loss of genetic diversity on evolutionary potential. 7 Incorporating multispecies considerations may result in the generally accepted notion that small populations are at peril being called into question. For instance, small populations may be less capable of sustaining parasites or herbivores. 8 Comparative studies of endangered, common and invasive species may be a valuable approach to developing conservation biology from a phenomenological case study discipline into one investigating the general principles of what sustains biodiversity. 9 The issues discussed set an agenda for further research within conservation genetics and may lead to a further refinement of our understanding and prediction of the genetic effects of habitat fragmentation. They also underline the need to integrate ecological and genetic approaches to the conservation of biodiversity, rather than regarding them as opposites. © 2006 The Authors.",193,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,Dispersal | Eco-genomics | Habitat fragmentation | Invasions | Multispecies interaction,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,13,NA,NA

Environmental filtering is thought to result in the formation of groups of species with similar traits that tend to co-occur more often than expected by chance alone, known as Beta guilds. At a smaller scale, within a single Beta guild, species may be partitioned into Alpha guilds - groups of species that have similar resource use and hence should tend not to co-occur at small scales due the principle of limiting similarity. 2 This research investigates the effects of successional age and the presence of an invasive exotic species on Alpha and Beta guild structuring within plant communities along two successional river terrace sequences in the Waimakariri braided river system in New Zealand. 3 Fifteen sites were sampled, six with and nine without the Russel lupin (Lupinus polyphyllus), an invasive exotic species. At each site, species presence/absence was recorded in 100 circular quadrats (5 cm in diameter) at 30-cm intervals along a 30-m transect. Guild proportionality (Alpha guild structuring) was tested for using two a priori guild classifications each containing three guilds, and cluster analysis was used to test for environmental structuring between sites. 4 Significant assembly rules based on Alpha guild structuring were found, particularly for the monocot and dicot guild. Guild proportionality increased with increasing ecological age, which indicated an increase in the relative importance of competitive structuring at later stages of succession. This provides empirical support for Weiher and Keddy's theoretical model of community assembly. 5 Lupins were associated with altered Alpha and Beta guild structuring at early mid successional sites. Lupin-containing sites had higher silt content than sites without lupins, and this could have altered the strength and scale of competitive structuring within the communities present. 6 This research adds to the increasing evidence for the existence of assembly rules based on limiting similarity within plant communities, and demonstrates the need to incorporate gradients of environmental and competitive adversity when investigating the rules that govern community assembly. © 2006 The Authors.",71,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Assembly rules | Community structure | Competition | Guild proportionality | Invasion | Limiting similarity | Lupinus polyphyllus | Primary succession | Trait patterns,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,14,NA,NA

Several individual traits have been shown to determine flooding tolerance, but the interrelationships among these traits and their effects on plant performance still remain largely unknown. 2 Here, we aim for a more coherent understanding of submergence tolerance, by investigating whether different traits are alternative strategies to enhance survival under water or whether these traits act in concert. 3 Because responses to submergence may be taxon-specific, we chose a multiple-species approach that allowed phylogenetic comparisons. The phenotypic traits investigated in the current study were constitutively different in species originating from frequently flooded habitats than in species from dry habitats: wet species were taller and had a higher specific leaf area (SLA), chlorophyll content, aerenchyma content, and longer longevity of terrestrial and 'aquatic' leaves compared with species from dry habitats. Moreover, the frequently flooded species appeared to be more plastic for these traits in response to submergence. Neither the phylogenetic component nor the light climate under water were important for the expression of the submergence-related traits. 4 Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that these traits were divided in two independent clusters structured either around the petiole (i.e. aerenchyma content and shoot length) or the leaf lamina (i.e. SLA, chlorophyll content and leaf longevity). Shoot length and aerenchyma content of the petiole were also positively correlated, albeit not significantly. A positive correlation between SLA and leaf longevity was observed under water, indicating that thinner leaves may have an increased potential for gas exchange, resulting in increased leaf longevity and plant survival. 5 Path analyses indicated significant positive effects of the two trait clusters on plant performance during full submergence. 6 Our study shows that multiple ecophysiological traits act in concert to fine tune responses to dynamic and unpredictable environments such as river floodplains. © 2006 The Authors.",113,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Aerenchyma | Comparative study | Ecophysiology | Elongation | Flooding | Gas exchange | Multivariate analysis | Plasticity | Shoot morphology | Specific leaf area,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,15,NA,NA

The need to quantify PP in a simple manner in comparative ecological studies has resulted in the prevalence of various indices instead of the classic approaches, i.e. a comparison of slopes in the norms of reactions (trait vs. environment plots). 2 The objectives of this study were: (i) to review the most common methods for quantitative estimation of PP; (ii) to apply them to a specific case study of growth and shoot-root allocation responses to irradiance in seedlings of four woody species grown at 1%, 6%, 20% and 100% full sunlight; and (iii) to propose new methods of estimating PP. 3 The 17 different plasticity indices analysed rendered disparate results, with cross-overs in species PP rankings. Statistical comparisons of PP among species were not possible with most of the indices due to the lack of confidence intervals. The non-linear responses of the traits made the use of the slope of the reaction norm to quantify PP unrealistic, and raised awareness on values derived from studies that consider just two environments. 4 We propose an alternative approach to quantify PP based on phenotypic distances among individuals of a given species exposed to different environments, which is summarized in a relative distance plasticity index (RDPI) that allows for statistical comparisons of PP between species (or populations within species). RDPI was significantly correlated with 12 out of the 17 PP indices analysed. An index including the environmental range leading to the different phenotypes (environmentally standardized plasticity index, ESPI), and thus expressing plasticity per unit of environmental change, is also proposed. 5 The new indexes can statistically segregate and unambiguously rank species according to their PP, which can foster a better understanding of plant ecology and evolution, particularly when common protocols are used by different investigators. © 2006 The Authors.",590,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,Index of phenotypic plasticity | Norm of reaction | Normal distribution | Phenotypic variability | Pinus | Plastic response to environment | Quercus | Responsiveness | Shoot-root ratio | Tree seedlings | Variance,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,16,NA,NA

In a reciprocal transplant experiment we tested whether: (i) three widespread grassland species are locally adapted at a European scale; (ii) detection of local adaptation depends on competition with the local plant community; and (iii) local differentiation between neighbouring populations from contrasting habitats can be stronger than differentiation at a European scale. 2 Seeds of Holcus lanatus, Lotus corniculatus and Plantago lanceolata from a Swiss, Czech and UK population were sown in a reciprocal transplant experiment at fields that exhibit environmental conditions similar to the source sites. Seedling emergence, survival, growth and reproduction were recorded for two consecutive years. 3 The effect of competition was tested by comparing individuals in weeded monocultures with plants sown together with species from the local grassland community. To compare large-scale vs. small-scale differentiation, a neighbouring population from a contrasting habitat (wet-dry contrast) was compared with the 'home' and 'foreign' populations. 4 In P. lanceolata and H. lanatus, a significant home-site advantage was detected in fitness-related traits, thus indicating local adaptation. In L. corniculatus, an overall superiority of one provenance was found. 5 The detection of local adaptation depended on competition with the local plant community. In the absence of competition the home-site advantage was underestimated in P. lanceolata and overestimated in H. lanatus. 6 A significant population differentiation between contrasting local habitats was found. In some traits, this small-scale was greater than large-scale differentiation between countries. 7 Our results indicate that local adaptation in real plant communities cannot necessarily be predicted from plants grown in weeded monocultures and that tests on the relationship between fitness and geographical distance have to account for habitat-dependent small-scale differentiation.

Invasive non-native species, e.g. Fallopia japonica, Impatiens glandulifera and Rhododendron ponticum, were uncommon in this survey. 3 Between 1990 and 1998 the total number of non-native species increased but the mean number of species per sample plot decreased. The mean cover of non-natives increased from 1.2% to 1.9%. 4 There were positive spatial and temporal relationships between non-native and native species diversity. However, there was a weak negative relationship between changes in non-native cover and native diversity. 5 The species composition and ecological traits of communities containing non-natives were very different from those that did not contain them. 6 In the British countryside non-native species were mainly found in habitats with anthropogenic associations, high fertility, high number of ruderal species and high diversity. There is also an indication that successional shifts where competitive invasive species dominate involve non-native species. 7 National-scale changes in plant community composition are likely to be closely correlated with external land-use impacts. Changes such as eutrophication, nitrogen deposition and increased fertility in infertile habitats are likely to benefit both native and non-native invasive species; however, currently these trends benefit native species much more often than non-natives. 8 Non-native species are known to have significant effects on native species at local scales in many countries; however, at the landscape scale in Great Britain they are best considered as symptoms of disturbance and land-use change rather than a direct threat to biodiversity. © 2006 Natural Environment Research Council.",78,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Countryside Survey | Diversity | Exotics | Landscape scale | Neophytes | Plant traits | Temporal studies,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,18,NA,NA

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, reproductive characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. 2 Pteridium is a complex genus comprising a number of species, subspecies and varieties. The treatment here is based on a recent revision that incorporates both morphological and molecular data, and is related to its geographical distribution. 3 Pteridium is thought to be a woodland genus, but it can grow in the open. It is cosmopolitan and occurs on all continents except Antarctica. It responds to human disturbance and is often found in open spaces after forest clearance and cultivation. In some situations it can be a troublesome weed, causing problems for land managers. Moreover, its abundance and distribution in Britain are predicted to increase as a result of global climate change. 4 Pteridium aquilinum ssp. aquilinum, the most common taxon in the British Isles, occurs in many plant communities, and it is apparently limited by frost and waterlogging. Its abundance has probably increased in the relatively recent past as a result of changing land management, and this increase impinges on plant communities with a high conservation interest. The changed land management reflects changing use of agricultural land and also a reduction in the use of Pteridium as a resource. Accordingly, in many places Pteridium is viewed as a weed and management is needed to control it and restore more desirable vegetation. These management techniques are summarized. © 2006 The Authors.",122,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Climatic limitation | Communities | Conservation | Ecophysiology | Geographical and altitudinal distribution | Herbivory | Management | Mycorrhiza | Parasites and diseases | Reproductive biology | Soils | Taxonomy | Weed biology,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,19,NA,NA

This may be the first study that shows how trade-offs among branch traits contribute to variation in crown size, light requirements and maximum height across multiple sympatric tree species in a tropical rain forest. 2 Ten saplings were selected for each of 30 tree species in a Bolivian rain forest. Sapling height and crown dimensions were measured and branch and stem samples were harvested. Fresh density, dry density, modulus of rupture, centre of mass, biomass and diameters were determined for those samples. For each species, cantilever theory predicted the mass needed to produce a stable 1-m long horizontal branch. 3 Generally, shade-tolerant species had denser and stronger branches, and produced a stable horizontal branch at lower resource costs. These species had branches with a higher resistance against mechanical failure, and a wide crown that favours effective light acquisition. Less shade-tolerant species had low density and weak branches, short branches, high resource costs per unit branch length, and low resource costs per unit stem length. These traits seem advantageous under conditions of prolonged exposure to direct sunlight, where such species grow rapidly to reproductive size, while mechanical risks are low and light levels are favourable. 4 Branch (wood and bark) traits are good predictors for performance differences across tree species in heterogeneous forest light environments. Physical trade-offs among branch traits contribute to the specialization of tree species for different light habitats and to tree species coexistence in tropical rain forests, even within classical functional groups such as pioneers and shade tolerants. © 2006 The Authors.",48,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Biomechanics | Bolivia | Coexistence | Crown form | Diversity | Life history | Maximum height | Safety factor | Shade tolerance | Tropical rain forest | Wood density,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,20,NA,NA

We combined fine-resolution palaeoecological proxies for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to investigate the responses of a tropical rain forest catchment over the last 700 years. 2 Sediment cores were sampled at 1-cm intervals to a depth of 100 cm from Lake Euramoo on the Atherton Tableland of north-east Queensland, dated and analysed for pollen, charcoal, diatom, chironomid and inorganic content. 3 The pollen and charcoal record shows a rapid loss of forest diversity (particularly the long-lived taxa Agathis and Podocarpus) and increased burning coinciding with the arrival of European settlers. The aquatic environment is also subject to rapid changes at this time, with a possible increase in pH and subsequent shifts in local algal and insect communities. This event was outside the historic range of variability in both rain forest and aquatic communities. 4 The present mosaic of vegetation types is a complex function of environmental changes operating across a range of spatial and temporal scales: millennial climate change, short-term climatic variations associated with El Niño events and, most significantly, a shift from indigenous to 'European' land-use practices, including clearance and burning activities associated with the timber and farming industry between about ad 1880 and 1920. 5 The establishment of a World Heritage reserve around the lake catchment and the suppression of fire over the last 50 years have not yet restored the terrestrial or aquatic ecosystem to its pre-European state and are unlikely to, given the current predictions of future climate change. This supports the notion that ecological and climate thresholds are not necessarily the same, and that the effects of crossing them are not necessarily reversible.

However, in long-lived plants there may be a time lag between habitat deterioration and a decline in population size, although some vital rates may be immediately affected. 2 We studied the dynamics and viability of populations of the endangered, long-lived perennial Scorzonera humilis to different levels of agricultural intensification in five populations over a period of 4 years at the genet level and for 3 years at the rosette (ramet) level. 3 Asymptotic growth rates varied little between years and the observed stage structure was very similar to the stable stage structure. Mortality of adult genets of S. humilis was low and their life expectancy was several decades. By contrast, turnover of ramets was high and their life expectancy was less than 4 years. 4 Calculations based on mean transition matrices indicated that populations at nutrient-poor sites would grow (λ > 1), whereas those at nutrient-rich sites would continuously decline (λ > 1) if conditions stayed the same. Life-table response experiment analysis revealed that the lower growth rate of nutrient-rich populations was primarily due to a lower survival of large plants, but also due to lower establishment and growth of new plants. 5 Stochastic simulations indicated that the extinction risk for medium-sized populations at nutrient-poor sites is very low, whereas the long-term survival even of large extant populations at nutrient-rich sites is unlikely unless favourable conditions for the establishment of young plants are restored. 6 Fertilization did not influence survival, but an additional cutting early in the season significantly reduced survival of S. humilis. Stochastic simulations indicated that a combination of fertilizing and early cutting drives populations quickly to extinction and that the long-term survival of late-cut, NPK-fertilized populations is also unlikely. 7 The results suggest that in long-lived plants, population size may not be a suitable predictor of long-term viability of populations because of time delays in their response to habitat deterioration.

The positive correlation between population size and female fitness tended to be stronger in field studies than in common garden studies, and the positive correlation between genetic variation and fitness was significantly stronger in DNA than in isoenzyme studies. 3 The strength and direction of correlations between population size, fitness and genetic variation were independent of plant life span and the size range of the studied populations. The mean correlations tended to be stronger for the rare species than for common species. 4 Expected heterozygosity, the number of alleles and the number or proportion of polymorphic loci significantly increased with population size, but the level of inbreeding FIS was independent of population size. The positive relationship between population size and the number of alleles and the number or proportion of polymorphic loci was stronger in self-incompatible than in self-compatible species. Furthermore, fitness and genetic variation were positively correlated in self-incompatible species, but independent of each other in self-compatible species. 5 The close relationships between population size, genetic variation and fitness suggest that population size should always be taken into account in multipopulation studies of plant fitness or genetic variation. 6 The observed generality of the positive relationships between population size, plant fitness and genetic diversity implies that the negative effects of habitat fragmentation on plant fitness and genetic variation are common.

Because damage exposure and avoidance through large size may differ between growth forms, size-stage, growth form and disturbance type may interact. 2 A Bayesian mixed-effects model was used to analyse a wide-ranging literature dataset of resprouting responses following clipping or burning. There were distinct ontogenetic patterns of resprouting ability between growth forms. In ground-dwelling plants, seedling resprouting ability was high and was maintained as plants grew. In trees, survivorship increased with size-stage. However, for disturbances resulting in stem-kill, resprouting ability of trees declined with increasing size. 3 The finding of distinct ontogenetic patterns of sprouting ability between growth forms demonstrates how species trade-off damage avoidance with resprouting ability to achieve persistence, and provides an example of the life-history trade-off of avoidance and tolerance of damage. 4 Large random effects associated with between-species variation indicated that although such ontogenetic patterns can be detected, each growth form contains species employing diverse strategies.

Here, we examine the effects of AMF on plant community composition in experimental wetland plant communities, where the dominant plant species are non-mycorrhizal and subordinate plant species are colonized by AMF. We also assess how an important abiotic soil variable, depth to water table (soil saturation), might mediate the community-level effects of AMF. 2 In the low water table (un-saturated) treatment, above-ground plant biomass increased in the presence of AMF relative to the controls, while in the high water table treatment, biomass decreased with the presence of AMF. Contrary to predictions, plant diversity was unaffected by the presence of AMF in the low water table treatment, but significantly decreased in the presence of AMF in the high water table treatment. Changes in biomass and composition were driven by the interactions between the dominant non-mycorrhizal species Carex hystercina, and the remaining mycorrhizal plant species. 3 Our results indicate that AMF have the potential to influence plant community composition in calcareous fens and that these effects can be mediated by soil saturation. 4 This study has implications for understanding how established principles of above-ground/below-ground interactions from upland communities translate to wetland plant communities and for understanding how AMF function can be mediated by abiotic soil properties.

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. 2 Sarcocornia perennis (Miller) A.J. Scott (Salicornia perennis Miller; Salicornia radicans Sm.; Arthrocnemum [Arthrocnemon] perenne (Miller) Moss) of the European and African coasts is now considered also to include Salicornia virginica L., S. ambigua Michx. and S. gaudichaudiana Moq. of the Americas. Sarcocornia perennis is a spreading, jointed-stemmed, halophyte that differs from the closely related Salicornia in being a shrubby perennial and in aspects of inflorescence structure. In Britain, it is found mainly on the coasts of south-east England, on gravelly or sandy foreshores, and well-drained sediments of tidal salt marshes. 3 Sarcocornia perennis occurs relatively low in the tidal frame but only in well-drained situations, as seedling establishment and long-term survival are intolerant of highly reducing surface sediments. It has a role in the early stages of salt-marsh succession, sometimes as the primary colonist on sandy substrates. In southern Europe, its invasion may be facilitated by the raised clonal tussocks of Spartina maritima, a primary colonist; subsequently, S. perennis dominates the tussocks and supports their rapid radial and upward growth by trapping silt. Pollen flow from the high marsh species Sarcocornia fruticosa may allow invasion by hybrids between the two species. 4 Hybridization between the diploid S. perennis and octaploid S. fruticosa in south-west Spain has been confirmed by analysis of random amplified DNA (RAPDs). This has also clarified the relationship between the two subspecies present there (the widely distributed ssp. perennis and the more upright, rigid Iberian endemic ssp. alpini (Lag.) Castroviejo). 5 Sarcocornia perennis maintains low water potentials and a positive carbon balance under highly saline conditions. Salinity treatment had no effect on the efficiency of Photosystem II (Fv/Fm). Total germination was also unaffected by salinity up to 2%, although above this it was progressively inhibited; the reduction in germination at seawater concentrations was mainly osmotically enforced dormancy, which would promote dispersal by tides and currents. © 2006 The Authors.",61,Journal,re,Review,100,8,8,Climatic limitation | Conservation | Ecophysiology | Geographical and altitudinal distribution | Germination | Halophyte | Herbivory | Parasites and diseases | Salt-marsh succession | Teproductive biology,29602,BIGF010001,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,27,NERC,Natural Environment Research Council

Does diversity increase in a forest after being hit by a hurricane? We answer these questions using a 30-year study of four Jamaican forests, which differ in soil fertility and diversity, and which were hit by Hurricane Gilbert in 1988; the decades were: pre-Gilbert (1974-84), Gilbert (1984-94), and post-Gilbert (1994-2004). 2 Diversity (Shannon index) was always higher in the three forests (Col H′ 3.00, Mull H′ 2.91 and Slope H′ 2.99) on more fertile soils (C : N ratios 10-13, N : P 16-24), and significantly lower in the Mor forest (H′ 2.26) with the least fertile soil (C : N ratio 24, N : P ratio 44). Diversity increased during the Gilbert decade in two of the more diverse forests (Mull and Slope), it did not increase in the least diverse, Mor forest. The overall increase in diversity during the Gilbert decade was due to the recruitment of eight, mostly light-demanding, species and the increased abundance of uncommon species. 3 We used turnover rates (the average of mortality and recruitment of stems) as a measure of resistance. We equate low turnover with high resistance to hurricane damage. Turnover increased during the Gilbert decade in all forests, but increased more in the three more diverse forests (Mull 1.5% year-1 1974-84 to 3.1% year-1 1984-94; Slope 1.3-2.6; Col 1.5-3.2); than in the least diverse Mor forest (1.2-1.9). 4 Stem diameter growth rates pre-Gilbert were very low in all forests and were lowest in the Mor forest (Mor 0.3 mm year-1, Mull 0.4, Slope 0.5, Col 0.6). They increased during the Gilbert decade and remained, in the post-Gilbert decade, double those of the pre-Gilbert decade (Mor 0.6 mm year-1, Mull 0.6, Slope 0.8, Col 1.1). Smaller stems increased growth more than larger stems. The stems recruited during the Gilbert and post-Gilbert decades grew faster than those present in 1974. 5 Thus, in montane forest in Jamaica the least diverse forest was most resistant to hurricane damage, and although there was a strong similarity in species rank abundances over 30 years including a hurricane, the hurricane increased diversity. © 2006 The Authors.",54,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Diversity | Hurricanes | Mortality | Recruitment | Resistance,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,28,NA,NA

Plant stage or size is a common predictor of plant performance for a range of ecological conditions, including responses to neighbours. Plant response to local conditions varies from seedling establishment through to senescence, with strong implications for population regulation. 2 I investigated size-dependent responses to near adult neighbours among a uniquely quantitative sample of mapped juvenile and adult bur-sage (Ambrosia dumosa), a common shrub in the Colorado Desert of California. 3 Analyses of juvenile establishment and survival for two 5-year census periods from 1984 to 1989 and 1989 to 1994 determined that germination and survival was greater for juveniles located under adults compared with away from adults. However, analyses of neighbour effects on growth of plants from the 1984 cohort showed that near adult neighbours improved juvenile growth over the 10-year interval from 1984 to 1994, but reduced adult growth. 4 A size-dependent, ontogenetic shift occurs because neighbouring adult plants significantly improve the demographic performance of juveniles, but diminish that of larger established plants. 5 The ontogenetic niche shift may be a useful framework to describe such differential responses of juvenile and adult plants. The utility of this framework is that responses to spatial and temporal variability in the environment are clearly demonstrated through ontogenetic constraints on plant performance, which provide an alternative mechanism of coexistence within and between species. © 2006 The Author.",250,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Ambrosia dumosa | Demography | Desert plants | Ontogenetic shifts | Population ecology | Spatial ecology,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,29,NA,NA

However, results of earlier studies of local adaptation in plant-pathogen systems have been contradictory and it has been suggested that specific, species characteristics, for example distribution, dispersal and the degree of pathogen dependence on the host, are important for the outcome of host-pathogen interactions. In addition, the scale of the study may influence whether or not local adaptation is found. 2 We argue that local adaptation of the pathogen to the host can be expected in a system where: (i) the pathogen is host-specific with a short generation time compared with the host; (ii) populations are isolated, allowing localized evolution to occur; and (iii) the study is performed on a geographical scale exceeding the maximum dispersal range of the interacting species. 3 To test these predictions we examined the within- and among-population variation in resistance and virulence of the plant-pathogen system Salix triandra - Melampsora amygdalinae. The pathogen occurs throughout the whole distribution range of the host, and the area of interest consists of highly isolated, small natural populations. 4 Resistance and virulence differed both within and between populations and all clones showed a unique resistance pattern. We conclude that M. amygdalinae is locally adapted to the host S. triandra as all pathogen populations have a higher probability of infecting sympatric than allopatric hosts. Furthermore, high resistance in the host population was accompanied by a high virulence in the pathogen population, suggesting that high resistance levels in a host population may select for more virulent pathogen populations, or vice versa. 5 The nature of host-pathogen interactions differs among systems, and the dynamics of the interaction between triandra and M. amygdalinae is governed by characteristics that have resulted in the evolution of local adaptation. 6 Thus, when studying local adaptation of pathogens to their hosts it is important to consider the biology, as well as the scale of dispersal and spatial distribution of both host and pathogen. © 2006 The Authors.",19,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Allopatric | Coevolution | Evolutionary potential | Local adaptation | Rust fungus | Spatial distribution | Spatial isolation | Sympatric,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,31,NA,NA

Tabebuia ochracea and T. aurea are sympatric in the cerrado (Brazilian savanna), whereas T. aurea also colonizes floodplains in the wetlands of the 'Pantanal Matogrossense' as large monodominant stands, but is sparsely distributed in the cerrado. 2 We test the hypothesis that T. aurea has a more vigorous genotype in the Pantanal than in the cerrado, which may be due to a lower negative selection caused by insect herbivory, positive selection for better soil conditions and an increased growth in the face of stochastic flooding. In addition, we predict that T. ochracea is better adapted to withstand higher herbivory rates than T. aurea, and is thus more successful in the cerrado. 3 Kruskal-Wallis analysis and Wilcoxon paired-sample tests were used to compare adult tree reproductive traits. A reciprocal transplant experiment, combined with a glasshouse experiment, was used to investigate herbivory on half-sib seed families found in each habitat. 4 Over a 2-year period, T. ochracea had the higher investment in flower and seed production, which compensated for lower germination rates. However, in the Pantanal, T. aurea had the greatest conversion of flowers to fruit. 5 Fewer seeds of T. aurea survived and germinated in the cerrado than in the Pantanal, but seedlings from the Pantanal grew faster than those from the cerrado. The growth rate of T. ochracea was approximately four times lower than that of T. aurea. 6 Herbivory on seedlings was lower in the Pantanal than in the cerrado. Although seedlings of T. aurea from the Pantanal suffered the highest rates of herbivory in the cerrado, they survived equally to seedling genotypes from the cerrado. Tabebuia aurea had a higher mortality in both the cerrado and under controlled environmental conditions. 7 Faster growth rates may evolve when favourable abiotic conditions prevail.

Most empirical studies on extinction resurvey historically occupied sites and estimate extinction probability as the proportion of sites where a species is no longer detected. Possible non-detection of surviving populations is usually not accounted for, which may result in extinction probabilities that are overestimated. 2 As part of a large revisitation study in north-east Switzerland, 376 sites with historically known occurrences of a total of 11 plant species 80-100 years ago were visited by two independent observers. Based on typical population size, ramet size and plant architecture, we judged six species as easy to find and five species as hard to find. Using capture-recapture methods to separate non-detection from true extinction, we gauged the bias of extinction probability estimates that do not account for non-detection. 3 When non-detection was not accounted for, a single visit resulted in an average estimate of population extinction probability of 0.49 (range 0.27-0.67). However, the mean detection probability of a surviving population during a single visit had an estimated average of only 0.81 (range 0.57-1). Consequently, accounting for non-detection resulted in extinction probability estimates ranging between 0.09 and 0.61 (mean 0.36). Based on a single survey, our revisitation study would have overestimated the extinction rate on average by 11 percentage points (range 5-22%) or by 59% (range 0-250%) relative to the estimated true value. 4 A simple binomial argument enables the calculation of the minimum required number of visits to detect a surviving population with high probability (e.g. 95%). For the easy to find species, approximately two visits would be required to find most of the surviving populations, whereas up to four visits would be required for the hard to find species. 5 In revisitation studies, only repeated revisits allow the separation of extinction from simple non-detection. Unless corrected for possible non-detection, extinction probability may be strongly overestimated, and hence some control for non-detection is desirable at least in a subset of species/sites in revisitation studies.

Conceptual models of the effects of wind disturbance have traditionally focused on the impacts of catastrophic disturbances and have painted a simple picture of how disturbance acts to maintain tree species diversity. These models ignore variation among species characteristics that could have important consequences for both resistance to and recovery from disturbance. 2 We integrated an empirically parameterized, mechanistic model of windstorm mortality (WINDSTORM) and a seed-mass-based dispersal and recruitment model into a spatially explicit, individual tree model of forest dynamics (SORTIE) in order to create simulated long-term 'experiments' designed to explore the sensitivity of forest composition and structure to species-specific resistance to and recovery from disturbance. 3 We found that species-specific variation in resistance to wind mortality interacted strongly with: (i) shade tolerance characteristics, (ii) the medium-term history of disturbances, (iii) the long-term average severity of the disturbance regime and (iv) seedbed substrate dynamics to influence tree population dynamics and successional trajectories. 4 We also examined how local and long-distance dispersal affect response to wind disturbance. Ignoring differences among local dispersal characteristics overestimates the importance of dispersal-limited species. Our results show that long-distance immigration maintains species coexistence only if the immigration rate is very high relative to local dispersal. Despite this, stand-scale models that ignore long-distance dispersal can underestimate population dynamics of dispersal-limited species. 5 Our results indicate that landscape-scale heterogeneity in structure and species composition in these forests is facilitated by synergisms between the stochastic nature of wind disturbance and complex interactions between species traits that govern: (i) resistance to disturbance, (ii) local dispersal and seedling establishment and (iii) competitive (i.e. growth/survival) traits that do not adhere to strict tradeoffs. 6 We conclude that wind disturbance has much more complex and variable effects on long-term dynamics of forest structure and composition than suggested by previous models. In particular, non-catastrophic disturbances can generate important variation in forest dynamics that can either lead to dominance by a single or small number of species, or facilitate species coexistence. © 2006 The Authors.",78,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Community dynamics | Competition | Disturbance | Forerst ecology | Local and long-distance seed dispersal | Resistance to disturbance | Seedling establishment | Simulation model | Succession | Wind disturbance,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,34,NA,NA

Their influences on soil properties result in net positive or negative feedback effects, which influence plant performance and plant community composition. 2 For two grassland systems, one on a sandy soil in the Netherlands and one on a chalk soil in the United Kingdom, we investigated how individual plant species grown in monocultures changed abiotic and biotic soil conditions. Then, we determined feedback effects of these soils to plants of the same or different species. Feedback effects were analysed at the level of plant species and plant taxonomic groups (grasses vs. forbs). 3 In the sandy soils, plant species differed in their effects on soil chemical properties, in particular potassium levels, but PLFA (phospholipid fatty acid) signatures of the soil microbial community did not differ between plant species. The effects of soil chemical properties were even greater when grasses and forbs were compared, especially because potassium levels were lower in grass monocultures. 4 In the chalk soil, there were no effects of plant species on soil chemical properties, but PLFA profiles differed significantly between soils from different monocultures. PLFA profiles differed between species, rather than between grasses and forbs. 5 In the feedback experiment, all plant species in sandy soils grew less vigorously in soils conditioned by grasses than in soils conditioned by forbs. These effects correlated significantly with soil chemical properties. None of the seven plant species showed significant differences between performance in soil conditioned by the same vs. other plant species. 6 In the chalk soil, Sanguisorba minor and in particular Briza media performed best in soil collected from conspecifics, while Bromus erectus performed best in soil from heterospecifics. There was no distinctive pattern between soils collected from forb and grass monocultures, and plant performance could not be related to soil chemical properties or PLFA signatures. 7 Our study shows that mechanisms of plant-soil feedback can depend on plant species, plant taxonomic (or functional) groups and site-specific differences in abiotic and biotic soil properties.

Our aims were to identify minimal factors and processes able to generate treeline types with abrupt vs. smooth transitions in different variables (tree height, age, density), to investigate the role of positive feedback in pattern generation, and to determine why krummholz appears at some but not all treelines. We hypothesized that a different balance between smooth growth and mortality gradients across the treeline ecotone could account for differences between commonly observed treeline types. 2 The model contained only processes and factors regarded as essential for producing a treeline ecotone and was parameterized with an extensive, individual-based data set from Pinus uncinata treelines in the Spanish Pyrenees. However, parameters expected to influence treeline type were systematically varied. 3 The simple model was able to generate major treeline types differing in abruptness and krummholz abundance. The most important factors determining treeline types were the relative strength of growth and mortality gradients, followed by facilitation strength, whereas demographic parameters accounted for more subtle differences. 4 Only certain combinations of growth inhibition, mortality and facilitation allowed for the emergence of certain treeline types characterized by contrasting abruptness values and the presence or absence of krummholz. High krummholz densities emerged only under positive feedback and strongly increasing growth inhibition across the ecotone. Abruptness in adult tree density was positively correlated with facilitation strength and growth inhibition. By contrast, treelines with abrupt height transitions occurred only where both low growth inhibition and a strongly increasing mortality occurred across the ecotone. 5 Our analysis suggests that treeline features are not arbitrary but that there is a clear signal in the pattern which allows for inference of the underlying processes. Our approach of a systematic comparison of model predictions and various observed patterns can be widely applied for testing hypotheses on the functioning of ecological systems and for deriving specific questions for further investigations in the field. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",56,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Demographic model | Individual-based model | Pattern-oriented modelling | Pinus uncinata | Positive feedback | Pyrenees | Spatially explicit population model,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,36,NA,NA

Resource availability to competitors can be affected through resource depletion (scramble competition) and by mechanisms that inhibit access of other roots to resources (contest competition, such as allelopathy). 2 It has been proposed that soil heterogeneity can cause size-asymmetric root competition. Support for this hypothesis is limited and contradictory, possibly because resource uptake is affected more by the amount and spatial distribution of resource-acquiring organs, relative to the spatial distribution of resources, than by root system size per se. 3 Root competition intensity between individual plants generally decreases as resource availability (but not necessarily habitat productivity) increases, but the importance of root competition relative to other factors that structure communities may increase with resource availability. 4 Soil organisms play important, and often species-specific, roles in root interactions. 5 The findings that some roots can detect other roots, or inert objects, before they are contacted and can distinguish between self and non-self roots create experimental challenges for those attempting to untangle the effects of self/non-self root recognition, self-inhibition and root segregation or proliferation in response to competition. Recent studies suggesting that root competition may represent a 'tragedy-of-the-commons' may have failed to account for this complexity. 6 Theories about potential effects of root competition on plant diversity (and vice versa) appear to be ahead of the experimental evidence, with only one study documenting different effects of root competition on plant diversity under different levels of resource availability. 7 Roots can interact with their biotic and abiotic environments using a large variety of often species-specific mechanisms, far beyond the traditional view that plants interact mainly through resource depletion. Research on root interactions between exotic invasives and native species holds great promise for a better understanding of the way in which root competition may affect community structure and plant diversity, and may create new insights into coevolution of plants, their competitors and the soil community. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",342,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Allelopathy | Contest competition | Plant diversity | Root signals | Scramble competition | Self-inhibition | Size-asymmetric competition | Soil heterogeneity | Soil organisms | Soil resource availability,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,37,NA,NA

The role of dispersal limitation was examined by adding approximately 7000 seeds to each of eight patches in March 2000. The role of seed predation was examined in all 40 patches using experimental exclosures from June 2000 to July 2001. 4 The number of P. americana plants in September 2000 was unchanged by seed addition. However, fewer P. americana plants were found in patches where seed predators removed more P. americana seeds from experimental exclosures. These data suggest that P. americana is not limited by seed dispersal. Rather, in habitats where microsites are readily available, the abundance of P. americana among patches appears to be limited by the activities of seed predators. 5 When dispersal and microsites are not limiting, the role of local seed predators can be important for generating emergent, large-scale patterns of plant abundance across landscapes. Moreover, because predators may generate large-scale patterns that resemble other forms of limitation and predators may target specific species, predator impacts should be more frequently incorporated into experiments on the role of seed limitation and plant community composition. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",101,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Microsite limitation | Predator limitation | Seed addition | Seed dispersal | Seed limitation,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,38,NA,NA

A total of 52 host plant species were investigated. Sixteen publications provided data enabling a comparison to be made of AM fungal taxon richness and community composition across 36 host plant species and 25 locations. Ninety-five fungal taxa (small subunit rRNA gene sequence types) were involved, 49 of which were recorded from at least two study sites, and 65 from more than one host plant species. 2 The number of AM fungal taxa per host plant species differed between habitat types: a significantly higher richness was found in tropical forests (18.2 fungal taxa per plant species), followed by grasslands (8.3), temperate forests (5.6) and habitats under anthropogenic influence (arable fields and polluted sites, 5.2). 3 AM fungal communities exhibit differing compositions in broadly defined habitat types: tropical forests, temperate forests and habitats under anthropogenic influence. Grassland locations around the world host heterogeneous AM fungal communities. 4 A number of AM fungi had a global distribution, including sequence types related to the Glomus intraradices/fasciculatum group, G. mosseae, G. sp. UY1225 and G. hoi, as well as the Glomus and Scutellospora types of unknown taxonomic affiliation. Widespread taxa occur in both natural and anthropogenic (disturbed) habitats, and may show high local abundance.

The findings imply that plant diversity and productivity have a major influence on gross rates of N transformation and vice versa. 2 A geostatistical analysis was used to evaluate the spatial relationships between abundance and species composition of the understorey vegetation and in situ gross N mineralization, NH4+ immobilization and nitrification rates. 3 The gross N transformation rates and the plants spatial variation were correlated within the forest, but plant distribution was more dependent on the fraction of mineralized N that was nitrified than on individual N transformation rates. 4 The total cover of the understorey vegetation varied more in space than the species composition, and was higher in areas with high N transformation rates. 5 Plant species benefiting from high net nitrification rates were more common in areas with a low activity of mineralizing and nitrifying microorganisms, possibly because the net and gross rates were independent of each other. In fact, those species occurred most often in areas in which a large fraction of mineralized N was nitrified. 6 Beech and oak trees also had an effect on the spatial variation of the understorey vegetation. Beech trees provided conditions more suitable for plants benefiting from NO3-, whereas the vascular plant cover was greater under oak trees, probably in response to a higher light interception than under beech trees. 7 Oak generally had a positive impact on gross N transformation rates compared with beech, perhaps reflecting differences in litter quality and climate caused by the two species. 8 The influence of trees alone could not explain the full magnitude of the variation of N transformation rates or the presence of overlapping areas with high mineralization and immobilization rates.

Single trees in deciduous forests form dynamic patches that emerge, grow and fall, but the stands themselves are also dynamic patches established after disturbances and replaced by conifers during succession. Increased dispersal distance, as imposed by landscape fragmentation, may lead to extinctions and reduced biodiversity among species dependent on this dynamic network. 2 We analysed regional frequency distributions, local abundances and spatial occupancy patterns of epiphytic bryophytes in 135 deciduous forest stands in a fragmented landscape in Sweden. We used generalized non-linear models to test whether these patterns could be assigned to metapopulation dynamics of individual epiphytes by investigating the relative importance of stand size, habitat quality, connectivity and landscape history on species occupancies and local abundances. 3 Most asexually dispersed species were regionally rare, and spatial species occupancy patterns suggest that this is caused by dispersal limitation. In sexually dispersed species, a strong rescue effect was indicated by a bimodal frequency distribution of the species, as well as by increasing local abundance with increasing connectivity to stands present today, or some decades ago. There was a strong positive relationship between regional frequency and local abundance of the species, and between species richness and forest stand size. Vicinity to forest edge negatively affected the local abundance of most species. 4 Our results clearly indicate a metapopulation structure. Sensitivity of epiphytes to habitat fragmentation is caused by decreasing forest sizes, habitat alteration at forest edges and increasing dispersal distances. Even in assumed good dispersers, increasing distances can significantly alter regional dispersal processes. A lower rescue effect leads to smaller stand population sizes with a larger extinction risk. Rapid reduction of the amount of habitat during the last decades and the expected time-lag in species extinctions suggest that epiphytes will further decline in the future, although there may still be time for restoration programmes to prevent extinction. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",114,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Bryophytes | Core-satellite hypothesis | Dispersal | Distribution-abundance relationship | Dynamic landscape | Metacommunity | Rescue effect | Species-area effect | Time-lag,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,43,NA,NA

The composition of the soil fungal community is affected by fungus-feeding soil invertebrates, suggesting that fungus-feeding soil animals may affect losses of seeds caused by fungal attack. We tested this assumption with a full factorial experiment that examined the effects of fungivorous Collembola and of seed coating with a fungicide on seed longevity of four grassland plant species. 2 Seeds of Centaurea nigra, Dactylis glomerata, Origanum vulgare and Taraxacum officinale were kept in Petri dishes filled with soil under conditions that stimulate fungal growth but not seed germination. Treatment factors were (i) addition of the collembolan Protaphorura fimata, a soil-dwelling fungus feeder; and (ii) seed treatment with the fungicide chitosan. After 5 weeks, germination was recorded and viability of the remaining ungerminated seeds was determined. 3 In three species, the addition of P. fimata resulted in an increase in the number of remaining ungerminated viable seeds. This was due to reduced seed mortality (C. nigra, O. vulgare) or to reduced germination (D. glomerata). Seeds of T. officinale remained unaffected. 4 For the fungicide treatment, no significant main effect was found in any species, although in two species there was a significant interaction between the addition of Collembola and seed coating with chitosan. There is circumstantial evidence that this interaction may have resulted from a negative effect of chitosan on adult survival of P. fimata. 5 These results show that fungus-feeding soil invertebrates affect not only the performance of live plants, as shown in previous studies, but also the persistence of seeds in the soil, and that this effect varies between different plant species. 6 Our results suggest that by reducing the mortality of seeds due to fungal decay, fungal grazers may influence the dynamics of plant populations and the assembly of plant communities.

For plants living in high-alpine habitats, it is of significant importance to what extent sexual or clonal reproduction contribute to population growth, but respective data are scarce. 2 We studied the demography of Geum reptans, an alpine plant which reproduces by seeds and by vegetative rosettes formed at the ends of above-ground stolons. In three consecutive years, growth, survival, and reproduction were measured in two populations with 579 and 301 individuals, respectively. The two resulting transition matrices per population were used to calculate population growth rates (λ) and elasticities, and to perform stochastic simulations to assess the relative importance of sexual vs. clonal reproduction for population growth. 3 Population growth rates (λ) varied from 0.999 to 1.074 among years and populations. The frequency of seed and stolon production was relatively constant over the years. However, there was interannual variation in seed germination (0.7-2.4%) and in establishment of clonal offspring (53-74%). 4 Elasticity analysis showed that changes in the survival of adults had the largest effect on λ, confirming the importance of longevity and persistence in the life history of G. reptans. 5 Stochastic simulations showed that in G. reptans, independently of location and year, both sexual and clonal reproduction did not significantly differ in their contribution to the population growth rate λ. Establishment from seeds contributes to population growth particularly in favourable years, while the more regularly occurring reproduction by clonal offspring may ensure population growth in less favourable years. 6 Sexual reproduction in clonal plants is frequently explained by the short- and long-term benefits of genetic variation and the need for dispersal and colonization, for which seeds are better suited than vegetative organs. Our results, however, show the importance of sexual reproduction in a clonal plant for local dynamics as well, and prove the power of matrix models to evaluate the relative contributions of the two reproductive modes. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",87,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Clonal plants | Demography | Glacier foreland | Pioneer plant | Population growth rate | Population projection matrix | Recruitment | Seeds | Stochastic simulation | Stolons,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,46,NA,NA

Its value to science has changed and grown since it was founded to answer agricultural questions. In recent times the experiment has shown inter alia how: plant species richness, biomass and pH are related; community composition responds to climatic perturbation and nutrient additions; soil is acidified and corrected by liming. It also provided one of the first demonstrations of the evolution of adaptation at a very local scale and contains a putative case of the evolution of reproductive isolation by reinforcement. The application of molecular genetic markers to archived plant material promises to reveal a whole new chapter of genetic detail about the long-term dynamics of plant populations. 2 Over the range of values observed at Park Grass, biomass (productivity) has a negative effect upon species richness. Any positive effect of species richness on productivity could only be weak by comparison. The experiment provides support for both the competitive exclusion and pool size hypotheses for determination of species density. 3 Instantaneous comparisons of species richness between plots do not accurately reflect temporal rates of loss which may be multiplicative rather than additive. This suggests that comparisons among sites, nutrient inputs, especially N treatments, or soil acidity may in general underestimate the threat posed to plant species diversity by long-term changes in plant nutrient availability, both enrichment and depletion. 4 Differences between plots at the community level are maintained despite a flow of propagules between plots. There is no strong evidence for a spatial mass effect. 5 Guild (grass/legume/other) compositions of plant communities have equilibrated, but the species composition within guilds is more dynamic and continues to change over time, suggesting that species and guild abundances are independently regulated. 6 At least some members of all the major trophic levels, including predators (spiders), herbivores (leafhoppers) and detritivores (springtails) are treatment-specific in their distributions. 7 Plant populations on Park Grass are subdivided by treatments which, to some degree, have led to plots becoming genetically isolated from one another and decoupled demographically. This subdivision has created a metapopulation structure in each species, characterized by species-specific rates of local colonization and extinction. 8 Inverse clines in flowering time occur in the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum across some plot boundaries. These suggest that reproductive isolation between plots has been reinforced by natural selection. 9 Drift as well as selection may have taken place in A. odoratum, especially on plots where effective population size is restricted by population bottlenecks caused by drought. 10 Park Grass illustrates how long-term experiments grow in value with time and how they may be used to investigate scientific questions that were inconceivable at their inception. This is as likely to be true of the future of Park Grass as it has proved to be of its past. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",274,Journal,re,Review,100,6,6,Biodiversity | Ecological genetics | Long-term experiment | Natural selection | Permanent grassland | Plant nutrition | Plant population dynamics | Soil fertility | Stability,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,47,NA,NA

Given the sensitivity of decomposition to temperature, especially in cold biomes, it has been hypothesized that global warming will lead to increased litter decomposition rates, both through direct temperature effects and through indirect effects on litter quality and soil organisms. 2 A meta-analysis of experimental warming studies in cold biomes (34 site-species combinations) showed that warming resulted in slightly increased decomposition rates. However, this response was strongly dependent on the method used: open top chambers reduced decomposition rates, whereas heating lamps stimulated decomposition rates. The low responsiveness was mainly due to moisture-limited decomposition rates in the warming treatments, especially at mesic and xeric sites. This control of litter decomposition by both temperature and moisture was corroborated by natural gradient studies. 3 Interspecific differences in litter quality and decomposability are substantially larger than warming-induced phenotypic responses. Thus, the changes in the species composition and structure of plant communities that have been observed in medium-term warming studies in cold biomes will have a considerably greater impact on ecosystem litter decomposition than phenotypic responses. 4 Soil fauna communities in cold biomes are responsive to climate warming. Moreover, temperature-driven migration of the, hitherto absent, large comminuters to high-latitude sites may significantly increase decomposition rates. However, we do not know how far-reaching the consequences of changes in the species composition and structure of the soil community are for litter decomposition, as there is a lack of data on functional species redundancy and the species' dispersal ability. 5 Global warming will lead to increased litter decomposition rates only if there is sufficient soil moisture.

This study describes how soil C loss is related to temperature, moisture and chemical composition of organic matter in Alaskan tundra soils, including soils that were fertilized annually for 8 years prior to the study. 2 Fertilized and unfertilized soils from four vegetation types (tussock, intertussock, sedge and heath) were incubated at 7 or 15°C, under saturated or well-drained conditions, through four 100-day 'seasons' separated by 25- to 45-day frozen periods. 3 Losses of CO2 were monitored and total C loss was determined by difference between initial and final C stocks. Initial and final organic matter composition was determined by separation into non-polar extractable (NPE, mainly fats, oils, and waxes), water-soluble (WS, mainly soluble carbohydrates and phenolics), acid-soluble (AS, mainly cellulose and related compounds), and acid-insoluble (AIS, 'lignin') fractions. An isotopic label (99% 13C-enriched glucose) was added to track transformations among the C fractions. 4 Total C loss during the experiment was 3-32% of initial C mass depending on soil type and treatment, with most of the loss as CO2. Wet sedge tundra soils, with the largest AS and AIS fractions, lost the least CO2 and total C. The added 13C ended up in all C fractions, indicating production, as well as loss of all fractions. 5 The greatest CO2 and total C losses occurred under warm, well-drained conditions, in all soils. The effects of fertilizer treatment were occasionally significant but never large relative to the other treatments. 6 Despite the long incubation under standard conditions, there was no evidence for convergence in C chemistry among soils as indicated by changes in relative abundances of the four C fractions. 7 Large and constant rates of C loss even after 4 'seasons' of incubation suggest that a large portion of the C pool is potentially mineralizable in all soil types. 8 Warming of the Arctic climate and associated thawing of permafrost and the increase in soil drainage have the potential to cause a large release of C.

In arid systems, for example, soil nitrogen (N) is often supplied in pulses. Mechanisms influencing the ability of a species to exploit N pulses through the season, however, are poorly understood despite the strong potential for temporal variation in N supply to impact growth, survival and competitive interactions in these systems. 2 We examined how plant physiological and soil processes interacted to influence the ability of two dominant perennial Atriplex species to capture N from pulses occurring at different times in the growing season. 3 15N-labelled pulses were applied to the two Atriplex species in early and mid spring. Sequential time harvests were used to quantify changes in plant 15N content, root length, root length relative growth rate, root N inflow rates, microbial biomass 15N, soil water content and soil inorganic 15N pools. Path analysis and structural equation modelling were used to quantify the relative importance of different root parameters for plant N capture from pulses and to evaluate the degree to which these root responses interacted with soil processes to influence plant N capture. 4 Plant N capture was greatest when pulses coincided with high root length relative growth rates. Declining availability of total inorganic N through a pulse had a limited effect on N capture. This was partly because soil NH4+ pools were removed from the soil system four times faster than soil NO3- pools, allowing sufficient NO3- supply to roots, although total inorganic N pools declined. Microbial immobilization rates did not change significantly through a pulse and did not influence plant N capture during a pulse. Instead, plant N capture during a pulse was limited by total root length and uptake capacity per unit root length, which in turn was affected by plant N demand and soil water content. 5 Understanding interactions between root responses, soil processes and pulse timing provides insight into mechanisms underlying competitive interactions and diversity maintenance in pulse-driven systems. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",43,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Atriplex | Great Basin | Nitrogen isotopes | Path analysis | Resource pulses,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,50,NA,NA

Mathematical models have been developed that attribute this phenomenon to a symmetry-breaking instability. Such models are based on the interplay between competitive and facilitative influences that the vegetation exerts on its own dynamics when it is constrained by arid conditions, but evidence for these predictions is still lacking. Moreover, not all models can account for the development of regularly spaced spots of bare ground in the absence of a soil prepattern. We applied Fourier analysis to high-resolution, remotely sensed data taken at either end of a 40-year interval in southern Niger. Statistical comparisons based on this textural characterization gave us broad-scale evidence that the decrease in rainfall over recent decades in the sub-Saharan Sahel has been accompanied by a detectable shift from homogeneous vegetation cover to spotted patterns marked by a spatial frequency of about 20 cycles km-1. Wood cutting and grazing by domestic animals have led to a much more marked transition in unprotected areas than in a protected reserve. Field measurements demonstrated that the dominant spatial frequency was endogenous rather than reflecting the spatial variation of any pre-existing heterogeneity in soil properties. All these results support the use of models that can account for periodic vegetation patterns without invoking substrate heterogeneity or anisotropy, and provide new elements for further developments, refinements and tests.

Within each of six experimental canopy gaps, we planted two conspecific blocks of Shorea leprosula (Dipterocarpaceae) seedlings and two heterospecific blocks of S. leprosula seedlings amongst four other dipterocarp species with differing growth rates and palatability to herbivores. The growth allocation patterns of S. leprosula differed according to whether they were planted among conspecifics or heterospecifics. Although S. leprosula seedlings grew taller in conspecific stands, their above ground biomass did not differ between planting treatments, due to increased branching and leaf area in seedlings in the heterospecific stands.

We investigated how the andromonoecious herb Solanum carolinense regulates its maternal investment in response to stress from foliar and floral herbivory. Most of the variation among S. carolinense individuals (ramets) in maternal investment occurred during the initiation of flower-bud primordia, with ramets initiating between 9 and 167 flower buds. In response to simulated floral herbivory, S. carolinense regulated maternal investment by decreasing the abortion rate of flower buds, increasing the ratio of perfect to male flowers and decreasing the rate of fruit abortion. In response to foliar herbivory, the plants increased the rate of fruit abortion and decreased allocation to perennial root growth. Some individuals specialized at regulating during early phenological stages, others specialized at later regulation, and there appeared to be trade-offs between these strategies. Because most plants must cope with multiple stresses that occur at different times in their phenology, such trade-offs suggest the presence of adaptive constraints.

Herbaceous plants in the open surrounding wetlands may also depend on these pollinators. We investigated pollinator diversity and abundances in both tree island and marl prairie habitats using transect sampling methods and estimated pollination success of the milkweed Asclepias lanceolata, an insect-pollinated marl prairie species, in relation to distance from and size of the closest tree island. On a total of 11 bayhead tree islands, we found that insect diversity and abundance were greater on the edge of larger tree islands (20-30 m2) than on smaller tree islands (5-10 m2).

We used Life Table Response Experiment (LTRE) analysis, coupled with stochastic analyses, to examine how a major abiotic disturbance, flooding, influences the fitness and population growth of a common riparian plant, Mimulus guttatus, and how this effect compares and interacts with that exerted by herbivory. We also extended LTRE analysis to include nested factors, which enabled us to examine differences across experimental sites. These spatial contributions to changes in population growth rate, λ, were compared and contrasted with those derived for year and experimental treatments. Flooding had direct positive impacts on population growth, while protection from herbivory benefited plants in both flooded and non-flooded areas. Spatial variation in plant performance was also substantial, with greater variation across experimental sites than temporal variation across years. Our stochastic analysis revealed that the impact of herbivores on population growth was much greater when the environment fluctuated between years with and without flooding than in more constant environments. Both flooding and herbivory exerted the majority of their impacts on plant performance via changes in adult summer survival. For flooded sites, this was surprising, given the small difference in summer survival between control and herbivore-exclusion treatments, and results from the high sensitivity of population growth to adult survival. The importance of herbivory in flooded sites would have not been discerned had we not considered how adult survival interacts with other stages of the M. guttatus life cycle. Thus, in order to increase ecological understanding associated with shifts in community dynamics, experimental results should be placed in a life-history context. Within disturbance-driven systems, the direct abiotic effects of factors such as flooding play a critical role in determining population dynamics.

As a result, increased attention has been paid to the development and testing of more synthetic multivariate hypotheses. One class of multivariate hypotheses, founded in successional diversity theory, predict that species richness is jointly influenced by periodic disturbances that create new niche opportunities in space or time, and the production of community biomass that speeds displacement of inferior by superior competitors. While the joint response of diversity to disturbance and productivity has gained support from theoretical and small-scale experimental studies, evidence that corresponding patterns of biodiversity occur broadly across natural systems is scarce. Using a data set that employed standardized methods to sample 85 streams throughout the mid-Atlantic United States of America, we show that biogeographical patterns of primary producer diversity in stream ecosystems are consistent with the predictions of a multivariate model that incorporates disturbance frequency and community biomass production as independent variables. Periphyton species richness is a concave-down function of disturbance frequency (mean no. floods year-1) and of biomass production (μg of biomass accrual cm-2 day-1), and an increasing function of their interaction. Changes in richness across the disturbance x productivity response surface can be related to several predicted life-history traits of the dominant species. Our findings complement prior studies by showing that multivariate models which consider interactive effects of community production and ecosystem disturbance are, in fact, candidate explanations of much broader patterns of richness in natural systems. Because multivariate models predict synergistic effects of ecological variables on species diversity, human activities - which are simultaneously altering both the disturbance regime and productivity of streams - could be influencing biodiversity more than previously anticipated. © 2006 The Authors.",70,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Disturbance | Flood | Freshwater algae | Periphyton | Primary production | River | Species diversity | Stream ecosystem functioning,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,56,NA,NA

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. Cakile maritima (sea rocket) is a succulent, annual species that is confined to maritime strandlines on sand or shingle, and associated foredunes. British material is ssp. integrifolia (= ssp. maritima), found around the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Europe. Cakile maritima shows considerable variation, within and between subspecies, especially in fruit morphology and leaf shape. A very closely related species, Cakile edentula, is native to the east coast of North America. Both species have been introduced to Pacific North America and Australia. Populations of C. maritima tend be ephemeral and shifting, depending on dispersal by tides and wind. The fruits are 2-segmented: the distal segments are readily detached and can float considerable distances in seawater; the proximal segments tend to shed their seed while attached to the maternal plant. Seeds require cold stratification and do not germinate at high salinity, or usually while retained in intact fruit segments. There is often a flush of germination in strandlines left by early season, equinoctial spring tides. Cakile maritima shows great phenotypic plasticity of form and reproductive output. Work on C. edentula suggests that abundance is regulated by a combination of density-dependent and density-independent processes. Landward dispersal of seeds from strandline populations may subsidise foredune populations, which themselves experience severe mortality from predators. Cakile maritima is tolerant of salt spray and transient seawater inundation. Although beach and dune sand is a meagre source of macronutrients, C. maritima shows large growth responses to nitrogen addition and can exploit local nitrogen enrichment associated with mineralisation of organic detritus washed up on the strandline. Growth is stimulated by burial with blown sand and plants sometimes form the nuclei of early successional foredunes. The tissues are rich in glucosinolates; these may be responsible for the limited ranges of herbivores and fungal pathogens, and the absence of mycorrhiza. © 2006 The Authors.",45,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,Coastal distribution | Communities | Conservation | Ecophysiology | Genetic variation | Germination | Herbivory | Parasites and diseases | Phenotypic plasticity | Reproductive biology | Soils,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,57,NA,NA

Previous research has focused on the role of colonization success in governing plant community patterns in abandoned forests, but few studies have explored how changes in the performance of adult plants may contribute to changes in plant populations. We examined patterns of biomass allocation and growth of 12 herbaceous plant species in southern Appalachian forest stands that have developed after agricultural abandonment or logging at least 55 years ago, to determine whether plant performance varied with land-use history. Soil nutrient availability and canopy closure were also investigated. Adult plant biomass allocation varied appreciably among stands with different histories. Herbs in farmed stands generally allocated the most to leaves and the least to stems, while reference stands showed the opposite pattern. Plants in previously farmed sites had the highest rate of growth, although we observed considerable interspecific variation in plant performance. Stem allocation and relative growth rate were positively correlated in reference stands, but not in farmed or logged stands. Similarly, the growth of plants was clearly associated with soil nutrient concentration in reference stands but not in farmed or logged stands. Differences in understorey density and soil nutrient availability may account for the observed patterns. Total herbaceous cover was appreciably lower in farmed and logged stands (58% and 51%) than in reference stands (78%), and soil phosphorus was higher in farmed stands than in logged and reference stands. Thus, competition for light and nutrients may be lower in farmed and logged stands than in reference stands, despite there being no difference in canopy closure with land-use history. Overall, these results suggest that land-use history may influence environmental variables in ways that can enhance the performance of some herbaceous species.

Six years after webbing, crown cover had increased by 14.4%, compared to a 2.1% increase for the control plots. Webbing also resulted in significant increases in mean branch length, leaf area per branch and foliage density of individual branches from top and middle sections of the crown. Polishing of branches, caused by chronic contact with adjacent trees, was three times as common on control trees compared to webbed trees. The mean leaf area per tree was larger for the webbed trees. Crowns of webbed trees were more symmetrical than those of control trees. Trees from webbed plots, however, had a decline in leaf area density. The branches of control trees were typically curved upward with twigs pointed inward, making the crowns more compact compared to the outwardly expanding crowns of trees from the webbed plots. The fact that crowns expanded laterally after webbing, despite little change in light regime, provides strong evidence against the hypothesis that loss of crown closure in maturing stands is caused by a lack of light. The study indicates that the decline in crown closure and leaf area in maturing and tall stands is at least partly related to wind-induced sway of trees abrading the edges of crowns. © 2006 The Authors.",56,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Abrasion | Aged-related decline in productivity | Crown shyness | Crown symmetry | Leaf area | Tree sway | Wind,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,59,NA,NA

We related the density of littoral coarse wood both among and within 45 lakes in Vilas County, Wisconsin, USA, to forest structure, abiotic drivers and land use. Among all lakes and among a subset of low-development lakes, the best predictor of the density of littoral coarse wood was the density of riparian coarse wood. At the within-lake (site) level, two alternative models explain variability in coarse wood abundance: as a function of exposure to wind and amount of riparian coarse wood or as a function of exposure to wind and land-use intensity. Both among and within lakes, areas more modified by humans had a lower density of littoral coarse wood. Conversely, areas with little (current) human impact were tremendously variable; some sites and lakes had abundant wood and others had virtually none. Contrary to previous studies, there was no relationship between living trees and coarse wood density, suggesting that riparian and littoral coarse wood densities may be strongly influenced by past disturbance, both human and natural. This study highlights the importance of cross boundary subsidies in understanding the impact of development on ecosystems. The concentration of residential development at the boundary between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems appears to reduce the flow of coarse wood from forests to lakes.

We focus on six categorical traits related to forest regeneration, reproduction and dispersal: pollination mechanism, dispersal mechanism, growth form, fruit type, fruit size and seed size. We compared trait state richness and composition of each trait in forested and deforested habitats and how three pollination states (bat, bird and bee pollination) and three dispersal states (fur, bird and monkey dispersal) of conservation interest were distributed across these landscapes. Only one trait state was missing from forest, and none was missing from deforested habitats. Understorey and pasture were consistently trait state poor. Forested and deforested plots differed in trait state composition for all traits. Pasture riverbanks and road verges were compositionally similar to forest riverbanks and tree-fall gaps, for multiple traits. There were more compositional similarities between forested and deforested habitat types when abundance of individuals with a trait state was used as the basis for similarity measures than when the number of species with each trait state was used. Bat-, bird- and bee-pollinated plants and plants with bird- and monkey-dispersed fruits were most common in forest and pasture riverbanks whereas species with fur-dispersed seeds were more common in all deforested habitats. Functional diversity patterns were inconsistent across habitat types and locations but overall functional similarity was high between forested and deforested communities. Patterns of functional diversity were far more variable between habitats and landscapes than the consistent patterns found previously for species diversity. © 2006 The Authors.",63,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Biodiversity conservation | Dispersal | Functional diversity | Growth form | Human-dominated countryside | Native herbaceous plants | Native shrubs | Pollination | Tropical deforestation,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,61,NA,NA

We used SMA to test for differences in slopes between groups. We found a significant common slope amongst all subsets of the larger data set. The estimated common slope and the 95% confidence interval for the relationship between ln(elaiosome size) and ln(seed size) across all data sets fell above one (1.24, 95%CI = 1.17-1.32), suggesting positive allometry. Slopes were also significantly positive and strikingly similar between the Acacia species data set and the Other species data sets. Similar positive allometry was shown in the 'other' species data set among genera and families, and among species independent of genus means ('species effects'). Significant and consistent relationships between taxonomic levels, independent of relationships at other levels, along with significant relationships at the species level, and similarity of slopes, suggest independent convergence towards an underlying functional relationship that has persisted over long evolutionary periods. Our results therefore suggest that ants have been agents of selection on seed traits. Such a functional relationship might result from a trade-off in ant foraging behaviour between the benefit of the reward (elaiosome) and the cost of the dispersal (determined by seed size). Slopes > 1 would then suggest that ants need more than proportionally larger rewards to remove larger seeds. © 2006 The Authors.",57,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Elaiosome size | Functional relationship | Phylogenetic effects | Seed dispersal | Seed size,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,62,NA,NA

Whether neighbouring plants can 'eavesdrop' on such airborne cues and tailor their defences accordingly, remains controversial. We used Lima bean plants (Phaseolus lunatus) to investigate whether herbivore-induced VOCs induce another indirect defence strategy, i.e. the secretion of extrafloral nectar (EFN) in conspecific plant neighbours, and whether this enhances the defence status of the receiving plant under natural conditions. EFN secretion was induced by VOCs released from herbivore-damaged bean tendrils as well as by a synthetic VOC mixture resembling the natural one. One constituent of the herbivore-induced blend - the green leaf volatile (3Z)-hex-3-enyl acetate - was sufficient to elicit the defence reaction. A long-term experiment comparing the defensive effect of EFN alone with the VOC-mediated effect (EFN induction plus attraction of plant defenders) suggested that Lima bean benefits from both indirect defences. Repeated treatment of tendrils with either an artificial blend of VOCs or with EFN led to the attraction of a higher cumulative number of predatory and parasitoid insects (i.e. ants and wasps) as well as to less herbivore damage and an increased production of inflorescences and leaves. Our results demonstrate that one indirect defence mechanism can induce another one in conspecific plants, and that Lima bean plants can benefit from this VOC-induced EFN secretion under natural conditions. Both extrafloral nectaries and the capability to release VOCs upon herbivory are present in many plant taxa and airborne signalling may thus represent a common mechanism for regulating the secretion of EFN in plant parts which face an increased risk of herbivory. © 2006 The Authors.",222,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Airborne signalling | Ants | Extrafloral nectar | Herbivore-induced plant volatiles | Herbivory (3Z)-hex-3-enyl acetate | Indirect defence | Lima bean | Mexico | Plant-plant communication,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,63,NA,NA

We evaluated the influence of light and biomass support costs on growth rates of trees 8-25 cm in diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) among 21 species differing in wood density in two aseasonal rain forests. Measurements of crown width, tree height, d.b.h. and wood density (ρ) were used to estimate the stem biomass (Ms) of a standard-sized tree (17 m tall and 16 m2 in crown area), i.e. the cost in stem biomass of supporting a given sized crown at a given height. The species showed a three-fold range in support cost, which was highly correlated with wood density (Ms ∝ ρ0.77, r2 = 0.72 for the log-transformed relationship). This relationship is due to the high interspecific variation in wood density and the fact that the stem diameter of the standard-sized tree increased only slightly with decreasing wood density, i.e. light-wooded species did not compensate for their lighter, weaker wood by substantially increasing stem thickness. Mean growth rate per species showed a 10-fold range and increased with the fraction of trees at least partly in gaps (gap fraction), the reciprocal of support cost (1/Ms), and the reciprocal of wood density (1/ρ). The relationship between mean growth rate and 1/Ms was particularly strong when one outlier was excluded (r2 = 0.88) and among the Dipterocarpaceae (r2 = 0.89). Log(mortality rate), as determined for all trees per species ≥ 1 cm d.b.h., increased linearly with 1/Ms, 1/ρ and gap fraction.

It is evident that not all explanations that have been offered for animals are directly applicable to plants. We suggest three hypotheses that require further study in the interpretation of size-dependent species richness in plants. These hypotheses are all based on mechanisms that have generated, for smaller plants, a greater historical opportunity for speciation: (i) large adult plant size confers significant adaptation primarily in habitat types that have been relatively uncommon in space, across evolutionary time; (ii) relatively small species are more widely differentiated from each other in the environmental qualities defining their niches, many of which are made possible by the mere presence of larger species residing in the same habitat; and (iii) compared with large species, smaller species generally have higher fecundity allocation, i.e. they can produce a greater number of offspring per unit plant size per unit time, which generally confers a higher premium under most circumstances of natural selection, thus generating a potentially greater number of descendant individuals, and derived species. We discuss the implications of these hypotheses in addressing an underlying paradox in plant competition/coexistence theory, i.e. that large adult size is assumed to be the principal trait that confers competitive ability yet, even in those habitat types where competition is assumed to reach the highest levels of intensity within vegetation, the vast majority of the resident species are, nevertheless, relatively small. © 2006 The Authors.",87,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Coexistence | Competition | Competitive ability | Fecundity allocation | Fitness | Habitat availability | Niche | Size distribution | Speciation | Species diversity | Species pool,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,65,NA,NA

However, the role of facilitation varies along environmental severity gradients. It is important to understand the shape of this relationship to improve our ability to predict the impact of a changing environment on biodiversity. We used Scots pine saplings growing within heather to examine the shape of the relationship between facilitative interactions (protection from browsing) and the severity of the environment (deer browsing intensity). We also investigated whether protection from browsing translated into a biomass response of saplings. In the first winter following planting heather had a facilitative effect on saplings by reducing the probability of browsing. This effect was strongest at intermediate deer browsing intensities, thus producing a hump-backed relationship between facilitative effects and the severity of the environment. Protection from browsing did not lead to longer-term biomass gains for the saplings. The competitive effects of heather on sapling growth therefore outweighed the beneficial effects of protection from browsing. These results provide much-needed information on the shape of the severity-interactions relationship with respect to a key natural disturbance phenomenon (herbivory), and demonstrate that an observable interaction relationship does not necessarily translate into a biomass response.

Eighteen plant traits were tested for relationships to AOO, and to fractal dimension while controlling for AOO. These included both directly heritable traits (e.g. life-form) and emergent properties that are, at most, indirectly heritable (e.g. typical local density). The latter set included an index of net distributional change and an index of range dynamism. Only two traits, habitat preference and local abundance, were significantly related to AOO1, but about half were associated with fractal dimension. Relatively aggregated fine-scale distributions (high D1-10) were related to high local abundance, lack of specialized, long-distance dispersal mechanisms, habitat preference and an increasing range size with relatively few local extinctions (i.e. a positive index of change with low dynamism). Relatively aggregated coarse-scale distributions (high D10-100) were related to the use of insect pollinators, obligate outcrossing, habitat preference and relatively stable ranges (low dynamism). Multivariate analyses of subsets of conceptually related variables showed that few variables interacted to affect distributional variables. A highly significant negative relationship between dynamism and fractal dimension appears to be driven primarily by high rates of local extinction, leading to relatively scattered, diffuse range structures. Furthermore, it suggests that recent population trends may be inferred from snapshots of contemporary distribution patterns. The role and interpretation of phylogenetically informed analyses in studies such as this are debatable. However, we found similar relationships in both phylogenetically informed and conventional analyses for all variables except pollination vector (a strongly conserved trait).

Analyses of rain forest sites arrayed on a substrate age gradient from c. 300 years to over 4 million years across the Hawaiian archipelago demonstrate that the sources of calcium and other essential cations shift from > 80% rock-derived in young sites to > 80% derived from marine aerosol on substrates older than 100 000 years. Rock-derived phosphorus is retained longer within ecosystems, but eventually long-distance transport of continental dust from Asia becomes the most important source of phosphorus. A biogeochemical feedback from low nutrient availability to efficient resource use by trees to slow decomposition and nutrient regeneration accentuates the geochemically driven pattern of low phosphorus availability and phosphorus limitation to net primary productivity in the oldest site.

Bunchgrass seedlings face additional pressures from both livestock grazing and barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDVs), which infect both young and established grasses throughout the state. 2 Previous work suggested that B/CYDVs could mediate apparent competition between invasive exotic grasses and native bunchgrasses in California. 3 To investigate the potential significance of virus-mediated mortality for early survivorship of bunchgrass seedlings, we compared the separate and combined effects of virus infection, competition and simulated grazing in a field experiment. We infected two species of young bunchgrasses that show different sensitivity to B/CYDV infection, subjected them to competition with three different densities of exotic annuals crossed with two clipping treatments, and monitored their growth and first-year survivorship. 4 Although virus infection alone did not reduce first-year survivorship, it halved the survivorship of bunchgrasses competing with exotics. Within an environment in which competition strongly reduces seedling survivorship (as in natural grasslands), virus infection therefore has the power to cause additional seedling mortality and alter patterns of establishment. 5 Surprisingly, clipping did not reduce bunchgrass survivorship further, but rather doubled it and disproportionately increased survivorship of infected bunchgrasses. 6 Together with previous work, these findings show that B/CYDVs can be potentially powerful elements influencing species interactions in natural grasslands. 7 More generally, our findings demonstrate the potential significance of multitrophic interactions in virus ecology.

In addition, the ectomycorrhizal fungal community structure of trees with low, intermediate and high levels of dwarf mistletoe were significantly different, primarily due to a shift in the dominance of ascomycete fungi. 5 These higher levels of ectomycorrhizal colonization were associated with increased fungal inoculum under the crowns of pinyons heavily infected with dwarf mistletoe. In addition, 33% more pinyon seedlings were found in the understories of mistletoe-infected trees than uninfected trees. 6 These findings point to complex multi-trophic interactions between the above-ground and below-ground communities of pinyon pine, and suggest that a detailed understanding of host-parasite relationships may require study of other symbionts associated with the host. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",35,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Arceuthobium divaricatum | Dwarf mistletoe | Ectomycorrhizas | Parasitism | Seedling establishment,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,70,NA,NA

Here, using 213 106 individual stem records derived from a national survey in Ghana, West Africa, we examine the relationship between relative crown exposure, ontogeny and phylogeny for 109 canopy species. 2 We use a generalized linear model (GLM) framework to allow interspecific comparisons of crown exposure that control for stem-size. For each species, a multinomial response model is used to describe the probabilities of the relative canopy illumination classes as a function of stem diameter. 3 In general, and for all larger stems, canopy-exposure increases with diameter. Five species have size-related exposure patterns that reveal local minima above 5 cm d.b.h., but only one, Panda oleosa, shows a local maximum at a low diameter. 4 The pattern of species exposures at 10 cm diameter is consistent with two overlapping groups, of which the smaller (21 species, including most pioneers) is generally better exposed. 5 Relative illumination rankings amongst species are significantly maintained over a wide range of stem sizes. Species that are well exposed at small diameters are therefore also more likely to be well exposed at larger diameters, although two species in the most exposed 25% of species at 10 cm d.b.h. drop to the lowest illumination quartile at 40 cm d.b.h., and three demonstrate the opposite (low-to-high) pattern. 6 Species capable of achieving the largest diameters are generally recorded less frequently in shade than are smaller species, even when compared as saplings, suggesting that species achieving large mature sizes are generally shade intolerant when small. Controlling for phylogeny reveals that this relationship holds across independent lineages. 7 We also find evidence that the range of strategies encountered is influenced by disturbance regimes. 8 We interpret our results as indicating a continuum of strategies that reflect an evolutionary trade-off between a species' mature size and its general shade-tolerance, in combination with differentiation based on disturbance based opportunities.

With increasing size, a reduced tolerance to shade was observed for all species except trembling aspen and thus species tended to converge in shade tolerance with size.

In contrast, reducing grazing pressure on previously heavily grazed vegetation had no significant effects on any of these variables over the same time-scale. 4 Although few effects on individual species were recorded from the short-term manipulations, all those that were significant were qualitatively similar to the long-term responses of the respective species to herbivory. 5 The grass-dominated vegetation from the heavily grazed area changed little when grazing and trampling pressure were reduced for 3 years. In contrast, the dwarf shrub-dominated vegetation in the lightly grazed area changed rapidly into grasslands when the grazing pressure was enhanced. 6 Re-establishment of dwarf shrubs appears to be both seed and microsite limited, but it appears that dwarf shrubs may be able to re-establish in previously heavily grazed vegetation in the absence of reindeer. 7 Transitions from moss- or dwarf shrub-dominated ecosystems to grass-dominated ecosystems are currently occurring at different locations in boreal, arctic and alpine regions due to atmospheric nitrogen deposition and livestock grazing.

Little is known about the form and components such functions should have. 2 We evaluate some properties of kernel functions using data on the growth of Arabidopsis thaliana plants in replicated, even-aged stands of many individuals. Because of the essential non-independence of plant growth in stands, we employed a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach to estimate values and uncertainties of kernel parameters in location-dependent models of interacting plants. 3 During the experiment plant size and a simple measure of neighbourhood crowding became strongly correlated, plants tending to be small where local crowding was intense, indicating that local competition was an important process in the growth of the plants. 4 Competitive interactions between plants of different sizes were strongly asymmetric, the larger individual acquiring a disproportionately greater share of resources. Competition increased with plant size and attenuated rapidly at distances of a few centimetres, but the exact shape of the attenuation function was less important. 5 Kernel functions with the same kind of structural features were similar in their predictive ability. However, a simple zone-of-influence model, based on overlap of pairs of individuals, with competition favouring the larger individual, was arguably the most parsimonious. 6 Neighbourhood competition in stands of even-aged plants may be successfully captured with relatively simple kernel functions. The results should inform and enhance the formal theory of spatiotemporal plant population and community dynamics.

Arbuscular mycorrhizas usually increase the size and inequality of non-competing plants, but mycorrhizal effects often disappear when plants begin competing. We hypothesized that mycorrhizal effects on size inequality would be determined by the experimental conditions, and conducted simultaneous field and glasshouse experiments to investigate how AM fungi and intraspecific competition determine size inequality in Plantago lanceolata. 2 As predicted, plant size was reduced when plants were competing, in both field and controlled conditions. However, size inequality was unexpectedly reduced by competition. Plants may have competed in a symmetric fashion, probably for nutrients, rather than the more common situation, in which plant competition is strongly asymmetric. 3 Mycorrhizas had no effect on plant size or size inequality in competing plants in either field or controlled conditions, possibly because competition for nutrients was intense and negated any benefit the fungi could provide. 4 The effects of mycorrhizas on non-competing plants were also unexpected. In field-grown plants, AM fungi increased plant size, but decreased size inequality: mycorrhizal plants were more even in size, with few very small individuals. In glasshouse conditions, mycorrhizal colonization was extremely high, and was generally antagonistic, causing a reduction in plant size. Here, however, mycorrhizas caused an increase in size inequality, supporting our original hypothesis. This was because most plants were heavily colonized and small, but a few had low levels of colonization and grew relatively large. 5 This study has important implications for understanding the forces that structure plant communities. AM fungi can have a variety of effects on size inequality and thus potentially important influences on long-term plant population dynamics, by affecting the genetic contribution of individuals to the next generation. However, these effects differ, depending on whether plants are competing or not, the degree of mycorrhizal colonization and the responsiveness of the plant to different colonization densities. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Antagonistic | Beneficial | Field grown plants | Gini coefficient | Glasshouse plants | Intraspecific competition | Lorenz curves | Mycorrhizas | Plant community | Size inequality,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,75,NA,NA

We analysed the growth of target plants over two time intervals as a function of their own size and the size of their neighbours at the beginning of the interval. 2 When competition became intense, the relative growth rate of target plants was primarily determined by the size of their neighbours. There was a negative linear relationship between the relative growth rate of target plants over an interval and the biomass of their neighbours at the beginning of the interval. The size of the target plant itself did not make a significant additional contribution to predicting its growth rate. There is a limit on the growth in biomass of the population (target + neighbours), and growth of individuals occurs within this constraint. Local biomass density, which can be primarily determined by neighbouring individuals, can be much more important for an individual's growth than its own size. 3 There was no evidence of size-asymmetric competition.

The resistance of vegetation to change may be mediated through the effects of topography (slope and aspect) on soils and microclimate. 2 To assess long-term vegetation change in British chalk grasslands, 92 plots first surveyed by F. H. Perring in 1952-53, and distributed across four climatic regions, were re-surveyed during 2001-03. Changes in vegetation since the original survey were assessed by comparing local colonization and extinction rates at the plot scale, and changes in species frequency at the subplot scale. Vegetation change was quantified using indirect ordination (Detrended Correspondence Analysis; DCA) and Ellenberg indicator values. 3 Across all four regions, there was a significant decrease in species number and a marked decline in stress-tolerant species typical of species-rich calcareous grasslands, both in terms of decreased plot occupancy and decreased frequency within occupied plots. More competitive species typical of mesotrophic grasslands had colonized plots they had not previously occupied, but had not increased significantly in frequency within occupied plots. 4 A significant increase in Ellenberg fertility values, which was highly correlated with the first DCA axis, was found across all regions. The magnitude of change of fertility and moisture values was found to decrease with angle of slope and with a topographic solar radiation index derived from slope and aspect. 5 The observed shift from calcareous grassland towards more mesotrophic grassland communities is consistent with the predicted effects of both habitat fragmentation and nutrient enrichment. It is hypothesized that chalk grassland swards on steeply sloping ground are more resistant to invasion by competitive grass species than those on flatter sites due to phosphorus limitation in shallow minerogenic rendzina soils, and that those with a southerly aspect are more resistant due to increased magnitude and frequency of drought events. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",252,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Chalk grassland | Colonization | Ellenberg indicator values | Extinction | Nitrogen deposition | Resistance | Topography,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,79,NA,NA

Recurrent wet and dry phases in the reconstructed palaeohydrological record indicated pronounced temporal variability. Wet and dry phases were compared between cores and with palaeoclimatic proxy values, measured as percentage melt and δ18O in nearby ice cores. 3 Periodic wet and dry phases appear unrelated to past climate over c. 50% of the combined stratigraphic records, and are attributable instead to geomorphological mechanisms. At other times, association of wet and dry phases with significantly lower and higher values of percentage melt and δ18O indicate a possible effect of past climate change on polygon hydrology and vegetation, although inconsistencies between cores suggest that local geomorphological processes continued to modify a regional climatic effect. However, during a period incorporating the Little Ice Age (c. 305-530 cal. years BP), reconstructed moisture and vegetation change is pronounced and consistent among all three cores. 4 The results provide strong evidence for the sensitivity of a High Arctic terrestrial ecosystem to past climate change during the Holocene.

Analysis of the modern distribution of these taxa and their pollen rains confirms that species-level pollen identifications provide detailed ecological information, but the lack of distinction to the species level in many fossil and modern pollen studies renders palaeoenvironmental reconstructions incomplete. 4 Within each of three selected high-resolution sites, ordinations indicate that individual species of Acer, Fraxinus and Juglans follow different trajectories through the Holocene, showing that analysing only generic categories results in the loss of ecologically valuable information. For example, pollen of Acer rubrum increased in abundance in response to canopy openings in a southern Ontario forest around 500 years ago, while that of A. saccharum declined. Similarly, Juglans nigra pollen percentages increased while J. cinerea decreased at this time. 5 Regional-scale comparisons of pollen percentage curves indicate that, despite the uncertainties associated with the low temporal resolution and the chronologies, it is reasonable to conclude that individual species of Acer, Fraxinus and Juglans responded synchronously to palaeoclimatic changes within each region. 6 Taking analyses to the specific level shows that different species followed different tracks in their post-glacial history, a fact previously blurred by less resolved taxonomy.

In recent decades the grass Phragmites australis has been aggressively invading coastal marshes of North America, with monocultures often replacing diverse assemblages of plants. 2 Our objective was to quantify how P. australis modifies the abiotic (soil and light conditions) and biotic (litter and shoots) environment and to determine the mechanisms by which it excludes two common forbs, the annual chenopod Atriplex patula var. hastata and the perennial aster Solidago sempervirens, from the highest tidal elevations of a brackish marsh in southern New England, USA. 3 In a 3-year field experiment we added seeds of both forb species to stands of P. australis, where we manipulated shoots and litter in an orthogonal design, and to uninvaded marsh areas dominated by the rush Juncus gerardi, where we manipulated the shoots of the marsh vegetation. In general, seedling establishment and the number of plants surviving until the end of the growing season were substantially greater in areas not invaded by P. australis, and both shoots and litter limited the abundance of forbs within stands. 4 Forbs surviving within stands of P. australis grew larger and produced more seeds than those in uninvaded areas, indicating that changes to the soil resulting from invasion do not preclude the survival of established forbs. This was confirmed by a glasshouse study where the performance of forbs in soil collected from within stands of P. australis was better than in soil from areas dominated by J. gerardi. 5 Similar to many invasive grasses in terrestrial communities, P. australis excludes native forbs through competition, modifying the biotic environment of the marsh at both the ground (litter) and above-ground (shoots) levels. Our results suggest that successful invaders, such as P. australis, are likely to be the ones that can engineer habitats in multiple ways and limit populations of native species across several critical stages of their life history. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",88,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Brackish and salt marsh plants | Competition | Dispersal limitation and seed supply | Ecosystem engineer | Invasive species | Litter | Phragmites australis | Recruitment limitation | Sedimentation | Seedling establishment,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,86,NA,NA

This doctrine has recently been challenged because of evidence demonstrating larger leaf dry mass per unit area (MA), lower photosynthetic capacities and inferior whole plant relative growth rates (RGR) in both high and low irradiance in seedlings of shade-tolerators. However, as the individuals of shade-tolerant species often need to endure canopy shade for many years before gap formation, testing of the carbon gain hypothesis of shade tolerance requires examination of species carbon gain potentials during the entire plant ontogeny. 2 Light vs. MA relationships throughout ontogeny demonstrate that saplings and canopy individuals of shade tolerators do have lower MA than intolerant species, and moderately higher photosynthetic capacities in low light, resulting in greater whole plant carbon gain capacities at lower light. The apparent discrepancy between results from studies on seedlings vs. saplings/trees is due to MA increasing at a faster rate in shade intolerators during ontogeny. A strong positive linkage between seed size and species shade tolerance further implies that shade tolerators have larger initial size, absolute growth rate and survivorship in low light despite their lower RGR. 3 The evidence reviewed collectively suggests that the carbon balance concept of species' successional position is valid for both seedlings and saplings, and that the apparent discrepancies in species rankings on the basis of structural and physiological characteristics are driven by variations in initial size and rate of ontogeny. Analyses of species shade tolerance potentials should therefore consider how any suite of adaptive traits varies with ontogeny. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",132,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Absolute growth rate | Leaf structure | Light availability | Minimum light requirement | Photosynthetic capacity | Plant ontogeny | Relative growth rate | Shade tolerance | Vegetation dynamics,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,87,NA,NA

The remarkable radiation of the Aizoaceae in the southern African winter-rainfall deserts is no exception. 2 We examined the role of specialization to soil microenvironments in the coexistence and differentiation of the aizoaceous genus Argyroderma, which is confined to quartz-lag gravel habitat in southern Africa. 3 We examined patterns of edaphic habitat use and morphological divergence between three sympatrically occurring species (one habitat generalist and two quartz specialists) and used transplant experiments to investigate the extent of local adaptation to quartz microenvironments. 4 Soils utilized by populations of the generalist, A. fissum, and one of the specialists, A. pearsonii, differ significantly in terms of stone content and quartz cover. The soils utilized by the two specialist taxa (A. pearsonii and A. delaetii) do not differ significantly in terms of the variables measured, although A. pearsonii consistently uses habitats with higher quartz cover at all contact zones investigated. 5 The three species are clearly separated morphologically. The morphological trend between Argyroderma species occupying sparse (A. fissum) and dense (A. pearsonii and A. delaetii) quartz habitats is towards reduction in plant size and height (dwarfism), increased levels of submergence, decreased branching, spherical leaf shapes, increased leaf thickness and increased enclosure of the leaf by the old leaf sheaths. The two specialist taxa differ in terms of leaf sheath enclosure, plant submergence and fruit traits. 6 Transplant experiments demonstrate home-site survival advantage in transplants between species occupying sparse and dense quartz habitats as well as between microenvironments within the dense quartz habitat. 7 The results suggest that divergence in potentially functional morphological traits between Argyroderma species occupying different edaphic microenvironments probably results from local adaptation, with coexistence facilitated by response to fine-scale habitat variation. In addition, the results suggest a possible role for edaphic specialization in the evolutionary divergence of Argyroderma and perhaps in the broader radiation of the Aizoaceae in southern Africa. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",55,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Aizoaceae | Coexistence | Edaphic specialization | Local adaptation | Reciprocal transplant experiment | South Africa | Succulent Karoo,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,88,NA,NA

Variation partitioning was used to examine the relative contribution of subsets of environmental variables such as site spatial variation, boundary type and presence of herbivores. 4 Ordination confirmed hypotheses that field layer vegetation is primarily structured by two composite geo-climatic gradients. However, variation partitioning demonstrated that site- and plot-scale management factors also strongly influence the floristic composition of forest patches. 5 Disturbance variables (site boundary type/regional presence of deer) accounted for considerable species variation, exceeding that due to either site spatial variation or forest structure. 6 This is the first time variation attributable to such a comprehensive range of environmental variables has been quantified for forests surveyed at a national scale. We thus provide a context within which regional studies, or analyses considering a more limited range of factors, can be viewed, and a framework from which robust models of floristic response to gradual and episodic natural and anthropogenic disturbances may be developed. 7 The methodology we present, including a novel technique for the identification and removal of outliers in large data sets, provides a unique and standardized means of assessing the relative importance of diverse environmental drivers across a range of habitat types at the landscape scale, and is readily applicable elsewhere. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",36,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Canonical correspondence analysis | Forest field layer | Forest herb species | National Woodland Survey | Variation partitioning | Vegetation analysis,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,89,NA,NA

Periods of high growth after canopy disturbances (releases) are necessary for successful canopy regeneration, but their importance cannot be studied without lifetime data. The recent detection of annual rings in tropical forest trees enables such analyses. 2 We used tree ring analysis to study lifetime growth patterns and age variation in six Bolivian rain forest species. Our aims were to evaluate the magnitude and sources of age variation of canopy trees, to analyse the frequency of suppression and release events, and to analyse the relation between temporal growth changes and tree age. 3 The average age of trees of 60 cm diameter differed threefold between species and by two- to threefold even within species. This variation was mainly explained by variation in passage time through the juvenile categories. 4 We used strong relative growth changes to detect release and suppression events. On average, canopy trees experienced 0.8-1.4 releases, with a maximum of 4. 5 We distinguished four canopy accession patterns by which trees have attained the canopy (growth without major growth changes, one release event, one suppression event, or several release and suppression events), with increasing time required to attain the canopy. The distribution of trees over categories of canopy accession is therefore closely related to the average age of canopy trees and its variation. 6 There were clear differences among species in how trees attained the canopy and in the length of slow-growth periods they experienced, suggesting differences in shade tolerance and growth responses to gaps, which are indicative of life-history differences among non-pioneer tree species. 7 Canopy attainment of tropical rain forest trees does not occur by steady growth, but rather by irregular patterns of growth spurts and stand-stills, probably mostly caused by temporal variation in light.

In the coastal marshes of Hudson and James bays, foraging by increasing numbers of lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens A.O.U.) has led to loss of vegetation, and exposure and partial erosion of sediment. 2 Multi-temporal analysis of LANDSAT data has been carried out to detect vegetation change from 1973 to 1999 or later at nine sites in the coastal marshes of these bays where staging and/or breeding geese are present annually. 3 Images were co-registered, and for each image NDVI (Normalized Differential Vegetation Index) channels were generated. For each location, pairwise normalized differences were calculated between these NDVI images for each successive period defined by the imagery acquisition dates. The resulting secondary NDVI difference images expressed changes in NDVI values for each time interval and yielded three well-defined classes: water, vegetation decline and no detectable change in vegetation. 4 At the nine widely separated study sites, the intertidal saltmarsh (an ecological sere) has been lost (to a total of 35 000 ha) and an alternative stable state (exposed sediment) established. Similar changes have occurred elsewhere along the 2000-km coastline where the geese breed or stage. 5 Re-vegetation of these coastal marshes will take decades because of near-irreversible changes in soil properties that require erosion and re-deposition of unconsolidated sediment before large-scale plant colonization can occur, and because large numbers of geese continue to forage annually producing this dramatic top-down effect. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",139,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Alternative vegetative states | LANDSAT imagery | Population numbers of lesser snow geese | Self-organized patchiness | Soil salinity,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,91,NA,NA

Because several indicators suggest a stronger selective pressure for such traits in California than in the Mediterranean Basin, we hypothesize that plant species should have evolved to become R+ and P+ more frequently in California than in the Mediterranean Basin. 2 To test this hypothesis we studied the phylogenetic association between R and P states in both California and the Mediterranean Basin using published molecular phylogenies. 3 The results suggest that R and P evolved differently in the two regions. The occurrence of the states differs significantly between regions for trait P, but not for trait R. The different patterns (towards R+ and P+ in California and towards R+ and P- in the Mediterranean Basin) are reflected in the higher abundance and the wider taxonomic distribution of species with both persistence traits (R+P+ species) in California. 4 The differential acquisition of fire persistence mechanisms at the propagule level (P+) supports the idea that fire selective pressures has been higher in California than in the Mediterranean Basin. 5 Our comparative phylogenetic-informed analysis contributes to an understanding of the differential role of the Quaternary climate in determining fire persistence traits in different Mediterranean-type ecosystems and, thus, to the debate on the evolutionary convergence of traits. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",72,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,California | Exaptation | Fire and plant evolution | Fire ecology | Mediterranean basin | Persistence traits | Resprouting | Seeding | Sprouting,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,92,NA,NA

A period of 150 years is too short for Succisa to have spread extensively if dispersal parameters are given realistic values. 4 Simulations in which present-day land-use patterns were imposed at earlier dates showed that changes in landscape structure over the past 175 years also had a strong effect on the present-day habitat occupancy and population sizes of Succisa. 5 The dominant process for Succisa now is extinction from marginal habitats. It is therefore likely that the (relatively) high present-day occupation patterns are still due to much larger areas having been available in the past rather than to successful dispersal. Although the species has responded to landscape changes, there is little evidence of population sizes reaching equilibrium. 6 Our approach shows that the wealth of landscape information available from historical maps can be linked with data on population biology by means of dynamical models that can make predictions about species dynamics. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",76,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Equilibrium | Extinction debt | Land-use change | Landscape manipulation experiments | Metapopulation dynamics | Population biology | Southern Sweden | Transient dynamics,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,93,NA,NA

In particular, differences in soil nutrient content, drainage and canopy openness correlated with floristic differences. 5 The decline in mean floristic similarity with increasing geographical distance was stronger than proposed by the random dispersal model over short distances (up to c. 100 m), which is probably attributable to both dispersal limitation and environmental changes. The scatter around the mean was large at all distances. 6 Our initial expectation was that the effects of dispersal limitation (represented by geographical distance) on observed patterns of floristic similarity would be stronger, and those of environmental differences weaker, than at broader spatial scales.

High summer precipitation enhanced the N effect, suggesting that precipitation may modify the effects of N deposition on plant-parasite interactions. This may complicate predictions of future effects of N deposition as precipitation patterns are expected to change as a result of climate change. 4 Our results suggest that small-scale fertilization experiments may underestimate future large-scale effects of N deposition, and indicate the need for increased awareness of the problems associated with scaling results from experiments using small-scale manipulation of environmental variables. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",24,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Boreal forest | Nitrogen deposition | Spatial scale dependence | Vaccinium myrtillus | Valdensia heterodoxa,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,96,NA,NA

However, this effect was not strong enough to transform the neutral relationship of productivity with alpha (1 m2) diversity to a positive relationship of productivity with gamma (1000 m2) diversity. 4 The positive effect of productivity on beta diversity was not related to increasing heterogeneity in coarse measures of vegetation structure (percentage cover of shade, litter, rocks, moss, bare soil, animal disturbance). We speculate that the effect may instead have a 'top-down' explanation: higher beta diversity may be caused by the positive influence of productivity on the size of the regional species pool. 5 Our study illustrates the principle of a 'scale transition', in which an ecological pattern is qualitatively different at different spatial scales. Careful attention to scale-dependence may help narrow the search for mechanisms for such long-studied ecological puzzles as the latitudinal diversity gradient. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",87,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Beta diversity | Diversity | Heterogeneity | Productivity | Regional species pool | Scale transition | Serpentine | Spatial scale | Species richness,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,99,NA,NA

My goal here is to present a qualitative model to further our understanding about the driving forces of plant taxonomic richness across spatial scales. 2 The model attempts to predict local plant species richness based on previous work regarding (i) correlations between temperature, precipitation and richness, (ii) correlations between soil nutrient availability and richness derived from both descriptions and experimental manipulations, and (iii) empirical demonstrations of the importance of the species pool in regulating local species richness. 3 The model consists of a phenomenlogical submodel of the multiplicative effects of temperature, water and mineral nutrients on plant species richness, with a spatially implicit submodel of immigration and extinction of species in local communities. 4 The model makes the following five testable predictions. (i) Local richness increases linearly with immigration rate of new species and curvilinearly with local extinction rate. (ii) The effects of altered local immigration and extinction rates will be most apparent in local communities embedded in species-rich metacommunities. (iii) Local communities are not saturated, but rather increase in richness directly with increasing metacommunity richness. (iv) Unimodal or hump-shaped productivity-richness relations arise when low water or temperature limit diversity at low productivity and mineral nutrients limit diversity at high productivity. (v) An apparent scale-dependence of the effect productivity on richness should arise when there exists a matching scale-dependence of the underlying environmental drivers. These predictions do not contrast sharply with available data, but remain largely untested. 5 I suggest that continued attempts to synthesize the most predictive patterns emerging from the burgeoning global data bases of both taxonomic and genetic diversity will guide us toward mechanistic explanations of the determinants of species richness, suggest why special cases differ from general patterns, and provide additional novel predictions not currently apparent. © 2006 British Ecological Society.",18,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Competition | Diversity | Hump-shaped | Latitudinal gradient | Metacommunity | Productivity | Scale | Scale-dependence | Shifting limitation | Source-sink | Species pool,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,100,NA,NA

Selection for phenotypically plastic antiherbivory responses has been suggested for many plants, including a few species of seaweed, but little is known about its specificity or seasonality. 2 Multi-factorial experiments tested the effects of consumer identity (Littorina brevicula vs. Haliotis discus) and season (summer vs. autumn) on the induction of antiherbivory defences in the brown seaweed Ecklonia cava. Following a grazer-free acclimation phase, algae were incubated with grazers (treatment phase) and, subsequently, without grazers (recovery phase). Feeding preference assays, were used to assess differences in consumption rates between grazer-exposed and control plants. 3 In summer, Littorina, but not Haliotis, induced defence in Ecklonia. This defence vanished by the end of the recovery phase. In autumn, neither exposure to direct attack nor to waterborne cues induced defensive responses. 4 Both consumer identity and season of consumption can influence the ability of a given macroalgal species to induce antiherbivory defences.

In the late Holocene, however, palaeobotanical evidence indicates a distinct lowering of the treeline, while simulation projected continuous forest cover up to an altitude of 2400 m a.s.l. 5 Our results indicate that changes in temperature alone can account for changes in treeline elevation for the first half of the Holocene. The discrepancy between simulation results and palaeobotanical records since 4500 cal. BP supports the hypothesis of a strong human influence on the Alpine treeline during the late Holocene. 6 Combining palaeoecological methods with vegetation modelling can disentangle climatic effects and early human impacts on long-term vegetation dynamics.

(2005, Journal of Ecology, 93, 748-757) recently rejected the predictions of the stress-gradient hypothesis for arid and semi-arid environments in entirety. It was concluded that neither positive nor negative effects of neighbours increased with abiotic stress and that different theoretical models are now needed. 2 In light of this sweeping conclusion, we re-examined the analytical approach and explored the general synthetic power of meta-analysis. 3 Detailed statistical re-analyses demonstrated that some of the meta-analyses of Maestre et al. were robust. However, more rigorous data selection criteria, changing gradient lengths between studies and covariance in response effects did not support their original conclusions. Additionally, application of more rigorous data selection criteria did allow us to detect a significant and consistent positive effect of neighbours, which suggests that facilitation is important at many points along stress gradients. 4 Careful evaluation of the studies used by Maestre et al. also revealed serious limitations. Many studies included in the meta-analyses were not conducted along stress gradients, did not identify a stress gradient within the study, focused on invasive species or were not peer reviewed. Most importantly, however, gradient lengths were not quantified and appeared to differ dramatically among studies. This crucial source of variation was not accounted for statistically nor in the interpretations. 5 Meta-analyses are useful tools for synthesis and description but are inherently limited by the appropriateness of the data selected. Unfortunately, in this particular instance, the data available to and selected by Maestre et al. did not adequately test the stress-gradient hypothesis and cannot thus reject its value for understanding the organization of plant communities in arid systems. 6 The ecological implication of our synthesis is that meta-analytical summary statistics may not always tell the whole story. Alternative interpretations of differences in effect sizes (or lack thereof) are possible because studies will vary in their ability to test specific predictions of a hypothesis, and furthermore, a certain level of judgement is required to infer the relative importance of certain ideas to synthetic progress within a discipline. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",240,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Abiotic stress | Competition | Criteria for data selection | Facilitation | Gradients | Meta-analysis | Plant-plant interactions | Progress | Statistics | Synthesis,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,103,NA,NA

In the study area, Briza is both a characteristic species of old pastures and an early colonizer of young grasslands developing on previously forested or arable sites. 2 Generalized linear models revealed that descriptors of both present landscape structure and past grassland history are significant determinants of genetic variation in the Briza demes. Genetic structure and levels of within-deme diversity are influenced by the size of grassland fragments, the type of habitat surrounding the grasslands, the size/spatial extent of the demes, the geographic position of the demes and the historical continuity of the grassland fragments. 3 Gene diversity (H) was higher in demes from grassland polygons with a high proportion of adjacent grassland, higher in the more extensive demes, and decreased northwards within the study area. 4 The negative association between the inbreeding coefficient (FIS) and grassland continuity is interpreted in terms of a two-stage colonization process: recruitment into young grasslands leads initially to spatial patchiness, but subsequent selection in maturing pastures occurs within an increasingly uniform and dense sward. 5 Despite a weak overall genetic structure (as indicated by Bayesian cluster analysis) the between-deme FST was significant. Linear discriminant analysis of within-deme allele frequencies grouped the demes according to the age and previous land-use history of their grassland polygons. The convergence of the allele frequency profiles in the younger grasslands towards those of the old grasslands is consistent with convergence of selective regimes as pastures mature towards an increasingly uniform, dense sward and characteristic species assemblage. 6 The genetic composition of demes of a grassland species appears to be influenced by the process of plant community convergence during grassland development - complementing the recent finding that convergence of species composition in experimental assemblages of grassland plants is dependent on the genotypic composition of the component species. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",37,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Allozymes | Gene diversity | Grassland history | Habitat continuity | Inbreeding coefficient | Landscape mosaics,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,104,NA,NA

The benefits of gene flow therefore persist for at least one generation beyond that created by the gene flow event. 5 The fitness of offspring of crosses between F1 individuals and their maternal population did not depend on the relatedness of the parents of the F 1. Thus, there was no evidence of outbreeding depression following recombination within F1 individuals whose creation involved gene flow. 6 Our results imply that alteration of the rate of self-fertilization or the rate of gene flow between populations of S. vulgaris could affect the demographic characters that influence population establishment and persistence in this species.© 2006 British Ecological Society.",30,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Genetic rescue | Heterosis | Inbreeding depression | Outbreeding depression | Population structure | Self-fertilization | Silene vulgaris,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,107,NA,NA

The data were also used to compare genet recruitment with estimates of genet mortality. 2 We sampled F. rubra from four permanent plots in which ramet densities of all species have been recorded at a fine scale for a decade. Identities of 224 ramets were assessed by means of RAPD, yielding 145 different genets, of which most (68%) were found only once. The genet with the highest number of sampled ramets was recorded nine times. 3 By assuming that the probability that two ramets are genetically identical is a function of distance between ramets, we estimated that successful seedling recruitment rates were between 0.15 and 16 genets m-2 yr-1 depending on the plot. Genet mortality was estimated from ramet mortality using the assumption that ramet mortality was uncorrelated over space. In three of the four plots, genet mortalities fell into the same range as the genet recruitment rates. 4 The total number of genets per unit area must be known to enable determination of per capita recruitment and mortality rates. We developed an estimation technique involving simulation of the sampling process, which yielded values of 231-968 genets m-2. Genet turnover was therefore low (0.1-1% annually) and the high genet diversity is maintained by a very low recruitment. 5 Spatial analysis showed that two ramets were more likely to be genetically identical when they came from a microhabitat where Festuca ramet density had recently increased; patches in which Festuca ramet density had decreased were more likely to contain ramets from several genets. Expanding tussocks are thus more likely to be composed of ramets of one genet only. Density and biomass of other species in the neighbourhood showed little correlation with the genet structure of Festuca rubra. 6 Although ramets of Festuca rubra intermingle with other species at a fine scale, the population biology of its genets is driven mainly by the dynamics of its own ramets.

We test the hypothesis that species turnover across the habitat gradient reflects interspecific partitioning of soil resources. 2 Floristic inventories (≥ 1 cm d.b.h.) of the Dipterocarpaceae, the dominant Bornean canopy tree family, were combined with extensive soil analyses in 30 (0.16 ha) plots. Six samples per plot were analysed for total C, N, P, K, Ca and Mg, exchangeable K, Ca and Mg, extractable P, texture, and pH. 3 Extractable P, exchangeable K, and total C, N and P varied significantly among substrates and were highest on alluvium. Thirty-one dipterocarp species (n = 2634 individuals, five genera) were recorded. Dipterocarp density was similar across substrates, but richness and diversity were highest on nutrient-poor granite and lowest on nutrient-rich alluvium. 4 Eighteen of 22 species were positively or negatively associated with parent material. In 8 of 16 abundant species, tree distribution (≥ 10 cm d.b.h.) was more strongly non-random than juveniles (1-10 cm d.b.h.), suggesting higher juvenile mortality in unsuitable habitats. The dominant species Dipterocarpus sublamellatus (> 50% of stems) was indifferent to substrate, but nine of 11 'subdominant' species (> 8 individuals ha -1) were substrate specialists. 5 Eighteen of 22 species were significantly associated with soil nutrients, especially P, Mg and Ca.

However, juvenile variation (1-10 cm d.b.h.) was more strongly related to geographical distance than edaphic factors, while the converse held for established trees (≥ 10 cm d.b.h.), suggesting increased importance of niche processes with size class. 6 Pervasive dipterocarp associations with soil factors suggest that niche partitioning structures dipterocarp tree communities.

However, a lack of change in the slopes (z-values) of species-area curves indicates that proportional changes were independent of scale of observation below 400 m2. Changes in species richness were predominantly driven by immigration, which was significantly related to fire severity. Survival of species present pre-fire was greater than local extinction, but neither was related to severity. 3 Species richness of trees increased at all scales but proportional increases were smaller at larger scales and slopes of species-area curves decreased after the fire. Local seedling recruitment increased species richness at small scales, but low rates of immigration due to dispersal limitation in most species limited increases at larger scales. 4 Directional changes in species richness of non-trees were not always consistent at fine scales but both absolute and relative changes were positive at scales ≥ 1 m2 and increased with increasing scale. Slopes of species-area curves increased post-fire because localized patterns of immigration within plots resulted in little mixing of species at small scales but large changes in species richness at larger scales. 5 Fire in the southern Appalachians increases plant species richness within local communities, but rates of species turnover and patterns of beta diversity are maintained by local recruitment of tree seedlings at small scales and immigration of herb, shrub and vine species at larger scales. 6 Although decreased levels of competition after disturbance promote species coexistence at small scales, changes in species richness at larger scales are determined by the degree that the local community is linked to the species pool of the surrounding landscape through processes related to dispersal, particularly mass effects. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",46,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Disturbance | Fire | Immigration | Linville Gorge Wilderness | Mass effects | Pine-oak forests | Scale | Southern Appalachians | Species-area curves,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,111,NA,NA

The ferns were the most diverse group, with 138 species, followed by orchids (112 species). Cloud forest at 1000 m was the richest site, representing the maximum of a pronounced mid-elevation peak in epiphyte species richness. 3 Spatial randomizations of recorded elevational ranges suggest that the overall elevational richness pattern of most epiphyte groups on this transect is substantially influenced by the mid-domain effect (MDE, the mid-elevation overlap of large-ranged species). Among the environmental factors considered (rainfall, temperature and canopy light environment), only rainfall was significantly correlated with richness. 4 Different patterns of richness for vascular epiphytes and for trees indicate that mechanisms differ between life forms. 5 We collected 26% of the estimated epiphyte species of Costa Rica along a single mountain transect. This, together with the finding that different groups and life forms varied in the elevation at which species richness peaked, highlights the need to conserve the few remaining intact elevational gradients in Latin America. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",198,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Barva Transect | Beta diversity | Chao-Sørenson | Elevational gradient | Epiphyte diversity | Mantel test | Mid-domain effect | Mid-elevational bulge | Species richness,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,112,NA,NA

We also detected a more pronounced spatial genetic association between the surface seeds and flowering genets than between the deeper seeds and flowering genets. 4 These results suggest that the surface seed bank accounts for a large proportion of the previous season's seed dispersal and therefore represents the transient seed bank, whereas the deeper (persistent) seed bank pools the reproductive output of multiple generations. 5 Directional analysis indicated that secondary dispersal by running water modifies the spatial genetic structure and extends dispersal distances. Over time, this may impact on the spatial pattern of soil seeds, possibly accounting for the absence of spatial genetic structure in deeper seeds. 6 Emerging seedlings and flowering ramets were strongly clustered together at distances up to 20 cm. Surviving seedlings were aggregated at short distances because of the patchy spatial distribution of safe sites for establishment, allowing development and strengthening of the marked fine-scale spatial genetic structure. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",20,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Genetic structure | Kinship coefficient | Primula modesta | Safe site | Seed bank dynamics | Seed dispersal | Seedling establishment | Soil seed bank | Spatial autocorrelation | Spatiotemporal pattern,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,113,NA,NA
