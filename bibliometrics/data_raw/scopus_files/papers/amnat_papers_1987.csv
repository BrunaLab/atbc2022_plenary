If males have a similar survival rate but shorter postmating latencies than females, then males always exhibit higher variances in LMS than do females, given equal LMS means for both sexes. Simply observing a higher LMS variance for males than for females is not sufficient proof of the existence of sexual selection or male-male competition. Absolute LMS variances generally increase with increased survival, decreased duration of postmating latency, and increased mate availability. However, the ratio of male to female LMS variances first increases and then decreases with increasing survival; this ratio can become quite large if the length of postmating latency differs greatly between the sexes. Mate choice is favored by a sexual asymmetry in postmating latencies. Males generally have shorter postmating latencies than females; this implies that females should be choosier in their selection of mates at all levels of survival and of availability of potential mates.

Grand fir, however, undergoes a more extensive series of biochemical conversions.

Where lodgepole pine is seral, there is probably little selection for resistance once late-successional species have grown into the understory. Synchronous decline in resistance capacity among old trees in even-aged stands may increase the likelihood of beetle epidemics and subsequent fires, thereby favoring reestablishment of lodgepole pine.

The reduction in the mean fecundity is expressed through a lowered barnacle equilibrium density and, consequently, through increased free space. Equilibrium levels of infection are stable; epizootic outbreaks may therefore result from extrinsic factors that stochastically alter the population size or the threshold density of the host.

Responsiveness to photoperiod is argued to be the common physiological pathway whereby both intrinsic and extrinsic factors can interactively influence breeding. In order for animals to breed during the short days of winter, photoperiodic information must be ignored.

The classic successional pattern of species replacement results from a particular structure of correlations among life history and physiological characteristics.

In one population, there is significant variation caused by genotype-environment interaction for age at first reproduction, indicating the existence of genetic variance for plasticity in this character. In each population, however, there is a positive genetic correlation between the timing of reproduction in the long- and short-day environments, implying that the evolution of life history in one environment can influence evolution in the alternative environment. -from Authors",38,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,70,NA,NA

In the linear case of constant cost and benefit, the conditions for the evolution of intergenerational altruism are shown to depend on the form of expression of this gene, the criteria by which altruistic evolution is assessed, and the level of penetrance of the gene for altruism; these conditions are usually not found in intragenerational models. Central to the interpretation of these results are demographic factors and aspects of life history strategy that play an important role in intergenerational altruism. The case in which the fitnesses of the altruistic and selfish phenotypes are general functions of the fraction of altruists in the brood is also investigated. The shape of these functions has important effects on the conditions for the evolution of altruism.-from Authors",9,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,73,NA,NA

A fluctuating environment was assumed, such that in each generation some catastrophe may occur, in which case the only individuals that survive carry an allele resistant to the current catastrophe on the prime locus and the other individuals are most likely exterminated. Under such selection pressure, the proportion of the whole population that is exterminated depends on the number of possible catastrophes. For 3 catastrophes, possibly 1/2-2/3 but no more of the population may die.

An alternative scenario, in which the dance evolved from the bees' cognitive map, seems in many ways more plausible. Among the 4 species of honey bee and among the races of Apis mellifera, many differences in the dance appear to have adaptive value, casting light on the later evolution of the dance. The roles of sound versus vision in the dances appear related to nesting ecology; the imprecision in distance and direction indication appears to be 'tuned' to an optimal patch size; and various distance dialects appear to be consequences of winter stress.-from Authors",20,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,77,NA,NA

A given increase in diversity adds twice the number of interactions to dispersal systems as to pollination systems, suggesting a higher global specificity of the latter. For seed-dispersal systems involving frugivorous birds, mutual dependence values are strongly skewed toward the low end and illustrate generally strong asymmetries in mutualistic interactions. Coadaptation may originate from a process of species sorting without the necessity of genetic (coevolved) changes. Asymmetrical interactions and the prevalence of weak relations can provide pathways for rare species to persist and alternative routes for system responses to perturbations. -from Author",505,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,78,all,All Open Access
