Growth and development rates of individual aphids were influenced by the nutritional value of their host plant and by crowding density. Other experiments indicated that the effect of crowding was mediated through the host plant, rather than solely through direct behavioural interactions.

This conclusion is challenged on the basis of how difficult it is to detect natural enemies as density-dependent factors, especially when they act together with other stochastic processes. The point is illustrated by analysing model populations in which the parasitoids are the only regulating factor. The problem lies in attempting to detect density dependence that arises within a generation (eg by non-random parasitism between patches of different host density) from estimates of mean population size per generation. The only real solution is to seek much more detailed information from within each generation, and thus to design life table sampling programmes that are stratified in the 2 dimensions of space and time.-Author",93,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,10,NA,NA

Similarly, the red squirrel in decline was reduced to scattered 'island' populations. Interaction between the species could at the most provide a partial explanation of red squirrel decline: in many cases, red squirrels became locally extinct before establishment of grey squirrels in the same area. In other cases, coexistence occurred for up to 16 yr, or continued in 1982. Grey squirrel presence per se did not enhance the probability of red squirrel extinction. However, the more plausible possibilities of density-dependent interaction could not be tested in this extensive approach.

A viral disease caused high death-rates locally in red squirrel populations, sometimes resulting in local extinction, but was not recorded in grey squirrels.

Larvae usually pupate within 2 days of leaving their pits but some larger larvae delay pupation for up to 4 months. All pupating larvae emerge as adults, but there are 3 distinct size classes of larvae: those <140 mg become adults that are a decreasing percentage of larval weight, whereas larger larvae become adults that are a constant or an increasing percentage of larval weight. Adult females show 2 length-weight relationships, small adult females (from larvae <140 mg) being relatively shorter than large adults.

Tengmalm's owl clutches had a higher probability of being preyed upon in nest boxes where the previous clutch had been taken than in boxes where there had been a successful nesting the previous year. Pine martens thus did not encounter nest boxes randomly, but revisited those that they had found previously. Tengmalm's owls preferred to nest in new boxes, and a majority of the females shifted nest hole between successful nestings. Clutches initiated in March were in newer boxes than were later clutches, and were thus less exposed to predation. This predation situation will select for owl individuals which move to another hole after having a clutch preyed upon. If new holes become available each year it will also select for individuals which shift nest hole between successful nesting and prefer nesting in new holes.-from Author",137,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,23,NA,NA

The relative availability of clams to probing was an increasing function of clam size, despite the size-depth relationship, because large clams were easier to detect than small ones at any particular depth. As big holes were widest at the surface, the smaller clams were more available to digging crows than the deeper, large clams. From the ratio of probes to digs, it was calculated that relative availability increased only slightly with clam size.

There was little niche differentiation among the flies, many of the species sharing the same kind of fruit. Though there was less overlap over individual fruit items, the dipteran species were not negatively associated as they would be if the low overlap was caused by systematic niche separation. Low overlap over fruit items would be expected if the fly populations were kept at a low level by density-independent mortality; this might also explain the persistence of a diverse community.

Although the birds tended to spend most foraging time in the most profitable habitat, they had difficulty discriminating among slight differences in habitat profitability. All kites apparently sampled habitats to monitor profitability trends which changed over time, with peaks at 06.00-08.00 and 18.00-20.00, and a low at 12.00- 14.00. No spatial choices were detected relative to habitat-profitability changes, but kites did concentrate hunting efforts in the habitat with the highest prey density. Diet differences between adults and juveniles were associated with differences in handling times. Adults took significantly larger apple snails Pomacea doliodes than did juveniles and spent significantly less time handling these snails. The breeding pair took significantly larger snails back to the nest than they consumed.

The territory size that maximizes feeding rate or energetic gain varies with the rate of food renewal, smaller territories being better when renewal is fast and larger ones when it is slow.

Nor do results support the view that breeding ecology is determined through mechanisms of optimization of reproductive effort in a trade-off between clutch size and associated life history parameters. Rather they fit Ashmole's hypothesis on the significance of clutch size. A low amount and only a small surplus of food supply during the breeding season are sufficient to explain why the breeding ecology of Corsican tits is so different from that of continental ones.-from Author",94,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,62,NA,NA

The sex ratio was c1 for fish of similar age. Survivor density at 5 stages in the life cycle was related to egg density at the start of each year-class. Losses during successive life-stages were effectively zero for the egg-alevin stage (loss-rate ko), density dependent in the 1st spring (k1) and summer (k2) of the life cycle, and density independent within the 1st winter (k3), 2nd summer (k4) and 2nd winter plus post-migration period (k5). Density-dependent survival of young trout (k1,k2) was chiefly responsible for the stock-recruitment relationships for different life-stages; proportionate survival occurred between life-stages of older trout (k3, k4, k5). The 'key factor' for population regulation was spring losses (k1) soon after the young trout started to feed. A predictive equation for total loss-rate was K = k0 + k1 + k2 + k3 + k4 + k5 = 4.399 + 0.665k1. Neither water temperature nor rainfall significantly affected loss-rates except those for 1+ parr (k4) in summer droughts.

In years of higher than average mortality, the 'divorce' rates amongst the surviving pairs were also higher.

These characteristics are apparently generated by an over-compensating endogenous mechanism which damps colony counts to equilibrium. The equilibrium may be perturbed by an exogenous factor.

Mean arrival time was earlier following a mild winter, but was not related to local food supply, so that the mean length of courtship (pairing to egg-laying) was longer in a poor vole year (when laying was late) than in good times (when laying was early). Within years, migrants that arrived early tended to pair earlier, and lay earlier, than those that arrived late. Later pairing birds partly compensated for this by having shorter courtship than those that paired early. Males and females arrived over roughly the same period and there was no difference in mean arrival dates, but within pairs, the males arrived c4 days on average before their females. The sex ratio of winter residents was biased towards males, so more early arriving females than males were able to pair with residents on arrival. This resulted in a surplus of unpaired males that persisted until the end of the settling period when all breeding birds were paired. In the 2 years when they bred in substantial numbers, first-year birds arrived later than adults. In males, but not females, first-year birds resident over winter waited longer than adults before finding a mate.
