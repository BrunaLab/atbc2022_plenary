Over the 5 yr, the net aboveground productivity averaged 21.6 Mg·ha-1·yr-1 and was faster than most plantations and secondary forests in the area. Woodfall and associated nutrient fluxes never attained pre-storm values but by the fifth yr, mean daily total litterfall, and N, P, K, Ca, and Mg fluxes in litterfall were 83, 74, 62, 98, 75, and 81 percent of their pre-disturbance values, respectively. Aboveground nutrient pools of these nutrients ranged from 102 to 161 percent of their pre-disturbance values and were larger after 5 yr because of higher nutrient concentrations in the regeneration compared to the older wood that it replaced. The following sequence of ecosystem reorganization during this first 5 yr period is suggested. An initial period of foliage production and crown development occurred as hurricane survivors re-leafed and herbaceous vegetation and woody regeneration became established. During this period, 75 to 92 percent of the nutrient uptake was retained in the aboveground vegetation and there was a relatively low rate of aboveground carbon accumulation per mole of nutrient cycled. This initial period of canopy development was followed by a peak in aboveground productivity that occurred as early successional species entered the sapling and pole stages. This period was followed by the establishment of the litterfall nutrient cycle and an increase in the net productivity per mole of nutrient cycled. During this 5 yr period, the Bisley forest had some of the lowest within-stand nutrient-use-efficiencies and some of the highest levels of aboveground productivity ever observed in the LEF. The study demonstrates that high levels of productivity and rapid rates of aboveground reorganization can be achieved with rapid within-system cycling and inefficient within-stand nutrient use.",144,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,2,10.2307/2389086,Biomass | Hurricanes | Nutrient use | Puerto Rico | Recovery,NA,NA

The largest relative change in concentration occurred for K+, which increased from 0.7 to as high as 13 mg/L; concentrations were still 1.3 mg/L 5.5 yr after the hurricane. Most other solutes had returned to background levels within 1-2 yr of the hurricane. At the secondary study site, the lcacos catchment, NO3- concentrations peaked at 1.1 mg/L one yr after the hurricane and decreased to nearly zero 5.5 yr after the hurricane. At both sites, NO3- concentrations were higher in upslope wells than in those closer to the stream. Overall, riparian processes appear to reduce but not eliminate hydrologic looses of N following catastrophic disturbance.

One option for reducing net emissions is to lessen damage to residual forests during selective logging, thereby retaining additional carbon in biomass. A pilot carbon offset project was initiated in Sabah, Malaysia, in 1992 in which a power company provided funds to a timber concessionaire to implement guidelines aimed at reducing logging damage; in doing so, the utility gained potential credit towards future emissions reduction requirements To quantify the carbon retained due to this effort, we compared dipterocarp forests logged according to reduced-impact logging guidelines with forests logged by conventional methods in terms of the above- and below-ground biomass both before and after logging. Prior to logging, the forest stored approximately 400 Mg biomass ha-1, 17 percent of which was bdowground. High volumes of timber were removed from both of the logging areas (mean CNV = 154. RIL - 104 m'ha1) Forty-one percent of the unharvested trees <60 cm DBH were severely damaged (uprooted and crushed) from logging in conventional logging areas in contrast to 15 percent in reduced-impact logging areas. Approximately 18 and 12 percent, respectively, of the remaining residual trees in conventional and reduced-impact logging areas suffered less severe damage (e. g., crown or bark damage). Mortality rates of the less severely damaged trees in all DBH classes were higher during the first year in conventional logging areas than in reduced-impact logging areas. One yr post harvest, conventional and reduced-impact logging areas contained biomass equivalent to about 44 percent and 67 percent of pre-logging levels, respectively. Approximately 62 percent of the difference in carbon retention was due to fewer trees killed in the reduced-impact logging areas; the remaining 38 percent was due to a lower mass of branches, stumps and waste wood from felled trees in reduced-impact logging areas. Mortality of damaged trees in both areas may contribute to net decreases in biomass for several years after logging.

Our worked was undertaken on 725 termitaries among which we distinguished three groups: active, vertical (358); abandoned, vertical (220); and fallen abandoned (147). The rate of termitaries sheltering ant societies is higher for those which are abandoned (92.5% for fallen ones; 83.6% for vertical ones) than for those which are active (43.8%). We recorded 799 ant societies belonging to 37 genera and 151 species, of which 11 are undescribed. We found up to six ant colonies per termitary. These termitaries, which are frequent in the understory, thus proved to be good shelters for ant societies. Moreover, this represents one of the highest levesls of diversity of ants ever recorded, although these termitaries correspond to a limited area in comparison to that represented by the soil and leaf litter, rotten wood lying on the ground, or trees' trunks and canopy. These results imply that in the rain forest the scarcity of nesting sites is one of the principal factors limiting the populations of the ground-dwelling ants. The termitaries sampled also sheltered 103 incipient ant colonies (12.9% of the total number of societies) which belong principally to the Formicinae (71.7% of the societies of Formicinae recorded were incipient; 4.3% for the Ponerinae; 5.9% for the Myrmicinae and 0% for the Cerpachyinae and the Dolichoderinae).

The lottery model predicts a positive covariance between death rates and ohia recruitment when mean death rates are equal and koa has a higher growth rate than ohia.

From collections of hundreds of seeds from beneath three trees, we found the median number of eggs per seed to range from 4 to 8.5, even though many seeds (33%) had zero eggs.

Thus, the relatively high numbers of eggs per seed on guanacaste seeds could be an anachronism more appropriate for limited seed availability.

Most of the species were dominated by a single floral scent compound. Most of the compounds identified in this study have been previously reported in floral scents collected with head-space techniques from other plant families. However, several of the fatty acid derived esters of hexanol and cis-3-hexenol present in Lecythis persistens have been reported only in one or a few other plant families. No apparent correlations were found between amount and number of floral scent compounds produced on the one hand and pollinator reward, morphology, color, or size of flowers on the other hand The fatry acid derivatives found in Grias suggest that beetles may be the pollinators whereas the floral scent compounds of all other species studied are consistent with bee pollination. The floral scents of the nectar-producing species Eschuetleva coriacea and Couratari stellata contain, in contrast to the pollen-producing species, compounds that are highly attractive to male euglossine bees. This suggests that floral scent may play a role in directing male euglossine bees to those species of Lecythidaceae providing nectar as a pollinator reward.

These sites are prone to erosion and slow to become reforested. Stands of pioneer trees established in these heavily disturbed sites may provide environmental conditions that foster recruitment of persistent forest species. Results of a field experiment indicate that recruitment of pioneer trees in recently logged sites is limited more by site conditions than by availability of seeds. In lightly disturbed areas, where the canopy is open and soils are uncompleted, seed addition does not increase the density of pioneer tree seedlings; resprouting vegetation coven such gaps within 3 mo following logging. On landings and skid trails, pioneer seedling densities increase initially following seed addition but by 12 mo after seeding, densities of pioneer seedlings are similar to those on unseeded areas. High seedling mortality in seed addition plots on skid trails and landings indicate that conditions on these compacted and nutrient poor sites during the first year after logging are unfavorable for the persistence of pioneer seedlings. On log landings, seedlings recruit adjacent to debris and bark fragments more frequently than expected by chance. Eighty percent of artificial seeds sown on landings and skid trails were washed away by overland water flow after three storms. The scattering of bark fragments and other small debris over denuded sites may assist seed capture and increase seedling survival temporarily, but many seedlings die within a year. Improving harvesting practices to minimize the area scraped and compacted by heavy machinery will be more effective management than attempting to rehabilitate these areas following logging.

We examined the abundance, distribution, and habitat associations of four species of land snail (Caracolus caracolla, Nenia tridens, Gaeotis nigrolineata, Polydontes, acutangula) in the tabonuco forest at two sites (El Verde and Bisley) which were differentially damaged by the hurricane. Five years after the impact of Hurricane Hugo, significant differences between sites in density persisted for all snails except P. acutangula. Moreover, significant differences in habitat characteristics (central tendency and dispersion) were detected between El Verde and Bisley based on univariate and multivariate analyses of a suite of 31 abiotic and biotic variables. Despite these differences, the basis of habitat association for each snail did not differ between sites. The factors that affected microspatial differences in snail density within sites accounted for differences in density between sites.

These disturbances occur, respectively, at increasing spatial and temporal scales, and require increasing recovery time.

Petroleum is the primary pollutant of Caribbean mangal, and results in tree defoliation, stand death, and loss of associated sessile and mobile animal species. Hydrocarbons persist in mangrove sediments for decades, and are correlated with increasing seedling mutation rates. Chemical, industrial, and urban wastes are associated with increased heavy metal content of seedlings, stand die-back, reduced system-wide species richness, and higher incidence of Vibrio spp. (shellfish poisoning). Mangal has been reclaimed for urbanization, industrialization, and increasingly, for tourism. Overall, the region is losing mangrove forests at ≈1 percent per yr, although the rate is much faster on the Caribbean mainland (≈1.7% yr-1) than it is on the islands (≈0.2% yr-1). The region's fisheries are declining at a similar rate, as most commercial shellfish and finfish use mangal for nurseries and/or refugia. Few Caribbean states have legislation or enforcement capabilities to protect or manage mangal, although at least 11 international treaties and conventions could be applied to conserve or sustainably use these forests. These treaties may protect riverine and basin mangal, but are likely to be most with respect to fringing mangal, which may vanish as a consequence of global climate change.

To determine if these different hydrologic regimes altered distributions of populations, we compared shrimp densities during three periods: pre-Hurricane Hugo (20 mo), post-Hurricane Hugo (50 mo), and low-flow (12 mo). There were significant differences in the relationships between locations of stream pools along an elevational gradient (300 to 470 m) and the abundances of two species of shrimp (Atya lanipes and Xiphocaris elongata) during these three periods. Atya increased in density with increasing elevation in a consistent fashion during all three periods. Densities also increased during the post-Hugo and low-flow periods relative to the pre-Hugo baseline. Xiphocaris increased in density with increasing elevation during the pre- and post-Hugo periods, but density decreased with elevation during the low-flow period. Palaemonid species of predatory shrimp, Macrobrachium carcinus and Macrobrachium crenulatum, consistently decreased in density with elevation during all three periods of observation. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated high predictability of Atya density distributions based on volume, pool depth, and coefficient of variation of pool depth during the pre-Hugo baseline observations. Xiphocaris densities were positively associated with pool width and negatively associated with the coefficient of variation of pool width in the pre-Hugo period. However, physical variables did not predict Atya or Xiphocaris densities during the post-Hugo period. During the dry period, there was a negative association between Atya densities and pool depth and width, and a positive association with the coefficient of variation of pool depth. During the dry period, Xiphocaris densities were best predicted as a function of maximum depth; there was a negative association with the coefficient of variation of pool width. Pre-Hugo Macrobrachium densities were negatively associated with the coefficient of variation of pool width, pool width-to-depth ratio, and elevation: in the post-Hugo and dry periods, Macrobrachium densities were best predicted by elevation. Mechanisms that likely cause these patterns of distribution include avoidance of predators coupled with active preference by prey species for pool habitats with low frequency of washout by storm flows, and with sufficient storage of food resources (microbially conditioned leaf detritus).",58,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,64,10.2307/2389090,NA,NA,NA

We measured trees ≥ 4 cm diameter at breast height in a 40 × 50 m plot at each forest type. The natural forest had lower total tree height (8.8 vs. 10.2 m in 1984), and greater basal area (35.7 vs. 28.5 m2/ha in 1989) and tree density (1525 vs. 969 trees/ha in 1989) than the plantation. Rates of tree mortality and ingrowth to the ≥ 4 cm diameter class were higher in the plantation than in the natural forest. Both forest type exhibited the same rate of change in these structural parameters before and after Hurricane Hugo. However, Hurricane Hugo caused a greater reduction in the rate of change of tree density and basal area of the plantation than it did in the natural forest. After the hurricane, the plantation experienced a greater fluctuation in tree species composition and tree species abundance than did the natural forest. Tree ingrowth was lower than tree mortality in both stands. By 1994, all measured rates of change were at pre-hurricane levels. The species composition and structural changes required to make the plantation more productive in terms of stemwood biomass appear to make the plantation more vulnerable to hurricane wind effects and this in turn causes greater rates of change in species composition, tree mortality, and tree ingrowth during the initial phase following th disturbance.",20,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,66,10.2307/2389093,Disturbance | Hurricane Hugo | Mahogany | Secondary forest | Tree mortality | Tropical forests | Tropical tree plantations,NA,NA

Spatially heterogeneous removal of both substrate and vegetation is responsible for a variety of patterns of ecosystem development and plant successional trajectories within Caribbean landslides. Soil nutrient pools in exposed mineral soils reach levels comparable to mature forest soils within 55 yr but soil organic matter recovers more slowly. Plant colonization of landslides depends on the availability of propagules and suitable sites for germination, soil stability, and the presence of residual or newly deposited soil organic matter and associated nutrients. Once initial colonization occurs, the rate and trajectory of plant succession on landslides is strongly affected by plant/plant interactions. We present two conceptual models of landslide succession that summarize the mayor processes and pathways of ecosystem development and plant succession on landslides. Additional work is needed to characterize interactions between spatially heterogeneous zones, controls over soil development, impacts of key plant species, and the role of animals on Caribbean landslides.",122,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,67,10.2307/2389097,Disturbance | Landslides | Primary succession | Puerto Rico | Seed rain | Soil nutrients | Soil organic matter | Spatial heterogeneity | Tropics,NA,NA

Disturbance may be of three forms, density dependent, density independent and quasi-dependent. It is shown analytically that the quasi-dependent form is incapable of setting back the competitive process to avoid competitive exclusion, while either the density dependent form or the density independent form can. The basic theory is tested with data on changes in tree population densities since the landfall of Hurricane Joan in Nicaragua. It is found that this catastrophic event indeed did have the effect of reducing competitive dominance and thus preserving species diversity. Furthermore, the effect was density independent.",44,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,68,10.2307/2389100,"Disturbance | Diversity | Hurricane, Nicaragua | Rain forest",NA,NA
