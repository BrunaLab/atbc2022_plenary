Plants were cultivated under natural soil conditions. Rhizosphere samples were taken at regular intervals (every 7 days) during 35 days of the growth of the plant and the rhizosphere effect on the nitrogen transformer and nitrogen-fixing bacteria populations and on the urease activity was ascertained (N° of microorganisms or enzymatic activity of rhizosphere / N° of microorganisms or enzymatic activity of soil). The incidence of amonifying, nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria was determined by the Most Probably Number Method. The Standard Plate Count Method was used to estimate the nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Urease activity was determined by spectrophotometric analysis. The results obtained show that microflora population and urease activity were significatly greater ( p < 0.001 ) in the peanut rhizosphere and that plant age exerted a marked rhizosphere effect ( R/S ). The results demostrated that microbial populations were stimulated in the rhizosphere in the following order: symbiotic nitrogen-fixing > non symbiotic nitrogen-fixing > amonifying > denitrifying > nitrifying bacteria.

It aims at the identification of the main plankton taxa for a general description and comparison of the plankton communities of the gulf systems Golfo de Nicoya (GN) and Golfo Dulce (GD) and the analysis of biomass spectra at inshore and offshore stations at the end of the rainy season and during the dry season. Inshore plankton biomass was significantly higher in GN than GD and exceeded offshore biomass several times, while in the GD area the reverse was found. In the rainy season, inshore biomass spectra of GN and GD were discontinuous with biomass concentrations at small sizes (around 0.06mg) suggesting little developed communities, with highest production and energy use occurring in the small organisms. From the rainy to the dry season inshore species richness increased in both gulf systems and a shift was observed towards the larger size groups resulting in more continuous biomass spectra. In GN, bivalve larvae, foraminifers, ostracods. mysids and nauplii increase heavily in abundance and some gelatinous specimens occur. In GD, gelatinous Zooplankton appears in enormous abundance and dominate the community biomass, followed by large chaetognaths and ostracods. In GD, inshore plankton has neritic and oceanic elements and differs less from the offshore plankton, whereas in GN, inshore plankton is largely neritic. The high abundance of fish eggs and invertebrate larvae suggest that this area is an important spawning ground. While in the rainy season inshore biomass was about 15 times higher in GN compared to GD, this difference was reduced to 3-4 times in the dry season due to the appearance of the large predators mentioned above. The changes from the rainy to the dry season at the offshore stations of both gulf systems are less pronounced in terms of total biomass. shape of the biomass spectra and taxonomic composition of the community. The differences - relatively continuous biomass spectra with an increasing slope and a high total biomass in GD versus flat and shorter spectra due to the absence of large chaetognaths and medusa in the GN - suggest that conditions in the former area allow for a better development of a trophodinamically tightly structured plankton community.",28,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Biomass spectra | Costa Rica | Zooplankton,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,26,9393650,NA

The Crustacea collections were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively during the fourth leg (February 1994, dry season) in the three study areas Golfo Dulce (CD), Bahia Coronado in the Sierpe-Térraba-estuary (ST) and Golfo de Nicoya (ON). Qualitative data were available for comparison from the first leg in december 1993. A total of 24 beamtrawl and ten ottertrawl sample collections were done on an area of 860.000 m2 yielding a total of 119 species with a biomass of 37,8 kg (10275 specimens). Despite the smaller area covered by the beamtrawl, it collected a higher number of species and more biomass than the ottertrawl due to the smaller mesh size (0,8 cm). Judging from the shape of the species -per-area-curves, the crustacean fauna appeared as representatively sampled for the study area. As compared with the GN (biomass 0,36 g ± 0,26, SR = 97) and the ST (0,41 g ± 0,27, SR = 59) and according to the results of the log-series-plots constructed from the abundance data, the GD seems to be a depauperated area with significantly lower biomass (0,05 g ± 0,07) and species richness (45 sp.). No crustaceans were found in the center of the deep basin of the GD but parts of the interior gulf with adjacent mangrove areas seem to be important as nursery area for some commercially important penaeid shrimp species. The ST-estuary revealed the highest mean species number per station in the whole study area, but the GN had the highest total number of species. Biomass seems to be regularly distributed and not depth-depending within the GN, while species abundance varies clearly, confirming previous results. In contrast, abundance and biomass correlated well in the ST. Based on the results of the multivariate analysis, seven station groups of particular species assemblages can be distinguished in the study areas. Despite a high variability between stations in abundance and biomass, the following four areas of characteristic species assemblages can be identified which are also confirmed by an independent study on demersal fishes: ( 1 ) the interior part of the GN, characterized by juvenile shrimps (Sicyonia disdorsalis, Trachypenaeus fuscina), several patchily distributed anomurans, brachyurans and other predator species like portunids (especially Portunus asper) and pre-adult stomatopods (Squilla spp.); (2) the exterior part of the GN with high amounts of caridean (Pantomus affinis, Plesionika spp.) and penaeid shrimps (Sicyonia picra, Solenocera mutator), the highly abundant Iliacantha hancocki and some specimens of the stomatopod Hemisquilla stylifera and the deep water portunid Portunus iridescent; (3) a transition zone between 60 and 120 m water depth with a heterogeneous faunal composition, located in the ST and east of Isla Tortugas in the GN, and (4) the oxygen-depleted shelf edge area, dominated by the galatheid Pleuroncodes monodon. Mass occurrence of this species takes place off the GD and to a lesser extent off the ST-estuary, associated with high numbers of Solenocera spp. There seems to be a general trend of species groupings along abiotic gradients (depth, temperature, oxygen saturation) interrupted by small-scale variations in habitat type, current regime, food availability and other factors not identified in this study.

Eleven species of calanoids found normally in the Costa Rica Dome show the influence of typical oceanic waters principally at the mouth of Gulf of Nicoya. Differences were observed in the composition and presence of the copepod species when the inner and outer (upper and lower) parts of both gulfs were compared. Gulf of Nicoya was dominated in its upper part by typical neritic estuarine species like Acartia lilljenborgii, Paracalanus parvus and, Hemyciclops thalassius as well as species of Pseudodiaptomus. On the other hand a more oceanic composition of copepods was observed in the lower part of the gulf. Both small species, like Oncaea venusta, as well as larger species, such as Pleuromamma robusta, Eucalanus attenuatus, E. elongatus and Rhincalanus nasutus, were typical of these waters, Oithona plumifera and O. similis were found in the lower part too; and both species are typical from oceanic water.

Despite the lower number of samples taken, more species were collected by the otter trawl (189 compared to 160), due to a wider area swept. As revealed by the speciesarea curve and a lognormal - curve constructed from the pooled (log) abundance data, the fish assemblage appeared as well sampled and a theoretical species richness (SR) of - 306 was estimated for the whole area. Mean species number per collection and mean biomass per area were much lower in the GD - area (9.3 species, 0.36g /m2) compared to ∼the ST (15.4, 0.81g /m2-) and GN (17.3, 0.74 g/m2 ) areas, indicating a depauperate fish assemblage in the former. Lowest species numbers and biomass were found in the central deep part of GD with increasing values towards the sill area at the opening of the gulf and towards the shallow stations above the thermocline. Average biomass was an order of magnitude higher in the interior part of GN compared to the other areas with values up to 18.1 g/m2 Based on results of a multivariate analysis of the collections, the GN area can be divided into (1) an interior shallow area above the thermocline (<50 m) characterized by scianids, sea catfishes, stingrays, flatfishes, sea robins. (2) an outer part (>100 m) characterized by cods, scorpionfishes, gobies, cutlassfishes, serranids, anglerfishes and flatfishes and (3) a transition zone of the central and lateral parts with a mixed species assemblage with carangids, pufferfish, snappers, several flatfish species and the lizardfish as common elements. Characteristic for the deep basin of GD were small species of the genera Cynoscion and Porichthys. These occurred in low densities, suggesting a reduced carrying capacity of this deep basin for fish biomass in terms of food and oxygen. Species occurring at the shallow stations of GD are also found at a similar depth in the other areas, but many species are missing, namely ariids and many scianids found in the GN area. The species assemblage of the ST area resembles that of GN. Ariids, however, are missing here too. Biotic station parameters like species richness, biomass, abundance and production were not significantly correlated with abiotic parameters (temperature, oxygen, nutrients) suggesting that other habitat factors not evaluated in this study like habitat heterogeneity, distance to the open ocean, current regime and food availability probably are important factors for the structure of the fish assemblage.",18,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Biomass | Costa Rica | Fish assemblage | Fish diversity | Multivariate analysis,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,34,9393654,NA

Oxygen was found to ca. 100 m water depth, but only the upper part of the oxycline was associated with the pycnocline, which was situated above the sill located at 60 m. Nitrate-rich water entered the bay at sill depth, and denitrification was indicated at anoxic depths. Hydrogen sulfide was only found in low concentrations near the bottom, and nitrate was a possible oxidant for the hydrogen sulfide. The observations reproduced those of a survey in 1969 to a large extent. This suggests that water exchange is frequent enough to prevent the development of strongly reducing conditions in the bottom water. High rates of dark oxygen uptake indicated intense carbon cycling within the euphoric zone. The rates decreased rapidly with depth, and at anoxic depths, rates of denitrification and sulfate reduction were more than 100-fold lower than the surface oxygen uptake. The chemical zonation as well as x-radiographs indicated that sediments underlying oxic bottom water were strongly irrigated and bioturbated while anoxic sediments were laminated and composed of turbidites. The rates of carbon oxidation were 5-10 times higher in the sediments underlying oxic bottom water than in those at the bottom of the basin. Sulfate reduction was a dominating process, accounting for about 50% and 100% of the carbon oxidation at the oxic and anoxic sites respectively.

In order to evaluate biomass and energy flow distributions, productivity potential, and to obtain guidelines for conservation management, a steady - state model of 20 compartments (excluding detritus) was constructed using the ECOPATH II software. Total system biomass (10.4 t/km2) and total energy throughput (sum of all flows, T =1405 t/km2/year) of Golfo Dulce are small compared to other modeled coastal ecosystems. The mayor part of the energy throughput is achieved from primarily pelagic trophic levels 1 to II (52%) plus II to III (41%). The pelagic fish biomass consumed within the system by top predators (about 1133t) exceeds twice the demersal fish biomass consumed (502t). Artesanal fishery primarily operates on the top trophic levels of the benthic domain and has a very low gross efficiency (catch/ primary production = 0.06%). A nearly balanced production/repiration ratio (P/R= 1.09) and a high mean tranfer efficiency (15%) suggest that the system is near maturity. Contradictory seem the low Ascendency (A= 32.2%) and high Development Capacity (DC = 67.8%) values indicative of a relatively undeveloped system of little internal stability. This contradiction might be explained through the fact that much of the detrital matter produced within the euphotic zone is sedimented away and does not - like in other coastal systems - reenter the food web. Thus, whereas the pelagial represents a tightly coupled rather mature (sub) system, the Golfo Dulce as a whole lacks this degree of maturity due to a very inefficient benthic pelagic coupling, which results from its fjord-like topography. The model reveals that Golfo Dulce acts differently from most tropical coastal ecosystems: it is dominated by biomass and energy flow within the pelagic domain and rather resembles an open ocean system than an estuarine one. Due to its low benthic biomass and low overall productivity, there seems to be no potential for further development of the demersal/semi-demersal fishery inside the gulf. An increase of the pelagic fishing pressure would seriously threaten the populations of resident predators such as dolphins, sharks and large bird species, which have considerable conservation and ecotourism values. Future ecosystem research in Golfo Dulce should focus on the pelagic part of the gulf (microbial loop, plankton, and nekton), on the small benthos, as well as on transfer processes within the pelagic domain, between the pelagial and the benthos, and at the river/gulf and gulf/ocean interfaces.",47,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Biomass budget | Costa Rica | Ecosystem structure | Energy flow | Tropical estuary,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,61,NA,NA
