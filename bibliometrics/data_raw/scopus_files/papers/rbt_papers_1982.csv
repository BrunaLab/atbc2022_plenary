The frequencies of the various stages in foregut, midgut and hindgut of the triatomines are provided; parasites were rare in the foregut and metatrypomastigotes were seen only in the mid- and hindguts. All adult bugs examined harboured intestinal infections of T. cruzi-like flagellates, large clumps of amastigotes were frequently observed in the midgut. The faeces of C. pilosa, containing metacyclic trypomastigotes, did not produce patent parasitaemia when inoculated into mice. Inoculated mice were not protected against subsequent challenge infections with the highly virulent Tulahuen stock of T. c. cruzi. The blood of bats also failed to produce parasitaemia when inoculated into mice, nor were the mice protected against subsequent challenges with T. c. cruzi. Although the developmental stages described were very similar to those of T. c. cruzi it is presumed that they were stages of T. c. marinkellei because of their failure to infect mice and Rhodnius prolixus, and their failure to protect inoculated mice against challenge with T. c. cruzi.",20,6820697,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,1

T. infestans and R. prolixus remained close to the host after feeding, while T. dimidiata wandered a short distance away, apparently for protection against preying by the host. R. prolixus showed the lightest values of ingestion in relation to its own weight. The amount of blood ingested by the three species was not related to the type of host. The percentage of insects that fed during the short and long periods of exposure, and the amount of blood ingested were similar in both experiments. The vertebrate hosts showed no prey preference for any of the three species. All the triatomines exhibited a marked preference for the homeothermic hosts, only a very small percentage (0.7%) of T. dimidiata, the least aggressive of the three species, fed on the toad; the insects that fed on two or more hosts did not exceed 8.1% T. infestans showed a slight preference for dogs. During nocturnal experiments all three species preferred to feed on hosts that slept at this time.",13,6763728,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,2

Initial symptoms were similar to those of bothropic envenomation: intense pain, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and excitability, but differing in the magnitude of a tremendous edema and in the absence of intensive bleeding and phlyctenae. We found important alterations in arterial blood pressure and in the activity and concentration of coagulation factors. All patients showed infections, and necrosis was found in at least three of them.",27,7156428,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,3

The amino acid composition differs slightly: L-amino acid oxidase-1 (thn most anodal) shows more aspartic and glutamic acid residues than L-amino acid oxidase-2b, which was found to be richer in lysine and alanine residues. Both isozymes had subunits of 60,000 and 57,000 molecular weight, as shown by electrophoresis on SDS polyacrylamide gel. Results of peptide mapping studies are consistent with a high degree of homology between the compared isozymes, and the number of peptides obtained indicated homologous subunits.",1,7156430,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,4

Three forms of this enzyme were obtained from the crude venom using only two steps: heating in the presence of L-leucine and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. The isozymes were numbered 1, 2a and 2b on the basis of electrophoretic mobility towards the anode. Isozymes 1 and 2b were homogeneous by acrylamide gel electrophoresis and sedimentation velocity.
