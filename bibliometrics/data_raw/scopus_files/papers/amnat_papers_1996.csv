Such biogenic disturbance can influence recruitment success if settling larvae and juveniles avoid disturbed sites or if juveniles die as a result of disturbance after settling. Because infauna commonly lose exposed body parts to browsing predators and disturb less sediment as a result, we developed a simulation model to examine the interactions between browsing predation, infaunal adult activity, and recruitment. Sediment disturbance in the model was based on data for the polychaete Abarenicola pacifica. We simulated the activity of two general types of predators: prey nippers, which damaged adults only, and sediment biters, which damaged adults and consumed settled juveniles. As both types of predation rates increased, habitat rejection by settlers decreased, but juvenile mortality increased as settlers landing near damaged adults were killed when those adults resumed activity. When prey nippers were active, the interaction between predation and infaunal activity determined recruitment success, and juvenile mortality was highest at intermediate predation rates. When sediment biters were active, they controlled recruitment success by directly consuming larvae. At low adult worm densities, habitat rejection by settlers and juvenile mortality were both low, and browsing predation did not affect recruitment success. At higher adult densities, net recruitment success increased with the rate of predation by prey nippers (the magnitude of increase depended on bite rate and the length of time juveniles were susceptible to mortality), but it was never enhanced by sediment biters.",23,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,2,all,All Open Access

Under such circumstances, group foraging success might be enhanced if individual workers reduce their cutting time, thereby taking smaller fragments individually but allowing a greater number of their nest mates to obtain fragments per unit time. I model a foraging situation of this kind as a service process. One model considers the maximum possible output from a system of servers, and a second model takes account of queuing time and 'traffic intensity' resulting from dense social foraging. Quantitative predictions of the models are compared with fragment masses taken during natural foraging by Atta colombica ants on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Natural fragment masses are nearly always too small to maximize individual worker foraging rates or energetic efficiency, but reasonably close to the sizes that maximize whole-colony foraging rate. The models also predict the mean and distribution of cutting times, the queuing time (which might be measured as latency from arrival at a resource site to initiation of a cut), and the ratio of actively cutting workers to queuing workers at equilibrium. The variety of quantitative predictions would allow extensive empirical testing of the model.

I developed a model to examine the impact of directly transmitted macroparasites on the competition and population dynamics of two sympatric host species. Several important features of macroparasite-mediated competition are considered in the model: the two host species compete in a classical Lotka-Volterra manner, the parasite influences the survivorship and reproduction of both hosts, and parasites exhibit aggregated distribution among host populations. The conditions for host coexistence were derived explicitly. The results suggest that host intrinsic growth rate, host carrying capacity, susceptibility, parasite pathogenicity, and the magnitude of parasite aggregation are important components influencing host coexistence. Parasites may enhance or disrupt host coexistence, depending on the relationships of these parameter values. If the individuals of the inferior species are less susceptible to infection than the individuals of superior species and/or exhibit less pathology, the inferior competitor will bear a competitive advantage, resulting in either stable coexistence or competitive exclusion. In contrast, parasites may cause more rapid extinction of the inferior species if the inferior species is more susceptible to and/or less tolerant of parasite infection. When two host species are equally susceptible to infection and parasites are equally pathogenic, parasites may still have significant consequences on the competitive outcome. Sensitivity analysis suggests that an increased degree of parasite aggregation among hosts reduces the ability of parasites to regulate host populations and decreases parasite equilibrium density.

Many other constraints can reduce the mean niche breadth of species. This article discusses one of these limitations-that species with broader niche breadths can have a slower rate of evolutionary response. Species with narrower niche breadths have higher probabilities of fixing beneficial alleles, taking less time to do so; they have fewer deleterious alleles drifting to fixation (a lighter drift load) and a lower frequency of deleterious alleles at mutation- selection equilibrium (a lighter mutation load). These patterns are true even with no correlation at all between fitness in different environments; no trade-offs are assumed. Furthermore, niche breadth is likely to evolve to be more narrow, because of the association between location and alleles favored in local habitats for individuals with reduced migration, assortative mating, or habitat selection.

A crucial determinant of community structure is the relative searching efficiencies of specialists and generalists and the nature of the density- dependent reduction in parasitoid searching efficiency. In some areas of parameter space, there is no dynamically stable end point, and complex cycles occur where the food web structure is constantly changing, species being added through invasion and lost through direct and indirect competitive interactions.

The trade-off concept has played an especially prominent role in discussions of the evolution of host specialization in phytophagous insects. The evidence for genetically based trade-offs in phytophagous insect populations is ambiguous, however. Cross- host genetic correlations for fitness traits are seldom negative, but this does not preclude the existence of trade-offs at a subset of loci controlling the fitness variation. One clear result is that cross-host genetic correlations for fitness traits are often less than one, which implies that genotypes have different fitness rankings on different hosts (i.e., that reaction norms for fitness cross). Using verbal arguments and a mathematical model, I show that crossing of reaction norms for fitness is a sufficient condition for selection to favor specialized host choice, in the absence of search costs and other disadvantages of specialization. In other words, selection will favor specialization if alleles that are positively selected on one host are less strongly positively selected, or neutral, on other hosts; it is not necessary for the alleles to be deleterious on the other hosts. Search costs and other factors may oppose the evolution of specialization, but introducing trade-offs into a model does not result in a quantum jump in the strength of selection favoring specialization, and thus in the likelihood of specialization evolving, compared to the situation in which alleles that affect fitness on one host are neutral on others. There is therefore no justification for focusing on the qualitative presence or absence of trade-offs as the critical issue in predicting or explaining the evolution of specialization. Furthermore, the quantitative genetic data, rather than give little information on why specialization evolves, indicate that the potential for selection to favor specialization exists in many phytophagous populations.",290,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,18,NA,NA

However, in searching for present-day evidence for the maintenance of the long neck, we find that during the dry season (when feeding competition should be most intense) giraffe generally feed from low shrubs, not tall trees; females spend over 50% of their time feeding with their necks horizontal; both sexes feed faster and most often with their necks bent; and other sympatric browsers show little foraging height partitioning. Each result suggests that long necks did not evolve specifically for feeding at higher levels. Isometric scaling of neck-to-leg ratios from the okapi Okapia johnstoni indicates that giraffe neck length has increased proportionately more than leg length-an unexpected and physiologically costly method of gaining height. We thus find little critical support for the Darwinian feeding competition idea. We suggest a novel alternative: increased neck length has a sexually selected origin. Males fight for dominance and access to females in a unique way: by clubbing opponents with well-armored heads on long necks. Injury and death during intrasexual combat is not uncommon, and larger-necked males are dominant and gain the greatest access to estrous females. Males' necks and skulls are not only larger and more armored than those of females' (which do not fight), but they also continue growing with age. Larger males also exhibit positive allometry, a prediction of sexually selected characters, investing relatively more in massive necks than smaller males. Despite being larger, males also incur higher predation costs than females.

All females have an intrinsic preference for males with a certain trait. If they have the copying allele, they modify this preference on the basis of observations of an older cohort's mating patterns. Our specific model suggests a general rule: copying alleles spread when copying causes females to mate males that have higher total lifetime fitness. It is therefore possible for copying to evolve both when females have preexisting preferences for high-viability males (good genes) and when females are copying a preference for a trait that impairs male survival. Copying can spread through the force of indirect selection even when there is mild direct selection against the copying allele.",48,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,20,NA,NA

Rarely, however, have key innovations been defined mechanistically; typically, a key innovation is described broadly as a complex suite of traits (e.g., the ability to feed on angiosperm plants). Identifying the molecular genetic basis for individual traits that collectively characterize such key innovations can be useful in determining whether all species within a lineage share a particular key innovation or whether convergent innovations have evolved independently. Within the genus Papilio, the ability to feed on a furanocoumarin-containing plant has been identified as a key innovation; over 75% of the species in the genus are associated to some degree with plants containing furanocoumarins. In this group, furanocoumarin metabolism is effected by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, heme-bound proteins known in many organisms to play a role in xenobiotic detoxification. Although furanocoumarin-metabolizing P450s in two species of Papilio do not share high levels of identity overall, conserved elements can be found; in particular, levels of amino acid identity in a putative substrate recognition site are very high. This conservation of amino acid identity contrasts sharply with reportedly high levels of diversification in substrate recognition sites observed in comparisons of proteins within species or between species that do not share a narrow range of host plants. Specialization on a particular group of host plants and subsequent diversification on those hosts may necessitate conservation of function in these regions, which may thus be considered key innovations in a lineage.",79,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,21,NA,NA

We estimated the strength of natural selection on host use within and among these patch types. We also repeatedly measured spatial variation of oviposition preference, a heritable univariate trait. The causes of this variation were different at three scales. First, a genetic difference in preference between insects in an adjacent clearing and outcrop (200 m apart) was due principally to nonrandom gene flow. Insects actively assorted themselves between the patches according to their preference genotypes. Second, preferences in outcrop patches 1-4 km apart were significantly associated with their degree of isolation from clearings. Emigration from clearings had diluted local adaptation in outcrops. Finally, differences in preference between disturbed and undisturbed metapopulations 8.5 km apart were due to differences between them in natural selection. Within the disturbed metapopulation, the preference difference between a clearing and an adjacent outcrop remained constant over time even while massive temporal changes in mean preference occurred across both patches in response to fluctuating natural selection on host use.

I collected data on body mass, brain mass, metabolic rate, and fetal and postnatal litter growth rates for 21 lemur and 13 loris species to examine the relationship between maternal investment and the other variables after controlling for allometric and phylogenetic effects. I found that evolutionary changes in fetal growth rates, relative litter mass, and postnatal growth rates were associated with evolutionary changes in maternal mass but that neither brain size nor metabolic rate were independently correlated with variables reflecting maternal investment. Evolutionary changes in all three variables reflecting maternal investment were positively correlated with one another, however, indicating that they are coadapted, only broadly constrained by body size, and unconstrained by brain size and metabolic rate. Lemurs and lorises were found to have similar postnatal litter growth rates, which reflect the bulk of maternal reproductive investment, indicating that the energetic costs of reproduction did not figure prominently in the evolution of female dominance.

Despite a recent surge of interest in the phenomenon, especially in phylogenetic histories of radiations, we know too little about the ecology of most radiations to assess the roles of the three processes. I summarize our own efforts to test the theory with a radiation of three- spined sticklebacks apparently still in its early stages. The role of divergent selection is supported by a strong relationship among populations and species in mean morphology, feeding performance, habitat use, and growth rate. Trade-offs in feeding performance and growth rate between habitats are steep. Ecological character displacement is indicated by the large differences between sympatric species and the intermediate features of solitary species inhabiting lakes of similar size. A pond experiment showed that natural selection on a solitary species is altered following introduction of a competitor and favors divergence. Evidence for ecological speciation in sticklebacks is weakest, but there are several hints of its importance: speciation was rapid and accompanied by divergence into different ecological niches: selection against hybrids is stronger in the wild than in the laboratory, which suggests that hybrid fitness depends on ecological context; premating isolation depends in part on traits that diverged in association with the exploitation of different resources; and reproductive isolation may have evolved in parallel in different populations experiencing similar environmental conditions.

Multivariate analysis would allow separation of direct adaptive plasticity from what we term indirect adaptive plasticity. Predator-prey inducible defense systems, such as the interaction between larval Chaoborus americanus (an aquatic dipteran ambush predator) and Daphnia pulex (a freshwater crustacean), provide excellent opportunities to evaluate the adaptiveness of plasticity. This study was conducted to separate direct from indirect adaptive induced change in Daphnia for morphological characters with respect to the agent that causes the induced change: the presence of Chaoborus.

When resources are nutritionally substitutable and spatially mixed, our model predicts that only trade-offs in encounter efficiency can promote coexistence. For spatially separate substitutable resources, any trade-off in encounter, conversion, or handling efficiency allows coexistence. For essential resources, whether mixed or separate, only trade-offs in conversion efficiency can promote coexistence.

We randomized communities by two different methods and found that the observed number of favored states, though greater than that expected, is not in an extreme tail of the simulated distribution, so that one would not have rejected a hypothesis that species join local communities independently. The suggested result, contradicted by our findings, is probably an artifact of the fact that the previous assembly rule treated all species as equally likely to be found on all sites. Further, we found that the excess of the observed number of favored states over that expected by our two methods can probably be explained by the fact that the few widespread species are not treated realistically.

This requires us to distinguish between search images that depend only on the forager's encounter with specific food types (passive) and search images that involve the forager's choice of a specific search mode (active). Both active and passive search images predict that the forager will appear to use a resource patch containing both food types less thoroughly than patches containing just one of the food types. The giving-up densities on the two foods in a mixed patch will be higher than a weighted average of the giving-up densities on the two foods in single-food patches. We tested this prediction on free-living fox squirrels using triplets of feeding patches containing sunflower seeds, granulated peanuts, and a mixture of both, respectively.

A butterfly (Euphydryas editha) metapopulation that was naturally restricted to rocky outcrops in an area of coniferous forest suffered two major perturbations in 30 yr. First, humans clear-cut patches of forest in about 1967. The butterfly colonized the clear-cuts, in which it began to oviposit on a novel host plant, Collinsia torreyi. Breeding success was high, and the clear-cut habitat supported a population source; in the mid-1980s, there was net movement of adults from clear-cut to outcrop, and butterfly densities were elevated on outcrops close to population sources. The second major perturbation came in 1992, when a severe summer frost killed C. torreyi plants (outcrop hosts were not damaged). As a result, E. editha larvae starved in clear-cuts, and the source populations became extinct. This occurrence allowed us to test several predictions of source-sink theory. As predicted, densities declined on outcrops, and particularly on those close to former sources; by 1993, densities on outcrops were no longer correlated with isolation from former sources. True population sinks are predicted to become extinct in the absence of immigration, but this prediction was not observed. Outcrops were not true sinks because E. editha occupied this habitat before the creation of sources, survived the frost on outcrops, and persisted on outcrops in areas where they were isolated from sources. Outcrops were pseudosinks; breeding success was poor at immigration-enhanced densities, but outcrop populations did not rely on immigration to persist.

A sustainable ecosystem is one that, over the normal cycle of disturbance events, maintains its characteristic diversity of major functional groups, productivity, and rates of biogeochemical cycling. These traits are determined by a set of four 'interactive controls' (climate, soil resource supply, major functional groups of organisms, and disturbance regime) that both govern and respond to ecosystem processes. Ecosystems cannot be sustained unless the interactive controls oscillate within stable bounds. This occurs when negative feedbacks constrain changes in these controls. For example, negative feedbacks associated with food availability and predation often constrain changes in the population size of a species. Linkages among ecosystems in a landscape can contribute to sustainability by creating or extending the feedback network beyond a single patch. The sustainability of managed systems can be increased by maintaining interactive controls so that they form negative feedbacks within ecosystems and by using laws and regulations to create negative feedbacks between ecosystems and human activities, such as between ocean ecosystems and marine fisheries. Degraded ecosystems can be restored through practices that enhance positive feedbacks to bring the ecosystem to a state where the interactive controls are commensurate with desired ecosystem characteristics.

Relative perianth size appears to be evolutionarily labile, even within genera. Patterns of perianth-size dimorphism differed between temperate and tropical species and between animal- and wind-pollinated species. Perianth size was strongly associated with the size of the reproductive structures enclosed in each flower, suggesting that the function of petals and sepals to protect developing reproductive structures may determine their size.

Considered as an evolutionary game, this conflict is complicated by two factors: before deciding to enforce their preferred brood size by eliminating unwanted brood mates, offspring must take into account the readjustments in parental investment that will normally ensue from brood reduction. Likewise, optimal parental investment will depend on offspring reaction to it. In particular, it is shown that the cost that parents must pay to provide enough resources to prevent siblicide will often be smaller than the benefit they obtain from maintaining their preferred brood size.

Growth of imaginal tissues thus occurs in a closed system at the expense of nutrients accumulated during larval life. In a closed system, growing imaginal tissues compete for available nutrients, and the growth trajectory and final size of one tissue (or disk) are influenced by the growth of others. We use the Gompertz growth equation and a model of growth in a closed system in which imaginal disks compete for nutrients to model the growth of imaginal disks and the resulting allometric relations among them. By incorporating known features of ant caste development, such as reprogramming of the critical size for metamorphosis in major workers (soldiers) and reprogramming of developmental parameters in individuals larger than a critical size, we show that the nonlinear and discontinuous allometries of ants with polymorphic castes result from normal developmental processes during the metamorphosis of holometabolous insects.

This structure is determined by spatial heterogeneity, dispersal, and colonization behavior. In mating groups lasting one generation where mating precedes female dispersal, female-biased sex ratios will be favored by 'local mute competition,' especially when the number of foundresses is small. When groups last several generations before dispersal takes place ('haystack' structure), relatedness among population members develops, and this can favor an extra female bias. However, when groups are permanent, with some dispersal in each generation ('island' structure), relatedness builds up without an effect on sex ratio bias because most competition takes place within groups. Current models of evolution under a haystack structure generally assume unlimited growth for a fixed number of generations (and hence no local density dependence), absence of substructure, and sex ratios that are inflexible over generations. These model limitations warrant scrutiny. Using extended versions of the haystack model, we show that, although local density dependence in the haystack population diminishes the sex ratio bias, strongly female-biased sex ratios are still possible if foundress numbers are low. It is also shown that substructure in the haystack by subdivision into one- generation mating groups promotes the female bias. Finally, it is shown that the ES sex ratio can change radically with generations within haystacks. When population growth is density dependent, the sex ratio of the last generation should he more female biased than in the preceding generations. In the case of haystacks subdivided into local mating groups, the sex ratio in the first generation should be less female biased than in the following generations. It is argued that a haystack structure is frequently found among small arthropods with a colonizing lifestyle and that subdivision into one- generation mating groups may occur, for example, among plant-inhabiting mites. To illustrate these points, predatory mites of the family Phytoseiidae are considered in more detail. Some species are found to exhibit a stronger female bias in their sex ratios than expected from local mating competition alone. This extra bias may well stem from selection in a haystack or subdivided haystack structure. Other phytoseiid species have a lifestyle that leads to more permanent subpopulations that have an island-like structure.

One hypothesis for such sexual indistinguishability is that the members of one sex benefit from resembling those of the other sex. Here we focus on the adaptive significance for males of resembling females. We suggest that female mimicry may directly enhance the competitive ability of a male. This is because males that conceal their sexual status may hide important information to their opponent (i.e., that they are males and represent a threat). We use game theory to present this hypothesis. The hypothesis is supported in an experiment with pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca), a species that previously has been shown to have difficulties in discriminating between female-like males and females. In aviary trials involving contests between black males and female-like males over a nest site, we show that female-like males were the first of the competitors to initiate attacks and were also the winner of the contest in nearly all cases. The same result was found when we used two female-like males of which one was painted black. Apparently, female-like males gain an advantage because they are in control of when to initiate a fight because of the opponent's poor sex recognition ability. We discuss our hypothesis in relation to delayed plumage maturation theory and the evolution of sexual indistinguishability. We suggest that concealment of sex in competitive interactions may be especially relevant to animals in which males provide resources that are attractive to females, such as a territory or a nuptial gift. In such cases, resource-holding males may benefit from signaling their true sex in order to attract females, whereas male intruders may benefit from concealing their sex. Concealment of sex would be easy to achieve in species in which sexual signaling is canalized through nonpermanent signals. However, female mimicry may also be evolutionarily stable in animals in which a high proportion of resource-holding males possess permanent sexual signals but intruders mimic the sexual signals of females-that is, if social status is relatively highly predictable.

Independent contrasts that control for the effects of allometry and phylogeny produce results consistent with the sexual selection hypothesis; a strong relationship exists between sexual dimorphism in size and the intensity of male mating competition among polygynously mating primates. Increased sexual dimorphism in large primates may not be an inevitable consequence of allometry but instead may result from a reduction in the temporal availability of fertile females due to long birth intervals.",224,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,55,NA,NA

We controlled statistically for effects of body size and phylogeny and compared songbirds (Passeriformes) of Europe to those of North America and found that nest predation was lower in Europe. Associated with this decrease in early mortality in Europe, fecundity was increased and iteroparity was reduced via decreased adult survival rates, as predicted by theory. Moreover, continental differences were greater for species that were more vulnerable to nest predation (open-nesting species) than for species that used safer nest sites (hole-nesting species).

Since male size and development time are interdependent, several hypotheses can be advanced to explain the observed correlations. Either large size is especially important in polyandrous species, or early emergence is of lesser importance. So far, models of protandry have neglected the trade-off between large size and early emergence. In this article, I present models that account for this trade-off and the interaction with polyandry. In polyandrous species, females use male-derived nutrients to enhance realized fecundity. Since large males produce large ejaculates, there will be a selection pressure for large male size, counterbalancing the selection for early emergence.

We show that some of their observations can be accommodated by a quantitative model that invokes known or plausible assumptions about host defenses and the interactions of bacteria with phage and antibiotics; some observations remain unexplained by the model.

In this model, predator and resource densities are ""buffered"" against variation in productivity, but the densities of species at the intermediate trophic level are not. Given a large ""pool"" of potential such species, the model predicts a replacement series involving multiple pairs of species ranging from good resource exploiters to predator-resistant forms as productivity increases or predator death rates decrease. In such a case, coexistence is most likely among the more similar forms, but abundances of similar species are predicted to be negatively correlated. Furthermore, the overall density of organisms at all trophic levels is correlated with variation in productivity. Spatiotemporal heterogeneity modifies these predictions by allowing more than two species to coexist in the presence of a single resource and a single predator and by permitting positive covariation in the abundances of coexisting competitors as well. These models show the critical role of species compositional turnover in determining food web responses to bottom-up and top-down regulation by productivity and variation in predator death rates.

Surgical manipulations of gastrovascular architecture were used to alter flow patterns within developing runner and sheet colonies, and subsequent morphological development of colonies was assessed. Reducing within-colony variation in patterns of gastro-vascular flow of runner colonies resulted in a lower rate of production of peripheral stolons and a sheet-type morphology. Experimentally increased variation in flow patterns within sheet colonies resulted in the development of peripheral stolons - hence, the initiation of a runnerlike growth trajectory. In both experiments, control colonies, in which stolonal architecture was not manipulated, maintained the runner or sheet morphology characteristic of their respective clones. The results imply that for this clonal species, morphological differences between geno-types can be controlled by changing gene expression in response to the local physiological conditions.",36,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,79,all,All Open Access

The model assumes fires are necessary for recruitment, and they may cause mortality, depending on species. Reproductive success is estimated as an integral equation (analogous to Lotka's equation for R0) taking into account fecundity schedules, mortality schedules, and age-specific disturbance effects. Life histories are parameterized for the three dominant fire-dependent tree taxa in the region, Pinus resinosa, Betula papyrifera, and Populus. Long-term disturbance regimes are summarized as density functions of intervals between fires parameterized from fire scars on trees and in sediment charcoal records. Changes in the density of fire intervals in the past are the basis for predictions that different taxa would dominate, depending on their life histories. Fossil pollen data indicate changing abundances of tree taxa and are used to test predictions of the model of reproductive success. Comparisons of model predictions with changing abundances of pollen indicate that the density of fire regimes is one of the important controls on composition. Pinus resinosa is limited by the high frequency of fire, but longevity is an advantage in the region for this species; Betula is limited by frequent fire, and longevity is of little advantage; and Populus is least sensitive to fire regime. Results show that knowing simply the frequency of fire can lead to naive interpretations of fire effects (or lack thereof)- The higher moments of disturbance densities can be critical for understanding responses of species that require extended intervals to achieve resistance to fire. These extended intervals may be rare, in which case they are better described by the higher moments of the density than they are by the mean interval. © 1996 by The University of Chicago.

The assumption that metapopulations occur at a steady state, common to many models, may be frequently violated because of the high rate of habitat loss and fragmentation in many landscapes.

That assumption is supported by the analysis of several population genetic models of the founder-flush demographic process. The basic ideas are that a newly founded population represents a random sample from the parent population and that, during the period of rapid growth, genetic drift is much weaker than would be expected, particularly for low-frequency alleles. As a consequence, the probability of a loss of a neutral lineage present in a single copy is quite low, and the probability of a fixation of advantageous alleles, including alleles with additive, recessive, and epistatic effects, is much higher than in populations that remain of constant size. Furthermore, the probability of a peak shift during the founding event is reasonably high provided that the second peak is substantially higher than the peak occupied by the parent population. Thus, there is no reason to dismiss founder-flush models of speciation because of their intrinsic implausibility or inconsistency with standard population genetics theory. The same kind of analysis suggests a test of whether a population has had a history consistent with a founder-flush model. Sampling during the founding event would lead to a strong negative disequilibrium between low-frequency nucleotides, and, if the sites are closely enough linked, then that disequilibrium would be preserved during the period of growth.

A key prediction is the expected demographic trade-off between clutch size and the opportunity to breed: the proportion of individuals in a population that breed annually should be negatively related to clutch size.

A substantial fraction of small starting populations become extinct within a short time. Those that survive the initial period typically survive for a long time. This skew in extinction times makes the expected time to extinction a misleading indicator. Probabilities of extinction are sensitive to environmental variation in the net reproductive rate and the shape of the distribution of disturbances, not just its mean. Probabilities of extinction are likewise sensitive to the rate of catastrophe occurrences and the shape of the catastrophe distribution, not just its mean.

We describe an experimental procedure that uses limiting and excess pollinations with mixtures of genetically marked pollen to partition the siring success of donors into three components: prefertilization gamete attrition (failure of male gametophytes before fertilization), pollen competitive ability (differences in pollen tube growth rate), and postfertilization gamete attrition (embryo abortion). Regression models for the relationships of pollen load size with each pollen's siring success and total recipient fecundity indicate that, for mixtures of self and outcross pollen, differences in gamete attrition, pollen competitive ability, and postfertilization success will have distinct and predictable effects on mating patterns and fecundity. Mating systems that rely on differences in pollen competitive ability result in outcrossing frequencies that increase with pollen load size, with seed production remaining high over a broad range of load sizes. In contrast, for mating systems governed by differences in gamete attrition, the frequency of outcrossed progeny will not vary greatly with pollen load size, but reduced fecundity will be expected over a wider range of pollen load sizes. These predictions were confirmed by analyzing the response of siring success and fecundity in response to pollen load size in the tristylous Eichhornia paniculata (Pontederiaceae).

Biomass from marine food webs (here, the Gulf of California) enters the terrestrial webs of islands and coastal areas through two conduits: (1) shore drift of algal wrack and carrion and (2) colonies of seabirds. Both conduits support dense assemblages of consumers: arthropods are 85-560 times more abundant in the supralittoral than inland and 2.2 times more abundant on islands with seabird colonies than those without. Marine input (MI), not terrestrial primary productivity (TP) by land plants, provides most energy and biomass for terrestrial communities on 16 of 19 study islands. The ratio of perimeter to area (P/A) significantly predicts arthropod abundance on islands and is the major determinant of the relative importance of allochthonous flow; we expect P/A ratio to be important wherever transport of nutrients, detritus, and organisms among habitats occurs.

Such input subsidizes a diverse array of terrestrial consumers; in many cases, subsidized consumers reach extraordinarily high densities and thus can depress their in situ resources.

In developing our theoretical framework, we utilize Dobzhansky's idea that strong selection against hybrids between two genotypes can occur simultaneously with the existence of a chain of genotypes that connect those two and differ only weakly in fitness among themselves.

Three components of fitness are considered: the cost of developing at a suboptimal time of the year, the reproductive advantage of larger adult size, and the increased mortality from rapid juvenile growth. The study focuses on the optimal responses of size, development time, and growth rate to changes in the amount of time available for completion of the life cycle. The models show that the optimal growth rate and size at maturity may respond in several different ways. Perhaps the most likely effect is that growth becomes faster and size smaller with less time available. It is also possible, however, for either growth rate or size (but not both) to stay constant; in other cases, less time available leads to slower growth or larger size. The effects of increased mortality on the juvenile stage are also explored; here, the optimal size is likely to decrease, but growth rate and development time may increase or decrease.",364,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,105,NA,NA

Second, by placing accurate boundaries on profitable food patches, foragers can eliminate the ""cost"" of over- and underestimating patch size.

We compare the life-history phenotypes of guppies from the north slope communities and find that the high-and low-predation contrasts are remarkably similar to those reported earlier for the south slope communities.

We find that the impact of variability is influenced significantly by the amount of variability an organism experiences (more variability affects selection pressures more), the correlations between variations among the vital rates (negative correlations are more likely to relax selection on fecundities and increase it on survival rates), and the life history in question (shorter life histories are more affected). In addition, the impact of a variable environment on the elastici-ties of life histories is sensitive to the sampling distribution used to generate the variability, and it is particularly sensitive to extreme values, such as those caused by occasional catastrophic events. The elasticities of life histories in highly variable environments may bear little relationship to those in a constant environment. In detailed optimality or evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) modeling, variability in vital rates as small as a standard deviation being 10%-15% of the mean may appreciably alter the conclusions.

The likelihood that a male is rejected on first encounter with a female should decline with male quality if females use a sequential search tactic. If females employ a best-of-n rule, however, the probability that a first encountered male is rejected should not depend on male quality; the proportion of males of any quality rejected on first encounter with a female equals the proportion of females that perceive the optimal number of males to be sampled prior to mating to be more than one. The behavior of females using either rule, however, depends on the distribution of quality among potential mates. We show that a variance-preserving increase of mean male quality results in an increase of the critical value of the threshold of acceptance under a sequential search rule; that is, females become more choosy. However, such a shift is not expected to change female search behavior if a best-of-n tactic is employed. A mean-preserving increase of the variance of male quality results in an increase of n among females that employ a best-of-n rule, whereas the number of males sampled prior to mating may increase, decrease, or remain unchanged following such a shift if females use a sequential search rule. The threshold acceptance criterion under sequential search, however, increases (decreases) with a mean-preserving increase (reduction) of the variance of male quality. Patterns of resampling of males by females and the position of accepted males in a search sequence have often been used to distinguish between the best-of-n and sequential search tactics. Predictions of each pattern under a sequential search model depend on both whether the time horizon over which search takes place is assumed to be finite or infinite and whether or not recall (resampling) of previously encountered males is permitted and sometimes resemble predictions of a best-of-n model of search behavior. Because finite time horizon models of sequential search are currently poorly developed, such information is not likely to provide good evidence that females are using either rule. The predictions that we derive, however, should be relatively robust to assumptions about recall and the time horizon over which sampling takes place.

In canids, larger female body size has been suggested to be associated with increasingly altricial young, larger litter sizes, and an increase in female pre- and postpartum energetic investment in offspring. It is hypothesized that the changing costs of reproduction with increasing body size result in a size-related diversity of canid reproductive life histories and social organization. Smaller canid species require less postpartum investment and thus tend toward polygyny and have a skewed dispersal ratio toward males. Larger species, with greater prepartum investment, require greater male investment in the rearing of offspring and thus tend to be group living. Using data on canid life histories, a phylogeny of the Canidae based on 383 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA, and an autoregressive comparative method, we found this hypothesis was not supported. Strong isometric relationships between neonate weight and female weight indicate that neonate size is constrained by female size directly or by parameters co-varying with female body size. Female weight accounted for only 26% of the variance in litter size, and no correlation was found between litter size and neonate weight. This result implies that female prenatal investment can be adjusted only by litter size (and not by neonate or litter weight), which in turn may be adjusted according to resource availability, an explanation supported by field and laboratory studies.

In bright light characterized by broad irradiance spectra, N. clavipes produce a complex of yellow pigments that absorb light of wavelengths less than 500 nm, making their webs appear golden. In dim light and where wave-lengths less than 500 nm have been eliminated, N. clavipes produce pigments that reflect light between 400 and 500 nm, making their webs appear white. Because yellow serves as a superstimulus attracting both herbivorous and pollinating insects, yellow silks may attract prey to spider webs. By training Trigona fluviventris, a stingless bee commonly fed on by N. clavipes, to forage at an artificial feeding site, we found that silk color affects insect response in two ways. First, yellow webs attract and intercept T. fluviventris more frequently than webs of any other color. Second, even after being intercepted once, T. fluviventris have difficulty learning to avoid yellow webs. We propose that N. clavipes has evolved a foraging behavior that makes use of the color cues insects seek while foraging and that the broad distribution of N. clavipes results from the spiders' ability to adjust the reflectance properties of its silks relative to its local light environment, allowing spiders to make use of whatever local populations of prey are most abundant.",47,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,119,NA,NA

We demonstrate that interspecific interactions are extremely weak, relative to intraspecific ones, and that the spatial arrangement of species and individuals within them is critical to the observed dynamics.

In 52% of the cases population size would have been increased by at least a factor of 1.5 had there been no interactions between individuals, and in 9% of these it would have increased by a factor of four or more.

The model considers competition in preadulthood and frequency dependence produced by the increasing fraction of pollinations that are intercytotypic, and unsuccessful, as frequency decreases. Analyses of the model indicate that increasing fecundity, selfing, and niche separation between cytotypes increases the likelihood of polyploid invasibility. These findings coincide with empirical patterns and with some theoretical results previously reported in the literature. However, in disagreement with other theoretical models, the conditions for polyploid establishment are found to be less restrictive. The application of the model, given that its parameters can be quantified, is discussed. As the percentage of selfing decreases, the niche separation required for polyploid invasibility increases, and the consequences of this result for community theory are discussed.",128,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,124,NA,NA

In this article we present a theoretical analysis of the adaptive significance of bud dormancy when the risk of herbivory varies from year to year. Under constant herbivore pressure, selection tends to favor either plants that have no dormant buds and hence no capacity of compensatory growth due to low risk of herbivory, or those that leave most of their buds in dormancy because of high risk of herbivory. We show that when the risk of herbivory varies from year to year, selection will favor intermediate phenotypes having both dormant and active meristems. The intermediate phenotypes represent bet-hedging strategies that have lower variance of seed production than either of the extreme strategies. We also show that intensive herbivory can favor meristem allocation strategies that allow plants to overcompensate for herbivore damage. Our results suggest that two kinds of herbivores might cause selection pressures favoring compensatory growth: large ungulate herbivores that remove a large proportion of the aboveground parts of the attacked plants and that predictably attack fairly many plants (>50%) each year, and invertebrate herbivores that periodically cause extensive damage during years of mass attacks.",61,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,125,NA,NA

In polygynous mammals, sexual selection by male-male competition often favors increased body size. Because adult body size, and hence reproductive success, are commonly related to maternal expenditure, I hypothesize that sexual selection for male body size can favor female reproductive strategies of single-birth parental allocation. To test this hypothesis. I made comparisons of sexual dimorphism in body size and litter size variations, after controlling for the effect of body mass, for 106 species of mammals. The results show that increases in sexual dimorphism are accompanied by decreases in the number of offspring per litter. Body mass is related to reductions in litter size only for larger mammals, whereas sexual dimorphism is negatively correlated with litter size throughout the whole range of species of all included taxa. Thus, the results support the hypothesis that sexual selection for male body mass reduces the size of mammalian litters, establishing a new consequence of sexual selection.",54,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,126,NA,NA
