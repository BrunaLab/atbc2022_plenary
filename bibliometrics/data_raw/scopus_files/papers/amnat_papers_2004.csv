Here we show that interspecific variation in demographic stochasticity, caused by random variation among individuals in their fitness contributions, can be predicted from a knowledge of the species' position along a ""slow-fast"" gradient of life-history variation, ranging from high reproductive species with short life expectancy at one end to species that often produce a single offspring but survive well at the other end of the continuum. The demographic stochasticity decreased with adult survival rate, age at maturity, and generation time or the position of the species toward the slow end of the slow-fast life-history gradient. This relationship between life-history characteristics and demographic stochasticity was related to interspecific differences in the variation among females in recruitment as well as to differences in the individual variation in survival.

Here we show that the immature brood of the cuckoo wasp Polistes sulcifer grows more rapidly than the host immature brood. Host workers perform more parental care to parasite larvae than to conspecific ones. Thus, the rapid growth of the parasite larvae is evidently due to increased host care, which prolongs the development of host larvae reared in the same colony.

These pigments, together with a 425-nm (short wavelength) pigment, permit trichromatic color vision. Other platyrrhines and prosimians have a single X chromosome gene but often with alleles for two or three M/L photopigments. Consequently, heterozygote females are trichromats, but males and homozygote females are dichromats. The criteria that affect the evolution of M/L alleles and maintain genetic polymorphism remain a puzzle, but selection for finding food may be important. We compare different types of color vision for detecting more than 100 plant species consumed by tamarins (Saguinus spp.) in Peru. There is evidence that both frequency-dependent selection on homozygotes and heterozygote advantage favor M/L polymorphism and that trichromatic color vision is most advantageous in dim light. Also, whereas the 562-nm allele is present in all species, the occurrence of 535- to 556-nm alleles varies between species. This variation probably arises because trichromatic color vision favors widely separated pigments and equal frequencies of 535/543- and 562-nm alleles, whereas in dichromats, long-wavelength pigment alleles are fitter.",151,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Balancing selection | Color vision | Evolution | Modeling | Primate,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,3,NA,NA,NA

We use the molecular phylogeny and species abundances from the well-studied yeasts that live in decaying cactus tissue (i.e., cactus yeast community) to demonstrate that community structure is indeed linked to genetic relatedness but that the relationship is different for the same yeasts found in hosts of two subfamilies of the Cactaceae.

Conversely, in the columnar cacti, the abundant yeast species tend to be genetically distant from one another, whereas the rare species tend to be closely related.

To address this debate, which crosses traditional boundaries between community ecology and population biology, we grew wild turnip families from three selection histories in a field experiment in which we manipulated conspecific density and sun exposure. Hot spring conditions caused neutral shading to reduce drought stress, resulting in a greater mean and variance for lifetime fertility at low density and greater intensity of competition at high density. The variance in relative fitness among individuals or families was least in partial shade at low density. Prior selection under shade stress in the greenhouse reduced lifetime fitness in the less stressful partial-shade treatment under field conditions.

Partial shade favored the proliferation of large leaves early in development, especially at high density. Selection in the stressful full-sun treatment favored reduced pathogen susceptibility at both densities and early flowering at low density.

We show that this discrepancy between data and theory collapses if one takes into account that size affects male and female fitness through distinct routes. Using the classification of budget (larger individuals spend a greater budget on reproduction) and direct (e.g., larger plants are taller and may disperse pollen more efficiently) effects of size suggested by Klinkhamer et al., we propose a simple general framework appropriately incorporating these two categories of size effects in male and female fitness expressions.

Most importantly, OU models possess selective optima that formalize the notion of adaptive zone.

Our approach allows us to translate hypotheses regarding adaptation in different selective regimes into explicit models, to test the models against data using maximum-likelihood- based model selection techniques, and to infer details of the evolutionary process. We illustrate the method using two worked examples.

The problem is determining why an individual would carry out a costly behavior that benefits another. Possible solutions to this problem include kinship, repeated interactions, and policing. Another solution that has recently received much attention is the threat of punishment. However, punishing behavior is often costly for the punisher, and so it is not immediately clear how costly punishment could evolve. We use a direct (neighbor-modulated) fitness approach to analyze when punishment is favored. This methodology reveals that, contrary to previous suggestions, relatedness between interacting individuals is not crucial to explaining cooperation through punishment. In fact, increasing relatedness directly disfavors punishing behavior. Instead, the crucial factor is a positive correlation between the punishment strategy of an individual and the cooperation it receives. This could arise in several ways, such as when facultative adjustment of behavior leads individuals to cooperate more when interacting with individuals who are more likely to punish.

There is natural evidence that clustering occurs as a result of the interplay between random and directed movements of individuals due to mutual attraction and repulsion. Classically, it is assumed that taxis velocity is determined by the density gradient of some stimulus. However, it is known that partial differential equation (PDE) diffusion-advection models that rest on this assumption cannot give a realistic representation of a stationary or moving cohesive group of individuals with a uniform interior density and sharp edges. Pioneering work by Okubo and coworkers suggests that the acceleration of individuals (rather than their velocity directly) is proportional to the population density gradient. A PDE model resting on this finding was constructed and investigated. The model demonstrates the formation of steady heterogeneous structures of the required shape. This feature can be interpreted as dynamic self-organization, like fish shoaling or insect swarming.

Under frequency dependence, two independent properties have to be distinguished: evolutionary stability (an evolutionarily stable strategy cannot be invaded once established) and convergence stability (only a convergence stable strategy can be attained through small, selectively advantageous steps). Combination of both properties results in four classes of possible evolutionary outcomes.

Our aim was to examine whether the trophic structure of mammalian communities is maintained through time despite continuing environmental change. Ecomorphological grouping of fossils indicates that herbivore genera have low taxon resilience in that each genus has predominantly only one locality coverage peak before disappearance. Despite this continuous replacement of the most prevalent herbivore genera, the herbivore trophic group as a whole remains the largest and maintains a roughly constant share of locality coverage throughout the Neogene. The successive herbivore genera, however, show increasing adaptations to harshening environments, indicating shifting properties of niches while the overall trophic structure is conserved.

A meta-analysis demonstrated significant local adaptation by the parasite, and a variance components analysis showed that the variance due to the host-parasite interaction far exceeded the variance due to the main effects of host source and parasite source. The meta-analysis also indicated that asexual host populations were more resistant to allopatric sources of parasites than were (mostly) sexual host populations, but we found no significant differences among parasite populations in the strength of local adaptation. This result suggests that triploid asexual snails are more resistant to remote sources of parasites, but the parasite has, through coevolution, overcome the difference.

In this study, we used a comprehensive data set of disease-causing organisms from free-living primates to illustrate how phylogenetic comparative methods can be used to examine mammalian lineage diversity in relation to parasite species richness. Our results provide evidence that the phylogenetic diversity of primate clades is correlated positively with the number of parasite species harbored by each host and that this pattern is largely independent of other host traits that have been shown to influence diversification rates and parasite species richness in primates. We investigated two possible mechanisms that could explain this association, namely that parasites themselves drive host evolutionary diversification through processes linked with sexual selection and that host shifts or host sharing increases parasite species richness among diverse primate clades. Neither parasite species richness nor host diversification is related to measures of sexual selection in primates. Further, we found only partial evidence that more rapidly diversifying host lineages produced increased opportunities for host sharing or host shifting by parasites through mechanisms involving species' geographic range overlap.

Since August 1997, aspergillosis has nearly eradicated large sea fans at some sites. However, sea fan densities have remained relatively constant due to episodic recruitment replacing large fans with small. Recruitment itself was affected by infection and occurred only when prevalence of disease was low. This impact on recruitment occurred because the largest, potentially most fecund colonies had the highest prevalence of disease, and the pathogen significantly suppressed reproduction of infected fans. Moreover, high mortality among adults resulted in a demographic shift to smaller colonies. The most dramatic impact of aspergillosis was the Keys-wide loss of >50% of sea fan tissue from complete and partial mortality. Aspergillosis prevalence has declined steadily over the last 6 years, and we consider the following hypotheses for decline of the epizootic: change in environment, change in pathogen input, and increase in host resistance.

Castrating parasites are thought to minimize their costs by reducing host fecundity, which may minimize the chances of killing both host and parasite prematurely. We conducted a series of experiments to understand the evolution of virulence of a castrating bacterium in the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna. By manipulating food levels during the infection of D. magna with the bacterium Pasteuria ramosa, we showed that both antagonists are resource-limited and that a negative correlation between host and parasite reproduction exists, indicating resource competition among the antagonists. Pasteuria ramosa also induces enhanced growth of its hosts (gigantism), which we found to be negatively correlated with host fecundity but positively correlated with parasite reproduction. Because infected hosts never recovered from infections, we concluded that gigantism is beneficial only for the parasite. Hosts, however, have evolved counter-adaptations. We showed that infected hosts have enhanced reproduction before castration. This shift to earlier reproduction increases overall host fecundity and compromises parasite reproduction. Finally, we showed that this resource conflict is subject to genetic variation among host and parasite genotypes within a population and is therefore likely to be an important force in the coevolution of virulence in this system. A verbal model is presented and suggests that the adaptive value of gigantism is to store host resources, which are liberated after parasitic castration for later use by the growing parasite.

Pathogen spillover occurs when epidemics in a host population are driven not by transmission within that population but by transmission from a reservoir population. Here we review examples of spillover in pathogens infecting humans, domesticated animals, and crops, noting that most empirical evidence for spillover results from nonmanipulative, observational studies.

Relatively low mortality while guarding is also important for the stability of male care. Female care, on the other hand, is favored by long female processing times and low populations densities, which lead to longer intermating intervals. Biparental care is stable only when the cost to benefit ratio of care was not biased toward either sex.

Furthermore, T treatment increased plasma levels of corticosterone and decreased body mass and fat stores in relation to other treatments.

In particular, we study interaction and distribution of two species in a two-patch environment assuming that individuals behave adaptively (i.e., they maximize Darwinian fitness). Either the two species are competing for resources or they are in a predator-prey relationship. Using some recent advances in evolutionary game theory, we extend the classical ideal free distribution (IFD) concept for single species to two interacting species. We study population dynamical consequences of two-species IFD by comparing two systems: one where individuals cannot migrate between habitats and one where migration is possible. For single species, predator-prey interactions, and competing species, we show that these two types of behavior lead to the same population equilibria and corresponding species spatial distributions, provided interspecific competition is patch independent. However, if differences between patches are such that competition is patch dependent, then our predictions strongly depend on whether animals can migrate or not. In particular, we show that when species are settled at their equilibrium population densities in both habitats in the environment where migration between habitats is blocked, then the corresponding species spatial distribution need not be an IFD. Thus, when species are given the opportunity to migrate, they will redistribute to reach an IFD (e.g., under which the two species can completely segregate), and this redistribution will also influence species population equilibrial densities. Alternatively, we also show that when two species are distributed according to the IFD, the corresponding population equilibrium can be unstable.",98,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Adaptive foraging | Competition | Evolutionarily stable strategy | Habitat choice | Ideal free distribution | Predator-prey | Replicator system,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,39,15459879,NA,NA

In contrast, for parasitic organisms, the trade-off hypothesis predicts that parasites exploiting many host species will achieve lower mean abundance on those hosts than more host-specific parasites because of the costs of adaptations against multiple defense systems. We test these alternative hypotheses with data on host specificity and abundance of fleas parasitic on small mammals from 20 different regions. Our analyses controlled for phylogenetic influences, differences in host body surface area, and sampling effort. In most regions, we found significant positive relationships between flea abundance and either the number of host species they exploited or the average taxonomic distance among those host species, This was true whether we used mean flea abundance or the maximum abundance they achieved on their optimal host. Although fleas tended to exploit more host species in regions with either larger number of available hosts or more taxonomically diverse host faunas, differences in host faunas between regions had no clear effect on the abundance-host specificity relationship.

We apply two methods of species delimitation to an ancient group of lizards (genus Xantusia) that occur throughout southwestern North America.

We observed distinct changes in dispersal in the two species with expanding ranges. Recently colonized populations at the range margin showed increased frequencies of dispersive, long-winged (macropterous) individuals, compared with longer-established populations in the range core. This increase in dispersal appeared to be short-lived because 5-10 years after colonization populations showed similar incidences of macroptery to populations in the range core. These changes are consistent with evolutionary change; field patterns persisted when nymphs were reared under controlled environmental conditions, and range margin individuals reared in the laboratory flew farther than range core individuals in a wind tunnel. There was also a reproductive trade-off with dispersal in both females and males, which could explain the rapid reversion to lower rates of dispersal once populations become established. The effect of population density on wing morphology differed between populations from the range core (no significant effect of density) and expanding range margins (negative density dependence), which we propose is part of the mechanism of the changes in dispersal.

I measured the fertilization success of male and female Strongylocentrotus franciscanus over a range of population densities using microsatellite markers. Female fertilization success first increased and then decreased with mate density, limited at low density by sperm limitation and at high density by polyspermy. Mate density affected variance in fertilization success in both males and females. In males, the variance in fertilization success increased with mate density. In females, the pattern was more complex. The variance in female success increased similarly to males with increased mate density but then decreased to low levels at intermediate densities, where almost all eggs were fertilized. As density increased further, the female variances again increased as polyspermy lowered average fertilization success. Male and female variances differed only at intermediate densities.

We thus have limited knowledge of the conditions under which multiple spatial mechanisms can operate or of emergent properties arising from interactions between mechanisms. Here we present a mathematical framework that allows for comparative analysis of spatial coexistence mechanisms. The basis for comparison is mechanisms operating in spatially homogeneous competitive environments (e.g., life-history trade-offs) versus mechanisms operating in spatially heterogeneous competitive environments (e.g., source-sink dynamics). Our comparative approach leads to several new insights about spatial coexistence. First, we show that spatial variation in the expression of a life-history trade-off leads to a unique regional pattern that cannot be predicted by considering trade-offs or source-sink dynamics alone. This result represents an instance where spatial heterogeneity constrains rather than promotes coexistence, and it illustrates the kind of counterintuitive emergent properties that arise due to interactions between different classes of mechanisms. Second, we clarify the role of dispersal mortality in spatial coexistence. Previous studies have shown that coexistence can be constrained or facilitated by dispersal mortality. Our broader analysis distinguishes situations where dispersal mortality is not necessary for coexistence from those where such mortality is essential for coexistence because it preserves spatial variation in the strength of competition.

Consequently, when multiple species face a common environmental gradient, their patterns of divergence might exhibit both shared and unique elements. Here we describe a general framework for investigating and evaluating the relative importance of these contrasting features of diversification. We examined morphological diversification in three species of livebearing fishes across a predation gradient. All species (Gambusia affinis from the United States of America, Brachyrhaphis rhabdophora from Costa Rica, and Poecilia reticulata from Trinidad) exhibited more elongate bodies, a larger caudal peduncle, and a relatively lower position of the eye in predator populations. This shared response suggests that common selective pressures generated parallel outcomes within three different species. However, each species also exhibited unique features of divergence, which might reflect phylogenetic tendencies, chance events, or localized environmental differences. In this system, we found that shared aspects of divergence were of larger magnitude than unique elements, suggesting common natural selective forces have played a greater role than unique histories in producing the observed patterns of morphological diversification.

Despite grasses and forbs independently possessing high fecundity in the same types of years, interspecific differences in germination biology and dormancy caused the rare forb to benefit from variation in the environment. Owing to the buildup of grass competitors, consecutive favorable years proved highly detrimental to forb persistence. Consequently, negative temporal autocorrelation, a low probability of a favorable year, and high variation in year quality all benefited the forb.

We measured foraging decisions at artificial food patches to assess how urban habitats differ from wildlands in predation risk, missed-opportunity cost, competition, and metabolic cost. By manipulating seed trays, we compared leftover seed (giving-up density) in urban and desert habitats in Arizona. Deserts exhibited higher predation risk than urban habitats. Only desert birds quit patches earlier when increasing the missed-opportunity cost. House finches and house sparrows coexist by trading off travel cost against foraging efficiency. In exclusion experiments, urban doves were more efficient foragers than passerines. Providing water decreased digestive costs only in the desert. At the population level, reduced predation and higher resource abundance drive the increased densities in cities.

Ecological stoichiometry could also predict compositional shifts of grazers over gradients of nutrient and light supply through a mechanism involving (mis)matches between elemental body composition of grazers and plants. This hypothesis is explored here using a suite of two-grazer, one-plant models that incorporate three key components: plant production depends on light and nutrients, nutrient content of plants can vary, and homeostatic grazers can be carbon or nutrient limited. The results from this suite closely resemble the classical resource ratio model describing plant competition for two resources. Here, the models predict shifts of grazer composition along resource supply gradients if species trade off competitive abilities for plant carbon and nutrients. Given this trade-off, superior nutrient competitors should dominate low nutrient environments, and superior carbon competitors should dominate high nutrient environments. At intermediate nutrient supply, species can coexist at a stable equilibrium, or alternative stable states emerge, depending on how grazers impact their resources.

Helianthus deserticola was negatively transgressive for stem diameter, leaf area, and flowering date, and the latter two traits are likely to be advantageous in a desert environment. The BC2 hybrids contained a range of variation that overlapped these transgressive trait means, and an analysis of phenotypic selection revealed that some of the selective pressures on leaf size and flowering date, but not stem diameter, would move the BC 2 population toward the H. deserticola phenotype.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Which, if any, of these hypotheses is the most plausible in general remains Jargely unresolved based on the available empirical data. Yet theoretical studies conclude that the evolution of preferences for multiple signals of male quality is unlikely, especially when the use of an additional cue in mate choice strongly increases the overall cost of choice. This would imply that most male courtship characters do not reflect the male's genetic quality but instead evolved through Fisherian sexual selection. However, the existing models focus on ornaments that signal overall genetic quality and do not address the possibility that different ornaments provide information about different aspects of quality. Therefore, we develop a model in which the ornaments act as signals for distinct quality components. When the ornaments provide overlapping information about these quality components, we retrieve the results of earlier models. However, when the ornaments provide independent information, preferences for multiple ornaments may evolve, even when exhibiting multiple preferences is costly.

On the one hand, restricting groups to close kin allows the evolution of highly altruistic behaviors but may limit group size to suboptimal levels, the more severely so the smaller the intrinsic fecundity of the species and the stricter the kin admission rule. Group size requirements, on the other hand, can be met by admitting nonkin into groups, but not without limiting the degree of altruism that can evolve. As a solution to this conundrum, we show that if helping roles within groups are assigned through a lottery rather than being genetically determined, maximum degrees of altruism can evolve in groups of nonrelatives of any size.

This tendency is caused by multiple attractors that may exist in such systems. We show that alternative attractors arise robustly in randomly generated multispecies models, especially if competition is symmetrical and if interspecific competition is allowed to exceed intraspecific competition. Inclusion of predators as a second trophic level did not alter the results greatly, although it reduced the probability of alternative attractors somewhat.

It is not only weak flows that can be stabilizing but also the arrangement of the flows that emphasizes stabilizing mechanisms. We find that the main stabilizing mechanism is asynchrony, where structures and energetic arrangements that decrease synchrony such as internal segregation or competition will stabilize dynamics. Since compartments allow prey dynamics to behave somewhat independently, compartmentation readily promotes stability.

Here we examine the consequences of adaptive life-history evolution on locomotor performance in the live-bearing guppy. In response to increased predation from piscivorous fish, Trinidadian guppies evolve an increased allocation of resources toward reproduction. These populations are also under strong selection for rapid fast-start swimming performance to evade predators. Because embryo development increases a female's wet mass as she approaches parturition, an increased investment in reproductive allocation should impede fast-start performance. We find evidence for adaptive but constrained evolution of fast-start swimming performance in laboratory trials conducted on second-generation lab-reared fish. Female guppies from high-predation localities attain a faster acceleration and velocity and travel a greater distance during fast-start swimming trials. However, velocity and distance traveled decline more rapidly over the course of pregnancy in these same females, thus reducing the magnitude of divergence in swimming performance between high- and low-predation populations.

We studied the capacity of soft selection to maintain polygenic variation for a trait determined by several additive loci, selected in opposite directions in two habitats connected by dispersal. We found three main types of stable equilibria. Extreme equilibria are characterized by extreme specialization to one habitat and loss of polymorphism. They are analogous to monomorphic equilibria in singe-locus models and are favored by similar factors: high dispersal, weak selection, and low marginal average fitness of intermediate genotypes. At the remaining two types of equilibria the population mean is intermediate but variance is very different. At fully polymorphic equilibria all loci are polymorphic, whereas at low-variance equilibria at most one locus remains polymorphic. For most parameters only one type of equilibrium is stable; the transition between the domains of fully polymorphic and low-variance equilibria is typically sharp. Low-variance equilibria are favored by high marginal average fitness of intermediate genotypes, in contrast to single-locus models, in which marginal overdominance is particularly favorable for maintenance of polymorphism. The capacity of soft selection to maintain polygenic variation is thus more limited than extrapolation from single-locus models would suggest, in particular if dispersal is high and selection weak.

In polyploidization, the polyploid evolves from the original diploid cytotype, in which the triploid state is considered to mediate the process (triploid bridge). Nevertheless, the fitness of triploid individuals seems to be too low to facilitate the polyploidization process (triploid block). The evolutionary condition of autopolyploidy was analyzed using a mathematical model focusing on the role of parthenogenesis in triploid and tetraploid individuals. In addition, offspring were assumed to arise by sexual reproduction by conjugations between haploid, diploid, and triploid gametes produced by diploid, tetraploid, and triploid individuals. According to the analysis, even if triploid block suppresses the fitness of sexually produced triploids, the polyploidization process can proceed when parthenogenesis occurs frequently. If only triploids frequently reproduce parthenogenetically, the evolutionary consequences tend to depend on the fitness of the tetraploid individuals. On the basis of a predetermined parameter set, if tetraploid fitness is relatively low, all three ploidies can coexist. Otherwise, tetraploidization occurs. In this case, triploid parthenogenesis promotes not only triploidization but also tetraploidization.

Reproductive asynchrony, which occurs when individuals are reproductively active for only a portion of the population-level breeding period, may provide one such link. Traditionally, reproductive asynchrony has been considered from evolutionary perspectives as an advantageous bet-hedging strategy in temporally unpredictable environments. Here, we explore the dynamic consequences of reproductive asynchrony as a density-dependent life-history trait. To examine how asynchrony affects population growth rate and extinction risk, we used a general model of reproductive timing to quantify the temporal overlap of opposite-sex individuals and to simulate population dynamics over a range of initial densities and empirical estimates of reproductive asynchrony. We also considered how protandry, a sexually selected life-history strategy that often accompanies asynchrony, modulates the population-level effects of reproductive asynchrony. We found that asynchrony decreases the number of males a female overlaps with, decreases the average probability of mating per male/female pair that does overlap, and leaves some females completely isolated in time. This loss of reproductive potential, which is exacerbated by protandry, reduces population growth rate at low density and can lead to extinction via an Allee effect. Thus reproductive asynchrony and protandry, both of which can be evolutionarily advantageous at higher population densities, may prove detrimental when population density declines.",107,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Bet hedging | Extinction risk | Life-history traits | Phenology | Protandry | Reproductive timing,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,72,15266368,NA,NA

We investigated the trade-off between investment in immunity and maintenance of testosterone, carotenoids, and sexually selected, carotenoid-based bill color in male mallards. Following a nonpathogenic immune challenge, facultative immune investment resulted in a syndrome of changes in allocation.

We suggest that influence of shared genetic biases should be detectable by the disproportionate use of the same genes in independent instances of parallel phenotypic evolution. We show how progress in testing this prediction can be made through simple tests of parallel inheritance of genetic differences: similar additive, dominance, and epistasis components in analysis of line means and similar effective numbers of loci. We demonstrate parallel inheritance in two traits, lateral plate number and body shape, in two lineages of threespine stickleback that have adapted independently to freshwater streams on opposite sides of the Pacific Ocean.

Our results represent only a first step in the study of the genetics of parallel phenotypic evolution in sticklebacks.

Theoretical models are inconsistent regarding the genomic location of sexually selected genes. Models that do not incorporate pleiotropic effects often predict sex linkage.

Evidence largely based on reciprocal crosses supports the notion of sex linkage. However, although they infer genetic contribution, reciprocal crosses cannot identify the genes or their pleiotropic effects.

Interestingly, most are pleiotropic (73%), and they are not preferentially sex linked.

Extrinsic factors here include both seasonality and long-term changes or interannual variability in forcing. Results with simulated data show that this semiparametric method successfully recovers the decay of immunity and identifies the origin of interannual variability. An application to historical cholera data indicates that temporary immunity can be long-lasting and decays in approximately 9 yr.

This hypothesis is also supported by data demonstrating that embryos and fetuses actively manipulate their interaction with the mother, thereby garnishing increased maternal resources.

Moreover, little is known about the variation or consistency of body size patterns across geographic space or evolutionary time. Here, we draw from a data set of terrestrial, nonvolant mammals to quantify and compare patterns across the body size spectrum, the taxonomic hierarchy, continental space, and evolutionary time. We employ a variety of statistical techniques including ""sib-sib"" regression, phylogenetic autocorrelation, and nested ANOVA. We find an extremely high resemblance (heritability) of size among congeneric species for mammals over ∼18 g; the result is consistent across the size spectrum. However, there is no significant relationship among the body sizes of congeneric species for mammals under ∼18 g. We suspect that life-history and ecological parameters are so tightly constrained by allometry at diminutive size that animals can only adapt to novel ecological conditions by modifying body size. The overall distributions of size for each continental fauna and for the most diverse orders are quantitatively similar for North America, South America, and Africa, despite virtually no overlap in species composition. Differences in ordinal composition appear to account for quantitative differences between continents. For most mammalian orders, body size is highly conserved, although there is extensive overlap at all levels of the taxonomic hierarchy. The body size distribution for terrestrial mammals apparently was established early in the Tertiary, and it has remained remarkably constant over the past 50 Ma and across the major continents.

Juvenile survival rates varied between years at a small spatial scale that was reflected as a strong interaction between the local neighborhood level and year. Spatially and temporally variable selection acted jointly on egg mass, which presumably would facilitate the maintenance of high additive genetic variance for this trait. Local selection gradients calculated at the neighborhood level were significantly correlated with the annual global selection gradients calculated at the metapopulation level. However, there was substantial variance in these local selective regimes, which suggests that strong local selection could go undetected if the analysis was limited to the global level.

This idea agrees with recent models suggesting that speciation may proceed by means of divergent Fisherian runaway processes within a single population. Notwithstanding this, the models so far have not been able to demonstrate that sympatric speciation can unfold as a fully adaptive process driven by sexual selection alone. Implicitly or explicitly, most models rely on nonselective factors to initiate speciation. In fact, they do not provide a selective explanation for the considerable variation in female preferences required to trigger divergent runaway processes. We argue that such variation can arise by disruptive selection but only when selection on female preferences is frequency dependent. Adaptive speciation is therefore unattainable in traditional female choice models, which assume selection on female preferences to be frequency independent. However, when frequency-dependent sexual selection processes act alongside mate choice, truly adaptive sympatric speciation becomes feasible. Speciation is then initiated independently of nonadaptive processes and does not suffer from the theoretical weaknesses associated with the current Fisherian runaway model of speciation.

The latter is defined as ""cross predation""; the antonym ""parallel predation"" means predation within the same laterality. We hypothesized that cross predation drives alternation of the survival and reproductive advantages between two morphological types, leading to frequency-dependent selection that maintains the dimorphism. To investigate this, we constructed mathematical models of population dynamics of one prey/one predator systems and three-trophic-level systems with omnivory. Mathematical analysis and computer simulations explained the behavior of the laterality frequency in nature well, insofar as cross predation dominated over parallel predation.

We present a model reproducing these maze and string patterns, describing how nutrient-limited vascular plants are controlled by, and in turn control, both hydrology and solute transport. We propose that the patterns are self-organized and originate from a nutrient accumulation mechanism. In the model, this is caused by the convective transport of nutrients in the groundwater toward areas with higher vascular plant biomass, driven by differences in transpiration rate. In a numerical bifurcation analysis we show how the maze patterns originate from the spatially homogeneous equilibrium and how this is affected by changes in rainfall, nutrient input, and plant properties.

Late-born offspring are more likely to die since they are smaller in autumn. Low female condition in autumn due to prolonged investment in current-year offspring may lower her ability to ovulate sufficiently early to get a good start for the calves the following spring. On the basis of autopsies of uteri from 10,073 red deer (Cervus elaphus), we show that ovulation was delayed as well as more synchronous with increasing population density.

Ovulation occurs progressively earlier with increasing age up to around 13 yr of age, after which ovulation again occurs later. Low ovulation rates in young compared with prime-aged deer were correlated with late ovulation in the fall. Also, yearling groups with a low rate of ovulation (e.g., because of low weight) also ovulated later, and old senescent deer not calving the previous year ovulated less frequently and markedly later than those raising a calf.

The masting dynamics were assumed to follow a resource-based model for plant reproduction, and the population dynamics of the predator were represented by a spatially extended Nicholson-Bailey model. The resultant model demonstrated that when host plants reproduce intermittently, seed predator populations go locally extinct, but global persistence of the predator is facilitated by dispersal or extended diapause. Global extinction of the predator resulted when the intermittent reproduction is highly synchronized among plants. An approximate invasion criterion for the predators showed that negative lag-1 autocorrelation in seeding reduces invasibility, and positive lag-1 cross-correlation enhances invasibility.

Here, we show by constructing random matrices that a spurious negative correlation exists between the sensitivities and variances, and between the elasticities and coefficients of variation, of matrix elements. This spurious correlation arises in part because size transition probabilities, which are bounded by 0 and 1, have a limit to their variability that often does not apply to matrix elements representing reproduction. We advocate an alternative analysis based on the underlying vital rates (not the matrix elements) that accounts for the inherent limit to the variability of zero-to-one vital rates, corrects for sampling variation, and tests for a declining upper limit to variability as a vital rate's fitness contribution increases.

Thus, environmental heterogeneity in resource availability can affect the relative costs and benefits of expressing shade-avoidance traits independent of local seedling density, the inductive environmental cue.

The tADL has been calculated by dividing the available oxygen stores by the diving metabolic rate (DMR). Contrary to diving mammals, most diving birds examined to date exceed the tADL by a large margin. This discrepancy between observation and theory has engendered two alternative explanations suggesting that dive duration is extended either anaerobically or by depressing aerobic metabolism. Current formulations of tADL uncritically assume that DMR is independent of depth. However, diving birds differ from other vertebrate divers by having a larger respiratory system volume and by retaining air in their plumage while diving, thereby elevating buoyancy. Because air compresses with depth, diving power requirement decreases with depth. Following this principle, we modeled DMR to depth for Adelie and little penguins and reformulated the tADL accordingly. The model's results suggest that <∼5% of natural dives by Adelie penguins exceed the reformulated tADL(d), or maximal aerobic depth, and none in the more buoyant little penguin.

Historically, this controversy has been an effective engine powering several evolutionary research programs during the last century (Provine 1989). While all biologists agree that both processes operate in nature to produce evolutionary change, there is a diversity of opinion about which process dominates at any particular organizational level (from DNA and proteins to complex morphologies). To address this last level, we did a broadscale analysis of cranial diversification among all living New World monkeys. Quantitative genetic models yield specific predictions about the relationship between variation patterns within and between populations that may be used to test the hypothesis that genetic drift is a sufficient explanation for morphological diversification. Diversity at several levels in a hierarchy of taxonomic/phylogenetics relationship was examined from species within genera to families within superfamilies. The major conclusion is that genetic drift can be ruled out as the primary source of evolutionary diversification in cranial morphology among taxa at the level of the genus and above as well as for diversification of most genera.

No such response is expected for cooperative begging (which influences the total level of provisioning by the parent), and the models even predict the opposite trend under some circumstances (where the indirect costs of extracting additional resources from the parent are high). These contrasting sets of predictions may help to explain the varying empirical results obtained by studies of sibling interaction. Cooperative (as opposed to competitive) begging is likely to be of greater significance in cases where dominant young can gain direct control of allocation (or enjoy some competitive advantage).

However, the tail also has an aerodynamic function, playing a role in turning and slow flight. If a tail is to function as an ornament, then there will be an inevitable conflict between the aerodynamic role and the signaling role. Aerodynamic theory has developed to the point where it is possible to predict the aerodynamic and mechanical consequences of ornamental tails of different sizes and shapes. Tail elongation will influence many different mechanical and aerodynamic parameters. For at least some and possibly all of these parameters, there will be limits that are placed by the bird's anatomy, morphology, or physiology on the extent to which the effect of tail elongation could be tolerated. For example, if a particular tail morphology meant that the power required to fly exceeded the power available from the flight muscles, then the bird would obviously be unable to fly with such a tail. To examine whether these considerations could limit the development of ornamental tails, the effect of long tails of different shapes was examined on three parameters: static balance, lift-to-drag ratio, and the cost of flight. All three of these parameters were found to limit the range of possible tail morphologies that could be developed by birds. These limits were most acute for small birds, which may not be able to operate with a long tail of any shape. Slightly larger birds would be able to develop elongated streamers and forked tails but not pintails or wedge-shaped tails. Medium to large birds are less constrained and could develop a much wider range of tails than small birds, but there will always be limits to the sizes of tail ornament that could be developed.

The model predicts that if the energy cost of maintaining a given body mass differs between environments, animals should be smaller in the more demanding environments, and there should be a negative correlation between body mass and daily energy expenditure (DEE) across environments. In contrast, if animals adjust their energy intake according to variation in survival costs of foraging, there should be a positive correlation between body mass and DEE.

Scarce populations (with low distribution and abundance) arise when relative local extinction rate is low to moderate and heterogeneity is high or successful dispersal is relatively low. Sparse populations (widespread, but with low local abundance) arise when relative local extinction rate is very low and either spatial heterogeneity or mortality through unsuccessful dispersal is high. In sparse or common species, there may be unstable as well as stable equilibria, implying a threshold distribution and abundance for persistence.

We present a theory that shows how the intrinsic rate of exponential population growth, rmax, and the carrying capacity, K, depend on individual metabolic rate and resource supply rate. To do this, we construct equations for the metabolic rates of entire populations by summing over individuals, and then we combine these population-level equations with Malthusian growth. Thus, the theory makes explicit the relationship between rates of resource supply in the environment and rates of production of new biomass and individuals. These individual-level and population-level processes are inextricably linked because metabolism sets both the demand for environmental resources and the resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction. We use the theory to make explicit how and why rmax exhibits its characteristic dependence on body size and temperature. Data for aerobic eukaryotes, including algae, protists, insects, zooplankton, fishes, and mammals, support these predicted scalings for rmax. The metabolic flux of energy and materials also dictates that the carrying capacity or equilibrium density of populations should decrease with increasing body size and increasing temperature. Finally, we argue that body mass and body temperature, through their effects on metabolic rate, can explain most of the variation in fecundity and mortality rates.

Both structures develop from imaginai disklike tissues that undergo explosive growth during late larval development but differ in exactly when they initiate their growth.

We found that experimental males developed disproportionately larger horns. Horn overexpression was weakest in response to early ablation and most pronounced in males whose genital disks were ablated just before larvae entered the prepupal stage.

In this article, we apply an evolutionarily stable strategy analysis to an epidemic model to answer this question. On the one hand, an investment in immune function confers protection to infectious agents by reducing host susceptibility, pathogen virulence, or the length of the infectious period. On the other hand, an immune system is costly since it absorbs resources that otherwise might be invested in increasing the host's fertility or longevity. In addition, an active immune system may be able to clear pathogens efficiently but at the same time may result in immunopathology. By means of a reproductive value approach, we show how to compare the costs and benefits of an immune system systematically and how to derive the evolutionarily stable level of immune function. We then apply these methods to various plausible scenarios. The analysis reveals that the relationship between the life span of an organism and the optimal level of investment in immune function is less straight-forward than one might expect. First, the prevalence of infection is reduced to the lowest possible level only under special circumstances. Second, members of a long-lived species do not necessarily have to invest more in immune function than those of a short-lived species. In fact, the opposite may be true.

First, we use a null hypothesis testing approach and find that the CB decision rule, in which individuals use past experiences to make nonrandom assessment and choice decisions, produces patterns of behavior that more closely correspond to observed patterns of nut sampling in scrub-jays than the other two rules. This approach does not allow us to quantify how much better CB is at predicting scrub-jay behavior than the other decision rules. Second, we use a model selection approach that uses Akaike Information Criteria to quantify how well alternative models approximate observed data. We find that the CB rule is much more likely to produce the observed patterns of scrub-jay behavior than the other rules. This result provides some of the best empirical evidence of the use of Bayesian information updating by a nonhuman animal.",26,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Decision rules | Diet selection | Likelihood statistics | Model selection,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,124,14970927,NA,NA

The combination of abundant articulated specimens available from a narrow stratigraphic interval and segmental intraspecific variation makes this trilobite singularly useful for studying postembryonic growth and segmentation. Trunk segmentation followed a hemianamorphic pattern, as seen in other arthropods and as characteristic of the Trilobita; during a first anamorphic phase, segments were accreted, while in the subsequent epimorphic phase, segmentation did not proceed further despite continued growth. Size increment during the anamorphic phase was targeted and followed Dyar's rule, a geometric progression typical of many arthropods. We consider alternative hypotheses for the control of the switch from anamorphic to epimorphic phases of development.

This general problem applies, for example, to migrant birds occupying territories in the spring and to precopula in crustaceans where males grab females before they molt and become receptive. Previous work has produced conflicting predictions. Theory on migrant birds predicts that the strongest competitors should often arrive first, whereas some models of mate guarding have predicted that the strongest competitors wait and then simply usurp a female from a weaker competitor. We build a general model of resource guarding that allows varying the ease with which takeovers occur. The model is phrased in terms of mate-guarding crustaceans, but the same logic can be applied to other forms of resource acquisition where priority plays a role but takeovers might be possible too. The race to secure breeding positions can lead to strong competitors (large males) taking females earliest, even though this means accepting a lower-quality female. Paradoxically, this means that small males, which have fewer breeding opportunities, are more choosy than larger ones. Such solutions are found when takeovers are impossible. The easier the takeovers and the higher the rate of finding guarded resources, the more likely are solutions where guarding durations are short, where strong competitors begin guarding only just before breeding, and where they do this by usurping the resource. The relationship between an individual's competitive ability and its timing of resource acquisition can also be nonlinear if takeovers are moderately common; if this is the case, then males of intermediate size guard the longest.",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Crustaceans | ESS | Guarding criterion | Mate guarding | Mating dynamics | Takeovers,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,129,14970925,NA,NA

Nevertheless, senescence has been documented in some natural populations, mostly in birds and mammals. Here we report on a comparative study of senescence in two natural populations of guppies (Poecilia reticulata). We document senescence as an age-specific increase in mortality rate, with use of mark-recapture studies and implementation of program MARK for analysis of such observations. Extrinsic mortality was controlled for by choosing populations that experience low rates of predation because they coexist with only a single piscine predator (Rivulus hartii). These populations differ in their evolutionary history because one was native to such a site whereas the other was introduced to a site that previously contained no guppies. The source of the introduced guppies was a high-predation population downstream below a barrier waterfall. Theory predicts that the guppies derived from a high-predation locality should experience senescence at an earlier age than the native low-predation population; however, the historical differences among these populations are also confounded with everything else that differs among the two localities. We found that females from a natural low-predation population have delayed senescence compared with the recently established population and hence that the differences among localities in senescence conform to theoretical predictions. The males from natural low-predation environments also had lower overall mortality rates, but contrary to predictions, the pattern of senescence for males did not differ between populations. The difference between the sexes is potentially attributable to two factors that lower the statistical power for distinguishing differences in the age-specific acceleration of mortality in males. One factor is that males have higher mortality rates, so fewer survive to advanced ages. A second is that we had a greater ability to discriminate among older age classes in females. We also found that the introduced population sustained a higher rate of disease than the native low-predation population. Such disease may represent a confounding factor in our comparison, but it may also reflect one of the trade-offs inherent in the life-history differences of these populations.",59,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Evolution of senescence | Guppy | Mortality rate estimation | Poecilia reticulata | Predation | Senescence,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,132,14767836,NA,NA

Purely neutral community models that assume functional equivalence among species are incapable of explaining this pattern because body size is the key determinant of functional differences between species. Several niche-based explanations have been offered, but none of them is completely satisfactory. Here we develop a simple model that unites a neutral community model with niche-based theory to explain the relationship. In the model, species of similar size are assumed to belong to the same size guild. Within a size guild, all individuals are equivalent in their competition for resources, sensu Hubbell's neutral community model; they have the same speciation rate and dispersal capacities. Between size guilds, however, the total number of individuals, the speciation rate, and the dispersal capacities differ, but using known allometric scaling laws for these properties, we can describe the differences between size guilds. Our model predicts that species richness reaches an optimum at an intermediate body size, in agreement with observations.

We used meta-analysis to review published studies of the Trivers-Willard hypothesis within ungulates and to assess the overall level of empirical support for the hypothesis. Overall, data from 37 studies of 18 species suggested a weak but significant positive correlation between maternal condition and sex ratio (r = +0.09). However, average effect size differed markedly between different categories of studies. Studies using measures of maternal condition that were taken preconception and on the basis of behavioral dominance provided strong evidence for a relationship between maternal condition and the sex ratio (r = +0.17-0.25). In contrast, studies that used morphological or physiological measures of condition that were measured postconception provided little or no evidence for a relationship between maternal condition and sex ratio (r = +0.05-0.06). There are several reasons to suggest that data collected postconception and relying on morphological measures of condition are less likely to capture variables that cause selection for biased sex allocation. In addition, we found that the relationship between sex ratio and maternal condition depended on life-history characteristics; relationships were stronger when sexual size dimorphism was more male biased and when gestation periods were longer.

We next evaluate the hypotheses that foraging strategy and competitive ability are functions of WDL, using our data in combination with those of published sources. Variation in hummingbird behavior cannot be easily classified using WDL and instead is correlated with a diversity of morphological and physiological traits. Evaluating selection pressures on hummingbird wings will require moving beyond wing and body mass measurements to include the assessment of the aerodynamic forces, power requirements, and power reserves of hovering, forward flight, and maneuvering.

We explored the influence of predation on lek dynamics using a stochastic dynamic game model based on the lek-breeding greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and its principal avian predator, the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos). The model predicts time-dependent male lek attendance as a function of factors affecting both mating success (female arrival rate, male numbers, and social status) and predation risk (eagle arrival rate and group size). Dominant males are predicted to arrive sooner and leave later than subordinates, especially if mating skew is high, predation risk is low, or the relationship between lek size and female arrival rate is weak. Both high mean levels of predation risk and small lek size should reduce lek attendance, but the relative tendency of predators to attack large versus small leks has little influence on predicted lekking behavior. Field observations confirmed the predicted effects of female arrival rate, lek size, male dominance, and weather-dependent predator arrival rates on lek departure times. Predicted effects of female arrival rates and male dominance on seasonal lek attendance were also supported.

For each population, we measured habitat light characteristics and quantified signal design by measuring the spectral and total reflectance and transmittance of the dewlap. We used these data to calculate dewlap detectability using an empirically based model of signal detection probability. We found that populations from mesic and xeric conditions occupy two distinct habitats with respect to light intensity and spectral quality and that dewlap design has diverged between populations in a way that increases signal detectability in each habitat. The major difference in dewlap design was in total reflectance and transmittance, making dewlaps from xeric habitats darker and dewlaps from mesic habitats brighter. Furthermore, dewlap detection decreased significantly when a dewlap from a xeric habitat is detected under the spectral conditions of a mesic habitat. The converse is true for a dewlap from a mesic habitat. We propose that sensory drive has promoted divergence in dewlap design in distinct habitat light conditions, and we discuss the possibility that selection might promote early stages of reproductive isolation as a by-product of selection on dewlap design to distinct habitat light conditions.",178,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Anolis | Natural selection | Population divergence | Sensory drive | Signal detectability | Speciation,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,141,14767834,NA,NA

Although this statistical framework provides a potentially unifying approach to quantitative-genetic and phylogenetic analysis, the model has been applied infrequently because of technical difficulties with parameter estimation. We recommend a reparameterization of the model that eliminates some of these difficulties, and we develop a new estimation algorithm for both the original maximum likelihood and new restricted maximum likelihood estimators.

Though our empirical knowledge of the genetic mechanisms of plant domestication is still relatively limited, there exists a large body of theory that offers a host of hypotheses on the genetics of domestication. Two of these that have not been addressed concern the role of recombination in the process of domestication. The first predicts an increase in recombination rate through domestication, while the second argues that recombination rate should serve as a preadaptation to domestication. This study makes use of data on chiasma frequencies available from almost a century of plant cytogenetical literature to test these two hypotheses. The results support the hypothesis that domestication selects for an increase in recombination, and in rejecting the preadaptation hypothesis, they suggest directions for future research into the possibility of preadaptation to domestication.",70,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Chiasma frequency | Domestication | Preadaptation | Recombination,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,143,14767840,NA,NA

These positive responses of plants to herbivory have been called ""grazing optimization."" One possible mechanism of these paradoxical phenomena is the nutrient cycling promoted by herbivory. This article models the nutrient cycling hypothesis and analyzes the evolution of plant production and reproduction enhanced by herbivores, using dynamic optimization of plant phenology. Especially when there is nutrient competition among plant individuals or nutrient transportation by herbivores, we can apply the concept of evolutionary stability for the dynamic optimization. Two types of plant responses, long-term and short-term, are examined. Long-term response is an adaptive response for a given level of herbivory pressure, while short-term response is a nonadaptive one to various levels of herbivory, different from the level to which the plant is adapted. The analysis shows that both long-term and short-term grazing optimizations in primary production can occur under poor nutrient conditions and high nutrient recycling rates. However, grazing optimization in reproduction occurs under the same conditions but requires further conditions. In particular, long-term reproductive grazing optimization occurs only when nutrient competition exists among plant individuals. Accordingly, the present analysis revealed the following points concerning grazing optimization: poor nutrient condition is necessary, nutrient competition between plant individuals can promote optimization, and the native condition of the plant is important in the short-term response.",26,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Dynamic optimization | Grazing optimization | Model | Nutrient cycle | Plant phenology,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,144,14767843,NA,NA
