Model parameters of prey encounter rates and prey handling times were quantified as functions of fish size, prey density, and prey size through a series of laboratory feeding experiments using the bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus). Results of these experiments show both searching ability and prey handling efficiency to increase with increasing fish size. Predictions of prey size selection and optimal habitat use based upon maximizing energetic gain were then examined in a small Michigan lake for three size classes of bluegills. Bluegills >100 mm standard length were highly size selective in their feeding and their diets closely matched predictions of an optimal diet model. From two estimates of relative prey visibilities I show that these fish selected larger prey items than would be predicted if prey were consumed ""as encountered."" Habitat use of large bluegills was also shown to maximize foraging return as fish switched from utilizing vegetation-living prey to utilizing open-water zooplankton as relative foraging profitabilities in the two habitats changed across the summer. Bluegills <100 mm standard length were restricted in their habitat use, remaining in or near the vegetation despite demonstrated increases in foraging return available in the open-water habitat.

Response of bees to different plant species was determined by the density of foraging bees on the flowers of each species at a given time. If bees are optimal foragers, preference should reflect the per- flower reward value of species, characterized by nectar production rates (NPR's). The bees' preference for species was very similar to the relative magnitudes of their NPR's.

Adults of all 3 species are similar in appearance, apart from color and pattern differences. Amphibolurus decresii and A. vadnappa are partially sympatric, but is found on rocks which are predominantly pinkish yellow, whereas A. vadnappa is found on rocks which are dark reddish brown. Each species appears camouflaged on its respective mineral type. Amphibolorus fionni is allopatric from the other species and exhibits variable coloration in its 'substrate races'. It has a distinctive color pattern of its own, but resembles one or the other species in areas where rocky habitats are correspondingly similar. Studies of reflectivity of lizard skin demonstrate that the dorsal coloration on the back, tail, and legs is relatively labile. Lability is correlated with latitude, southern populations being darker and possessing less lability than northern populations. Both dorsal and dorsolateral coloration are believed to have camouflage functions, but the latter appears more important.

Seasonal changes in the niche relationships of Anolis gundlachi, A. evermanni and A. stratulus included a winter season decrease in spatial overlap and spatial niche widths and an expansion of the prey size and prey taxa components of the food niche during the winter. However, compared to anoles in more seasonal environments at Maricao and Guanica in SW Puerto Rico, anoles in the relatively aseasonal Luquillo forest exhibited greater niche stability between seasons and greater niche overlap during both seasons. At Maricao and Guanica, spatial niche widths and spatial overlap also decreased during the winter dry season but to a much greater extent than at Luquillo. Data on seasonal changes in food abundance, food consumption and reproductive condition suggest that food competition is more intense during the prolonged dry seasons at Maricao and Guanica. Thus within Anolis communities, spatial overlap and spatial niche widths may be an inverse function of food competition, and the degree of seasonal change in niche relationships may be directly correlated with the magnitude of seasonal fluctuations in food supply. Loss rates of anoles from Luquillo suggested high rates of predation. Greater predation pressure may explain the generally higher levels of niche overlap among anoles in stable environments compared to more variable environments.-from Author",40,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,NA,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,28,NA,NA,NA,NA
