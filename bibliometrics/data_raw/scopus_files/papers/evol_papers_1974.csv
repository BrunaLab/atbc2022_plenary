The two mutants did not mate randomly initially. Selection significantly increased sexual isolation in both experiments. There was no change in sexual isolation in the control line in the light but in the dark a slight decrease in sexual isolation occurred. Choice tests showed that selection changed mating preferences. They also showed that selection speeded up all homogamic matings in the LS experiment and homogamic vg matings in the DS experiment. Quantitative analysis of male and female behavior revealed the underlying causes of changed mating preferences and faster mating. In the LS experiment male courtship became more stimulating because percentage licking of both males and percentage licking plus vibration of e males increased. Females became less receptive in heterogamic crosses and showed this by increasing repelling behavior. Breaks were reduced in homogamic matings probably because of the males improved courtship combined with the females unchanged behavior towards her own male. In the DS experiment vg males increased percentage licking when courting vg females. E females increased repelling behavior when courted by vg males. Percentage break was reduced in vg homogamic matings probably because of the male's improved courtship plus the e females' changed behavior which meant that vg males soon concentrated their attention on vg females. In the control line in red light percentage licking of vg males was increased toward e and vg females. This change was attributed to natural selection. Female discrimination and changed female responses were the most important causes of increased sexual isolation in both the LS and DS experiments. Changed male behavior contributed to faster mating.",43,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA,NA

Five different levels of evolutionary divergence can be recognized in these taxa. The average amounts of genetic differentiation, D, between populations are for each level as follows: geographic populations, 0.031 ± 0.007; subspecies, 0.230 ± 0.016; semispecies, 0.226 ± 0.033; sibling species, 0.581 ± 0.039; morphologically different species, 1.056 ± 0.068. D may be interpreted as the number of electrophoretically detectable allelic substitutions per locus that have accumulated during the evolution of two taxa since they separated from a common ancestor. The model of geographic speciation recognizes two stages in the formation of species. In the first stage, allopatric populations become genetically sufficiently different for natural selection to favor the development of reproductive isolation between the populations if they were to come into geographic contact. The second stage occurs after sympatry when reproductive isolation is being completed. Two pairs of subspecies in the D. willistoni group represent populations in the first stage of speciation. On the average about 0.23 allelic substitutions per locus have accumulated in the separate evolutions of the subspecies. The second stage of the speciation process can be recognized in the semispecies of D. paulistorum. Genetic differentiation is not significantly greater, on average, between semispecies than between subspecies. Thus, these results indicate that a substantial degree of genetic differentiation occurs during the first stage of speciation, but little change is required during the second stage when reproductive isolation is being completed. Species are independent evolutionary units, and thus they continue to diverge genetically through time. In spite of their morphological similarity, any two sibling species have accumulated, on the average, about 0.58 allelic substitutions per locus during their separate evolutions; and about twice as many allelic substitutions have accumulated in the evolution of morphologically distinguishable species.",167,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,7,NA,NA

One of the populations was subjected to mild selection for DDT resistance, one to stringent selection, and the third served as the unselected control. After 15 months of selection the two experimental populations did not differ in level of resistance, but they were some 50 to 80 times as resistant as the control. Tests of the homozygous viability of second chromosomes from the control were conducted during the period in which resistance was developing in the experimental populations. At the end of the selection period samples of chromosomes from the control and experimental populations showed no significant differences in the frequencies of recessive lethals, nor were there marked differences in the rates of allelism. Low interpopulational lethal allelism indicated that nearly unique contents of these factors existed in the populations after 20 months. That the lethals did not play a role in DDT resistance was seen in the low allelism of lethals from the resistant populations. Higher viabilities of intrapopulational lethal chromosome heterozygotes as compared to interpopulational combinations was interpreted as an indication that coadaptation of the genes in each of the populations had taken place. There was no evidence that the lethals present in the populations had a positive viability effect within the coadapted genotypes.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,15,NA,NA
