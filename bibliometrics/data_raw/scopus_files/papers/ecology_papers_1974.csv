In the smelter location, soil zinc concentration was 385 times higher, cadmium content 37 times higher, and lead content 16 times higher. No evidence for the evolution of heavy metal tolerance could be detected in 2 X 2 experiments in which genotypes from both locations were grown on both soils. Growth of genotypes from both locations was inhibited on the heavy metal soil, but not to the extent that would be expected from previous studies of heavy metal effects. This is the first case described in which a species has been able to colonize heavy metal soils in the absence of the evolution of tolerant races.",87,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,1

Twenty samples were collected and 10 slides inserted in the soil at each of 10 points along a radiation gradient varying from less than 1 to over 1800 R/day 2 cm below ground. A minimum of 55 fungi were selected at random off the isolation plates prepared from each of the 200 soil samples, and 5 slides per dose were examined. The 15,770 isolates obtained were distributed among 267 taxa. Subsurface radiation levels in the vegetated area ranged from less than 1 R/day in the undisturbed forest to 20 R/day under an almost pure stand of Carex pennsylvania. These exposures only indirectly affected the microfungi, producing minor distributional changes. Species diversity remained virtually constant throughout the area. The mean propagule level was approximately 100,000/g dry soil. Moniliaceous and mucoraceous fungi producing upright, morphologically complex reproductive structures characterized the population. The eight most abundant fungi, typically isolated throughout the world from podzolic soils supporting conifer hardwood forests, were Penicillium terlikowskii, Mortierella isabellina, Aspergillus parvulus, Oidiodendron tenuissimum, P. nigricans, P. spinulosum, Monocillium humicola v. brunneum, and Mortierella nana. These eight taxa represented 71% of the isolates but only 5% of the species. A transitional zone devoid of higher plants except for a few scattered clumps of carex had a subsurface radiation level of 70 R/day. Species diversity was greatest in this region, where mesic and pioneer populations overlapped. The mean number of fungi was approximately 16,000/g dry soil. Only a few dominant forms of low density occurred in this area, notably, P. funiculosum, P. purpurogenum, Trichoderma viride, P. terlikowskii and Monocillium humicola v. brunneum. Distributional patterns of the microfungi correlated with radiation gradient in the Devastated Zone, a region with no living higher plants. At subsurface radiation exposures of 175-1,250 R/day, no species was abundant and the mean number of propagules was reduced to approximately 3,000/g dry soil. Coefficient of community (CC) values and morphological complexity decreased as exposures to radiation increased. CC50 occurred at 1,600 R/day. Species diversity was reduced but remained constant along the gradient as shifting groups of more and more resistant forms occurred, culminating in a population dominated by the morphologically simple yeasts. A subsurface radiation level of 1,830 R/day, the maximum dose in this study, reduced the fungi to a mean level of only 500 propagules/g dry soil. The population contained yeasts but was characterized by intensely melanized extremely slow growing, sterile isolates capable of producing only a rudimentary pseudomycelium. It is postulated that these are the most radioresistant of the fungi isolated and that resistance is related to their pigmentation. The contact slide results were comparable to those obtained by the dilution plate method except that basidiomycetes, not isolated by the latter, were the most radiosensitive fungi. Their dicaryotic hyphea were not observed on any slides receiving over 500 R/day.",13,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,2

Of the total 137Cs input, 97%, 88%, and 85%, respectively, remained in the forest, the grass, and the grass crop watersheds. The concentration of 137Cs per unit area in the reservoir sediments was 2.8, 3.8, and 4.0 times that of the soils from the respective contributing watersheds, indicating that the reservoirs are acting as ''traps'' for 137Cs. Of the 137Cs eroded from the three contributing watersheds, 57%, 38%, and 25% was found in the respective sediments.
