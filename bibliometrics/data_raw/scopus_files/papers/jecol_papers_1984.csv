Few seedlings of the actively-awned species Dichelachne micrantha and Themeda australis were observed, but all germinated from diaspores buried beneath the soil surface and only where the soil was not surface crusting. Movements of the active awn probably propel the diaspore into cracks in the soil surface. Seedlings of passively-awned species arose either from diaspores that were found in a standing orientation with their callused ends anchored in the soil or from diaspores that lay unanchored and almost horizontal on the soil surface. Germinating unawned diaspores were either lying on the surface or buried. Spreading passive awns serve to rotate a falling diaspore into a position that increases its chances of landing in a standing orientation with the embedded antrosely-bristled callus providing the necessary anchorage. Unawned diaspores achieve anchorages as a result of passive burial; dormancy delays the germination of many of these until effective burial is achieved. Following a forest fire, a 3-fold increase in the density of grass seedlings was recorded and the relative abundance of seedlings from unappendaged diaspores rose dramatically. Since the morphology of appendaged diaspores promotes their germination on or near the soil surface, many such diaspores are destroyed by fire. In contrast, burial of unappendaged diaspores not only achieves anchorage but protects the seed from the extreme temperatures generated in a fire. Fire may release many of these seeds from dormancy.-from Author",105,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,10,NA,NA

Hypotheses regarding the nature of successional convergence were tested using data for tree and herb abundance from upland forest stands on the North Carolina piedmont which were grouped in five successional age classes.

This correlation was greatest in the intermediate-age (40-60- and 60-80-yr-old) pines and in the hardwood stands, and lowest in old pine stands. Thus, there is a shift in species composition toward that characteristic of climax, but it is probably not monotonic. Beta-diversity was highest in the hardwoods and lowest among the pines.

About 1200 BP non-forest vegetation below the treeline was confined to waterlogged areas and human impact was not significant. Local forest clearance started >700 BP but the major clearance at most sites occurred within a few years of the 300 yr old tephra fall. More recent clearance has again been localized and shrubs have increasingly invaded the secondary tussock grasslands. Forest clearance was caused by fires lit by man.

Males resume growth shortly after the autumn rains, at least 1.5 months in advance of females. Mean length of the growing period was significantly longer for males. The flowering period lasts for March-September for females and nearly the entire year for males, with a peak in May-June. The flowering peak of males encompassed that of females in all years. Mean length of the flowering period was significantly longer for males. Ripe fruits are produced throughout the year, with a major peak in winter and a minor one in spring. The phenological pattern of O. quadripartita seems to be shared only by species from tropical forests or by others that, like itself, are survivors of an old evergreen tropical flora currently living in Mediterranean refugia. Sexual differences in phenology are interpreted in terms of the constraints imposed on the organization of the female annual cycle by fruit development and maturation. Males are relieved of this function and allocate the available time among fewer activities.-from Author",19,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,64,NA,NA

Computer simulations of population densities predict that Potentilla reptans (continental) should also become extinct, after a longer period of time at the same altitude. Failure to extend the altitudinal range is here a result of the combined influences of low seed germination, winter survival and seed production. Observations of germination, plant survival and seed production in the arctic-alpine species Oxyria digyna and Saxifraga stellaris provide no clue to their absence from the Welsh lowlands. Slow leaf area expansion resulting in low competitive ability is likely to be the key to their restriction.-from Authors",17,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,65,NA,NA

The most successful seedling establishment followed autumn burns. Summer burns were often less favourable and had a greater variability from fire to fire. Winter and spring burns lead to very poor seedling establishment, mostly well below replacement levels, so that successive fires in these seasons would rapidly lead to local extinction. Density-dependent regulation of seedling populations is apparently due to the reduction of the reproductive effort, and thus seed reserves, per individual with increased pre-burn crowding. -from Authors",110,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,67,NA,NA

Early season cohorts completed their life cycle during 1 growing season; late-season cohorts required 2 growing seasons.

Differences in the time of germination are not responsible for differences in adult size, even when early-germinating plants have as many as 35 days more for growth than late germinators.
