Features of optimal signal detection theory are here incorporated into traditional optimal diet theory to synthesize a more general theoretical framework that allows one to make predictions on the basis of constrained predator perceptual abilities. Predictions include frequency-dependent partial preferences for prey types defined by profitability, but not for types defined by appearance. Frequency-dependent partial preferences can create or enhance sigmoid functional responses, which can, in turn, stabilize randomly mixed model-mimic complexes. -Author",70,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

The model describes prey fitness in terms of the amount of energy available for reproduction over a lifetime and describes predator fitness in terms of the net energy intake rate of the adult predator. Both species are considered to be age- and size-structured. Predation is size-dependent, and the predator is assumed to select prey in a manner that maximizes its net energy intake. Two evolutionary traits of the prey are considered: the age-dependent allocation of energy between reproduction and growth (X1) and the allocation of energy between overall growth and extra growth in shell thickness (X2). Results of the model are described in terms of prey phenotypic fitness landscapes as functions of predation intensity. These landscapes consist of prey fitness plotted as a function of the parameters, X1 and X2, governing the energy allocation strategies. As predation intensity increases from zero to a high value, the initial single optimum for prey fitness changes to a landscape of 3 local optima, representing alternative strategy types. -Authors",35,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA,NA

The diet of Texas great egrets consisted almost entirely of very small individual fish that were delivered to the chicks in discrete boluses. By the age of c2 wk, elder chicks could intercept most boluses and thus monopolize the food. This monopolization was greatly enhanced by fighting and intimidating younger siblings. By contrast, great blue heron prey tended to be too large for the young to intercept, which made effective monopolization much more difficult.

If more than one prey may be taken (class 2) and if the bout length is known, then selectivity exhibited within the bout depends on the relative value of available prey. If prey are similar in rank, then the forager should generalize. If prey differ markedly in rank, then selectivity should decrease as the time left in the bout decreases.

The fiber fraction of plant material is digested slowly and exclusively by microbial symbiotes.

With decreasing body size, the increasing rate at which energy must be produced per unit volume of the rumen cannot be matched by a concomitant increase in the fermentation rate of forages.

Ornithopod dinosaurs were dominant medium- to large-sized reptilian herbivores of the late Mesozoic, despite the presence of contemporary mammals.

Females invest a large portion of their energy in reproductive physiology, and their reproductive success should be limited by their ability to acquire food and convert it into weaned offspring. Males invest much less energy in reproductive effort and do not participate in parental care; thus, their reproductive success should be limited by access to females. Territoriality in females should thus be food-based, that in males, female-based. 2) There are 3 main dietary categories for microtines; fruit-seed-fungus, forbs, and grasses. In general, fruits and seeds (in forest habitat) and forbs (in meadows) are patchily distributed, relatively sparse and poorly renewable. Since patchy distribution of a resource increases its defensibility, and since sparseness and poor renewability increase the costs of allowing exploitation by intruders, females relying on these 2 diets should be territorial. Grass in meadows is evenly distributed, abundant and highly renewable. Thus, females of species that rely largely on grasses should be nonterritorial. 3) When females are territorial they tend to be hyperdispersed; when females are nonterritorial they should be clumped in distribution. Since evenly spaced females are difficult to defend, males territoriality should not occur in species showing female territoriality.

A new hypothesis based upon prey vulnerability is introduced to explain differences in degree of raptor dimorphism. The prey vulnerability hypothesis maintains that lower encounter rates and capture successes resulting from the highly developed predator detection and escape abilities of avian prey may lower the availability of avian prey in comparison to nonavian prey. This would result in bird-eating raptors receiving a lower net energy intake per unit time spent foraging than non-bird-eating raptors.

Subadult males should delay breeding only if there is a large enough difference in the probability of mortality between those subadults who attempt to breed and those who do not. The size of the necessary mortality difference increases as potential life span decreases. Subadult males should make some competitive effort to facultatively exploit available reproductive opportunities, so long as the additional probability of mortality does not exceed the threshold value. Subadult plumage would evolve in those species to further reduce mortality from direct competition with older males, probably by signaling subordinance or mimicry of females. Delayed plumage maturation is thus viewed as a component of facultatively delayed breeding. Although reproductive maturation is not delayed, full reproductive effort is. Comparison of the group of strongly dichromatic passerine species that have subadult plumage with the group of strongly dichromatic species that lack this plumage revealed that species with subadult plumage tend to be larger, indicating that life span is an important factor because large species tend to live longer. There also should be a correlation between degree of resemblance and life span.

Evidence have argues against strong phylogenetic constraint at the ordinal level on the patterns of covariation in life history traits among squamate reptiles. The finding of significant effects of family-level taxonomy on 4 life history variables (clutch size, mode of reproduction, brood frequency, age at maturity), with the effects of size removed, suggest that tests of historical hypotheses within the squamates should be limited to comparisons at the family level, or below. After the removal of correlations with female body length, we found significant residual variation at the order, family and genus levels for clutch size and age at maturity in direct opposition to Stearns' major conclusion.

Woody species occupying ecologically equivalent positions in the forest midstory must depend heavily on sunflecks because up to 80% of the light penetrating the forest interior is this kind of direct-beam illumination. Immediately beneath the canopy, the light field (integrated over the daily sun cycle) is characterized by a high horizontal variance, because any point is either in a gap and directly illuminated or under a crown and continuously shaded. Farther down in the forest interior the horizontal variance becomes greatly diminished because the expanding cones of light beneath each gap eventually intersect. Where the cones of light from alternate gaps intersect, the light field becomes horizontally uniform. Plants of the woody middle stratum should grow up to, but not exceed, the upper limit of the horizontally uniform light field. The position of the upper limit of the horizontally uniform light field can be predicted from measurements of the canopy and the angular distribution of light gaps overhead. Such predictions for 5 climax stands in the SE USA agreed quite closely with the median height of trees composing the mid-story of these stands. The shapes of tree crowns can be expected to vary adaptively with the systematic latitudinal decrease in the the sun above the horizon. Consequently, tree crowns at high latitudes are narrowly conical in profile, but those in tropical latitudes tend to be planar or shallowly dome-shaped. As a result, direct light is admitted to high-latitude forests only at sharply inclined angles that do not permit the establishment of a woody midstory. By contrast, light is able to penetrate the canopy of tropical forests at relatively shallow angles, allowing development of a 2nd tree layer closely beneath the crowns of the first. The vertical dimension of plant species diversity thus seems to be controlled by adaptive responses to physical parameters of the latitudinal gradient. -from Author",143,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,72,NA,NA

Parental investment at birth is less in marsupials (litter weight averages 0.09% of female body mass) than in eutherians (average 15.5%), but total maternal effort is comparable in the two groups, since the litter weight at weaning is similar for metatherians and eutherians of equivalent adult weight. Metabolic rates does not seem to constrain reproductive adaptations. Resorption of postimplantation embryos in placental mammals is not closely linked to environmental conditions. Embryonic resorption, when it does occur, is more costly and risky than terminating reproduction by cessation of lactation.
