F. americana (the least shade-tolerant species) showed the greatest proportional increase in growth after the hurricane and maintained the highest growth rates several decades after disturbance. B. alleghaniensis, A. saccharum and F. grandifolia had very similar growth responses. Smaller trees had a greater proportional increase in growth than larger trees following the hurricane, especially for F. americana.

Palaeoecological, dendrochronological and historical studies of a primary woodland were undertaken. At present the old-age structure of the forest and dominance by shade-tolerant Tsuga canadensis gives the appearance of a mature and stable community. The woodlot has changed profoundly in structure and composition during the past 300 yr as a result of human activity, natural disturbance and forest development. The pre-settlement forest comprised old-growth northern hardwoods, hemlock and Pinus strobus (white pine). Frequent cutting resulted in the development of a sprout chestnut forest that persisted until a decrease in cutting and the onset of chestnut blight allowed the emergence of hemlock as the dominant species. The modern forest, although seemingly mature and stable, is unlike any preceeding vegetation and is a poor analogue for the pre-settlement forest.

The new hypothesis accounts for completely opposite kinds of plants being armed, eg particularly slow-growing and particularly fast-growing plants, or the deciduous species in one system and the evergreen in another. The new hypothesis is effectively forecasting the distribution of poisonous chemicals in plants. Parallels and differences between studies on competition among plants and competition among animals are considered. The term ""inhibition' is used to cover deleterious (non-parasitic) effects of one organism on another. Allocation to roots and its significance for water uptake is considered, especially for semi-desert perennials. Intensity of inhibition arising from competition for water, averaged over time, is likely to increase as rainfall decreases until a point is reached where plants hardly compete with each other. Alternating periods of inhibition arising from competition for water are seen as alternating with periods of inhibition arising from competition for nutrients or light, not just in semi-deserts but in forests and grasslands too.

The vascular bog flora consists of 81 species in this region. Four major floristic regions distinguished by DCA correspond to the geographic zonation of bog landforms. Each of these floristic regions is characterized by a different mean value for species richness. Raised bogs in the southern-continental floristic region (I) contain <20 species and have the most impoverished vascular floras in eastern North America. In the transitional-continental (II) and northern-continental (III) regions, the bog flora is slightly larger, although the mean number of species remain <26. The richest bog floras are found in the maritime region (IV), where species richness declines along a latitudinal gradient from 50 species in the south to 32 in the north. The relationship of species richness to various environmental factors was analysed. The most important factors are mean annual precipitation (MAP) and annual freezing degree-days (FDD) with a base temperature of 0°C. Factors that are also significantly related to species richness are mean annual temperature (MAT), the number of wet-to-dry habitats, and the concentration of Mg and Na in the surface water. A climatic threshold of 1000 mm of annual precipitation and 1000 freezing degree-days separates the floristically rich maritime bogs from the floristically impoverished bogs of northern and continental regions. CCA ordination identifies two groups of species on the basis of their response to these environmental factors. Species that are generally restricted to the maritime region (IV) have weighted averages that are above average for MAP and MAT, but below average for FDD. Species that are common to all bogs or that are more continental in their distribution have the reverse relationship. The tolerance of the regional bog flora to the acidic, anoxic rooting zone changes across this climatic gradient. One third of the species that grow on bogs in the southern maritime region are restricted to fens or mineral uplands in continental or northern regions. This shift in ecological tolerance may be related to slower rates of peat accumulation on the maritime bogs, longer time available for the evolution of local tolerant populations on maritime bogs, or a physiological adaptation to the maritime climate. -from Author",81,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,8

The resistance to movement is the ratio of the force due to gravity to that developed by the wind on a given reference area. B was used in a logistic regression to predict the percentage of seeds unmoved (remaining) on a surface with increasing wind velocity. Regressions had steeper slopes the greater the resistance to seed movement. The resistance equation should be species-independent, assuming a geometrically similar shape, and was so for the smoothest surface but not always so on the remaining surfaces. The percentage of seeds that will be unmoved on different surfaces for different time intervals was estimated by determining the return time in a natural environment of the B threshold velocities. Lower velocities occur more frequently than higher velocities. Return times were calculated for Calgary, Alberta. Heavy seeds moved less frequently than smaller seeds. On rougher surfaces, seeds remained stationary longer because the threshold velocity is larger and also the return time of that velocity is longer. On smooth surfaces (particle sizes up to 750 μm), all seeds moved before adequate time had elapsed for germination. On rougher surfaces (particle sizes up to 2 mm) the distribution of the percentage of seeds remaining was positively skewed and the tail of the distribution declined more slowly. This tail defines seeds which are caught in microsites that have the highest probability of germinating. -from Authors",64,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,16

For both V. chamaedrys and V. montana, waterlogging had the more suppressive effect. Mean SLA in V. officinialis, calculated across the five irradiances, was the same between normally watered plants and those subject to drought. Droughts had no effect on LWR in either V. chamaedrys or V. montana whereas it was increased by waterlogging. In contrast, LWR in V. officinalis remained unaffected by waterlogging but was decreased by drought. Regression analysis demonstrated a positive linear relationship between root weight ratio (RWR) and irradiance. Root weight ratio also increased with decreasing soil water content and was, in fact, influenced primarily by water treatment. V. officinialis had the highest RWR and showed the greatest reduction in RWR under low irradiance. Overall, waterlogged V. chamaedrys suffered the largest reduction in RWR. Given its low RWR and high LAR and SLA, V. montana would be unable to optimize water use in environments in which low soil water potential was concurrent with high irradiance. In fact, V. montana suffered leaf chlorosis under these conditions. V. officinalis possesses a high RWR but low LAR and SLA and was tolerant of both waterlogging and drought, irrespective of irradiance. Of the three species, V. chamaedrys was least tolerant of waterlogging.

All the production parameters (RGR, relative leaf production rate, unit leaf rates), were higher in annuals. There were very few differences between the two life forms in biomass allocation to the different organs (except a higher allocation to sheaths in perennials). The specific leaf areas and the leaf area ratios were higher in annuals, whereas the dry-weight:fresh-weight ratios of all the organs were higher in perennials. These differences between annuals and perennials were almost systematic when the comparisons were made within a given genus, but not when they were made btween annuals and perennials in different genera. RGR was significantly correlated with: unit leaf rate, specific leaf area, leaf area ratio, dry-weight:fresh-weight ratio of the whole plant, and dry-weight:fresh-weight ratio of roots. RFR was not correlated with any of the biomass allocation parameters. The single factor that best explained differences in RGR was the specific leaf area. If, as has been hypothesized elsewhere, the annual life form is derived from the perennial one, the results presented here suggest that the same morphological changes have occurred repeatedly in different genera.

Germinable seeds were detected in appreciable numbers down to 6cm beneath the boundary of the F/O soil horizons in soil cores from mature heath vegetation on a blanket peat and peaty stagnopodzol. However, severe fires in which more than 10cm of peat is ignited will destroy all of the viable seed bank.

This paper reports the vegetation dynamics of the upslope and downslope fringes of vegetated patches (vegetation arcs) in the Chihuahuan Desert, Mexico. A colonization process developed in the upslope fringes: 1) species richness increased gradually to a peak, then decreased; 2) this peak coincided spatially with a change in life form and floristic dominance; and 3) communities with geometric-like distributions of abundance were replaced by communities with log-normal-like distributions of abundance. The peak of species richness moved upslope with a concomitant colonization of new space. Displacement of that peak, coupled with changes over time in the dominance of life forms and in the dominance-diversity relationships, provided additional evidence that a successional process of colonization develops. Long-term variations in floristic composition of the upslope quadrats were explained by time, position along the grid and rainfall, in order of decreasing importance. The bare area was colonized by short-lived perennials and/or facultative therophytes that almost never appear in the main body of the arcs. These species are gradually replaced by tussock grasses and seedlings of woody species which are the dominants in the main body of the arcs. In the downslope fringes, spatially non-contagious variation in species richnes, a spatially non-patterned variation in life-form dominance, and a constancy in geometric-like dominance-diversity relationships suggested that colonization processes were not developing. Rather, a process of senescence without new recruitments was occurring. A grassland community dominated by Hilaria mutica was coupled with a reduction in the abundance of that species. -from Author",126,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,35

The model is a logistic system in which K is the maximum number of modules per plant and r(t), the instant growth rate, is the capacity of modules to multiply under optimal conditions minus the costs of seasonality and flowering. Simulations included adverse seasons varying in severity and frequency, different timings of births and deaths of modules, different flowering times and reproductive efforts, different performances under optimal conditions, and different maximum plant sizes. Of all the parameters in the model, only the capacity to multiply and the combined costs of flowering and climatic severity had a substantial impact on early plant size. The rate of module accumulation slowed when plants got close to maximum size. Mathematically complex frequencies, timing and delays in mortality, growth and flowering can be disregarded. The capacity to multiply vegetatively (rv) should be measured in newly emerged seedlings growing under optimal conditions, before the onset of negative size-dependent factors.

A significant positive correlation was found between gap age and tree size. Active regeneration of the species was suggested by the high proportion (>35%) of young individuals. The population was highly clumped among young juvenile trees and became less aggregated as density within-gaps decreased among older trees. New and successful recruitment was restricted to recently formed (<3 yr since opened) and large (>100-m2) gaps. Oldest individuals (35 m high) were growing in 37-yr-old gaps. Tree height and stem diameter increased allometrically with a slope <1.5 in trees >0.3m tall. Whilst the number of leaves remains fairly constant before branching, It increases linearly as the number of branches increase. Changes in area per leaf during the life cycle yield an overall allometric pattern betweeen tree height and total leaf area. Seed and seedling mortality was >99%. Reduced light, falling debris, movement of rotting logs and soil dryness were important mortality factors in pre-productive stages. Oldest adults died standing, apparently due to senescence. Maximum life expectancy is reached when trees attain a non-suppressed canopy position (c20m high). Individuals showed high growth rates (a stem-diameter increments of up to 2cm yr-1). Growth-rate variation in juvenile stages seem to be related to high environmental heterogeneity. In adult stages the number of conspecifics growing in the same gap seems to affect diameter growth rate negatively. First reproduction occurred at c3yr of age, and increased with age. The most important environmental filter in the life-cycle of C. obtusifolia operates from the seedling to the juvenile stage. This finding does not support the suggestion that pioneer limitation to gap regeneration is determined during germination. A continuum of demographic life-cycles was found.

This result could arise from micro-habitat differentiation if the pools of species occurring in different micro-habitats were similar in size - these can be termed limited species pools. A new method of testing for niche limitation (patch model) overcomes the problem of limited species pools by using a null model that predicts the species richness of each quadrat from the local frequency of each species in a three-by-three cluster of quadrats centred on that quadrat. Using this method, some sites no longer exhibited significant niche limitation. Examination of the frequency distribution of quadrat richnesses reveals that the departure from the null model comprises of greater-than-expected frequency at or near the mode, with a deficit of both species-poor and species-rich quadrats, all features being significant for most sites examined, with no indication of skewing.

Diurnal variation in rates of acetylene reduction was greater at a young regrowth site than in mature Eucalyptus diversicolor forest. Variation in surface soil temperatures can explain much of the variation in acetylene reduction at the regrowth site.

Differences among stands in rates of nitrogen fixation are largely explained by differences in the proportion of B. laidlawiana in the understorey stratum. High but transient levels of extractable P found in soils following slash burns may have facilitated growth, nodule production and acetylene reduction rates in 1-yr-old legume seedlings.

Populations of S. cespitosa were gynodioecious. Hermaphrodite individuals showed a high selfing efficiency and low pollen:ovule ratios, consistent with a lower outbreeding rate. Saxifraa tenuis was hermaphrodite with some indication of sexual asymmetry. Pollen:ovule ratios were low, but the ability to set seed by autodeposition was lower in S. tenuis than in S. cespitosa. Saxifraga cernua was androdioecious, with some populations that contained only female-sterile individuals and other populations with both female-sterile and hermaphrodite individuals. The higher production of bulbils by female-sterile individuals, coupled with self-incompatibility in hermaphrodites, suggests a means by which androdioecy may be maintained in S. cernua, in the absence of differences in male reproductive success between gender classes. Although all three species showed significant inter-population differentiation, the morphometric distances between populations were not related to the geographic distances between populations. Most of the total diversity in leaf shape was accounted for by inter-population differentiation in all three species, with <1% of the diversity due to variation within individuals. The mosaic pattern of variation in the three saxifrages is consistent with a scenario of localized founder effect and may still reflect patterns of recruitment after the deglaciation of the study area c8200BP. -from Authors",46,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,52

In total 417 taxa were found; number of planktonic species was c300. Compared with the few dominants, most species were extremely rare. About 2/3 of the planktonic species were evenly distributed in time, the others exhibited temporal peaks. Based on population dynamics, 100 species (RF >2000-1, ie a relative frequency greater than 500 out of 100 000 specimens) are considered to characterize the community responses to changes in both major and minor resources set by the given pattern of environmental background. Fifteen of these 100 species might have had an allochthonous origin. About half of the 200 rare species are velocity specialists, about to grow rapidly in spatially and temporally randomly distributed, nutrient-rich microenvironments; the other 100 are termed the ""ecological memory' of the phytoplankton community. Memory is the capacity of past states or experiences to influence present or future rersponses of the community. The memory of the community comprises all the potential recruit-species which are not completely excluded because of spatial and temporal disturbances (heterogeneity). These species may out-compete the regular dominants of the most probable seasonal successional pattern if the competitive arena changes. -from Author",137,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,53

Bark pH and cation levels and direct and diffuse radiation inputs (hemispherical photography) were measured. The bark chemical factors and radiation estimates, respectively, showed many strong inter-correlations. Mean bark pH was 0.7 units higher and mean bark Mg and K were, respectively, 1.8 and 3.7 times higher in ash than in oak. Bark pH was positively correlated with bark Ca in oak, whereas in ash bark pH increased wtih girth but was unrelated to cation levels. In oak, bark Mg content declined with increasing altitude probably due to increasing insect defoliation of the canopy at higher altitudes. Bark pH or cation concentrations were positively correlated with soil exchangeable cation levels. Height on the bole and bark angle were the most important factors influencing epiphytes, probably determining the degree to which water is available on, or evaporated from, the bark surface. Bark pH correlated strongly with the second ordination axes but radiation was a relatively unimportant predictor of epiphyte community composition. Classification of the floristic data resulted in the recognition of eight quadrat groups. Species of the Lobarion pulmonariae alliance were distributed between two groups, one predominantly on oak, the other, with richer presentation of cyanobacterial lichens, on ash. Both groups were characteristic of bark with high pH and high cation levels, and were best developed in low-altitude sites, possibly indicating that acidic inputs may restrict their colonization at higher altitudes. Neither group was strongly associated with high light levels. -from Author",94,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,54

Some species can become mobile again should environmental conditions change. Shoot developmental patterns lie along a continuum from sessile to mobile, within which four broad classes of growth form can be recognized, based on the shape of the internodes: acaulescent, in which internodes are ten or more times as wide as long; caulescent, in which internodes are about ten times as long as wide; and flagellar, in which internodes are thirty or more times as long as wide. The set of shoot developmental pathways allowed by the genetic system of a species determines its overall foraging pattern. Environmentally mediated switching between pathways or alterations of rates or directions of progress within pathways allow adjustments to the foraging pattern.

Eleven environmental factors were measured at each transect and included in canonical correspondence analysis. The first three axes identified by CCA were associated with percentage vegetation cover (soil moisture), altitude, and mean S. keniodendron stand height, respectively. Analysis of mid-altitude slope transects revealed that mean height of S. keniodendron was the dominant environmental determinant of community composition.

Atmospheric N deposition in southern Sweden (high-N site) exceeds that in northern Sweden (low-N site) by about tenfold. Productivity of Sphagnum at the low-N site increased almost fourfold after additional N supply (4g N m-2yr-1), but no increase was found after additional P supply (0.4g P m-2yr-1). At the high-N site, P supply caused an almost threefold productivity increase, but N supply did not result in any productivity increase. At 2 g N m-2yr-1 the recovery of the supplied nitrogen in the Sphagnum carpet was not different for both sites (60% and 69% respectively) but at 4g N m-2yr -1, N recovery at the low-N site significantly exceeded that at the high-N site (73% and 47%, respectively). At the low-N site, the supplied P was not recovered, but at the high-N site the P recovery was 85% (intermediate P supply) and 100% (high P supply), respectively. It is suggested that a high atmospheric N supply may affect the carbon balance of ombrotrophic bogs, because productivity is under these circumstances not N-limited, but decomposition is probably increased by N high loads.

The selective advantages of greater seed dispersal ability in order to avoid high predation and pathogen attack and intraspecific competition at proximity to the parent tree is unclear. There were no strong and consistent relationships between seed and seedling spatial patterns of abundance for any of the five tree species studied. Dispersion patterns of seeds or seedlings varied between quadrats and did not necessarily correspond within any one quadrat: eg clumped seeds and randomly dispersed seedlings. Seeds of Betula alleghaniensis were positively associated, but its seedlings were negatively associated, with those of the other tree species. Good seed dispersal ability and highly specific germination microsites may partly explain these latter observations. Seed or seedling mortality for Acer saccharum was not strongly related to seed or seedling abundance, leading to rejection of the hypothesis that seed and seedling mortality was density dependent for this species on the study site. Seed mortality was spatially uncoupled from seedling mortality. Spatial and temporal variation in the relative importance of mortality factors (eg predation, pathogen attack and competition) on seeds and seedlings may account for these results. -from Author",80,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,59

Experiments with seeds from nine populations showed that most seeds were non-dormant at autumn temperatures (15°C), but a majority required light for germination. Moist chilling at winter temperatures (1°C) for four weeks induced secondary dormancy in about half the seeds, whilst moist incubation at superoptimal summer temperatures (30°C) for 2 wk removed most primary and chilling-induced secondary dormancy, prevented induction of dormancy by chilling, and reduced the proportion of light-requiring seeds. The effect of 1°C and 30°C treatments persisted or were increased through drying. A field retrieval experiment with seeds from three populations showed that dormancy induction during winter and release from dormancy during summer functioned as predicted to confine germination to periods during autumn or early spring and to permit year-to-year persistence of the seed bank. Because chilling causes the seed population to diverge into spring-germinable and spring-dormant fractions, its seed bank can persist from year to year without burial. There were no clear habitat-correlated differences in germination patterns among populations, and populations from contrasting habitats showed similar and appropriate field responses, suggesting that P. palmeri is a generalist in terms of germination pattern. -from Authors",22,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,60
