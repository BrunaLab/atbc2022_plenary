The inbreeding coefficient (F) shows fluctuations in time (476 to 194 x 10(-5) with an increase from 1888 to 1917, followed by a decrease in the last years but remains high in nonmigrant marriages. There is a high frequency of unions among second cousins. The endogamy percentage is high, greater in MC (80%) than in MNC (61%). Exogamy tends to diminish with time among both types of union. Effects of age distributions in the groups was not found. Marital and migrational distances are short and tend to become shorter in the final periods. There is a positive correlation (r = 0.71; p less than 0.05) between these distances in MC but not in MNC; distances are shorter in MC. Immigration is minimal and reduced to short distances. Post-marital movement is intense (37%) and involves greater distances. Emigratory behavior is identical in MC and MNC.",4,756975,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,1

Such concepts will lead to the adoption of alternate criteria and standards for a better assessment of malnutrition in children. Computation of the adequacy of the diet should be made as a function of the child's weight and not of his age (Sukhatme approach). The adoption of the Weight for Height and Height for Age criteria are recommended as a substitute for Weight for Age. The normal curves of weight and height of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS, USA) would be more accurate criteria. Systematic collections of weights and heights at the national level should be made, and the data processed by simple and rapid programs to discover and assess growth deficiencies. The philosophy and orientation, scientific basis, definition of target population, infrastructure and logistics of the nutrition intervention programs of Costa Rica, should be critically revised in the light of the present report.

Only 13 per cent of the children selected at random were covered by Social Development and Family Allowances programs which provide for two ""hot meals"" per day.

The decline could be related to improvements in the pattern of fetal growth. The present report analyses the birth weight of newborns from a random sample of all births in the Republic of Costa Rica during 1970 and 1975. While the average birth weight in that period was 3100 grams, the prevalence of low birth weight neonates decreased from 9 to 7 per cent in five years. The provinces of Limon and San Jose exhibited the highest frequency of low birth weight. Women 20 to 29 years old had babies with better or optimal body weight. Age, marital status and occupation of the mother appeared correlated with birth weight. A relationship between changes in fetal growth and changes in maternal, perinatal and neonatal mortality is apparent. The present situation of birth weight places Costa Rica among the countries in transition with a clearer perspective to attain an even higher infant survival in the near future. In this regard, several measures oriented toward prevention of low birth weight are recommended.",1,574658,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,5

The major problems involved in producing safe, wholesome and nutritious shellfish are primarily those of sanitation and adequate preservation of the foods until they finally reach the consumer. Therefore, it is essential that these products be produced and handled in a sanitary manner on a continuous basis. There are numerous codes of recommended handling practices for shellfish, most developed only after many technical conferences were organized to evaluate all of the available scientific evidence. Therefore, for producing safe shellfish in Venezuela, this publication recommends the adoption of these sanitary and handling practices, designed and tested by the faculty and staff personnel of Universidad Simón Bolívar.",0,751106,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,7
