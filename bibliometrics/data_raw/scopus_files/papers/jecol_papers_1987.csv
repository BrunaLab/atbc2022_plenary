Most of the stand has been largely untouched since 1902, and is dominated by trees dating from 1800-1900; this old growth stand is the subject of this paper. Until the 1970s the stand remained undisturbed, increasing in basal area and decreasing in density. Beech Fagus sylvatica steadily increased in dominance by faster growth, lower mortality or both than other trees. The shrub stratum was almost eliminated. Only on the precipitous lower slopes, where beech was uncommon and the stand was perpetually disturbed by trees falling from insecure footholds, were other species generally dominant and the shrub layer vigorous. In the early 1970s disease struck the elms Ulmus spp and thus further opened the woodland on the lower slopes. In the openings created by this and earlier falls, regeneration has been patchy. The severe summer drought of 1976 killed many mature beeches and greatly reduced the vigour of the rest. As a result, the canopy of the stand on the dry upper slope has disintegrated in patches and openings have been increased by windthrow. This process was still continuing in 1983, by which date regeneration had not started.

Four subdivisions of both Atlantic heather moor and boreal heather moor are recognized; distribution is determined principally by the inter-relationships between climate, topography and soil type. With increasing latitude and altitude, the northern or exposed subdivisions become dominant and occur over a wide range of soil types, as climate exerts the major influence. The herb-rich subdivisions of Atlantic and boreal heather moor are most strongly associated with brown forest soils, often on steep slopes. The dry subdivisions are found most often on humus-iron podzols and on peaty podzols where rainfall is low, and the moist subdivisions are associated with peaty podzols and peaty gleys on the gentlest slopes.

In coarse shingle seeds are often lost too deep for successful germination. moisture retention capacity is too low for high seed germination rates, establishment rates or germinated seeds are poor and established plants do not survive droughts. Even small quantities of fine shingle and/or humus greatly increase the moisture retention capacity over that of pure coarse shingle; seeds are retained and germinate more successfully, and plant establishment and drought survival are very much enhanced. Permanent establishment of vegetation cover seems possible. The patterns of vegetation are believed to be the result of the storm ridge deposition process, when fine material collects in ridges above the level at which the normal wave-sorting processes can remove the fine shingle content.

Plants from the woodland showed the same leaf-producing potential under high nutrient conditions whether they were in high or low light. Plants from the grassland showed greater leaf-producing potential with high nutrient and high light conditions. Woodland plants responded to low light combined with low nutrient conditions by allocating proportionately more biomass to ramet roots. Grassland plants responded by investing proportionately more biomass in roots of the parent rosette. As a reaction to low supplies of resources, grassland plants seem to consolidate them in the parent rosette, whereas woodland plants consolidate them in daughter ramets. Stolon elongation was a response neither to etiolation nor to 'foraging' for sparse nutrients.
