One possibility is that poisons have evolved in some mushroom species to deter their consumption by would-be fungivores before spore dispersal. If this is so, then one might expect poisonous mushrooms to signal their unprofitability in some way. In this study, we have conducted the first formal analysis of the ecological and morphological traits associated with edible and poisonous mushrooms in North America and Europe. Poisonous mushrooms do not tend to be more colorful or aggregated than edible mushrooms, but they are more likely to exhibit distinctive odors even when phylogenetic relationships are accounted for. This raises the intriguing possibility that some poisonous species of mushrooms have evolved warning odors (and perhaps tastes) to enhance avoidance learning by fungivores. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.

Thus, there is a negative correlation between an individual's state at time 1 and the change in state from time 1 to time 2. In addition, whenever groups differ in their initial mean values, the expected change in the mean value from time 1 to time 2 will differ among the groups. For example, birds feeding nestlings lose weight, but initially heavier birds lose more weight than lighter birds, a result expected from the regression effect. In sexual selection, males who remain unmated in the first year are, on average, less attractive than mated males. The regression effect predicts that these males will increase their attractiveness in the second year more than mated males. In well-designed experiments, changes in the experimental and control groups would be compared. In observational studies, however, no such comparison is available, and expected differential effects must be accounted for before they can be attributed to external causes.

In this article, we present a two-locus model for the evolution of dispersal in the presence of inbreeding depression. The first locus codes for a modifier of the migration rate, while the second locus is a selected locus generating inbreeding depression. We express the change in frequency of the migration modifier as a function of allele frequencies and genetic associations and then use a quasi-equilibrium assumption to express genetic associations as functions of allele frequencies. Our model disentangles two effects of inbreeding depression: it gives an advantage to migrant individuals because their offspring are on average less homozygous, but it also decreases the degree of population structure, thus decreasing the strength of kin selection for dispersal. We then extend our model to include an infinite number of selected loci. When the cost of dispersal is not too high, the model predictions are confirmed by multilocus simulation results and show that inbreeding depression can have a substantial effect on the dispersal rate. For high costs of dispersal, we observe discrepancies between the model and the simulations, probably caused by associations among selected loci, which are neglected in the analysis. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.

Interference between the life-history schedule of a species and periodicity of the disease has unintuitive effects on selection intensity, and stochasticity in outbreak period further reduces the rate of spread of disease-resistance alleles. A general age-structured population genetic model was developed and parameterized using empirical data for phocine distemper virus (PDV) epizootics in harbor seals. Scenarios with acquired immunity had lower levels of epizootic mortality compared with scenarios without acquired immunity for the first PDV outbreaks, but this pattern was reversed after about five disease cycles. Without acquired immunity, evolution of disease resistance was more rapid, and long-term population size variation is efficiently dampened. Acquired immunity has the potential to significantly influence rapid evolutionary dynamics of a host population in response to age-structured disease selection and to alter predicted selection intensities compared with epidemiological models that do not consider such feedback. This may have important implications for evolutionary population dynamics in a range of human, agricultural, and wildlife disease settings. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.

To address this issue, tobacco Nicotiana tabacum plants were subjected to two levels of mechanical stress, 0 (control) or 40 (flexed) daily flexures, and grown solitarily, in a dense monostand (with plants of only one mechanical treatment), or in a mixed stand (flexed and control plants grown together). Flexed plants produced shorter and thicker stems with a lower Young's modulus than control plants, while dense-stand plants had relatively taller and thinner stems than solitary ones. Flexing effects on stem characteristics were independent of stand density. Growth, reproduction, and survival of solitary plants were not affected by flexing, while in the monostand growth was slightly reduced. But in the mixed stand, flexed plants were readily shaded by controls and had considerably lower growth, survival, and reproduction rates. These results suggest that wind shielding indeed plays a role in the plastic increase in stem elongation of plants in dense vegetation and that this response can have important consequences for competitive ability and lifetime seed production. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.

Organisms have two possible ways to reduce the negative effect of ROS: disposing of effective antioxidant defenses and minimizing ROS production. The unbalance between the amount of ROS produced and the availability of antioxidant defenses determines the intensity of so-called oxidative stress. Interestingly, most studies that deal with the effect of oxidative stress on organismal performance have focused on the antioxidant defense compartment and, surprisingly, have neglected the mechanisms that control ROS production within mitochondria. Uncoupling proteins (UCPs), mitochondrial transporters of the inner membrane, are involved in the control of redox state of cells and in the production of mitochondrial ROS. Given their function, UCPs might therefore represent a major mechanistic link between metabolic activity and fitness. We suggest that by exploring the role of expression and function of UCPs both in experimental as well as in comparative studies, evolutionary biologists may gain better insight into this link. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.

The results of our comparative genomic analysis between H. pylori, the two closely related species Helicobacter hepaticus and Campylobacter jejuni, and other relevant proteobacterial species are incompatible with the hypotheses invoking preadaptation or exaptation.

When we simply fit the models to the observational data, the best model assumed density independence in both oviposition and predation.

Despite an accumulation of evidence that mothers can sex-specifically modulate investment in offspring in relation to maternal quality, few mechanisms have been proposed as to how this is achieved. We explored a hormonal mechanism for sex-biased maternal investment by measuring and experimentally manipulating baseline levels of the stress hormone corticosterone in laying wild female European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and examining effects on sex ratio and sex-specific offspring phenotype adjustment. Here we show that baseline plasma corticosterone is negatively correlated with energetic body condition in laying starlings, and subsequent experimental elevation of maternal baseline plasma corticosterone increased yolk corticosterone without altering maternal condition or egg quality per se. Hormonal elevation resulted in the following: female-biased hatching sex ratios (caused by elevated male embryonic mortality), lighter male offspring at hatching (which subsequently grew more slowly during postnatal development), and lower cell-mediated immune (phytohemagglutinin) responses in males compared with control-born males; female offspring were unaffected by the manipulation in both years of the study. Elevated maternal corticosterone therefore resulted in a sex-biased adjustment of offspring quality favorable to female offspring via both a sex ratio bias and a modulation of male phenotype at hatching. In birds, deposition of yolk corticosterone may benefit mothers by acting as a bet-hedging strategy in stochastic environments where the correlation between environmental cues at laying (and therefore potentially maternal condition) and conditions during chick-rearing might be low and unpredictable. Together with recent studies in other vertebrate taxa, these results suggest that maternal stress hormones provide a mechanistic link between maternal quality and sex-biased maternal investment in offspring. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.

All models of gynodioecy assume maternal inheritance of the cytoplasmic alleles and postulate a variety of negatively frequency-dependent mechanisms to maintain the cytoplasmic polymorphisms observed in many natural populations. However, in some plant species, mitochondria are transmitted at least occasionally by pollen, a process called paternal leakage. We show that even a small amount of paternal leakage is sufficient to sustain a permanent, stable cytoplasmic polymorphism. Because only hermaphrodites provide pollen in gynodioecious species, the effects of paternal leakage are biased and occur more often from the non-CMS male-fertile haplotype to the CMS male-sterile haplotype. We also show that a nuclear restorer disrupts the polymorphic cytoplasmic equilibrium, leading to fixation of both the CMS allele and the restorer. Although a dominant nuclear restorer fixes, it fixes much more slowly than in the standard CMS models. Although a stable cytonuclear polymorphism is possible with ""matching alleles"" nuclear restoration, oscillations to low frequencies present a risk of loss by drift. Paternal leakage enhances the stability of joint cytonuclear polymorphism by reducing the chance that a CMS allele is lost by drift. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.

Vertical transmission can fill this role, but it is still unknown whether mutualism can be stable when vertically transmitted symbionts can evolve toward horizontal transmission. In this article, we investigate how symbionts' transmission mode and virulence should evolve, depending on the relationship between these two traits. We show that pathogens that reduce their host's fecundity can have more complex evolutionary dynamics than those that increase mortality. In some cases, runaway evolution of virulence can drive the host population extinct. In most cases, evolutionary branching results in the differentiation of avirulent, vertically transmitted symbionts from virulent, contagious pathogens. The population of symbionts then becomes polymorphic, and because the least virulent symbionts are the most frequent, the average virulence of symbionts is much lower than it would be in a monomorphic population. When the link between transmission and virulence results from correlated mutational changes and not from fixed constraints, vertically transmitted symbionts do not simply lose virulence; they evolve toward mutualism. We show that the force that stabilizes mutualism in such situations is the competition for transmission between symbionts. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.

Cooperatively breeding species offer an opportunity to address this problem because the strength of selection on sex ratio adjustment can be estimated. When helping behavior is sex dependent, parents are predicted to overproduce the helping sex when this sex is rare or absent.

The environmental deviation is assumed to be decomposed into environmental quality, which interacts with genotypic value, and residual developmental noise, which is independent of genotype. Environmental quality and the optimal phenotype of stabilizing selection are allowed to randomly fluctuate in both space and time, and individuals migrate equally before development and reproduction among different niches. Analyses show that phenotypic plasticity is adaptive within variable environments if correlations have become established between the optimal phenotype and environmental quality in space and/or time. The evolved plasticity increases with variances in optimal phenotypes and correlations between optimal phenotype and environmental quality; this further induces increases in mean fitness and the environmental variance in the trait.

When elevated experimentally, it is known to enhance some components of fitness and to decrease others. We report that female T also varies seasonally and co-varies with male T. Female T is higher in relation to male T in sexually monomorphic species and is higher absolutely in females of species with socially monogamous mating systems, which suggests adaptation. We also consider the effect of experimentally elevated T on females and whether traits are sensitive to altered T. We hypothesize that sensitive traits could become subject to selection after a natural change in T and that traits with opposing fitness consequences in males and females could constrain dimorphism.

Here, we show that Haldane's concerns may be incorporated into Fisher's model solely by allowing the intensity of selection to vary between traits. We further show that this generalization may be achieved by introducing a single, intuitively defined quantity that describes the phenotype prior to adaptation.

Contrary to the sexual-selection hypothesis, genital length, the target of sexual selection, shows the lowest allometric slope of all the assayed traits.

We show that offspring solicitation and parental provisioning are expected to become genetically correlated through coadaptation and that their genetic architecture is dictated by an interaction between patterns of selection and the proximate mechanisms regulating supply and demand. When selection is predominately on offspring solicitation, our model suggests that the genetic correlations between provisioning and solicitation are usually positive if provisioning reduces solicitation. Conversely, when selection is predominately on parental provisioning, the correlations are mostly negative as long as parents show a positive response to offspring demand.

Our results provide empirical support for several recent predictions regarding the evolutionary lability of developmental thresholds, including uncoupled evolution of alternative phenotypes and repeated fixation of phenotypes. We also report striking evidence of a possible developmental constraint.

Stronger maternal effects extended preselection phenotypic variance in morphological traits of males, thereby producing some locally adaptive phenotypes and lessening juvenile mortality.

The species is sexually dimorphic for many traits, especially flower number, with males producing many, small flowers compared to females. We tested whether the cost of reproduction is higher in males because flower number, which we presume to be under sexual selection in males, is genetically correlated with traits that would affect life-history trade-offs.

Thus, lineages were able to adapt to several substrates simultaneously without any appreciable loss of function with respect to other substrates present in the media.

I evaluate the roles of limited genetic variation, negative genetic covariation (within and between sex morphs), and lack of gender-differential selection in contributing to minimal sexual dimorphism for these traits in Fragaria virginiana. Major findings are as follows. First, selection was sometimes differential but rarely divergent between male and female fertility modes. Second, response to selection was constrained by low genetic variation and extensive genetic covariance. In fact, covariance between traits within sex morphs appears to represent a constraint on par with that of covariance between sex morphs. Third, these constraints combine with different modes of gamete transmission to produce very different gender-specific contributions to the mean phenotypes of the next generation. Finally, predicted responses to selection for several traits are concordant with the degree and direction of dimorphism in a closely related dioecious species. In sum, this work suggests that minimal sexual dimorphism in vegetative and phenological traits is due to similar directional selection via male and female fertility combined with the constraints of low genetic variation and extensive genetic covariance both within and between sex morphs. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.",42,16224712,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,1,1,Adaptive evolution | Antagonistic covariation | Dioecy | Fragaria virginiana | G matrix | Natural selection,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,36,NA,NA,NA,NA

First, it has been used as a hypothesis about signal design, that is, that males evolve traits that stimulate female sensory systems. Second, sensory bias has been used as a hypothesis for the evolution of female preference itself, that is, to explain why females exhibit particular preferences. We focus on this second facet. First, we clarify the unique features of sensory bias relative to the alternative models by considering each in the same quantitative genetic framework. The key assumptions of sensory bias are that natural selection is the predominant evolutionary mechanism that affects preference and that sexual selection on preferences is quantitatively negligible. We describe four studies that would test these assumptions and review what we can and cannot infer about sensory bias from existing studies.

Therefore, in crosses between plants with differing mating systems, outcrossing parents are expected to ""overpower"" selfing parents. We call this the weak inbreeder/strong outbreeder (WISO) hypothesis. Prezygotically, such overpowering can alter pollination success, and we argue that our hypothesis explains a common pattern of unilateral incompatibility, in which pollen from self-incompatible populations fertilizes ovules of self-compatible individuals but the reciprocal cross fails. A postzygotic manifestation of overpowering is aberrant seed development due to parent-of-origin effects such as genomic imprinting. We evaluate evidence for the WISO hypothesis by reviewing published accounts of crosses between plants of different mating systems. Many, but not all, of such reports support our hypothesis.

Starting from an individual-based model with neighborhood interactions and movements, a deterministic approximation is derived, and the effect of local spatial structure on equilibrium densities is investigated. Incorporating local movements and local interactions has important consequences for the community dynamics. Now the final prey density is very much dependent on its birth, death, and movement rates and in ways that seem counterintuitive. Increasing prey fecundity or mobility and decreasing the coefficient of competition can all lead to decreases in the final density of prey if the predator is also relatively immobile.

Asymmetrical LMC occurs when females lay eggs on a patch asynchronously and male offspring do not disperse, leading to relatively weaker LMC for males emerging from later broods. Varying levels of LMC then lead to varying optimal sex ratios for females, depending on when and where they oviposit. We confirm the assumptions of our theory using the wasp Nasonia vitripennis and then test our predictions. We show that females adjust their offspring sex ratios in the directions predicted, laying different sex ratios on different hosts within a patch.

Recent theoretical and empirical studies of source-sink systems demonstrate that temporally variable local growth rates in sinks can substantially increase average abundance of a persisting population, provided that the variation is positively autocorrelated - in effect, temporal variation inflates average abundance. Here we extend these results to a metapopulation in which all habitat patches are sinks. Using numerical studies of a population with discrete generations (buttressed by analytic results), we show that temporal variation and moderate dispersal can jointly permit indefinite persistence of the metapopulation and that positive autocorrelation both lowers the magnitude of variation required for persistence and increases the average abundance of persisting metapopulations. These effects are weakened - but not destroyed - if variation in local growth rates is spatially synchronized and dispersal is localized. We show that the inflationary effect is robust to a number of extensions of the basic model, including demographic stochasticity and density dependence. Because ecological and environmental processes contributing to temporally variable growth rates in natural populations are typically autocorrelated, these observations may have important implications for species persistence. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.",79,16032577,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Autocorrelation | Dispersal | Inflation | Population persistence | Sink metapopulation,12604,R01GM060792,0,FALSE,53,NA,NA,NIGMS,National Institute of General Medical Sciences

I propose a general mechanistic hypothesis integrating both ecological and ecophysiological approaches to explain this pattern. Specifically, the deep root and efficient vascular systems of lianas enable them to suffer less water stress during seasonal droughts while many competitors are dormant, giving lianas a competitive advantage during the dry season. Testing this hypothesis in central Panama, I found that lianas grew approximately seven times more in height than did trees during the dry season but only twice as much during the wet season. Over time, this dry season advantage may allow lianas to increase in abundance in seasonal forests. In aseasonal wet forests, however, lianas gain no such advantage because competing plants are rarely limited by water.

General mathematical models of community dynamics are often too simplistic to accurately describe this response, partly to retain mathematical tractability and partly for the lack of biologically pleasing functions representing the model/environment interface. We address these problems of tractability and plausibility in community/environment models by incorporating the Boltzmann factor (temperature dependence) in a bioenergetic consumer-resource framework. Our analysis leads to three predictions for the response of consumer-resource systems to increasing mean temperature (warming). First, mathematical extinctions do not occur with warming; however, stable systems may transition into an unstable (cycling) state. Second, there is a decrease in the biomass density of resources with warming. The biomass density of consumers may increase or decrease depending on their proximity to the feasibility (extinction) boundary. Third, consumer biomass density is more sensitive to warming than resource biomass density (with some exceptions). These predictions are in line with many current observations and experiments.

Thus, larger species are expected to be relatively poor gliders, in lieu of behavioral or physiological compensation, when compared with smaller congeners. Here we tested this hypothesis by conducting gliding performance trials for 11 Draco species spanning virtually the entire size range of the genus. We considered three primary performance variables: maximum velocity adjusted for wind conditions, height lost over a standard horizontal glide distance, and glide angle. Comparative analysis confirmed that larger species are relatively poor gliders and do not compensate substantially for their higher wing loadings via either behavioral or physiological mechanisms. Flying lizards were found to exhibit substantial context-dependent variation in glide performance, with smaller species often exhibiting extensive variation in height lost and glide angle between trials. Variation also was observed in empirically derived velocity profiles, with only a subset of individuals appearing to perform equilibrium glides.

However, the oscillation may also be intrinsic, generated by density-dependent effects on the life history. Models of structured single-species systems indicate that a much broader range of oscillatory behavior than that seen in nature is theoretically possible. We test the hypothesis that it is selection that acts to constrain the range of periods. We analyze a nonlinear single-species matrix model with density dependence affecting reproduction and with trade-offs between reproduction and survival. We show that the evolutionarily stable state is oscillatory and has a period roughly twice the time to maturation, in line with observed patterns of periodicity.

Analysis of null models consistent with the mid-domain hypothesis shows that MDEs are indeed likely to be ubiquitous consequences of geographical domain boundaries. Comparing the probability distributions of range locations for the process-based and randomization-based models reveals that randomization models probably overestimate the contribution of MDEs to empirical patterns of species richness, but it also indicates that other testable predictions from randomization models are likely to be robust. I also show how this process-based framework can be extended beyond null models to incorporate effects of environmental gradients within the domain.

At LH, from 4,303 identified specimens, we recognize 186 species of plant organs and 152 species of leaves. Adjusted for sample size, the LH flora is more diverse than comparable Eocene floras known from other continents. The RP flora shares several taxa with LH and appears to be as rich, although sampling is preliminary. The two floras were previously considered coeval.

The first involved releasing one female sea urchin's eggs and one or two males' sperm in discrete puffs from syringes; the second involved inducing males to spawn at different intervals in situ within a population of spawning females. In both, fertilization success was measured as the fraction of eggs fertilized and the paternity share of each male. The results indicate that spawning after females imposes a cost on males but only during sperm competition. Further, the optimal interval between the initiations of male and female spawning depends on degree of sperm competition, distance between males and females, and water velocity. The results show that sex differences in spawning timing of marine invertebrates can be explained on the basis of the differential costs and benefits of spawning out of synchrony with the other sex and that the result of sexual selection on external fertilizers may be behavioral rather than morphological differentiation of the sexes. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.",48,15937748,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Fertilization success | Microsatellites | Paternity analysis | Reproductive synchrony | Sea urchins | Sexual dimorphism,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,76,NA,NA,NA,NA

These three possibilities correspond to a mixed strategy of development, a genetic polymorphism, and a conditional strategy. Using the perspective of adaptive dynamics, I develop a unifying evolutionary theory of systems of determination of alternative phenotypes, focusing on the relative possibilities for random versus genetic determination. The approach is an extension of the analysis of evolutionary branching in adaptive dynamics. It compares the possibility that there will be evolutionary branching, leading to genetic polymorphism, with the possibility that a mixed strategy evolves. The comparison is based on the strength of selection for the different outcomes. An interpretation of the resulting criterion is that genetic polymorphism is favored over random determination of the phenotype if an individual's heritable genotype is an adaptively advantageous cue for development.

Our studies of garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis) at a communal den in Manitoba support an interpretation of sexual conflict rather than indirect mate choice. Female snakes dispersed rapidly from the den through areas with relatively few males rather than waiting for additional courtship. Many females dispersed without mating. Experimental (pheromonal) manipulation of the intensity of courtship accelerated rates of female dispersal rather than delaying dispersal, as would be predicted if females wait to obtain matings. The behaviors of females escaping from courting groups were maximally effective in losing their suitors regardless of the number of courting males or whether or not the female was capable of mating (recently mated females cannot mate again because of a mating plug).

Its diploid teliospores are heterozygous at the mating-type locus, normally producing equal proportions of haploid sporidia of the two mating types. However, natural populations contain high frequencies of individuals producing sporidia of only one mating type. This mating-type ratio bias is caused by the presence of deleterious alleles at haploid phase (""haplo-lethals"") linked to the mating-type locus. These haplo-lethals can be transmitted if there is conjugation among the products of meiosis (intratetrad selfing). Haplo-lethals still suffer from selective disadvantages, through reducing the infection probability of strains that carry them, and thus cannot persist in a panmictic population. We develop a realistic model of a metapopulation of M. violaceum on its host Silene latifolia. Simulations show that if intratetrad selfing rate is high, haplo-lethals can be maintained under a metapopulation structure because of founder effects and selection at the population level. Populations founded only by strains carrying haplo-lethals experience a lower extinction rate precisely because of their lower infection ability; they spread more slowly and sterilize fewer plants, thereby allowing their host population to grow more rapidly and therefore to be less prone to extinction. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.",10,15795854,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Disease transmission | Parasites | Population-level selection | Protected polymorphism | Transmission rate | Virulence,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,87,NA,NA,NA,NA

We use empirical data from the literature to assess the relative strength of indirect and direct selection on female EPC behavior, using quantitative genetic approximations of selection. This analysis confirmed that there is generally negative direct selection on EPC behavior caused by depressed paternal investment by social males. In contrast, there was no significant positive indirect selection on EPC behavior in females. A comparison between the two types of selection suggests that the force of direct negative selection is generally much stronger than that of indirect positive selection. Indirect selection is thus unlikely to maintain EPC behavior in the face of direct selection against it. We suggest that EPCs may instead be the result of antagonistic selection on loci influencing the outcome of male-female encounters and that EPC behavior per se may not be adaptive for females but may reflect sexual conflict due to strong selection in males to achieve extrapair copulations. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.",245,15795859,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,2,2,Genetic compatibility | Good genes | Mate choice | Paternal investment | Polyandry | Sexual selection,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,88,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recent work suggests that direct effects of multiple mating on female fitness are not fully understood. A major concern in studies of sexual conflict is how well the data obtained under controlled laboratory settings relate to natural conditions. We tested the effect of female multiple mating on reproductive success in a natural population of a polyandrous spider, Stegodyphus lineatus. Previous studies show that a male who succeeds in entering a female nest also mates with her; therefore, we used male encounter rate as a proxy of female mating rate. We further elevated female mating rate by introducing males into females' nests.

The usefulness of conflict analyses of traits that have been traditionally interpreted as resulting from female choice is controversial, however. This article explores a possible explanation for why conflicts of interest may be ameliorated in female choice situations. In contrast to most other evolutionary contexts in which conflicts of interest are the ught to have been important, sexual reproduction usually involves an extensive, irretrievable mixing of the genomes of the participants. Under certain combinations of costs and benefits to females, the genes in the female's genome can benefit, through increased reproduction of her offspring, from the very genes that produce sexually antagonistic traits in the male. In short, females can sometimes gain by ""losing."" Such Fisherian payoffs are also possible, though probably less important, for males. Gaining by losing is not feasible in most other contexts of evolutionary conflict, except under some conditions in parent-offspring conflict. Some apparent parent-offspring conflicts may instead be parental choice among offspring that is analogous to traditional female choice. Parent-offspring conflict may be relatively common, however, because offspring manipulation of their parents is likely to be damaging to the parents. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.",29,15795858,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,1,1,Female choice | Male-female conflict | Parent-offspring conflict | Sexually antagonistic coevolution,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,92,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, in spite of increased recognition of antagonistic male-female mating interactions, there is very limited evidence that such intraspecific interactions could cause rapid evolutionary dynamics in nature. This is because ecological and longitudinal data from natural populations have been lacking. Here we show that in a color-polymorphic damselfly species, male-female mating interactions lead to rapid evolutionary change in morph frequencies between generations. Field data and computer simulations indicate that these changes are driven by sexual conflict, in which morph fecundities are negatively affected by frequency- and density-dependent male mating harassment. These frequency-dependent processes prevent population divergence by maintaining a female polymorphism in most populations. Although these results contrast with the traditional view of how sexual conflict enhances the rate of population divergence, they are consistent with a recent theoretical model of how females may form discrete genetic clusters in response to male mating harassment. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.",197,15795853,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Color polymorphism | Ischnura elegans | Population genetics | Rapid evolution | Sexual dimorphism | Sexual selection,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,93,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Sexual selection favors exaggeration of male persistence traits that are costly to females, and females, in turn, are selected to resist these traits. The heightened resistance by females is thought to then favor further exaggeration in the male trait, leading to an escalating coevolutionary arms race between persistence and resistance traits. Much of this theory, however, is based on an (implicit) assumption that there are tight constraints on how female resistance can evolve. We develop a theory that identifies and relaxes these constraints, allowing female resistance to evolve in a fashion that better reflects known empirical patterns in the evolution of female preference functions (the resistance trait). Our results suggest that evolutionary arms races that lead to the exaggeration of persistence and resistance will be much less common than formerly predicted. Females sometimes evolve indifference to male traits rather than resistance and can even evolve to discriminate against these traits. These alternative outcomes depend on the existence of genetic variance in the components of the female sensory system underlying female resistance and on the strength of natural selection acting on these components. Female indifference tends to evolve when natural selection on the sensory system is weak, and under these conditions, sexually antagonistic coevolution tends not to reduce female fitness significantly at equilibrium. When natural selection on the female sensory system is strong, however, then arms races are more likely, and female fitness is then sometimes significantly depressed at equilibrium. Sexually antagonistic coevolution is thus likely to have strong deeterious effects on population fitness only when female sensory traits are under strong natural selection to perform functions in addition to those involved with mating. Together, these results suggest that identifying the nature of genetic variation in and the strength of natural selection on female resistance should be a central goal of future studies of sexual conflict. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.",90,15795862,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,3,3,Co-evolutionary theory | Female preference | Female resistance | Sexual selection,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,96,NA,NA,NA,NA

When this is the case, females may need to use multiple cues to accurately assess overall mate quality. We examined the pattern of mating preference in the cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea. Sexual conflict occurs in this species because male manipulation of female mating receptivity can result in reduced female fitness. We predicted that since females cannot remate within a single reproductive bout because of male manipulation, females should assess male mating history to avoid mating with males with low fertility caused by sperm exhaustion. In a mate-preference experiment, we found that females discriminated against males who had mated multiple times. Females also discriminated against males who had consorted with several females but had been prevented from mating with those females. Thus, females appeared to be able to detect cues on males that were derived from previous mates and to use this information to avoid mating with sperm-exhausted males. We suggest that females may commonly use multiple cues to assess different aspects of mate quality, especially when male quality changes over time.

We examined the effect of male and female selection history and the proximate effect of variation in male density on female fitness parameters. We found that male density rather than male selection history explained a greater degree of female fecundity, egg hatching success, and productivity. Additionally, females selected under elevated promiscuity had greater fecundity and hatching success than did enforced monogamy females. Selection line males do not differ in their capacity to coerce females to remate, suggesting no divergence in precopulatory manipulative ability.

In ants at baits, a combination of environmental stress and interspecific competition is widely held to lead to a unimodal relationship between the abundance of dominant ants and species richness. It is thought that in comparatively adverse environments, both abundance and richness are low. As habitats become more favorable, abundance increases until the abundance of dominant ants is so high that they exclude those that are subordinate and so depress richness. Here we demonstrate empirically that this relationship is remarkably similar across three continents. Using a null model approach, we then show that the ascending part of the relationship is largely constrained to take this form not simply as a consequence of stress but also as a result of the shape of abundance frequency distributions. While the form of the species-abundance frequency distribution can also produce the descending part of the relationship, interspecific competition might lead to it too.

One key result of the article is that, under certain conditions, there are extra effects of the landscape structure (number and configuration of patches, patch size distribution) on metapopulation persistence if stochasticity is included. In these cases, ignoring or including stochasticity can change conclusions about the persistence status but also ranking orders, relative results, and qualitative trends. A list of conditions is provided under which including stochasticity is vital to prevent counterproductive conclusions about metapopulation persistence. The results of the overall study are condensed in five lessons about the effect of stochasticity. A number of implications for ecological theory and conservation management are discussed.

In the presence of intergenerational effects, short-term and long-term measures of success (such as the expected numbers of surviving offspring and of farther descendants, respectively) may be in conflict. When such conflicts occur, life-history theory normally takes long-term measures to predict the outcome of selection. This ignores the fact that, because traits change in time - through mutation, sex, and recombination - long-term relations disintegrate. We study this issue with numerical simulations and analytical models combining intergenerational effects and evolutionary change. In the models, the parental investment per offspring, as well as the total reproductive effort, stand for investments in future generations. The models show that the rate of evolutionary change determines the level of those investments. Higher rates of mutation and of sexual as opposed to parthenogenetic reproduction favor lower parental investment per offspring and lower total reproductive effort. It follows that the level of investment of ancestors in descendants responds to the genetic relatedness between the generations of the lineage, in a manner unaccounted for by preexisting theory. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.

The intercept of the horn allometry was suppressed, but there was no evidence of reprogramming of horn growth in either beetle species. There was reprogramming in the earwig. In the beetles, the horn length in all males can be explained largely in terms of exponential horn growth following an extraordinarily steep power function. The asymptote in O. taurus can be explained by exponential growth meeting the constraint of resource exhaustion.

Using seed trap data on seeds dispersing from forests into adjacent sites of two distinct vegetation structures, we show that our model was unbiased and accurate, even though dispersal patterns differed greatly between the two structures. Our spatially heterogeneous model performed better than models that assumed homogeneous vegetation for the same system. Its sensitivity to vegetation structure and ability to predict seed arrival when vegetation structure was incorporated demonstrates the model's utility for providing realistic estimates of seed arrival in realistic landscapes.

We show that coexistence is unlikely in many systems characterized both by successful invasion of either prey species into the food web that lacks it and by a stable equilibrium with high densities of all species. Invasion of the predator-resistant consumer species often causes the resident, more vulnerable prey to crash to such low densities that extinction would occur for many realistic population sizes. Subsequent transient cycles may entail very low densities of the predator or of the initially successful invader, which may also preclude co-existence of finite populations. Factors causing particularly low minimum densities during the transient cycles include biotic limiting resources for the prey, limited resource partitioning between the prey, a highly efficient predator with relatively slow dynamics, and a vulnerable prey whose population dynamics are rapid relative to the less vulnerable prey. Under these conditions, coexistence of competing prey via keystone predation often requires that the prey's competitive or antipredator characteristics fall within very narrow ranges.

Males with larger song repertoires contributed more independent and recruited offspring, and independent and recruited grandoffspring, to Mandarte's population. This was because these males lived longer and reared a greater proportion of hatched chicks to independence from parental care, not because females mated to males with larger repertoires laid or hatched more eggs. Furthermore, independent offspring of males with larger repertoires were more likely to recruit and then to leave more grandoffspring than were offspring of males with small repertoires.

If the defensible predation risk is low or if the cost of defense is high, the optimal strategy is to have no shell (shell-less growth).

We find that Armstrong and McGehee's mechanism of coexistence can operate in a spatial context. However, individual-based simulations suggest that decreased dispersal restricts coexistence in most cases, whereas differential equation models of metapopulations suggest that a low rate of dispersal between subpopulations often increases the coexistence region. This difference arises in part because of two potentially opposing effects on coexistence due to the asynchrony in the temporal dynamics at different locations. Asynchrony implies that the less efficient species is more likely to be favored in some spatial locations at any given time, which broadens the conditions for coexistence. On the other hand, asynchrony and dispersal can also reduce the amplitude of local population cycles, which restricts coexistence. The relative influence of these two effects depends on details of the population dynamics and the representation of space.

Juvenile habitat plays a marginally greater role in limiting population size for species with closed populations, where recruitment is proportional to adult abundance, versus open populations. Because adult populations often accumulate pulses of juveniles, adult habitat size can strongly limit population size over a broad range of parameter values, an effect that increases as the longevity of a species increases. Limited empirical research from a range of taxa supports these model predictions, although few studies were designed to actually test the limiting role of juvenile versus adult habitat.

When predators strongly prefer parasitized hosts, the host-parasite system can oscillate, but predators can also create alternative stable states, Allee effects, and catastrophic extinction of parasites. In the latter three cases, parasites have difficulty invading and/or persisting in ecosystems. When predators are intermediately selective, these more complex behaviors become less important, but the host-parasite system can switch from stable to oscillating and then back to stable states along a gradient of predator control. Surprisingly, at higher productivity, predators that neutrally select or avoid parasitized hosts can catalyze extinction of both hosts and parasites.

We suggest that this may partly be due to a long tradition in the field of model development for choosing mathematical and statistical tools for convenience rather than applicability. Real population dynamics are influenced by nonlinear interactions, nonequilibrium conditions, and scaling complexity from system openness. Thus, a coherent theory for individual-, population-, and community-level processes should rest on mathematical and statistical methods that explicitly confront these issues in a manner that satisfies principles from statistical mechanics for complex systems. Instead, ecological theory is traditionally based on premises from simpler statistical mechanical theory for memory-free, scale-specific, random-walk, and diffusion processes, while animals from many taxa generally express strategic homing, site fidelity, and conspecific attraction in direct violation of primary model assumptions. Thus, the main challenge is to generalize the theory for memory-free physical, many-body systems to include a more realistic memory-influenced framework that better satisfies ecological realism. We describe, simulate, and discuss three testable aspects of a model for multiscaled habitat use at the individual level: (1) scale-free distribution of movement steps under influence of self-reinforcing site fidelity, (2) fractal spatial dispersion of intra-home range relocations, and (3) nonasymptotic expansion of observed intra-home range patch use with increasing set of relocations. Examples of literature data apparently supporting the conjecture that multiscaled, strategic space use is widespread among many animal taxa are also described. We suggest that the present approach, which provides a protocol to test for influence from scale-free, memory-dependent habitat use at the individual level, may also point toward a guideline for development of a generalized theoretical framework for complex population kinetics and spatiotemporal population dynamics.",85,15729639,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Complexity | Fractal | Home range | Multiscaled random walk | Scale-free | Site fidelity,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,142,NA,NA,NA,NA

We describe the demographic responses of both biomass and numbers of adult fish, predicting the mean and the variance of temporal fluctuations resulting from stochastic recruitment of juveniles. We find that top-down control acts by suppressing variability of numbers of fish, which in turn suppresses the variability of biomass. Bottom-up control has no effect on fluctuations of numbers of fish, though it strongly reduces fluctuations of biomass. Because fecundity of fish is directly linked to body mass, the regulation of biomass tightly regulates reproductive output independently of the number of individuals in the population. Finally, populations under pelagic control experience bounded fluctuations of biomass and numbers directly proportional to the bounded fluctuations of recruitment. The demographic signatures predicted from both bottom-up and pelagic control are consistent with current evidence supporting the recruitment limitation hypothesis in reef fish ecology. We propose tests to discriminate the dominant mode of density-dependent regulation using qualitative trends in time series demographic data across environmental clines.",21,15729643,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Bottom-up | Demographic fluctuations | Pelagic control | Population regulation | Top-down | Variance propagation,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,143,NA,NA,NA,NA
