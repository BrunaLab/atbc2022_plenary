Consequently, many freshwater systems are affected, by reducing water quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. With the increased frequency of harmful algal blooms, the development of biological tools to improve water quality is an urgent issue. Objective: To evaluate the effects of a submerged macrophyte and a cladoceran on the microcystin-producing cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa (NPLJ-4) and the chlorophyte Raphidocelis subcapitata (BMIUFRPE-02) in mixed cultures. Methods: Two parallel experiments were carried out for ten days to evaluate the effects of the submerged macrophyte Ceratophyllum demersum and the cladoceran Moina micrura on microalgal interactions. Microalgal strains were cultivated in the ASM1 culture medium, under controlled laboratory conditions. The first experiment presented four treatments: M (C. demersum), Z (M. micrura), MZ (C. demersum and M. micrura), and C (control). Meanwhile, the second experiment consisted of five treatments, in which the microalgae were cultivated together at different Microcystis:Raphidocelis ratios: 1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, and 0:1. Biomass and growth rates of the strains were evaluated every two days, which were statistically treated with three-way or two-way repeated-measures ANOVA. Results: In the first experiment, M. aeruginosa was significantly inhibited in M and MZ treatments from the second day, and Z from the fourth, while R. subcapitata showed no reduction in its biomass in any treatment. On the other hand, R. subcapitata was stimulated from the eighth and tenth days in M treatment and only on the eighth day in Z treatment. In the second experiment, M. aeruginosa was significantly inhibited when cultivated with R. subcapitata in low ratios (Microcystis:Raphidocelis ratio of 1:3) throughout the experiment, while the chlorophyte was stimulated in that treatment. Conclusions: The coexistence of a cyanobacterium with a green alga did not alter the main negative response of M. aeruginosa to the submerged macrophyte and zooplankton but stimulated the green alga. Accordingly, the introduction of submerged macrophytes and cladocerans already adapted to eutrophic conditions, both isolated and combined, proved to be a good method to control cyanobacterial blooms without negatively affecting other coexisting phytoplankton species.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Allelopathy | Biomanipulation | Competition | Grazing | Microalgal blooms,13567,CNPq,ID 305829/2019-0,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,1

La Arenilla coastal wetland has a historical record of 20 scolopacid species; climatic events could affect the distribution and migration of the several species of this taxonomic family, reducing their species richness and abundance. Objective: The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between richness and abundance of the species belonging to the Scolopacidae family and both Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and the coastal El Niño index (ICEN) in La Arenilla Coastal Wetland, La Punta, Callao. Methods: Sampling were carried out twice a month, between January 2013 and January 2019 using the Total Count Method in order to determine species abundance (N = 292). A Spearman correlation analysis between abundance, species richness, SST and ICEN was performed, and beta diversity was calculated through the Whittaker index (βw) to analyze both the annual turnover for each season and the seasonal turnover within each year. Results: Two significant correlations were obtained: Between SST and abundance and between ICEN and species richness. On the other hand, the ANOSIM test showed seasonal differences in abundance, and the SIMPER test showed that the greatest difference in abundance between seasons was between autumn and spring (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity = 81.57%), and the minimum difference between winter and spring (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity = 49.86%).

Objective: To compare five reproductive success parameters (hatching success, eggs with no apparent embryonic development, dead hatchlings, embryonic mortality, and incubation period) of the sea turtle Lepidochelys olivacea. Methods: The incubation of nests was evaluated under two periods of nest relocation, P1 ~28.8 °C (August and September) and P2 ~27.1 °C (October and November), average ambient temperature, under hatchery condition, in 2018 in Guerrero, Mexico. Results: Significant differences were found in hatching success and embryonic mortality between nest relocation periods (P < 0.001). In P1, lower values of hatching success (77.0% P1 vs 88.6% P2) and higher values of embryonic mortality (13.7% P1 vs 3.3% P2) were observed compared to those of P2. It’s important pointing that, in the present study, embryonic mortality occurred at a late stage of development, that is, in almost fully developed embryos. No differences were found between periods regarding the parameters eggs with no apparent embryonic development, dead hatchlings and incubation period. Conclusions: The differences between the environmental conditions during the first period of nest relocation compared to the second period, respectively, seem to affect the hatching success and embryonic mortality of L. olivacea.

Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate how the waterlogging of the soil due to rain affects the trap rebuilding and relocation behavior of M. brasiliensis of different sizes. Methods: The study was conducted between July and December 2019. Larvae M. brasiliensis were observed and collected from a forest reserve in the municipality of Aquidauana in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Results: In the natural environment, most larvae rebuilt their traps in the same location seven days after the simulation of rain, with a smaller diameter than that observed prior to the simulation of rain. In the laboratory, the movements of M. brasiliensis larvae and rebuilding of the traps after the waterlogging of the soil was affected by body size. Larger larvae moved more and were more likely to rebuild their traps. Conclusions: The saturation of the soil affects the foraging of M. brasiliensis larvae, which are impeded from rebuilding their traps for a period. In situations of long periods of saturated soil, the mortality rate of the larvae is high and rebuilding of the traps occurs after the soil dries out, but with a smaller trap size. These data suggest that changes in the rainfall pattern can affect the population structure of M. brasiliensis larvae, with the selection of larger individuals in situations of more severe rains. In this process, the smaller larvae are more affected, as their foraging is impeded.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Antlion | Construction behaviour | Foraging | Myrmeleontinae | Rainfall,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,5

Costa Rica, small in size and population compared to other Latin American countries, has been progressively adopting the discipline. Recognizing progress makes it possible to determine where the country can go in this field, as well as its contribution to the Latin American region. Objective: This manuscript reports evidence of the evolution of bioinformatics in Costa Rica, to identify weak¬nesses and strengths allowing future actions plans. Methods: We searched databases of scientific publications and sequence repositories, as well as information on training activities, networks, infrastructure, web pages and funding sources. Results: Important advances have been observed since 2010, such as increases in training opportunities and the number of publications, significant contributions to the sequence databases and connections through networks. However, areas such as critical mass and financing require further development. The scientific community and its sponsors should promote bioinformatics-based research, invest in graduate student training, increase profes¬sional training, create career opportunities in bioinformatics, and promote international collaborations through networks. Conclusions: It is suggested that in order to experience the benefits of bioinformatics applications, three key aspects must be strengthened: The scientific community, the research infrastructure, and funding opportunities. The impact of such investment would be the development of ambitious but feasible projects and extended collaborations within the Latin American region and abroad.

To further understand connectivity patterns, an assignment test was carried out which identified ten recent between-deme migrants with a mean dispersal distance of 116.6 km (± 80.5 SE). No long-distance dispersal was detected. These results highlight the ecological importance of the Bahía de La Paz region, including Archipiélago de Espíritu Santo MUMPA.

Objective: The study aim was to determine the efficacy of different concentrations of IL-SbV administered in 29 daily sessions of 100 ^L each, on CL infected mice. Methods: Leishmania (Viannia) panamensis and L. (V.) braziliensis--infected mice (N = 6) were treated with 150, 50, and 16.6 mgSbV/kg/day x 29 days.

As the subject areas, levels and scales of this management have expanded, public administration has become more complex, requiring new approaches. Although the Law of the Sea and the thesis that the land dominates the sea are not new, the truth is that it was with the United Nations Convention of the Law of the Sea, of 1982, that the areas under the jurisdiction of the coastal States were formalized and institutionalized. This has generated new challenges for the governments, since not only does territorial sovereignty extend over a large portion of the sea, but new responsibilities are assumed on behalf of the international community. Objective: The matter links public management with the regulations of the Law of the Sea regarding the delimi-tation and administration of boundaries. Therefore, this review proposes an approach to a matter that has not been explored enough. Methods: A review of the literature on public border management was made, considering the case of maritime boundaries, identifying international jurisprudence-especially of the International Court of Justice-and actions implemented by Costa Rica. Results: in the land portion, border management shows important development; this is not the case in the maritime spaces. The jurisdiction is different in each of these spaces, so public management must take these particu-larities into account. Things get complicated when it comes to the border area, because in it the marine and the maritime converge, but also different interests, due to the nature of the marine space. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize that the management of maritime boundaries is not as simple as moving what is done on land to the sea. When the limit was defined by a bilateral treaty, some provisions facilitate cross-border coordination and cooperation. For this reason, the case of Costa Rica and Nicaragua in the Pacific Ocean was used as a reference, since in this case the dividing line was established by the International Court of Justice, which causes a layout that is not necessarily satisfactory for the actors involved. Conclusions: the differences in border management between land and sea, in addition to how the boundary between the two countries is defined, has made it difficult for Costa Rica to implement public management, which is the best-known experience in the region on marine-maritime policies and management.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Costa Rica | Law of the Sea | Maritime boundaries | Nicaragua | Pacific Ocean | Public management,13567,NA,undefined,NA,0,FALSE,NA,NA,11

Methods: The north Pacific of Costa Rica, from Bahía Salinas to the Marine Sector of ACG was sampled between May 2005 and May 2006. The behavior scanning method was used to identify the general behavior of the cetacean groups. Results: Encounters were recorded for the three species, in a total of 36 sightings, but only for S. attenuata and M. novaeangliae for considerable periods of time. Stenella attenuata exhibited a wide variety of behaviors, being foraging (X2 = 29.42; d.f. = 1; P < 0.001) and travelling (X2 = 38.33; d.f. = 1; P < 0.001) significantly higher during the rainy season. Predominant behaviors for the humpback whale were mother-calf association, social and travelling; being the latter higher during the rainy season (X2 = 78.16; d.f. = 1; P < 0.001).

Objective: The health status of the Playa Blanca coral reef was evaluated. Methods: Between August 2010 and September 2011, the percentage of live coral cover (LCC) per species and of the macroalgae Caulerpa sertularoides was determined in four sectors and at three depths of the coral reef; the annual growth of Pocillopora damicornis and P. elegans was measured and related to temperature, nutrients, wind, sun irradiation and rain. Results: 14 species of corals were found, two of them, Fungia curvata and Leptoseris papyracea, only as skeletons. The area with the highest LCC was offshore in the middle zone of Playa Blanca. The species with the highest coverage in all depth ranges was P. damicornis, followed by P. elegans. The LCC decreased from 29% in September 2010 to 1% in October 2010 due to a mass coral mortality caused by harmful algal blooms. The growth rate of P. damicornis (26.0 ± 8.9 mm year-1) and P. elegans (27.9 ± 4.5 mm year-1) did not show significant differences between depths or location in the reef. Conclusions: The exuberant Playa Blanca coral reef experienced a sudden drop in LCC similar to those described by Glynn et al. (1983).

Identifying and recording coastal biodiversity is essential to assess ecosystem health, changes and the extent of biodiversity loss. Coastal tropical habitats such as coral reefs and seagrass beds have been the research focus for scientists during the last decades; however, other ecosystems have been neglected, such as macroalgae forests, subtidal (20-30 m deep) sedimentary bottoms, and rocky reefs. Objective: Our study reports the marine biodiversity associated with rocky reefs, coral reefs, Sargassum forests and sedimentary subtidal bottoms (20-30 m deep), in a tropical seasonal upwelling area (Santa Elena Peninsula, Santa Elena Bay, and Murciélago Islands, Costa Rica). Methods: During the ‘Santa Elena Expedition’ (April 21-May 2 2018), a total of 28 sites were visited in order to record the biodiversity across four different habitats (rocky and coral reefs, Sargassum forests, subtidal sedimentary bottoms), using SCUBA and both systematic surveys and visual assessments; in some sedimentary bottoms a 20-minute dredge tows were done. Results: A total of 254 taxa were identified, being bony fishes the most diverse group (91 species), followed by gastropods (25 spp.), red algae (21 spp.) and anthozoans (19 spp.). We report four new records for the Pacific mainland of Costa Rica, including the subclass of tube-dwelling sea anemone (Ceriantharia). Conclusions: Our results show that Santa Elena Peninsula, Santa Elena Bay, and Murciélago Islands harbor uncommon and unstudied habitats, such as Sargassum forests, sedimentary bottoms, reefs constructed by the stony coral Pavona gigantea –which is very unusual– and rocky reef communities dominated by calcareous colonies of polychaetes (Salmacina tribranchiata).",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Coral reefs | Eastern Tropical Pacific | Sandy bottoms | Sargassum forest | Área de Conservación Guanacaste,13567,NA,R-SINAC-ACG-PI-022-2018,MarViva Foundation,0,FALSE,NA,NA,19

Objective: The objective of this study was to characterize the spatio-temporal variability of the main hydrographic parameters through measurements in situ during the period 2017-2019. Methods: Eight measurement campaigns were carried out, where a CTD probe was deployed to perform vertical profiles in 23 stations distributed throughout the GP, to characterize the variations in temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll concentration. Results: A minimum in surface and bottom temperature associated with upwelling caused by the wind was found in the first period of the year. The increase in salinity was associated with the decrease in temperature, being its highest value in the first period of the year, decreasing until reaching a minimum in November. The maximum chlorophyll concentration ​coincided with the lowest surface temperatures and the minimum oxygen values were associated ​with the minimum bottom temperatures, both occurring during the upwelling season. The parameter distribution was similar on dry and rainy seasons in stations located inside Bahía Culebra, likely attributed to the bathymetry effect. Conclusions: Bathymetry determines a south-north asymmetry for salinity and temperature. Subsurface cooling events coincide with strong wind periods. Upwelling influences the surface and bottom hydrographic dynamic in GP and determines the seasonal variability.

The SSST is fundamental for the interactions of the ocean-atmosphere interface and influence marine biological processes. Zooplankton studies in the North Pacific are scarce and have been focused on the composi-tion, abundance and biomass of macro and mesozooplankton in Culebra Bay. No works on zooplankton has been carried out northward of Papagayo Gulf. Objective: To analyze the variation of the zooplankton in Bahía Salinas at different scales in response to oceanographic-atmospheric conditions. Methods: during 2011, 2012 and 2013, mesozooplankton was collected in seven stations following a coastal-ocean gradient to determine abundance, biomass, and community composition. CTD casts were also carried out in each station. Hourly data of the Sea Subsurface Temperature (SSST) were obtained from June 2003 to December 2017. Results: The annual surface temperature in Bahía Salinas was lower in December-April with a secondary mini-mum in July and higher in May-June and August-November. The cold, neutral and warm events determined by anomalies in the SSST, presented a distribution of the temperature in the water column with horizontal stratification, vertical mixture and homogeneous, respectively. The spatial distribution of zooplankton did not show significant differences and the variation of the total average abundance and biomass showed a similar behavior during the study period, with less variation in the first year compared to the second one, being the copepods the predominant category for all the dates. On a seasonal scale, a general pattern of variation between dry and rainy seasons was not observed, and copepods and others zooplankton groups were the categories that presented differences. On an intra-seasonal scale, abundance and biomass showed an inverse relationship with SST. Copepods and gelatinous zooplankton (GZ) were differentiated in all events. Conclusions: The zooplankton of Bahía Salinas respond differentially at different scales to the climatic conditions that affect the SSST of the region. The classification of the sampling dates into events allows character-izing different profiles in the water column it also allows to define the variation patterns for mesozooplankton that reflects short-term adaptation as a function of variation in environmental conditions.

Methods: The study was conducted in Bahía Salinas and Golfo de Santa Elena in 2013. In January, four rocky reefs were visited; while in February three rocky reefs and one Sargassum bed were visited. We identified the macroinvertebrates and conspicuous fish species through underwater visual census methods (timed swim and band transects). The mean density of each species was estimated through band transects method. Results: A total of 25 invertebrates and 34 fish species were identified. We found a high number of species of invertebrates (23) and fish species (33) in rocky reefs, but few species on Sargassum beds (eight invertebrates and ten fish species). Species composition differed between marine ecosystems.

The Munk’s devil ray (Mobula munkiana) is endemic to the Eastern Pacific, but yet little is known about its biology, ecology, and habitat use. As filter feeders, it is assumed that this species concentrates at high-productive upwelling regions, such as the Costa Rican Dome. Like many elasmobranchs, its populations are highly depleted and require urgent information to inform better conservation measures. Objective: The study was conducted to gain information on a unique behavior observed in juvenile M. munkiana, so further information can be provided on early life stages of this vulnerable species. Methods: From June to September 2017 and in August 2018, the feeding behavior of juvenile Mobula munkiana was observed in two shallow bays located at Punta Descartes, North Pacific Costa Rica. Individuals were captured using a non-lethal method to obtain data on size, weight, and sex distribution. Plankton samples (n = 100) were taken at both bays throughout the months to infer diet composition. Results: Munk’s devil rays showed a repetitive swimming movement parallel to the beach, feeding exclusively in the shallow breaking zone of the low tide waves at depth <50cm. A total of 12 M. munkiana (11 live and one found dead) indicated a juvenile feeding aggregation ranging from 490 – 610mm in disk width and 1400 – 2300gr in weight. The sex ratio (males to females) was 3:1. Zooplankton of the order Mysidacae was found in the highest abundance in the breaking zone. Conclusions: The specific behavior and seasonal occurrence of juvenile Munk’s devil rays in this area seem to be driven by prey abundance. More research is needed to conclude the presence of reproductive adults at deeper depths and the year-round habitat use of Punta Descartes. The area is threatened by unsustainable development and requires realistic management strategies to guarantee the survival of vulnerable species and their critical habitats.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Feeding | Juvenile | Migration | Mobula munkiana | Munk’s devil ray | Prey abundance,13567,NA,undefined,NA,0,FALSE,NA,NA,27

The knowledge about the diversity and the diverse biological processes that occur in such environments is, however, quite limited on a regional scale. Objective: Quantify, describe and compare (on a regional scale) the ichthyological diversity associated with the rocky intertidal zone of the Guanacaste Conservation Area (ACG), Costa Rica, as well as to evaluate and discuss some biogeographic and ecological patterns. Methods: A total of 49 tide pools were sampled between 2014 and 2019, at seven locations within the ACG. Data on absolute diversity (presence/absence of species) were obtained, in addition to some ecological data (residence status, development stage (s), trophic guild, aggregation and cryptic habits and generalized geographic distribution), these data were compared with published records from other surveys/inventories carried out at various locations (20) along the Eastern Pacific coast. Through a similarity analysis, both possible clustering patterns between localities (according to their species composition) and previous hypotheses of regionalization, under a biogeographic perspective, were evaluated. Results: A total of 67 species of bony fish were recorded in the rocky intertidal area of the ACG, being this the most diverse locality (with published data) in the Eastern Pacific. The components/categories “transitory” with 30 species (44.8 %), “juveniles” with 38 species (55.9 %), “carnivores” with 47 species (70.1 %), “solitary” with 32 species (47.8 %) and “endemic to the ETP” with 66 species (98 %), were dominant (in terms of the total number of species) within the ACG. The results of the similarity analysis supported the biogeographic division scheme, defined a priori; with the localities within the Californian, Cortez, Mexican, Panamic and PeruvianChilean provinces recovered as highly consistent groups. This structure is consistent with the effect of barriers such as the sandy gaps of Sinaloa and Central America, among others, limiting the flow of species between biogeographic units. Conclusions: The ACG has a high ichthyological diversity associated with its rocky intertidal zone, which is product of a unique combination of factors at the regional level. The results of this study reinforce the need to carry out more basic and applied studies with the aim of helping to better understand and know different key aspects of the dynamics and physical-chemical-biological processes occurring in intertidal zones, of its associated biological diversity, of its importance within the marine-coastal landscape as a continuum and of the possible effects that these environments could suffer due to the impact of human activities.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Biogeography | Central America | Eastern Tropical Pacific | Fishes | Ichthyofauna | Tide pools,13567,GDFCF,808B9-508,Guanacaste Dry Forest Conservation Fund,0,FALSE,NA,NA,28

This data collection remained constant until January 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: Identify cold and warm events of the sub-surface temperature of the sea in the Gulf of Papagayo, Guanacaste, Costa Rica and their relationship with known sources of climate variability as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and synoptic systems such as incursions of cold fronts in the Caribbean Sea. Methods: Sea Subsurface Temperature data corresponding to the lowest temperature of the seawater column were used, at an approximate depth of 25-35m. Observations were made daily, from 01/01/2011 to 01/31/2020. Results: The mean temperature was 25.7 °C. Cooler temperatures were observed in February-March, below 22.5 °C with a secondary minimum in July. There were two peaks in May and August with temperatures above 27.4 °C. The drops during cold events reached 16-17 °C. All cold events were associated with the passage of cold fronts through the Caribbean Sea, due to reinforcement in the intensity of the trade winds, with a zonal component from the East, which causes seasonal upwelling. The warm events presented temperatures at their maximum of 30-31 °C. The latter events were associated with the development and maturity of warm El Niño-type ENSO events. ENSO is an important modulator of sea temperature variability in the Gulf of Papagayo, since El Niño events are related to positive anomalies in sea temperature in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Conclusions: The Citizen Science initiative presented in this study proved to be very useful for monitoring sea temperature in the Gulf of Papagayo. The results of this study indicate that Dive Masters can provide data on sea temperature of sufficient quality and with high temporal resolution. Divers can profitably support monitoring and Citizen Science can contribute positively to social well-being by influencing the questions that are being addressed and by giving people a voice in local environmental decision-making.

Sea temperature in Bahía Salinas could be modulated by synoptic and other large-scale systems. This region belongs to the Central American Dry Corridor (CADC), a sub-region in the isthmus that is relatively drier than the rest of the territory, which extends along the Pacific littoral from western Guatemala through northern Costa Rica. Objective: To study the warm and cold events that could be inferred by studying the sea subsurface temperature in Bahía Salinas, and also analyzing the large-scale conditions and synoptic systems of the historical sources when they occurred in order to identify the atmospheric mechanisms that favored their appearance. Methods: A Sea Subsurface Temperature Index was calculated using hourly data from seven stations located at three different points in Bahía Salinas. Records range from June 19, 2003 to December 5, 2017. Additionally, six meteorological stations, with hourly wind records, were used to create two wind indices. The Sea Subsurface Temperature Index was used to identify the warmest and coldest events in the bay. Wind indices and monthly meteorological bulletins were used to analyze the large-scale conditions and synoptic systems in which cold and warm events occurred in Bahía Salinas. Results: Mean sea temperature in Bahía Salinas is 25.2°C. Colder temperatures were observed in February- March, below 21°C. There were two maxima in May-June and August-October with temperatures above 27°C. In four of the five cold events studied, Northeasterly wind anomalies were observed in the Costa Rican North Pacific, associated with trade wind reinforcements; meanwhile westerly anomalies were observed in all the warm events, associated with weaker trade wind conditions. Conclusions: The main seasonal climate driver in Bahía Salinas is the North Atlantic Subtropical High because its latitudinal migration is associated with the strength of the trade winds over Central America. Seasonal upwelling is modulated also by two synoptic scale climate features, the boreal winter arrival of cold front outbreaks and the winter maximum of the easterly Caribbean Low-Level Jet.

Objective: In this study, we aim to describe the diversity of ascidians in Costa Rica from new samplings in Área de Conservación Guanacaste, North Pacific, and by compiling previous reports for the entire country in order to improve the group’s state of knowledge. Methods: Samples were collected during two field trips between 2018 and 2019, at six sites within the Gulf of Santa Elena and three sites near the Murcielago Islands area. The specimens were dissected and analyzed in detail to determine the species. All the identifications were compared with the available information from literature and from museum collections. Literature, collections databases of the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution and the new material collected were used to create an updated taxonomic list. Results: A total of eight species were obtained from 70 specimens. Of these, five are new reports for the country, which increase to 22 species the total number reported for Costa Rica. The most common species was Rhopalaea birkelandi, whose presence was higher in Santa Elena Bay. Conclusions: This study improved the knowledge of ascidian diversity in Costa Rica. Polyandrocarpa anguinea, reported for the first time, is considered invasive in other areas, which suggests the necessity of a continuous monitoring of its population.

Objective: The potential for emission reductions and carbon sequestration in forests and cocoa agroforestry systems in the Munguidó river sub-basin in Colombia was estimated. Methods: Three land use systems were selected (primary forest, secondary forest and AFS with cocoa). Eighteen temporary sampling plots were established, six per system, to measure trees (diameter at breast height-dbh ≥ 10 cm) and cocoa shrubs. Aboveground biomass was quantified with allometric equations and a carbon fraction of 0.5. Carbon fixation in secondary forest and AFS with cocoa was estimated as the ratio of carbon stored to its age. Carbon loss from primary forest was estimated based on deforestation for Chocó and that sub-basin (0.6 and 0.3 %/year, respectively). An analysis of variance and LSD Fisher mean comparison was performed to determine differences in carbon storage and carbon sequestration between uses. Results: Primary Forest stored more carbon than secondary forest and AFS with cocoa (190.1, 22.3 and 5.3 Mg/ha, respectively). The carbon fixation of secondary forest and AFS with cocoa did not differ (2.23 vs. 1.33 Mg/ha/year). In 20 years, the primary forest would present an emission reduction of 1.4-2.6 Tg CO2; and the secondary forest and the PFS with cocoa would present a sequestration of 100.8 and 30.7 Gg CO2, respectively.

Methods: We captured bats with mist nets from sunset to sunrise in three study sites (tropical dry forest, wet forest, and rainforest) to calculate activity patterns of the species using Kernel density estimation. We used the superposition coefficient (Δ1) to compare activity patterns between (1) bat assemblages of study sites, (2) fru-givorous species in the same site, and (3) populations of the same species among different sites. To determine whether the overlap in the activity patterns was related to the ecological similarity of species, we evaluated the association between Δ1 and similarity in abundances and body mass and phylogenetic closeness. Results: We found geographical variations in the overall activity patterns of the assemblages of the three localities. Likewise, we found variations in activity patterns between species at each study site and between populations in different study sites. Overlap in activity patterns tended to decrease as species were phylogenetically more closely related and similar in abundance and body size.

Results: We found that traps containing sardine baits collected a greater abundance of ants, whereas non-baited traps collected a greater richness of ant species. On the other hand, litter collections captured the largest number of exclusive species, presenting a different species composition from the pitfall traps (with and without baits). In general, baited traps showed greater abundance in more degraded locations, while manual collections and unbaited pitfalls captured more individuals in preserved environments.

Our study included seven species of bark beetles, 52 species of the genus Pinus, and 19 bioclimatic variables from Worldclim dataset. Results: We identified 140 potential interactions between Dendroctonus and Pinus species, of which 42 % have not been previously registered. Complex inference network analysis allowed us to characterize ecological parasite-host interactions in generalists and specialists. Regarding the ecological niche analysis, we determined potential bark beetle distributions by combining Pinus species ranges and climatic variables as predictors. We noted that climatic variables contributed negatively to Dendroctonus distribution for the most species, i.e. these abiotic variables are restrictive in almost the entire distribution of the beetles; conversely, biotic variables (i.e. Pinus species) were positive and informative on the most of species ranges. Conclusions: Coexistence patterns of bark beetles and Pinus provide us information on the interactions that are able to establish among these species and that until now can be unknown. In addition, integrating biotic (hosts) and abiotic (climate) factors, allows us to obtain geographic distribution models that characterize the regions with favorable conditions for the presence of bark beetles, as well as the host species with which they could be interacting in those regions. Considering the phytosanitary risk due to bark beetles, our results provide geographic and ecological scenarios where bark beetles infestations may occur, as well as the possible emergence of new parasite-host interactions. These models can be a tool to address future fieldwork efforts to validate and complement our results.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Conifers | Data mining | Forest health | Infestations | Insects,13567,CONACYT,undefined,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,38

Objective: Analyze the composition, diversity, and structure of tree vegetation that develops in calcium outcrops (yesales) and their edaphic conditions compared to those present in the adjacent secondary vegetation (VS). Methods: Plots of 1 000 m² were used, 14 in yesales and 3 in VS. For soil sampling, we obtained a sample composed of each plot, and estimate pH, electrical conductivity (EC-salinity), % of calcium carbonates (CaCO3), organic matter (OM), phosphorus (P) and nitrogen content (N). The difference in species composition was esti-mated by similarity analysis (ANOSIM). We used rarefaction and extrapolation methods to standardize sample, and estimate diversity by Hill numbers (q = 0, q = 1 and q = 2). Linear regression was used to determine the relative influence of edaphic characteristics in diversity, average diameter, and height. Results: Soils in yesales presented low concentrations of OM, P, and N, with high values of EC-salinity and high percentages of CaCO3. In yesales, 6 443 individuals were recorded in 54 species and in the secondary vegetation 594 individuals and 62 species, the species composition being significantly different between both conditions. Diversity, average values of height, and diameter were significantly lower in yesales regarding the secondary vegetation, these differences were significantly related to edaphic conditions. Conclusions: Tree vegetation in yesales has a composition like the sub-evergreen forests of Calakmul. Small sizes in the arboreal individuals are related to the high percentage of CaCO3 and the high EC values, which partly condition the low availability of OM, N and P affecting the growth of the trees. This study supports the idea that precarious edaphic conditions have a negative influence on the diversity and horizontal and vertical structure of tree vegetation.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Karst | Rarefaction and extrapolation curves | Similarity | Species composition | Species richness,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,39

Golfo Dulce is a relatively pristine and accessible deep tropical ecosystem that provides opportunities for comparative and collaborative research. Objective: To summarize published reports on past research conducted in this ecosystem, identify topics for further study, and suggest new research issues. Methods: A search was made on the web for reports based on research conducted in Golfo Dulce and published in scientific journals. Reports focusing on environmental parameters and on the biota were included. Results: A total of 123 studies that include data from Golfo Dulce are cited. The four topics more frequently addressed were reports based on the results of the R/V Victor Hensen expedition (1993-1994) and follow-up work on microbiology, studies on water parameters, research on vertebrates, and zooplankton studies. The reports focusing on vertical profiles of oxygen and temperature are discussed in detail, followed by those on the biota. Conclusions: Golfo Dulce has low oxygen concentrations below 50 m and is frequently anoxic at the 200 m deep basin with occasional formation of H2 S. However, the ecosystem contains a relatively high diversity of identified organisms, from bacteria to whales. Of particular relevance for future studies are multidisciplinary surveys aiming at obtaining data on primary productivity, the diversity and biomass of the main groups of planktonic, demersal and benthic organisms, and the frequency and magnitude of the influx of deep offshore waters over the sill into the basin. These data, as well as the information gathered in the past, are essential for updating the trophic model developed more than 25 years ago and in support of new predictive models on the functioning of the ecosystem.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Anammox | Anoxic basin | Beggiatoa | Cetaceans | H  S 2 | Hypoxia | R/V Victor Hensen | Water parameters,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,40

Embryological and phylogenetic studies in the family indicate a trend towards reduction of the gynoecium and ovules, the morphology of which supports the current circumscription of Tribe Gaiadendreae (Gaiadendron and Atkinsonia). Molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that Nuytsia, Atkinsonia and Gaiadendron diverged successively, forming a grade at the base of the Loranthaceae, but support values are low. Objetive: In the present study, the floral anatomy of Gaiadendron punctatum was investigated in order to provide additional data to permit comparisons among the three basal-most genera in the Loranthaceae and reevaluate their relationships. Methods: Flowers of G. punctatum were collected at different developmental stages and serial sections were prepared and analyzed by light microscopy. Results: Inflorescence development is acropetal; the flowers are bisexual with an inferior ovary surmounted by a calyculus, a ring-shaped structure lacking vascular tissue; the ovary is comprised of seven basal locules, each with an ategmic, tenuinucellate ovule. Above the locules is a mamelon that is fused with the adjacent tissues. The androecium is comprised of seven epipetalous stamens, the anthers with fibrous endothecium dehiscence through a single longitudinal slit, releasing tricolpated pollen. Conclusions: The results of this study show that Gaiadendron and Atkinsonia share versatile, dorsifixed anthers, while Gaiadendron and Nuytsia share the same mode of anther dehiscence. On the other hand, Gaiadendron shares with members of Tribe Elytrantheae an amyliferous mamelon and an unvascularized calyculus.

However, little is known of the seed mass maturity (high seed germination, low seed fresh weight and low seed moisture content) in this species. Objective: Assess seed germination in the laboratory of H. perotensis during seed development and along the floral stalk (infructescence) in two sites one in rocky location and another near a lake. The hypothesis was that there is a time after flowering in which seeds have highest germination and fresh weight and that the apical, centre and base of the infructescence are different in seed germination and fresh weight in both sites. Methods: Capsules were collected in two sites one in rocky land (Frijol Colorado, Perote, Veracruz) and another near one lake (Alchichica, Puebla), in the months of August, September and November 2016 and January 2017. A repeated measure design (RMD) was used to analyze the effects of infructescence section on seed weight, moisture content and seed germination (41, 87, 152 and 215 days after flowering). Each evaluation time comprised five replicates, each one with 15 seeds. Results: Difference in seed germination, seed weight and moisture content between sections of the infructes-cence was not significant. However, significant differences were found not only between first and last sample dates, but mainly between first and second dates. Eighty-seven days after flower pollination seed moisture content was lower than 20 % and up to 80 % of seed germinated in both sites of sampling. Conclusions: In this study it was found that the moisture content of H. perotensis seed can be used as an indicator of the physiological maturity of the seed and it is also related to germination of the seed.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Ecological restoration | Germination | Infructescence | Moisture content | Seed weight,13567,CONACYT,undefined,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,42

Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of aerial rope bridges in restoring habitat connectivity for arboreal species in Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica, while preventing electrocutions by determining 1) what species are using the rope bridges and 2) whether wildlife prefer to use rope bridges instead of other hazardous structures that cross the roads (such as telephone cables, which are often in close proximity to electric wires). Methods: From January to May 2016, nine rope bridges along the highly-trafficked main road that extends from Quepos to Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica, were monitored using camera traps, and ten rope bridges were observed directly along a paved side road off the main road. Results: A total of 11 species were seen using the bridges, and 1 540 crossings were witnessed via camera traps and observations (1 234 via camera traps, 306 during observations). Results from a paired t-test showed no significant difference in the average number of individuals crossing the road via rope bridges versus telephone cables (t(8) = 1.027, P = 0.334). Conclusions: Rope bridges are used by a variety of arboreal wildlife species with a high degree of frequency; however, due to the equally high usage of telephone cables by arboreal wildlife, they are insufficient to prevent wildlife electrocutions on their own.

This taxonomic group shows an alarming population decline; therefore, its reproductive biology is one of the greatest topics of interest for its conservation. Objective: To describe the testicular morphology and the spermatogenetic lineage cells in adult males of Atelopus laetissimus, Atelopus nahumae, and Atelopus carrikeri in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia. Methods: During June – July 2017 and 2018, sampling was conducted in the localities of San Lorenzo and Páramo Cebolletas, Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (SNSM), to collect 15 adult males, 5 per species. Testes samples were fixed in Bouin to be processed by the standard paraffin-embedding technique. Histological sections (3 μm) were stained with Hematoxylin-eosin and Mallory-Heidenhain-Azan-Gomori’s. For the description and photographic register of the germ cells, the photonic microscopy technique was used with the differential interference contrast system. Results: The testes are oval organs, compact, light yellow color, and with little vascularization. Externally, they are surrounded by a thin albuginea tunic constituted by regular dense connective tissue. Inside this layer, they are composed of numerous seminiferous tubules of hexagonal contour, in which germ cell cysts are distinguished at different stages of spermatogenesis (spermatogonia I and II, spermatocyte I and II, and early and late spermatids) and spermiogenesis (spermatozoa in fascicles and free spermatozoa). Separating the seminiferous structures is the interstitial tissue in which Leydig cells and blood vessels stand out. Additionally, in the cranial part of the testis, the Bidder’s organ was found, formed by two distinguishable regions, the cortex and the medulla. In the cortex, there are previtellogénic oocytes of different sizes surrounded by a monolayer of flat follicular cells. For its part, the medullary region is the connective tissue that nourishes the oocytes and is constituted by blood capillaries. Conclusions: The gonads of the three species analyzed present a cystic cellular organization similar to other anurans, where all stages of spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis were identified, possibly indicating a con-tinuous reproductive activity.

Objective: Evaluate the diversity and genetic structure of natural populations of S. mombin in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, through microsatellite molecular markers in order to assist in the implementation of conservation strategies and the collection of genetic resources. Methods: A total of 139 S. mombin individuals were sampled in ten natural populations. PCR amplifications were performed with seven fluorescence-marked microsatellite primers. Genetic diversity was evaluated by the number of alleles, expected (He) and observed heterozygosity (Ho), polymorphic information content (PIC), fixation index (ƒ), rare and exclusive alleles. The genetic structure was evaluated using AMOVA, UPGMA dendrogram and Bayesian statistical analysis. Results: 46 alleles were amplified, which had an average of 6.6 alleles per locus. He was higher than Ho and f was positive, indicating the presence of inbreeding. The PIC ranged from 0.048 to 0.700, and only two loci were poorly informative. We found 27 rare alleles and 16 unique alleles. The largest component of variation was intrapopulational (90.64 %). The estimated gene flow was 1.99, which indicates that there is no genetic isolation between populations, and justifies the FST value (0.0963). The ten populations were grouped into two groups, and two populations constituted an isolated group. The Mantel test demonstrated that the genetic structure is not related to the geographic distance between populations.

However, no studies are evaluating how these insects are affected by changes in the surface tension of the water. Objective: To determine the effect of soapy water on the locomotion ability of three species of neotropical semiaquatic hemipterans. Methods: From August to November 2020, we conducted ex situ experiments, with nine groups of ten individuals of the family Veliidae (N = 90) and Gerridae (N = 90), where each group individually, was subjected to the entry of soapy water for three minutes. For this, we designed an aquarium consisting of three plastic boxes at different heights, connected to each other, so that a current flow was generated. We used powdered laundry soap, liquid hand soap, and bar soap for dishes. For each type of soap we prepared a low (9 ppm), medium (50 ppm) and high (200 ppm) concentration. By means of recordings, we recorded the time the hemipterans spent in the water, as well as their ability to get out of the water, and whether or not they sank. Results: We found that, regardless of the type of soap, the time spent by hemipterans in contaminated water decreases drastically as the concentration increases, but the impact varies by species, with Rhagovelia solida (family Veliidae) being less affected by pollution compared to Platygerris caeruleus and Potamobates uniden-tatus (family Gerridae).

A relative importance value index (IVI) identified the most important and, therefore, probably invasive taxa. Methods: During 2017 and 2018, roadside vegetation was documented with 4-6 transects every 300 altitudinal meters, from 0 to 2 100 m, for a total of 37 transects. Each transect consisted of five 1 m² plots. All herbaceous species were registered and alien taxa identified. A cluster analysis distinguished grouping of species based on elevation. The potentially invasive species were identified by their IVI, based on the sum of relative frequency and density values. The influence of environmental variables was analysed with a canonical correspondence analysis. Results: Most alien species were grasses; other families were represented by one or two species. The species were grouped into three main clusters. The first group included rare species, the second consisted of species restricted to higher altitudes, and the third group were tropical taxa with a distribution from sea level to medium altitudes. The most important potentially invasive species were: Urochloa maxima, Melinis repens, Eragrostis ciliaris and Cynodon dactylon, all African grasses introduced for grazing. The IVI of the species was related to tree cover, leaf litter depth and surface stone cover for some species and, for others, to soil compaction, distance to major roads and elevation. Conclusions: The alien ruderal species clustered according to the general climate (temperate vs. tropical). Grasses of African origin are of highest concern as invasive species. Although most introductions are related to human disturbance, each species becomes dominant under certain environmental conditions. Thus, management programs must be specifically adjusted to each individual invasive alien.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Environmental variables | Exotic plants | Invasive herbs | Ruderal weeds | Sierra de Manantlán,13567,UDG,undefined,Universidad de Guadalajara,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,50

There are many management and conservation programs for this species, and assessments are necessary to identify nesting trends and effectively manage current conservation programs. PROTORMAR-UAS is a Research and Conservation program for the olive ridley turtle created by the Autonomous University of Sinaloa, Mexico. The program utilizes two biological stations: Santuario Playa Ceuta (SPC) and Playa Caimanero (PC). Objective: To evaluate the nesting trend of olive ridley turtles on two beaches in Northwestern Mexico and to predict prospective nesting trends for the next 30 years. Methods: Using annual nesting data collected over 40 years at SPC (1976-2016) and 30 years at PC (19862016), we evaluated nesting trends, hatching success, predation and poaching of olive ridley turtles on the two beaches in Northwestern Mexico. Then, prospective nesting estimates for the next 30 years were calculated predictive time series model. Results: A positive and significant correlation was identified between the number of annual nests and time for both beaches (rho = 0.850, P ≤ 0.01 for SPC; rho = 0.677, P ≤ 0.01 for PC); the average hatching success rates were 65.09 at SPC and 60.72 % at PC. The predictive time-series model indicated that the numbers of nests will continue to increase through 2045, increasing three-fold at SPC and six-fold at PC with respect to the last year of monitoring. Conclusions: There was a clear positive trend in the number of olive ridley sea turtle nests at both sites, which is consistent with trends found in other recent studies from the region. Therefore, we suggest that PC be designated a legally protected nesting area since it is located within the latitudinal limits of olive ridley nesting and given the need for resources for camp operation considering increased nesting and current problems with predation and poaching. Because in Mexico operating a nesting beach without any protection status implies not having a budget for its management.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,Hatching success | Nests | Olive ridley turtle | Poaching and predation | Sea turtle conservation,13567,UAS,undefined,Universidad Autónoma de Sinaloa,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,51

Methods: We estimated the Importance Value Index (IVI) to select the most important canopy-dominant species associated to C. costaricensis; we constructed height and Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) frequency distributions for those selected species according to IVI as well as for C. costaricensis population; we computed the asymmetry of the frequency distributions through the coefficient of skewness and the probability density function via the Kernel density estimation. We tested for differences between canopy-dominant tree species and C. costaricensis population structure by the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results: C. costaricensis individuals presented the smallest heights and intermediate DBH sizes as compared with the canopy-dominant species, with statistically significant differences for height but not for DBH according to the Wilcoxon test. Most of the tree fern individuals were located in uneven terrains and over the base slope of the terrain; canopy openness and Total Radiation Under the Canopy values were similar to those reported for Cyathea species elsewhere. Conclusions: We confirm the hypothesis of comparable structure between the canopy-dominant species and the C. costaricensis population only for DBH; on the contrary, for trunk height, there were statistically significant differences; the small heights of C. costaricensis suggest their coexistence in the understory through sheltering from the taller canopy-dominants.

The land crab Cardisoma guanhumi is an artisanal and subsistence exploited species in Puerto Rico. However, the growth patterns and sexual maturity of the local populations are not known. Objectives: This study has a double objective: (1) to compare the size and sex structure between populations and (2) to model the relative growth of structures related to reproduction to estimate the average size of morphometric sexual maturity (MSM) for both males and females. Methods: A total of 2 849 specimens were captured from nine dispersed populations on the island between 2001 and 2020. Carapace width (CW) was measured as an estimator of the absolute size of all individuals, together with the propodus length (PL) in males and the abdomen width in females (AW). Differences in length structure between sexes and populations were tested by applying goodness-of-fit tests based on Kernel Density Estimators (KDE). The relative growth pattern was modeled adjusting a spline from which the maximum of its second derivative was calculated as an estimator of the MSM, and bootstrapping was used to generate confi-dence intervals. Results: Differences were found in size structures, between sexes, and between sites. Our estimates of morphometric sexual maturity resulted in a sexual maturity size for males between 57.9 and 79.0 mm CW, while in females, morphological maturity occurs between 43.8 to 51.5 mm CW. Conclusions: We found inter-population differences in body size that can be attributed to differences in the history of changes of land use and the exploitation biased towards larger individuals, though differences in recruitment should also be considered. Current regulations in Puerto Rico protect female crabs but not to larger male crabs. The regulation establishes that crabs smaller than 64 mm carapace width cannot be captured, leav-ing immature male crabs over 64 mm CW unprotected. We suggest considering different size limits depending on the sex of the crab. This will allow the full range of sizes where sexual maturity is reached to be protected, increasing the likelihood of the population’s size to increase.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Fisheries | Juey | Land-use change | Management recommendations | Mangrove | Reproductive biology,13567,DRNA,undefined,"Departamento de Recursos Naturales y Ambientales, Gobierno De Puerto Rico",1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,53

Consequently, it is necessary to identify the vulnerability of ecosystems in long term and quantify the losses that are generated at different scales, as a result of the intense events of rain and strong winds. Objective: Determining behavior and recovery status in a secondary forest directly affected by Hurricane Otto in Boca Tapada, Pital, San Carlos, Costa Rica. Methods: Ten 20 x 50 m sampling units were systematically distributed within a secondary forest affected by Hurricane Otto in Boca Tapada, San Carlos. The current condition of the forest was evaluated, the species that received the most damage due to high winds were identified, as well as those that have the capacity to recover through regrowths. An overflight was carried out with an unmanned aerial vehicle and an orthomosaic was constructed, subsequently digitized, and classified according to the state of the forest cover presented in three evaluated moments, initial condition, after logging and the condition at the time of sampling. Population density, diversity, and basal area, were compared to data obtained in an adjacent primary forest also affected by the passage of Hurricane Otto. Results: It was obtained that 69.5 % of individuals with d ≥ 5 cm are in good condition, 20.3 % were broken in the tree canopy and 12.7% inclined without exposure of the roots. The family that provided the greatest species richness is Fabaceae, which is the same with the greatest abundance of damaged individuals and the one with the highest number of species with the ability to resprouting. The species that suffered the most damage was Couma macrocarpa (Euphorbiaceae). The initial area of forest cover was reduced by 7.63 % due to logging and 44.25 % due to Hurricane Otto. It was determined that there are significant differences in species diversity (P = 0.0004; α = 0.05) and in the density of individuals (P = 0.0011; α = 0.05). The secondary forest has the highest average in both cases. There are no significant differences in the values of the basal area (P = 0.6951; α = 0.05). Conclusions: 30.5 % of the forest mass was affected by the passage of Hurricane Otto and the Fabaceae family plays an important role in forest recovery.

We expect limited coordination between above and below-ground functional traits due to a single conservation-acquisition trade-off cannot capture the variability of functions and environmental pressures to which the root system is subjected. Methods: We measured 12 functional traits belonging to 38 seedling species in a tropical dry forest in Colombia. We explored the relationships between pairs of traits using Pearson correlations, and to obtain an integrated view of the functional traits, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. Results: The results showed limited evidence of linkage between above-and below-ground traits, but we did find significant correlations between traits for the continuum of conservative and acquisitive strategies. Root traits related to water and nutrient take capacity formed an orthogonal axis to the acquisitive-conservative continuum. Conclusions: Our results showed that dry forest seedlings have different functional strategies to cope with water deficit.

Cryptothecia sp. possessed the highest importance across sites. More than 87 % of the species are rare. The combined IVI of the top three families were: 36, 48.5, and 74.8 % in the young and old forests and the Cypress plantation sites, respectively. Overall, Arthoniaceae is in the top three families. The young forest had the highest species richness, but the old forest presented the best evenness. Similarity and diversity indexes suggest a particularly low resemblance in the lichen communities but a smooth gradient differentiation between the three forests, which was confirmed by the NMDS test. The homogeneity test identified great differences in ecological importance and composition. Conclusions: This region contains a distinctive assemblage of species resulting in a strong community differentiation by site, reflecting the influence of ecophysiological and microclimatic factors that define lichen establishment and survival and suggesting a great regional beta diversity, within a fragmented landscape. Greater connectivity and passive restoration strategies resulted in greater diversity and a more heterogeneous community structure on both forests than the corticolous community of the abandoned plantation.

This bacterial pathogen is transmitted through the ingestion of endospores, which are challenging to eliminate due to intrinsic resistance to a variety of chemical disinfection agents. The well-characterized laboratory strain CD630 displays low virulence, has not caused outbreaks, and is highly susceptible to disinfectants. Nonetheless, a closely related strain termed NAPCR1 caused outbreaks in Costa Rica and later became endemic in many hospitals from this country. This strain causes disease through unusual mechanisms and is genotypically distinct from CD630. Consequently, its epidemic potential could be influenced by as yet unknown spore phenotypes, such as increased resistance to disinfectants. Objective: To determine whether the NAPCR1 strain is more resistant to a conventional and highly effective C. difficile sporicidal agent than strain CD630 and to identify potential explanatory mechanisms at the genomic level. Methods: We used an in vitro dilution-neutralization method to calculate the sporicidal activity of sodium dichloroisocyanurate (DCC) against purified spores from three subtypes of NAPCR1 isolates (LIBA-2945, LIBA5761, and LIBA-6276), CD630, and a representative of the highly virulent and epidemic NAP1 strain (LIBA5758). This phenotypic characterization was complemented with a genomics-steered search of polymorphisms in 15 spore-or sporulation-related genes. Results: Whereas DCC at a final concentration of 0.1 % (w/v) eradicated CD630 endospores with high efficacy (log10 reduction factor (LFR) ≥ 5), it only partially inactivated NAPCR1 (average LFR range: = 1.77-3.37) and NAP1 endospores (average LRF = 3.58). As hypothesized, the three NAPCR1 subtypes tested were more resistant to DCC than strain CD630 (ANOVA, P < 0.05), with LIBA-5761 showing the highest level of DCC resistance overall (ANOVA, P < 0.05). All three NAPCR1 isolates showed large deletions in bclA1. Besides, isolates LIBA5761 and LIBA-6276 had deletions in bclA2. Conclusions: Our in vitro tests revealed a differential resistance of spores from the C. difficile NAPCR1 strain to DCC. They highlight the importance of continuously evaluating the efficacy of deployed disinfection agents against circulating strains and hint to a potential role of structural proteins from the exosporium in resistance to disinfectants in C. difficile.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Bacterial endospores | Disinfection | Exosporium proteins | Sporicidal agent,13567,NA,FI-094-13,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,63

We studied the vegetative and reproductive phenology of the endangered palm Ceroxylon quindiuense along an altitudinal gradient in the Central Cordillera of Colombia. Objective: We describe the leaf production rate, and flowering and fruiting cycles, and calculate food offer for the fauna, as a tool for the proper management of the palm. Methods: At each sampling site (2 400, 2 600, 2 800, 3 000 m.a.s.l.), we marked 40 adult individuals (20 pistillate, 20 staminate), which we followed bimonthly for 24 months. We studied leaf production by counting fallen leaves. We followed flower and fruit production through observations with binoculars and photographs. Results: Each adult individual produced, on average, one leaf every 69 days. Although isolated individuals flowered throughout the year, most palms flowered synchronously at each elevation in October 2016-August 2017 and in August 2018-February 2019 and had ripe fruits 7-13 months later. Flowering started at 2 600 m, followed by 2 800 and 3 000 m. Palms at 2 400 m, the lower limit of the palm stands in the area, showed a singular behavior, with scarce flower and fruit production, some individuals that changed sex, and a higher proportion of pistillate palms. Each palm produced 1-11 (x̄ = 5.3, SD = 2.2) inflorescences and 1-10 (x̄ = 5.3, SD = 2.2) infructescences. The average number of fruits per infructescence was 4 465 (SD = 1 488). With an estimated population of adult palms between 256 000 and 600 000 and an overall ratio of pistillate: staminate individuals 1:1 or 1:2, total fruit production in the area during each fruiting period is estimated as 2.0-7.1 billion fruits.

In the natural habitat, unsatisfactory nutritional stage of numerous individuals is an expression of unfavorable factors. Objectives: Determine spatio-temporal variations in the nutritional condition of lobsters Panulirus argus, relate them to variations reported in the benthic community, and to demonstrate, through the application of analytical and morphometric indices, that variations of environmental factors affects both groups of indices due to its potential magnitude and its generalized nature. Methods: Lobsters were captured at six sites. Nutritional condition was estimated by three non-destructive, inexpensive and quick indices also easy to apply, which it means extensive indices: blood refractive index (BRI), relationship between total weight and total length (K), and condition factor (CFA). Because there are no historical records of BRI, longterm variations (60 years) were determined using morphometric indices (Klt and CFA). Data from the periods 1963-1964 (N = 29 001), 1983-1993 (N = 3 123) and 2011-2017 (N = 3 600) were analyzed, separating them in the rainy and dry seasons. Results: In all the periods the nutritional condition varied significantly between sites, but without similarities between periods. Despite this, it increased progressively in three sites. This indicates that factors impacting nutritional condition have a stochastic influence that is constantly changing, which is more characteristic of environmental factors than anthropogenic factors. Although the three indices showed a lower nutritional condition in 2017, only BRI gradually decreased between 2011 (16.6) and 2017 (14.2), which suggests that this index, and the morphometrics (Klt and CFA), express different information. All correlations were statistically significant but greatest coefficients were established between morphometric indices. The total weight and the Klt index did not show differences between rainy and dry seasons. However, BRI and CFA were statistically greater in dry season, a fact that was found for each sex. Both CFA and Klt decreased slightly (P > 0.05) between the first (1963-1964) and the second (1983-1993) period and then increased (P < 0.05) in the current period (2011-2017). Because they both are morphometric indices, this was attributed to the presence of greater weight lobsters. Conclusions: The lowest values in 2017 and gradually decreasing trend in BRI, corroborate the generalized nature of the environmental deterioration in the Gulf of Batabanó, but this was not equally expressed by the three indices.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Batabanó | Morphophysiological indicators | Nutritional indices | Spiny lobster,13567,CONACYT,undefined,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,65

Intensive livestock farming within the forest remnants is considered one of the main causes of these degradation processes. However, domestic ungulates could also be fulfilling the role of seed dispersal for some wild species. Objective: To evaluate the role of goats as seed dispersers of woody species and the possible consequences of their feeding behavior on the vegetation structure. Methods: Between December 2016 and June 2017, we collected goat feces from pens (N = 38) and vegetation plots (N = 42) from three locations of dry forest in the Southwestern Ecuador. All the seeds found in the feces (N = 13 326) were recorded and taxonomically identified. To evaluate the effect of gut passage on seed germination, we sowed the seeds found in the goat feces from the pens and seeds collected directly from parent plants. Results: Goats dispersed seeds from ten species, of which at least 50 % are legumes. Acacia macracantha seeds represented ca. 70 % of seeds present in goat feces. The passage of seeds through the digestive tract of goats significantly improved the percentage and speed of germination in Albizia multiflora, Piscidia carthagenensis and Ziziphus thyrsiflora, while in Choroleucon mangense and Prosopis juliflora no germination was registered. We did not find a correlation between the richness of established trees and the number of species found in the goat feces (χ2 =-0.23, P = 0.53). The composition of dispersed seed species in the feces did not show a dependency on the locality, although the composition of the established vegetation changes between localities. The frequency of seeds in the feces did not show a relationship with the tree abundance in the established vegetation. Conclusions: Goats can play, at least partially, the role of locally extinct wild ungulates, improving the germination of legume species with hard coat. However, this positive effect can be blurred by their feeding behavior and high preference for particular species, which can modify the dominance of some species, and result in changes in the composition and structure of the vegetation.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Chronic degradation | Defaunation | Domestic ungulates | Endozoochory | Germination | Livestock | Seed dispersal,13567,UTPL,undefined,Universidad Técnica Particular de Loja,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,66

Methods: The sample collection was carried out from March to September 2018, covering both the rainy season (January to July) and the dry season (August to December). For the biometric analysis, 95 adults and 21 hatchlings were used, in which the length and width of the carapace and plastron, height of the shell, and weight were measured (adults only). For the geometric morphometry analysis, 21 adults and 13 hatchlings were used, in which 27 coor-dinates of anatomical landmarks were inserted in each image of the carapace and 11 in the plastron. Hatchlings were sexed by histology which was enabled by the identification of the ovaries and testicles. Results: The results showed the existence of dimorphism in adults. The plastron and height were higher in females, which had a more rounded carapace than males. This characteristic may be related to the species’ sexual strategy, where males impose copulation. Histologically, it was possible to identify the ovaries and testicles in the hatchlings, but there was no anatomical sexual difference, despite the tendency to differentiate in the analysis of carapace PCA.

The El Gavilán Formation is a sedimentary sequence mainly made up of shale interbedded with limestone, with abundant invertebrate fossils, deposited in an open shelf marine environment. Objective: The main objective of this research work is to describe the species Ubaghsicystis cf. U. segurae for the first time in Mexico, in addition to biostratigraphic and paleoecological considerations. Methods: A composite stratigraphic section of the El Gavilán Fm. was measured in central Sonora, where samples corresponding to eocrinods were collected, the material was examined in the Microscope Leica MZ10. Results: The biotic association is composed of reticulosan sponges, chancelloriids (Chancelloria eros, Allonnia tintinopsis, Archiasterella sp.), hyolithids, brachiopods, trilobites (Quadragnostus depressa, Peronopsis sp., Tonkinella valida, and Elrathina sp.), and echinoderms (Ubaghsicystis cf.

There are problems measuring size, and measurement bias that interferes with many tagging methods used to estimate growth. There also are problems with the use of natural growth lines and com-monly used software to estimate both growth and mortality from size-frequency data. An interesting puzzle is that echinoderms may show negative senescence with mortality rate decreasing with size.

Objective: This work sought to characterize functional aspects of the phycoperiphytic community of four lotic systems of the La Planada Natural Reserve, located in the Department of Nariño, Colombia. Methods: In May 2019, between one and three sampling sites were established in each river. Hydrological and physicochemi-cal variables were measured. Periphyton was sample to determine the taxonomic composition of the benthic algae as well as some functional traits. From these traits, the community weighted mean (CWM) and community weighted variance (CWV) were calculated, and their relation with abiotic variables was explored using regres-sions, correlations, and a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Results: 59 genera of algae were recorded, from which 47 had its functional traits measured. The CWM of the siliceous exoskeleton trait was statistically higher in El Tejón creek. The other traits had similar CWM and CWV values in all rivers. However, the traits of the presence of mucilage and organization in filaments showed predominance in some streams. The fluctuating data of CWV in all rivers seem to indicate that these phycoperiphytic communities have no resource limitations, competition is low, and species tend to be functionally different. The environmental variables with the greatest influence were flow, water mineralization, pH, and water transparency. The hardness of the water and the presence of mucilage were associated, while the predominance of filamentous algae was related to transparency; pH positively influenced the surface/volume ratio (S/V).

Proboscis bat (Rhynchonycteris naso) is a protected species by Mexican law, whose foraging and roosting areas are strongly associated with bodies of water, primarily rivers. Therefore, alterations in the water quality pose a risk to their populations. However, knowledge of the current state of their populations and roosting ecology is very poor in Mexico. Objectives: To locate and to describe R. naso’s diurnal roosts, and to evaluate the relationship of the group size per roost with the characteristics of the diurnal roost, the salinity and pH of the water where they inhabit. Methods: From March to October 2015, we searched diurnal roost through boat tours along rivers, streams, and lagoons, in eleven sites in the Laguna de Términos Flora and Fauna Protection Area, Campeche, Mexico. For each localized roost, we recorded the group size, and their spatial distribution, the type of roost and vegetation, the distance between roosts, the diameter of trunk, the salinity, and pH. In order to investigate the effect of the variables recorded in diurnal roost on size group, generalized linear models were adjusted. Results: We found 48 diurnal roost in dead tree-trunks, tree bark and bridges, associated with freshwater, and oligohaline bodies, mainly in mangrove vegetation. The average size of the groups was 5.3 ± 0.48 and 22.6 ± 9.54 in natural and artificial roosts, respectively. We found a significant relationship with the type of roost, type of vegetation and diameter of trunk. Roosts with larger groups of bats presented an aggregated distribution. We located 40 diurnal roosts on freshwater bodies and eight in oligohaline with a high grouping level. Conclusions: Greater incidence of roost in fresh and lightly acid water is explained under optimal foraging theory. Because the study area is found in the limit of their distribution, mangrove is a very important vegetation type to guarantee the establishment of R. naso populations. Also, due no roosts were found in some portions of the study zone, quality of water, and contaminant level studies are crucial.

Galls show a huge range of sizes, colors and ornaments, which vary even intraspecifically. However, galling insects are targets of various organisms that attack them directly or indirectly. In this con-text, to consider only one gall trait to investigate gall structure acting against only one guild of enemies can conceal an understanding of the community-level interactions. Objective: Herein, we take these ideas into consideration to investigate the conspicuous galls induced by Palaeomystella oligophaga Becker and Adamski 2008 (Lepidoptera) on Macairea radula (Bonpl.) (Melastomataceae) as a model system. We characterize this system through categorization of the different enemy guilds present in the community. We identified them to the lowest taxonomic level possible and determined the kind of interaction responsible for galling insects’ deaths. Considering the enemy hypothesis and the selection of secondary characteristics, we also aimed to determine which of the multiple gall traits influence the survival success of galling insects in a multi-enemy context. Methods: We inspected galls and characterized the enemy guilds affecting the galling insect and the mortality rates produced by each one of them. Next, we tested whether the distinct gall traits measured (parenchyma thickness, color, projections) promote galling insect survival with respect to each enemy. Results: The mortality induced by indirect enemies (organisms that interact with gall tissues and can interact secondarily with galling insect) was 47.3 %, being higher than that caused by parasitoids and predators (31.5 %). Despite the gall’s structural complexity, live galling insects showed the smallest occurrence (21.2 %). Parenchyma thickness was negatively related to Calliephialtes parasitoids, Gelechiidae cecidophages and predation signals. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the attacks to gall tissues by the cecidophages represented the highest threat to P. oligophaga survival, being higher than the mortality caused by direct enemies. That is, the gall traits were not as efficient as supposed to protect the galling insect from the attack of natural enemies. Nevertheless, we also demonstrated that parenchyma thickness can be negatively related to some organisms, especially direct enemies.

Results: The data indi-cate that wasps preferred to oviposit on fruits with a diameter of less than 8 cm, oviposition was more frequent between 11:00 am and 03:00 pm., and there was 26 % infestation of fruits, and 9 % of seeds. Conclusion: It is an obligatory interaction for the wasp, the highest proportion of attack on fruits was in the early stages of fruit development and control actions should focus on the protection of these early stages.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Adults | Larvae | Pest of Annonaceae | Plant-insect interactions | Pupae,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,73

Objective: To evaluate the spatial distribution of the catch of yellowfin tuna and non-target species by this fleet, and possible correlates with environmental and fishing variables. Methods: We applied geospatial statistics and multiple regression models to Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission data, covering from 2002 to 2011. We used a grid the size of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) with 1 124 cells of 22 x 22 km (unit of analysis), for a total of 11 240 year-cells. Results: The medium tuna (presumably immature for the most part), dolphins, mantas and rays dominated catches within the Thermal Dome (Northeast of the EEZ). Small tuna (all immature), sharks, billfishes, dorado, wahoo, and various small species were caught mostly in the extreme South. Large tuna (mature) was caught specially in the zone center, towards the east of the Submarine Mounts Marine Management Area and the Isla del Coco National Marine Park. Tuna, dorado, dolphins, mantas and rays showed high site fidelity due to their association with geographic and environmental variables, at the time small tuna was associated with sets on floating objects, and big tuna was associated with sets on dolphins.

However, estimating the size of each colony or group in roosts used by more than one species is particularly difficult, especially when recapture rates are very low (< 10 %). Objective: Estimate the colony size of 14 species of bats: one emballonurid, one natalid, four mormoopids, seven phyl-lostomids, and one vespertilionid, which roosted throughout one year (July 2016 to June 2017) in a mine and two caves-Cerro Huatulco and El Apanguito-in the Sierra Sur and Costa of the state of Oaxaca. Methods: We constructed capture-recapture histories per species and roost, and for species for which we obtained recaptures that represented at least 10 % of the captures, we used the probabilistic Cormack-Jolly-Seber model. In the case of species with no recaptures or with a recapture proportion lower than 10 %, we estimated the number of individuals per roost by applying the same proportion between the number of captured specimens and the estimated number for species with recaptures greater than 10 % and that they belonged to the same family or trophic guild. Results: The total estimated number of bats in the three studied roosts was 20 105. The highest colony size estimates were for the mormoopids Pteronotus fulvus and P. mesoamericanus from El Apanguito and P. fulvus from Cerro Huatulco, with 6 609, 4 092 and 2 212 individuals, respectively. Conclusions: The methodology used in this study allowed estimating the colony size for all registered species, even though only for 21.42 % the recapture rates were greater than 10 %.

Actuotaphonomy thus is a valuable tool for reconstructing fossil communities because it establishes analogies between observable processes in the present and those that happened in the past. Objective: The taphonomic attributes of a marginal marine environment were analyzed to assess the origin of fragmentation, bioerosion, and encrustation processes and the role of these characteristics in the deterioration of current sediment accumulations of mollusks (gastropods and bivalves). Methods: The material studied was collected from a shell-remain accumulation called “El Conchal” in the Laguna de Mandinga, Veracruz, a lagoonal complex located in the Gulf of México. Taphonomic analysis included fragmentation, bioerosion, and encrustation features on recent gastropods and bivalve’s shells. The categories of each attribute were classified in three degrees: poor, regular and good. The analysis was performed only in complete shells. Results: A bulk sample of 1 697.9 g was processed, recovering 1 165 complete specimens, of which 5 genera of bivalves and 4 genera of gastropods were identified. The fragmentation and bioerosion were classified as regular (grade 1), this may be the results of the water energy in the environment, that permits a constant rework, and exhumation of the remains at the lagoon’s water-sediment interface; meanwhile, three eroders were identified to ichnogenus level: Entobia, Oichnus, and Caulostrepsis, being Caulostrepsis the least abundant. The encrustation was classified as poor (grade 2); the result can be interpreted based on the ecosystem intrinsic conditions that do not allow many encrusting organisms to develop properly.

Objective: We aimed to characterize the morphological structure, the morphological adaptations in response to the daily flooding of the Amazon estuary and the biogeographic area of P. macroloba. Methods: Detailed description of the external morphology, from germination to the adult tree, was obtained from individuals located in floodplain forest, Northeast Amazonia. The occupation area and the geographical extension of P. macroloba were determined from point of geographical coordinates of botanical samples deposited in the digital collections of Mobot and SpeciesLink. Results: Adult individuals have adapted structures in response to daily flooding, such as: adventitious roots to increase respiratory efficiency and lenticels in the trunk, serving as a connection point for oxygen transport between the root and the aerial part. Dried fruit favours the activation of the explosive dehiscence mechanism, allowing the seed to be expelled long distance. Deltoid shape of the seed allows water fluctuation and more efficient dispersal. Seedling is phanerocotylar hypogeal and with one pair of reserve cotyledons that provide the seedling an extra source of energy to escape the flood. Germination rate was 78 % and the speed was 0.2 seeds.day-1. Circular buffer method revealed the presence of 123 subpopulations of P. macroloba distributed in a radius of 5 699 943 km² across the Neotropical region.

Then, we estimated the actual suitable habitat using land cover type layers. Finally, we analyzed the connectivity among the actual suitable habitat patches using single-patch and multi-patch approaches. Results: From the area of potentially suitable habitat estimated by the bioclimatic model, 74 % were urban areas that are unsuitable for Melozone cabanisi. The largest suitable patches within urban areas were coffee plantations; which also were crucial for maintaining connectivity between habitat patches along the species’ range. Conclusions: To preserve and protect the Melozone cabanisi, these areas must be taken into consideration by decision-makers in the present and future management plans.

One of the species useful for this purpose is the Montezuma baldcypress (Taxodium mucronatum Ten.), a long-lived species with well-defined annual rings, present along the riparian zone of the Rio Sabinas that constitutes a “proxy” of interannual and multiannual climate variability. Objective: develop a seasonal precipitation and maximum temperature reconstructions, and to analyze the influence of global circulatory modes on the species annual radial increase. Methods: Increment cores of the Montezuma baldcypress specimens were dated through dendrochronological techniques to produce a ring-width series. Climate gridded data from two databases were used to develop a response function analysis for climate reconstruction purposes. Results: A ring-width chronology extending from 1808 to 2018 (211 years) was developed and used to develop a seasonal April-June precipitation and a mean June-July maximum temperature reconstruc-tion. The driest period detected on the rainfall reconstruction occurred from 1815 to 1818 with 27.4 mm and a maximum temperature of 41.2 °C; while the wettest year was 1828 with 393.72 mm.

Females prior to oviposition flit irregularly around their host plant between 8.00 and 14.00 h and deposit their eggs on the upper and underside of leaves in isolation, most frequently on the underside. The duration of the cycle from egg to adult was 28.24 days. The average egg period was 3.75 ± 0.40 days. The larvae passed through five larval instars: the first instar 3.21 ± 1.03 days, the second 2.78 ± 0.73 days, the third 2.67 ± 0.77 days, the fourth 3.22 ± 0.81 days, and the fifth 4.61 ± 0.70 days. The prepupal period lasted 1.33 ± 0.49 days and the pupal period 6.67 ± 0.80 days; the adults hatched between 10:00 to 11:00 h. Adult males lived on average 31.80 ± 3.29 days, the female 42.00 ± 2.14 days and their eggs were parasitized by a microhymenopteran (Scelionidae). Conclusions: This study allowed to know the biological aspects of H. feronia feronia identifying its food plants of both larvae and adults, its oviposition behavior, as well as it has been determined that it has a relatively short biological cycle with a period of less than one month and its eggs are consumed by a small Hymenoptera that can hinder its production. This work provides necessary information to develop the breeding of H. feronia feronia, oriented to its conservation, environmental education and biotrade (tourism and handicrafts) in the Peruvian Amazon.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Eggs | Food plant | Larva | Life cycle | Oviposition | Parasitoid,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,98

Aphids are the main pest of pepper Capsicum spp. (Solanaceae) crops in Southwestern Colombia, due to their role as vectors of viruses. However, the identification of aphid species is complex, limiting the investigations performed to address their interactions with other organisms. Ants and aphids present a facultative mutualistic relationship, that promotes the growth of hemipteran colonies, for this reason, the study of the ecological mutualistic association between aphids and ants is important. Objective: The main objective was to discriminate the aphid species present in commercial crops of Capsicum spp., and to identify the ant community that attends the aphid colonies and its effects on the size of the aphid colonies. Methods: Aphid species, and their ant mutualist, were collected from Capsicum annuum and Capsicum frutescens, in the Cauca valley, Southwestern Colombia. We used the DNA barcoding approach to identify aphid species, and the ants were identified by morphology-based taxonomy. To evaluate the effect of ant care on the size and structure of aphid colonies, generalized linear models were calculated using as the response variables the total number of aphids for each colony and the pro-portion of nymphs. Results: The aphid species that attack pepper crops, are: Aphis gossypii and Myzus persicae (Hemiptera: Aphididae), with A. gossypii being the species that interacts with ants (19 ant species). A. gossypii colonies attended by ants had larger sizes and more nymphs per colony, than those not attended. Conclusions: Although the aphid-ant interaction is not species-specific, it is necessary to consider its role in the propagation of viral diseases in peppers and to determine how this interaction may affect regional biological control strategies.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Ants | Aphis gossypii | COI | DNA barcoding | Myzus persicae,13567,Univalle,BPIN-2013000100007,Universidad del Valle,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,99

However, the knowledge con-cerning hematological features is scarce, there is not much information that allows an analysis about the possible explanations of this physiological feature. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between immature red blood cells (RBCs) mitosis and the presence of blood parasites in amphibians. Methods: We sampled 116 amphibians (31 species) in six Colombian localities. Blood was taken by cardiac puncture or maxil-lary vein puncture. Smears were prepared, fixed, and Giemsa stained for microscopical analysis. The variables analyzed were the percentage of immature RBCs, mitotic cells in peripheral blood, and blood parasite infection. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon’s rank test and exact Fisher statistical tests. Results: Sixty-two individuals showed mitosis in peripheral blood, and these mitotic RBCs shared morphological features with immature RBCs. Overall, parasite prevalence was 30.1 %, distributed as follows: Trypanosoma (24.1 %), Hepatozoon-like (6 %), Dactylosoma (4.3 %), Karyolysus-like (0.9 %), and Filarioidea (2.6 %). A positive association between the percentage of immature RBCs and the presence of mitotic RBCs was found, and also between the blood parasite infection and the percentage of immature RBCs. Conclusions: In this study, we found that the presence of blood parasites, immature RBCs, and RBCs mitosis are frequent events in amphibians’ peripheral blood, and our analysis suggests an association between those features. Thus, the release of immature RBCs and the mitosis of those cells in peripheral blood may be a physiological response to blood parasite infection.

Objective: To analyze the antimicrobial activity of bacteria associated with the zoanthid Palythoa caribaeorum from the coral reefs of Carapibus, Paraiba state, Brazil. Methods: The phylogenetic analysis of the bacteria was conducted based on partial sequences of the 16S rRNA gene using molecular and bioinformatics tools. The anti-microbial activity of the 49 isolates was tested against four bacterial strains and one yeast strain: Bacillus cereus (CCT0198), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans (ATCC 10231). The antibiosis and antibiogram assays were conducted and the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) was determined by the microdilution method. Results: The bacterial isolates belonged to Firmicutes phylum (84 % of the isolates) and the Proteobacteria phylum (16 % of the isolates). Among the 49 isolates five genera were found, with the Bacillus genus being the most abundant (82 % of the iso-lates), followed by Vibrio (10 %), Pseudomonas (4 %), Staphylococcus (2 %) and Alteromonas (2 %). Antibiosis test revealed that 16 isolates (33 %) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of five tested reference strains.

Objectives: To describe and analyze the structure and micromorphology of the anthers and pollen grains of 10 elite genotypes of this important tropical species. Methods: More than 30 anthers of flowers in anthesis were taken of the 10 elite genotypes of T. cacao from the ex situ germplasm bank of the Suiza-Agrosavia Research Center (Rionegro, Santander-Colombia). The anthers with the pollen grains were fixated and processed according to the standard protocols for embedding and sectioning in paraffin. Sections obtained (3 μm thick) were stained with Safranin-Alcian blue to discriminate structures with primary and secondary walls and total polyphenols. Additionally, the samples were also stained with the PAS-Amidoblack technique was used to differentiate between structural and reserve polysaccharides as well as proteins. Toluidine blue staining was used for the determination of sporopollenin and polyphenols and finally Alcian blue-PAS-Hematoxylin staining was applied for additional descriptions. Observations were made using photonic microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy. For observa-tion with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) the anthers with the pollen grains were fixed and dehydrated in 2.2 Dimethoxypropane, then desiccated to critical point and finally coated with gold. Results: the anthers are dithecal and supported by a long filament made up of an epidermal stratum, parenchymal tissue, and a vascular bundle. The dehiscence occurs longitudinally through the stomium. The anther wall is made up of a monostrati-fied epidermal layer, followed by a layer of endothecial cells with lignified fibrillar thickenings, cellular rem-nants of tapetum and abundant orbicules can be seen covering the cavity of the microsporangia. The epidermal and parenchymal tissues of the anthers are abundant in polyphenols. Orbicules are generally spherical, psilated, and these exhibit the same staining and fluorescence reactions as exine from pollen grains. The pollen grains are monades, isopolar, small (16-19 µm) with circular amb, spheroidal, tricolpate with medium or short colpi (5-10 µm) with sculptured membrane, semitectate, reticulated, heterobrochate, sculptured or non-sculptured walls, with microgranules of different size or scabrate. The statistical analyzes showed that there are significant differences in the size of the pollen grains (P ˂ 0.05). It is observed that the smallest pollen grains are those of the TCS 19 genotype (16.890 µm) and are different from the other genotypes, and among these there are no significant differences. Only two genotypes (SCC 19 and SCA 6) showed pollenkit and only one has perforated walls (SCA 6). Conclusions: The structure and micromorphology of the anthers of T. cacao are similar to those described for other Malvaceae. Likewise, the pollen grains showed variations in size, ornamentation of the sporoderm and the lumen of the reticulum and the presence of pollenkitt.

Objective: the antioxidant activity of different genotypes of Theobroma spp. from Mexico was evaluated in order to distinguish promising qualities for genetic improvement, and to differentiate phylogenetic traits, considering biochemical variables. Methods: the amount of phenols, flavonoids and antioxidant activity was determined by ABTS and DDPH, in addition to the content of anthocyanins, theobromine and caffeine in four species of Theobroma L., and 50 genotypes derived from T. cacao. The results were analyzed using an analysis of variance, means test, principal component analysis and cladistic analysis. Results: there are highly significant differences between genotypes. The phenol content ranged from 7.5-85 mg g-1; flavonoids 6.57-69.6 mg g-1, antioxidant activity by ABTS of 17.3-86.1 and by DDPH of 40.0-53.3; anthocyanin content of 0.01-3, caffeine of 1.8-6.7-and theobromine of 2.9-9.8 mg g-1. Principal component and cladistic analysis helped explain the variation found and distinguish evolutionary characters and phylogenetic brotherhoods. The variation in content of phenols, flavonoids, antioxidant activity, anthocyanins, theobromine and caffeine was mainly due to the degree of domestication, while for the group of genotypes derived from T. cacao (forastero, trinitario and criollo) it was the origin of the seeds.

The h-index and total citations are greatly affected by how many studies are published, i.e. the region with more production is the one with higher values. The Neotropical articles showed a greater growth rate in the last decade, decreasing the gap between both regions.

Methods: The experiments were carried out using isolated chick biventer cervicis preparation subjected to field stimulation for muscle twitches recordings or exposed to acetylcholine and potassium chloride for contracture responses. Results: Poison (10 μg/ml) produced complete neuromuscular blockade in chick biventer cervicis preparation within approximately 70 min incubation (times for 50 and 90 % blockade: 15 ± 3 min and 40 ± 2 min, respectively; P < 0.05, N= 5); contracture responses to exogenous acetylcholine and KCl were unaffected by poison indicating no specificity with postsynaptic receptors or myotoxicity, respectively. Poison (10 μg/ml)induced neuromuscular blockade was not prevented by heparin (5 and 150 IU/ml) under pre-or post-treatment conditions.

This represents one of the principal causes of biodiversity loss in the world. Pangasianodon hypophthalmus is an introduced species in Colombia that shares life characteristics and habitat with endangered native species, such as Ageneiosus pardalis, Sorubim cuspicaudus, and Pseudoplatystoma magdaleniatum. However, its distribution is little-known, and scientists have barely explored the effects on the native fauna. Objectives: To evaluate the P. hypophthalmus invasive potential in some of the Colombian basins, which drain into the Caribbean Sea. Methods: Using records available in various databases, we performed a niche conservatism analysis between the native and introduced records of P. hypophthalmus using the R package Ecospat. Subsequently, we modeled the potential invasion area of P. hypophthalmus and the distribution areas of three native species, performing ecological niche modeling (ENM) using the Maxent algorithm. Finally, we calculated a geographic niche overlap between the non-native and native species. Results: The Ecospat spatial analysis indicated that P. hypophthalmus retains some environmental niche attributes through space. For this reason, we can use ENM as an approximation to its range of distribution in the invaded area. Our results using ENM demonstrated that the four species analyzed prefer low and slightly rocky regions; therefore, the geographical overlap of the three native species’ ecological niches and the introduced species exceed 80 %. Conclusions: There are adequate conditions in the study basins to fully establish the species P. hypophthalmus, representing a high risk for aquatic ecosystems and native ichthyofauna.

For variables such as relative humidity (RH) and air vapor pressure deficit (VPD), whose individual effects on tree growth can be underestimated, we hypothesize that such influences can be detected by removing the effect of collinearity between regressors. Objective: This study aimed to determine the collinearity-free effect of climatic variability on tree growth in the central Amazon. Methods: Monthly radial growth was measured in 325 trees from January 2013 to December 2017. Irradiance, air temperature, rainfall, RH, and VPD data were also recorded. Principal Component Regression was used to assess the effect of micrometeorological variability on tree growth over time. For comparison, standard Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) was also used for data analysis. Results: Tree growth increased with increasing rainfall and relative humidity, but it decreased with rising maximum VPD, irradiance, and maximum temperature. Therefore, trees grew more slowly during the dry season, when irradiance, temperature and VPD were higher. Micrometeorological variability did not affect tree growth when MLR was applied.

Methods: We identified factors affecting the vaquita, constructed life tables, derived demographic parameters for different scenarios and conducted a population viability analysis using stochastic age-structured matrix Leslie models. Results: Analytical results indicate that the vaquita net growth rate is particularly sensitive to juvenile survival. We find that intensive, ongoing bycatch in gillnets used to poach totoaba (Totoaba macdonaldi) over the past decade brought the vaquita population to its current critically low size. Currently this seems to be exacerbated by demographic stochasticity and a potential Allee effect.

In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified processed meats as human carcinogens, associated specifically with colon cancer. The increase in intake of processed meats, which are a low-cost source of dietary protein, varies by socioeconomic status (SES) and can impact chronic disease incidence. Objective: Examine the association between processed meats intake and (a) total protein intake, (b) inadequate protein intake, by SES. Methods: This study included a representative sample (N = 135) of women age 25 to 45 years, with one to four children, from three different socioeconomic groups who were residents of two counties from the Greater Metropolitan Area of San José, Costa Rica between June 2014 and March 2015. Using photographs, we examined women’s perceptions of the cost and perceived desirability of 12 different foods, including processed meats. Using 24-hour dietary recalls collected on three different days, and the ValorNut food composition database, we estimated total protein intake, in grams, and determined the intake frequency (times/day) of processed meat. Each women’s dietary protein requirement was estimated based on her bodyweight. Inadequate protein intake was calculated as the difference between protein requirement and actual intake. A linear regression model was used to determine the association between total protein intake in grams and intake frequency (times/day) of processed meat. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between low protein intake and intake frequency (times/day) of processed meat. Results: Processed meats were perceived as the least preferred protein source but were the third most commonly consumed protein source. Consumption of processed meats differed by SES and was lower in the higher SES group (P < 0.01). The most commonly consumed processed meats by SES were “mortadella” (low-SES), sausages (middle-SES), and sliced turkey/ham (high-SES). Processed meat intake was significantly associated with an increase in protein intake. There was an inverse association between SES and inadequate protein intake. Conclusions: Processed meat intake is associated with SES. Women may consume processed meats because they are perceived to be a low-cost protein source. Educational strategies are needed to help women identify their protein needs and meet those needs with healthier and affordable dietary alternatives.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Developing countries | Disparities | Mothers | Obesity | Protein intake | Urban region,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,111

Oxidative damage caused by UV can trigger inflammation, resulting in serious inflammatory skin diseases including eczema, seborrheic dermatitis, hyperpigmentation and ageing. Enzyme inhibitors involved in melanogenesis, such as tyrosinase, have been used recently for hyperpigmentation and skin diseases in cosmetic products. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tyrosinase activities and total polyphenolic contents of the different parts of P. americana fruit. Methods: The fruit was divided into exocarp, mesocarp, seed, and then methanol and n-hexane extracts were prepared. DPPH and ABTS free radical scavenging capacities and inhibitory potentials on lipid peroxidation were determined to investigate the antioxidant potentials of the extracts. Anti-inflammatory activities of the extracts were evaluated by measuring the stabilization level of the human red blood cell membrane. The tyrosinase inhibitory activities of the samples were determined using mushroom tyrosinase. Results: In general methanol extracts possessed remarkable higher DPPH free radical scavenging activities than n-hexane extracts. The highest activity was determined in methanol extracts of seed (4.17 ± 0.04 mg/mL) followed by exocarp (5.25 ± 0.05 mg/mL). Overall methanol extracts possessed higher ABTS free radical scavenging activities than n-hexane extracts. The greatest ABTS free radical scavenging activity was obtained in methanol extracts of seed (0.03 ± 0.01 mg/mL). In the antilipid peroxidation assay, the greatest activity was noticed in methanol extracts of seed (7.71 ± 0.36 µg/mL) followed by exocarp (12.12 ± 0.34 µg/mL), while all n-hexane extracts were inactive. Overall methanol extracts exhibited higher anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties than n-hexane extracts. However, the maximum anti-tyrosinase activity was determined in n-hexane extracts of exocarp (0.40 ± 0.01 mg/mL) followed by seed (0.46 ± 0.01 mg/mL). Conclusions: These extracts are promising candidates for use as natural products-based antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in inflammation-related disease, and also anti-tyrosinase properties in dermatological applications.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Anti-inflammatory | Anti-tyrosinase | Antioxidant | Avocado | Persea americana,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,112

The majority of the published works indicates that coffee is benefited from the mycorrhizal association, where the AMF confers protection against pathogens and diseases, increases water absorption, as well as it increases the adaptation of the plant at transplant from nurseries to the main plantation. Objective: A review was made where we summarized and analyze the research reports of AMF with coffee from at least the past 10 years, focused on AMF global species distribution, nutritional benefits of the association and interaction with pathogens. Methods: We retrieved available bibliographic data from coffee producer countries in public databases. We considered published works from 2000 to 2019, nevertheless, we included classic papers on the topic, outside that period, mainly the ones performed in Brazil since 1986. We organized the number of reported species per country, we look for synonyms, grouped them by family, genera and species. The reports that only reported genera or where ambiguous were used as reference but not considered for the final analysis. We summarized the reports of the benefits of the AMF interaction in coffee, as well as pathogen tolerance. Results: The collected data shows that there are more than 100 AMF species associated with coffee, which represents more than a third part of the total of reported species worldwide. We found that Colombia has the highest richness, but it also has the highest number of published reports. Conclusions: This information shows the benefits of the incorporation of AMF to coffee plantation programs, because these fungi are a key element in coffee plant nutrition, nevertheless, the coffee variety should be considered when introduc-ing AMF, as not all associations has been efficient.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Biodiversity | Coffee | Generalist species | Rhizosphere | Symbiosis,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,113

Methods: A checklist was elabo-rated based on an exhaustive literature search of the Echinodermata, and was complemented with taxonomical revisions of Ophiuroidea scientific collections. All the geographical coordinates of the records were validated. Results: The region harbors 187 species of Echinodermata: three Crinoidea, 35 Asteroidea, 67 Ophiuroidea, 32 Echinoidea, and 50 Holothuroidea. We detected 52 records in the literature that must be considered as invalid and five as doubtful. We provide 16 new records of Ophiuroidea from different states and islands; of them, four are new records for the region. Jalisco presented the highest number of species (84), followed by the coast of Nayarit (74), Michoacán (63), and Colima (55); among the islands, Revillagigedo showed the major number of species (85) followed by Marías (81), Marietas (48), and Isabel (44).

However, only a few species are considered edible and commercialized. The sea urchin Tripneustes depressus has generated the interest of producers in Baja California Sur, Mexico, due to the quality of its gonads. A biological basis for designing a management strategy is key to consider its commercial exploitation. Objective: To determine the reproductive season of T. depressus through description of the gonad stages and reproductive cycle, and to establish its relationship with environmental factors. Methods: We collected monthly samples (October 2016-September 2017), recording in-situ temperature and photoperiod. We evaluated a sample of 1 055 specimens for demographic characteristics, using total weight (g) and test diameter (cm). We also did a histological analysis of gonads from 178 individuals. Results: Average test diameter was 9.70 ± 0.03 cm (5-12.50 cm). Based on the proportion into the gonad of sexual (gametes) and somatic (nutritive phagocytes) cells, we propose five gonad stages (growing, premature, mature, spawning, and intergametic) for both sexes. There were two times of the year when gonads were heaviest and closely corresponded to the growing stage, coinciding with the highest proportions of nutritive phagocytes. Gonad development (growing and premature stages) peaks in the months with the longest daylight periods, with spawning in the shortest daylight periods. Conclusions: Gonad wet weight and adjusted gonad weight are good indicators of the reproductive season of T. depressus.

Its size is considered relevant because it is related to consumption rate. Objective: To describe the variability of the disk diameter and food type of the species in four sampling sites in the southern Gulf of California. Methods: Each site was visited on a monthly basis from February 2008 to March 2009. Disk diameter was registered from a total of 389 observed specimens. Measurements included only the main disk from side to side where the arms begin. A flexible tape was used to measure disk diameter. Three size groups were created for easier explanations: small (< 15 cm), medium (16-25 cm), and large (> 26 cm). From the total, only 298 asteroids were feeding. Preyed organisms were classified in hard corals, other invertebrates, and algae. The Simpson’s Diversity Index was used to calculate the probability that any specimen would be feeding on different types of organisms. A permutational analysis of variance was used to detect differences of disk diameter amongst months and study sites. Results: This population of Acanthaster planci had an average disk diameter = 18.23 + 0.21 cm, with a minimum of 7 cm and maximum of 36 cm. Size structure was unimodal and largely dominated by medium sized specimens, followed by small ones. The larger were less frequent. Disk diameter was statistically higher in February and lower in the last months of the year. San Rafaelito was the site with the largest and Ensenada de Muertos with the smallest organisms. Medium sized individuals were dominant throughout the year and sampling sites. The small sized fed significantly more on Porites panamensis and coralline algae and turf. Larger specimens had the lowest diversity values, more than 90 % of this size group fed on Pocillopora spp. and very few on macroalgae. Medium sized specimens showed the highest diversity, feeding on all the food types, although as expected, many of them were selective to Pocillopora spp. Conclusions: Acanthaster planci can be considered a medium sized species in the study area. There is an evident food selectivity regarding disk diameter size.

Results: The reproductive cycle of H. forskali in the Ría de Vigo is characterized by a sexual resting stage during spring, when temperature and daylight hours are lower; the beginning of gametogenesis during summer, when temperature is higher, daylight hours longer and the sea bottom is rich in nutrients; then, a period of spawns interspersed with a gonadal restoration during autumn and winter, when temperature is lower and food is scarce. Sex ratio is 1:1, however, the studied population is not synchronized, because females initiate maturation earlier.

Objective: To compare the basic morphology of R. pacifica and C. carib-aearum. Methods: We examined a total of 2 158 specimens of R. pacifica and C. caribaearum, selecting 50 to evaluate shape and size with linear regression and Principal Component analysis. We selected an additional 62 specimens per species to identify significant character correlations and morphological groups within species. Results: There is a direct relationship between Test length and Test width. Test height/Test width, and Total length (oral view)/Distance from the ambitus to the peristome apex, are the two main ratios to distinguish both species. C. caribaearum is more dorsoventrally compressed and has a round peristome base; versus R. pacifica has a tall and triangular one. There are four morphological groups of C. caribaearum and two groups for R. pacifica. Conclusions: These two species can be distinguished with reliable morphological characters, in which peristome shape suggests that R. pacifica is more adapted to burrowing deeper into certain types of substratum.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,Cassiduloida | Mexico | Morphometry | Neognathostomata,13567,CONACYT,666781,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,138

Nevertheless, they have almost never been used as biostratigraphic tools. Objective: To provide a refined stratigraphic frame useful for calibrating temporal dimensions of scutelliform diversity from Argentina and Uruguay and its correlation with the molluscan assemblages previously proposed. Methods: A detailed survey of their geographic and stratigraphic provenance was carried out. We revised both the bibliography and collections (institutional and from our own field work). Results: The group is represented by 14 species belonging to six genera, and four assemblages were identified. Numerical dates of the Neogene marine rocks obtained recently allowed their placement in a chronological scheme: “Iheringiella” sp. A is restricted to the late Oligocene, the genera Camachoaster and “Eoscutella” and the species Monophoraster telfordi to the early Miocene, Abertella gualichensis and Abertella miskellyi to the middle Miocene, and Monophoraster duboisi, Amplaster coloniensis and Amplaster ellipticus to the late Miocene. Non-lunulate scutelliforms are not restricted to the late Oligocene as previously supposed. The oldest occurrence of the genus Monophoraster cor-responds to the early Miocene, and along with Iheringiella are long-living taxa that embrace the 25.3 Ma-18.1 Ma (Iheringiella patagonensis) and approximately 15 Ma-6.48 Ma (Monophoraster darwini) intervals. The presence of Iheringiella in the early Miocene of northeastern Patagonia is corroborated, reaching there its north-ernmost distribution. Monophoraster darwini has a temporal range from the late Miocene (where it was previously thought to be restricted) back to the middle Miocene, since this is the species yielded in the well-known and discussed “Monophoraster and Venericor Beds”. Conclusions: The Paleogene-Neogene scutelliforms of Argentina and Uruguay range from the late Oligocene to the late Miocene. There is a good correspondence among the numerical ages, molluscan biozones and scutelliform assemblages.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Argentina | Echinoidea | Neogene | Paleogene | Sand dollars | Scutelliformes | Uruguay,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,139

Objective: To compare the development of Arbacia dufresnii in two different water temperatures and in progeny with varying maternal origins. Methods: We induced A. dufresnii females and males from Nuevo Gulf to spawn, collected the eggs of each female individu-ally (progeny), separated them into two seawater temperatures (12 and 17 °C), and fertilized them. We recorded the percentage of fertilized eggs and embryos per developmental stage according to time, temperature and progeny. We measured larval growth by total length (TL) and midline body length (M) according to time post fecundation (DPF), temperature, and progeny. Results: Temperature did not affect fertilization, but embryo development was faster and more synchronized in the high temperature treatment. The generalized linear models indicate that embryo development depends on a quadruple interaction between the embryonic stage, time (h), seawater temperature and progeny. Larval growth was faster, producing larger larvae at the highest tempera-ture. Larval growth depends on a triple interaction between time (DPF), seawater temperature and progeny. Conclusions: We found a temperature and progeny impact during embryonic and larval development and, in both cases, these factors generate a synergistic effect on developmental timing and larval size. This probably provides a survival advantage as a more rapid speed of development implies a decrease in the time spent in the water column, where the sea urchins are vulnerable to biotic and abiotic stressors.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Early life stages | Echinoderm | Echinoidea | Larval growth | Parental provisioning | Thermal effect,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,140

A significant number of the new marine natural compounds discovered have contributed to solving some of the problems of humanity, mainly those related to human health. Objective: The purpose of this research is to evaluate the bactericidal and fungicidal activities of the methano-lic extract of sea cucumber Holothuria princeps collect from the bay of Cispatá in the Colombian Caribbean, in addition to chemically identifying its fatty acids. Methods: A methanolic extraction was performed from the collected biological material, by the cold maceration method. The extract obtained was fractionated using chromatographic techniques and the fatty acids were obtained, which were derivatized and identified by means of gas chromatography in coupling with mass spectrometry. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the methanolic extract of Holothuria princeps was performed through the microdilution method against reference strains and clinical isolates. Results: We found 16 fatty acids present in Holothuria princeps according to the analysis of their mass spectra. Antibacterial activity showed that Enterococcus faecalis was the most susceptible to the extract at low concentrations, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the highest at the higher concentra-tions. In antifungal treatment, the fungus with the highest inhibition was the clinical isolate of Candida albicans (blood sample). Conclusions: Taking into account previous studies in the genus Holothuria, it is considered that the environment plays a fundamental role in the presence and diversity of fatty acids. The evaluation of the antibacterial activity against reference strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis demonstrated the existence of a considerable effect in the reduction of bacterial growth by the extracts applied, mainly at low concentrations (less than 1 000 ppm). On the other hand, the antifungal activity against the reference strain of Candida albicans and the clinical isolates of Candida albicans (blood sample) and Candida krusei (catheter sample), the extract showed that the best results were presented at higher concentrations (above 1 500 ppm).",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Antibacterial | Antifungic | Chromatography | Echinodermata | Lipids | Mass spectrometry,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,143

Thus, it is imperative to understand their spatio-temporal kinetics in lotic environment with reference to regional climatic variabilities in the tropical inland waters. Objective: In-situ studies were conducted to examine the changes in phytoplankton biomass in lower Ganga basin as influenced by various environmental parameters under regional climatic variability during 2014-2016. Methods: Firstly, the most key influential environmental parameters on riverine Chl-a concentration were determined. Then the direct cascading effect of changing climatic variables on key environmental parameters were derived through modeling and quantified probable changes in mean Chl-a concentration in the lower stretch of river. Results: Only five environmental parameters namely water temperature, total dissolved solid, salinity, total alkalinity and pH were key factors influencing Chl-a (Multiple R2: 0.638, P < 0.05). Present estimates indicate that if the present rate of regional climatic variability over the last 3 decades (mean air temperature + 0.24 °C, total annual rainfall-196.3 mm) remain consistent over the next three decades (2015-2045), an increase in mean Chl-a by + 170 µgL-1 may likely be expected grossly reaching about 475.94 µg L-1 by the year 2045 or more.

However, this can be affected by biotic or abiotic conditions. Objective: To analyze if the consistency in cell morphology offered by the cytocentrifugation method, might be used as a convenient tool to study echinoderm coelomocytes. Methods: Cells of Echinaster (Othilia) brasiliensis (Asteroidea), Holothuria (Holothuria) tubulosa (Holothuroidea), Eucidaris tribuloides, Arbacia lixula, Lytechinus variegatus, and Echinometra lucunter (Echinoidea) were spread on microscope slides by cytocentrifugation, stained, and analyzed through light microscopy. Additionally, fluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy were applied to cytospin preparations, to complement the analysis of granular and colorless spherulocytes of Eucidaris tribuloides. Results: Altogether, 11 cell types, including phagocytes, spherulocytes, vibratile cells, and progeni-tor cells were identified in the samples analyzed.
