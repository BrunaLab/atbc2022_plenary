At middle to high shore levels, oystercatchers avoided 3 abundant but small-bodied snails, and fed primarily upon larger size classes of 2 other, large-bodied herbivorous molluscs. Pairs of birds averaged >80 prey items per low tide. This predation rate significantly affected the local abundance and size structure of the 2 preferred species.

Between 13-21oC, pollination efficiency increased linearly with dusk temperature. As M. jalapa is capable of selfing, the breeding structure of the population seems to depend on temperature conditions, being mainly autogamous on cool nights and allogamous on warm nights.

An index of dispersion based on distances to nearest conspecifics (DNC) was used to infer tree spatial patterns. Clumped spatial patterns were predominant in all tropical forests (75-100% of species) and in one north-temperate forest (Smoky Mountains). In the two south-temperate forests and in Bryn Athyn random spatial patterns were more common (50-58% of species). Uniform distributions were rare in all forests. Examination of the overall distributions of DNCs revealed a marked and unexpected similarity between some tropical and north-temperate localities. South-temperate forests exhibited highest densities of trees and the smallest average DNCs. Differences in the proportions of random vs clumped spatial patterns among forests seem to be related to different histories of disturbance in the forests. Forests subjected to frequent, catastrophic disturbances should exhibit a predominance of random spatial patterns, whereas clumping should predominate in forests where canopy gaps are the major cause of structural change.-from Authors",69,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,3

Pistillate flowers are borne solitarily and appear receptive for 2-3 days. Staminate plants may produce >50 times as many flowers as pistillate plants. Both types of flowers are strongly fragrant. A single species of beetle, Formicomus braminus (Anthicidae, ant-mimicking flower beetles), appears to be the best candidate for an effective pollinator of nutmeg in S. India. The beetles are strong fliers, are active nocturnally around staminate flowers, and carry significant pollen loads. Pollen is the only evident pollinator reward. Pistillate flowers produce no reward, and spatial constraints of the perianth and stigma appear to prevent beetles from entering the flowers. Pollen carried on the beetle's head or body would be deposited on the stigma when the insect attempts to enter the flower.-from Authors",32,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,5

Relative to single-seeded fruits, double-seeded fruits have greater wet mass, area, wing-loading, and rate of descent in still air, and consequently are dispersed shorter distances under field conditions. The proximal seed of double-seeded fruits has a smaller dry mass and usually has lower and slower germination than the distal seed. Unless multiseeded fruits more easily escape seed predation, there is no apparent evolutionary advantage to a parent of P. elegans producing multiseeded fruits. Their presence in low numbers appears to result from incomplete elimination or suppression of development of the multiple ovules after pollination. -from Author",20,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,7
