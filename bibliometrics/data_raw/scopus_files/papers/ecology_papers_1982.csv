P. longimembris avoids open areas and utilizes shrubs in a relatively coarse-grained fashion. D. merriami and D. deserti frequently traverse open areas at high speeds and hence utilize shrubs in a relatively fine-grained manner. Beneath shrubs, D. merriami and D. deserti are more active and discrete in their foraging than is P. longimembris; both Dipodomys search for large clumps of seeds, while P. longimembris forages slowly and continuously, taking individual seeds from scattered dispersions. The distinctive morphology of Dipodomys is interpreted as an adaptation that allows fine-grained use of desert shrubs in the face of high predation risk during intershrub transits. Differences in heteromyid body sizes may also reflect 2 foraging strategies: small size reduces energy demands, and thus lowers the need to move between shrubs and reduces the need for predator avoidance; larger size permits year-round activity (avoidance of torpor), reduces susceptibility to starvation, increases the range of thermal tolerance, and generally increases abilities to cope with variations in environmental parameters.- from Author",80,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,11,NA,NA

Gulls in meadow habitat fledged the fewest chicks per nest. Within habitats, chick survival was strongly correlated with early laying dates and high rates of growth, but there was also a large residual effect which was probably due to differences in the habitats.

The latter involved Vestiaria coccinea (the dominant) and subordinates Himatione and Loxops, with the preferred resources being trees with the highest numbers of flowers.

A total of 34 ant species in 5 subfamilies were observed, but plant species varied significantly in ant species richness. Number of ant species expected from equal sampling (40 inflorescences per Costus sp.) was 9 for C. pulverulentus, 13 for C. scaber, 15 for C. allenii and 20 for C. laevis. Among-species differences in ant species richness were not a function of plant distribution, the volume or composition of extrafloral nectar, or the duration of nectar flow. The number of ant species was positively correlated with inflorescence height, which varied from 0.6-2.0 m. The differences in ant species richness with inflorescence height were due primarily to the addition of arboreal ants, which increased from 3 species representing 3% of all ant species observations on the shortest plant, C. pulverulentus, to 12 species representing 62% of all ant observations on the tallest plant, C. laevis. The number of terrestrial ant species varied only from 6-8. High ant species richness and the similarity in nectar characteristics among Costus spp. suggest these are relatively generalized mutualisms with limited coevolution between the plants and their attendant ants.

Manual addition of pollen to flowers in the field did not increase number of fruit matured, suggesting that fruit production was not pollinator limited. Removal of rapidly growing fruit resulted in growth and maturation of fruit that normally would not have matured; resources thus limited fruit production.

The models predict an increase in seeds dispersed with an increase in fruiting display, with each of the models predicting a different behavioral response to increases in fruiting display. When empirical data were analyzed on a weekly basis, the null hypothesis was rejected and total reward energy on the tree explained the number of fruits eaten by birds and the number of seeds dispersed better than did number of fruits on a tree or reward energy per fruit.

During 1977 one of the worst droughts of this century occurred in the western United States. Number of breeding species declined most markedly during drought in aspen. Breeding communities on the forested plots during drought were least similar to predrought communities; pre- and postdrought communities were consistently most similar. Densities of singing males declined more markedly on all plots during drought than did number of species, and remained below predrought levels in 1978. Changes were also noted in avian trophic structure during drought: insectivores generally declined in number, nectivorous hummingbirds completely disappeared, and the number of granivorous cardueline finch species increased. These changes can be related to changes in food resources. During drought, insect species composition and densities changed, flower phenology was 5 wk early, and one of the best coniferous cone crops in 30 yr occurred in northern Utah. Direct effects of lack of water were observed, and many bird species probably experienced water stress. Although difficult to document, indirect effects of drought on food resources are suggested for insectivores, nectivores, and possibly carnivores.

For all insects successfully handled, prey body width was the best predictor of handling time in both species. The primary function of prey handling in these birds is probably to render prey swallowable. Thus gape size sets a limit to the largest noncrushable prey, and determines how much handling is required for malleable prey. -from Authors",42,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,62,NA,NA

Handling efficiency on different seed types was related to size of finch species. The 2 larger finch species generally ignored small seeds with low rewards, and the 2 smaller finches avoided feeding on seeds apparently too large and hard to crack. In G. fuliginosa, the smallest species, seed choice was correlated with seed depth within the range of seed sizes actually consumed. The proportion of its diet made up of given seed types was correlated with the profitability of patches within which these seeds occurred. Certain seed types providing low individual returns per unit handling time were highly profitable by virtue of their high density within patches. Conversely, large search times between valuable seeds diminished the relative profitability of respective patch types. Diet breadth of G. fuliginosa was investigated in relation to seasonal changes in food supply. Results on seed choice in relation to relative densities of seed types were ambiguous, but a slight shift toward feeding on smaller seeds in the dry season was detected. However, the shift could be explained by the greater profitability of patches of the small seeds in this season. These finches did not generalize their use of patch types, despite a large seasonal decline in food abundance. This contradicts a prediction of optimal foraging theory. Several possible explanations are discussed, including an hypothesis that when food was abundant finches selected a diet that was less than maximally efficient. -from Author",49,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,64,NA,NA

Ecological differences between the two populations during the food shortage may be linked to a phenotypic difference. Tobago A. tobaci had longer wings than Trinidad conspecifics, resulting in lower wing disc loadings (ratio of body mass to area swept out by the wings).

This was tested for a sample of 62 species of southern Spanish bird- dispersed plants; results fully conform to expectations. Species ripening fruits during the dry Mediterranean summer, when water demands of dispersers are highest, have the most watery fruits. Species producing fruits in winter, when energy needs of avian frugivores are at a maximum, possess fruits with the highest lipid content. No marked seasonal trend in protein yield of fruits was found, consistent with the fact that protein demands of avian dispersers appear to be fairly constant during the summer-through-winter period. Coupling between fruit quality and frugivores' needs is most likely related to coevolution between plants and birds. The significance of highly rewarding winter fruits for the evolution of some physiological and behavioral traits among overwintering dispersers points to the existence of a closely coevolved system involving the latter and the assemblage of winter-ripening Mediterranean evergreens.

In enlarged synchronous broods nestlings that subsequently died did so at a greater age than did those in asynchronous broods. Brood size frequency for synchronous broods, recorded 8 d after brood enlargement, deviated from that expected under a random mortality pattern, ie. mortality more resembled an 'all-or-none' type. Hatching success was not lower for larger clutches (provided that the eggs hatched synchronously); the parents showed great skill in raising enlarged broods, and these nests were not subjected to a much greater degree of predation than were nests that contained small clutches and broods.

More pairs that were provided with an artificial, large-size nest managed to raise a brood of 7 than did pairs that attempted to rear 7 in their own original nest.

Electroshocking of a 1220 m long experimental section kept trout stocks at 10-25% of this initial value during the summers of 1975-1978. Density of invertebrates in the benthos showed no consistent differences between the trout removal section and upstream and downstream control sections for most taxa examined. Drift density also failed to show an effect of the trout removal. Some taxa were significantly more abundant at one site than another, but this was attributable to changes along the stream gradient or differences in phenology among the sites. As trout stomach content analysis revealed very intensive grazing on a few taxa of aquatic insects, their failure to increase in the trout removal section was unexpected. Because of the variability of the system, a doubling or halving of numbers must occur to be detectable. Within these limits, it is concluded that removal of trout had no significant effect on the prey community. It is also likely that because streams do not provide areas where fish are predictably absent, the invertebrate community is highly adapted to fish predation and so is not sensitive to manipulations in fish density.-from Author",142,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,82,NA,NA

An adaptive topography is constructed showing that, with phenotype- and age-specific fecundity and mortality rates constant in time, evolution of the mean life history maximizes the intrinsic rate of increase of a population. However, the rate and direction of evolution in response to selection are strongly influenced by genetic correlations among characters. Negative genetic correlations among major components of fitness are often obscured phenotypically by positive environmental correlations, but commonly constitute the ultimate constraint on life history evolution.

Burrow length, home range area, perimeter, and number of adjacent neighbors were significantly higher for reproductive males than for females or nonreproductive males in the population. Spacing within and between individual burrow systems was uniform for all sizes and both sexes. Reproductive male pocket gophers relate to their neighbors in such a way as to increase the contact with potential mates, while all individuals, regardless of sex or reproductive condition, develop and maintain uniform internal spacing distances that are perhaps related to resource management. Males practice serial monogamy; instances were found of males and females sharing a common, deep nest between their individual burrows. This suggests a potential for parental care by males. Differences in plant production are possibly compensated for by altering burrow length rather than altering spacing. Plant production was approximately twice as great at one site as at the other. At the site of higher production, average burrow lengths were almost exactly one half those at the site of lower production. However, all values for spacing within and between individual burrow systems were statistically indistinguishable between the study sites. For both sites, the difference in burrow lengths appears to be attained by the addition of basic building units to a burrow, consisting of equal branch lengths and equal distances between branching points along a burrow. -from Authors",96,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,84,NA,NA

These models apply strictly to species whose ramets, because of developmental constraints, do not alter their apportionments of energy to seed production and vegetative growth as functions of age or position (central vs. peripheral) in a clone. The limiting prediction of these models is that the quantity ku2, where k is the rate of seed production per unit area occupied by a clone, and where u is the ultimate rate of radial spread of a clone, should be maximized. This prediction arises in both density-dependent and density-independent models, and is to a large extent independent of the mortality schedule of the plants involved. Both these features arise from the assumption that growth in these plants can ultimately be described by a power law. Generation of numerical predictions from maximization of ku2 requires the construction of ancillary theories describing the relationships among seed production, growth, and the energy devoted to each. The simplest assumption possible, that seed production and radial growth rate are each directly proportional to energy expended on them, yields the prediction that a plant should devote one-third of its postmaintenance energy to seed production and two-thirds to vegetative expansion.

Most small flowering individuals lack sufficient resources to mature a pod. A typical seedling passes through a juvenile nonflowering period and a flowering period when it functions solely as a male (all initiated pods are aborted) before it accumulates enough reserves to become functionally hermaphroditic.

Three results support the resource-partitioning mechanism: 1) Competition coefficients, obtained by dividing niche overlap values by the appropriate niche specialization values, are all less than one; this indicates that each population should inhibit its own access to a limited food supply more than it inhibits the access of the other populations. 2) The two-dimensional competition coefficients are slightly smaller on average than the product of single-axis means, suggesting two-dimensional complementary. 3) There are about the same number of consistent 3-yr trends in specialization and overlap as would be expected by change, suggesting a relatively persistent arrangement of odonate niches in niche space.

Where accessible to oystercatcher predation, limpets are unlikely to survive over winter once they reach moderate size (10-14 mm). Collisella pelta are exceptional in having a refuge in large size. Oystercatchers thus produce and reinforce patchy limpet distributions. Adaptations of the limpets include crypsis and habitat selection of settling larvae. Spatial heterogeneity on local, regional and broader geographic scales complicates these effects, especially since settlement behavior is constrained from making distinctions between all levels of heterogeneity, eg. between cliffs where limpets will be relatively safe and boulders where they are at high risk. Locally the effects of bird predation are most notable for Notoacmea persona, but N. scutum, C. digitalis and C. pelta are also consumed in significant numbers.

Over a wide range of depths, the rate of cell removal by limpets matches the rate of cell production by Clathromorphum.

Light availability was the most important environmental factor influencing among-plant differences in ratios of flower types and production of mature fruit, though variability of the former may also have had a large genetic component. Within inflorescences, bisexual flowers were most common basally, especially near the central inflorescence axis, and on the side of the inflorescence away from the branch bearing the inflorescence. Predator and pollinator behavior, and requirements for fruit support were potentially important in determining this pattern. Bisexual flowers tended to occur in inflorescences receiving most light, and having the most subtending leaves and greatest yearly twig elongation. Abundance of bisexual flowers through time showed 1) a strong negative correlation with intensity of predation on fruits produced from flowers borne at these times, 2) a negative correlation with intensity of predation on flowers, and 3) a positive correlation with probability of pollinator visitation.-from Author",31,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,146,NA,NA

Groups of Trigona (Trigona) ferricauda (Apidae: Meliponinae) arrived at flowers in early morning; each bee dominated a single flower that it perforated to rob nectar. Robbers in each patch aggressively defended their feeding sites from the sole pollinator of the plant, the hermit hummingbird Phaethornis superciliosus (Trochilidae: Phaethorninae). Less visitation by hummingbirds and reduced seed production resulted from nectar robbing. Flower number in patches was not associated with visitation per flower by pollinators, but patches having the most flowers were entered more often by P. superciliosus. In contrast, thieving P. longuemareus and robbing T. ferricauda showed no patch preference related to total flower number. Seed production per flower was not related to total number of flowers presented in patches at one time. Average proportion of robbed flowers through the entire flowering episode was 36% among 66 patches at one site and 35% among five patches at a second site. Reduced seed production was not caused directly by robber damage to flowers, but indirectly through successful deterrence of birds via joint attacks by bees on and near the flower visited by a hummingbird. Although fewer seeds were produced by robbed flowers overall, robbed and unrobbed flowers in patches that were heavily robbed did not differ in seed production. Thus robbing primarily influenced reproductive success at the level of the flower patch. P. dasypetala was self-pollinating, yet unrobbed flowers that were not bagged produced 67% more seeds than those not visited by P. superciliosus. Persistent robbing by Trigona may result in selective advantage for autogamous or apomictic P. dasypetala.-Author",130,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,147,NA,NA

Spring chydorid populations are limited by temperature. Summer populations, at least for abundant species, are limited by predation. Chydorid species are distributed patchily within Chara beds. Patchiness is moderate in spring, declines to low levels during summer, and peaks in the fall for most species. Patchiness remained about constant during the summer decline in density. Heterogeneity of the physical habitat is not a necessary cause of patchiness. In a Bray-Curtis-type ordination, the primary component of variation is due to temporal differences in abundance among species.

Recruitment was a major factor underlying population fluctuations and accounted for 75% of the variability in reproduction as indexed by the production of zooids by Membranipora colonies.

Experiments were performed to determine if a) fruit resulting from pollination by a particular plant mature more rapidly than do those resulting from pollination by other plants, and b) fruit resulting from mixed pollen loads mature more readily than those pollinated by a single plant. These ideas were also rejected. The hypothesis that fruit with a large number or percentage of fertilized ovules are selectively matured was supported by both glasshouse experiments and field observations. Percentage of fertilized ovules seemed to be more clearly related to fruit growth and maturation than was number of fertilized ovules.

Species presence information alone tends to bias the mean habitat toward the one where the most common species is found. If niche specialization is to be measured by distance from the overall mean habitat, each sampling station should receive equal weighting. The most straightforward measure of habitat breadth seems to be the variance or standard deviation of canonical scores.

Nevertheless, a greater amount of fruiting occurred at the beginning and near the end of the 8-mo wet season than would be expected if the species were fruiting randomly. In both species, the major fruiting peak occurred when most other tree species were not producing ripe fruit. Large trees of both fig species tended to produce fruit crops at shorter intervals than small trees. Average interval between crops was slightly longer than a half year for F. yoponensis and slightly shorter than a full year for F. insipida. Results, combined with life history data, suggest that individuals of these Ficus species are fruiting asynchronously at relatively short intervals, thereby increasing total lifetime fruit production and ultimately maximizing reproductive success.
