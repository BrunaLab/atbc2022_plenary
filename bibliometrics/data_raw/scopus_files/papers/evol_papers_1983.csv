This self-recognition bioassay was used to analyze the clonal structure and diversity in A. cervicornis populations in Discovery Bay, Jamaica, and Tague Bay, St. Croix, US Virgin Islands. The Discovery Bay population has a significantly greater microgeographic clonal diversity that is reflected in a much higher Neighbor Index, the proportion of rejection responses in contacts among adjacent colonies. In Tague Bay, spatial maps of A. cervicornis clones show that clones are variable in size (from a single colony to assemblages up to 10 m or more in diameter), and are distributed in discrete patches. A computer model was used to simulate the development of clonal population structure from simple demographic processes. This indicated that the relatively low diversity of clones apparent in the Tague Bay population is expected when the input of new clones into the population by sexual recruitment is extemely low. Occasions of catastrophic mortality and subsequent recovery of A. cervicornis populations may be major determinants of clonal diversity and population structure, especially when the rate of sexual recruitment is relatively low.-from Authors",65,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA,NA,NA

This variation in preference affects variation in host use. 3) One of the most highly preferred hosts is sufficiently rare and localized that most insects which do prefer it search without finding it until other, less preferred hosts become acceptable.

The opportunity for selection was further broken down into natural selection due to variance in lifespan and sexual selection due to variance in the ability to acquire a mate during a short subset of total lifespan (mating efficiency).

The fluctuating reservoirs differ significantly in their fluctuation patterns, and these differences are reflected in the life-history traits of the fish living in them. Much of the variation among stocks was caused by plastic responses to short- term environmental changes. The pattern of variation in water levels in the more distant past (3-6 months) had strong effects on weight-adjusted fecundity than did the more recent past (1-3 months). The environment can induce significant lag effects in less than a generation via physiological plasticity.
