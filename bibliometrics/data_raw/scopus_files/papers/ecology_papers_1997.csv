Nests were provided with supplemental food from hatching to fledging for three years (1992, 1993, and 1995), which differed in the natural abundance of voles, the Eurasian Kestrel's major prey. These supplemented nests were compared to nonsupplemented control nests using the following variables: (1) parental effort, (2) parental condition, and (3) fledgling number and quality: Female parents responded to food supplements by decreasing their hunting effort (estimated as the percentage of time spent flight-hunting) and prey delivery rate, whereas the hunting effort and/or prey delivery rate of males did not change. Females at supplemented nests were heavier than those at control nests, but the body mass of males was not affected by feeding. Supplementary food increased the number of fledglings per brood not only in years of low, but also in years of relatively high natural prey density. We conclude that even at high levels of natural food abundance, the reproductive output of kestrels is food-limited during the nestling period. In addition, there appear to be intersexual differences in the adjustment of parental effort. While females adjusted parental effort to male provisioning and offspring requirements, males did not change parental effort within a season, suggesting that male parental effort is fixed at a level where male survival is not jeopardized.",124,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Clutch size | Eurasian Kestrel | Falco tinnunculus | Fledgling production | Food limitation and supplemention | Lifetime reproduction | Nesting success | Parental effort | Vole cycles,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Thus, in the absence of predators and with limited resources, defended individuals are expected to be outcompeted by individuals lacking the costly defense. Crucian carp, Carassius carassius, increase in body depth in response to chemical stimuli from piscivorous fish, and the deeper body constitutes a morphological defense against gape-limited piscivores. Here, we have performed a field experiment investigating effects of population density on the relative competitive performance of shallow-bodied and deep-bodied crucian carp. We assigned groups of six individually marked fish (the 'focal' individuals) of either morph into enclosures with either low or high crucian carp density, and monitored changes in body mass, length, and body depth of these fish for 4 mo. In addition, we determined sex, and final liver and gonadal mass, of all focal fish. At high population density, there was a reduction in food resources (zooplankters), which resulted in reduced gonad mass, reduced gonadosomatic indices, and reduced growth in fish of both morphs. Unexpectedly, the relative allocation to livers was higher at high density. There was no difference in body mass gain between morphs at the low density, whereas at the high density shallow-bodied fish gained twice as much body mass as deep-bodied fish. Hence, when predators were absent and food resources were limited, deep-bodied individuals suffered a substantial cost when competing with shallow-bodied conspecifics. This study verifies the theoretical prediction that an inducible defense results in fitness costs in the absence of predators. Further, as we found no measurable disadvantage of the deep-bodied morphology at high food availability but a strong disadvantage under intense competition for food, our results also demonstrate the importance of relating defense costs to levels of intraspecific competition.",56,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Antipredator | Body size | Carassius carassius | Competition | Cost | Density dependence | Field-enclosure experiment | Fish | Inducible defense | Phenotypic plasticity | Resource allocation | Sweden,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA,NA

The red crab (Gecarcoidea natalis) occurs at densities of ~ 1 crab/m2 and consumes seeds, seedlings, and leaf litter. A crab-exclusion experiment below closed canopy and in light gaps showed that red crabs markedly reduced seedling recruitment. Overall, seedling emergence was 29-fold and 21-fold greater on the exclusion plots in the understory and in gaps, respectively. In control plots, mean seedling densities never exceeded 15 seedlings/25 m2 in the understory and 3 seedlings/25 m2 in gaps. Species richness of seedlings was significantly higher in the absence of crabs, averaging >10 and 12 species per plot in the understory and gaps, respectively. On control plots, mean species richness was less than one species per plot. Two-dimensional ordination (using nonmetric multidimensional scaling) showed that red crabs had a large impact on relative species abundances. Analyses of similarity confirmed that significant differences existed between both treatments and habitats. Seed removal and seedling transplant experiments suggested that most rain forest species are rapidly eaten by red crabs. Seedlings of many of these vulnerable species (e.g., Maclura cochinchinensis, Planchonella nitida, Schefflera elliptica) were abundant on exclusion plots. However, they were rare on control plots, and none persisted for >2 mo. Persistent seedlings were limited to two species (Inocarpus fagifer and Tristiropsis acutangula), both of which were resistant as seeds and seedlings to crab predation. Although red crabs are the major biotic determinants of seedling recruitment, this impact was not reflected in the overhead canopy. Some tree species unable to recruit in the presence of crabs were common as adults. Shifting mosaics in crab densities over space and time may offer the best explanation for recruitment of vulnerable species.

In South Africa, they feed almost exclusively on the termite Trinervitermes trinervoides during the warmer months of the year, whereas on cold winter nights these insects remain belowground, unavailable to aardwolves. At this time aardwolves shift their foraging efforts to a less abundant termite species, Hodotermes mossambicus. This species provides less food for aardwolves, making the wintertime potentially a period of energy stress for them. In this study, we report the first estimates of field metabolism and water flux as determined by doubly labeled water for a myrmecophagous euthermic mammal. Specifically, we tested the hypotheses that a reduced basal metabolic rate and pulmocutaneous water loss lead to a conservative field metabolic rate (FMR) and water flux in free-living aardwolves during summer and winter. Further, we quantified the activity budget of aardwolves during summer and winter to construct a time-energy budget for them. We used knowledge of water flux in aardwolves and of the water content of their prey to construct a water budget during summer and winter, and to estimate the seasonal consumption of termites by aardwolves. During summer (November-January), aardwolves that averaged 7768 g in body mass had a CO2 production of 112.5 L CO2/d, equivalent to an energy expenditure of 2891.2 kJ/d. During winter (June-July), when body mass averaged 8543 g, CO2 production averaged 71.8 L CO2/d, which translates to an FMR of 1844.8 kJ/d. Water flux equaled 615 mL/d in summer, but only 292 mL/d in winter, a decrease of 53.1%. Aardwolves were active for an average of 8.77 h/d in summer, but only 4.05 h/d during winter. A time budget for active periods showed that aardwolves spent a significantly larger proportion of their active time feeding in summer than in winter (26.7 vs. 15.2%). In addition, males and females spent 12.6% of their time in winter in breeding activities such as courtship and copulation. For aardwolves in summer, our model estimated a DEE of 2370.5 kJ/d, whereas during winter it predicted a DEE of 2086 kJ/d. These values deviated from our estimates of FMR by -18% and +13.1%, respectively. From data on water flux and the water content of termites, we estimated that aardwolves consumed 222 445 Trinervitermes per night during the summer. Using previously obtained data on foraging, we predicted that aardwolves consume 833 termites per patch with an intake rate of 33 termites per second while feeding. During winter, aardwolves consumed 5867 Hodotermes and 2515 Trinervitermes per night. Our estimate of gross energy consumption was 5616 kJ/d in summer and 3022 kJ/d in winter. Assuming an assimilation efficiency of 0.66, metabolizable energy intake would be 3707 kJ/d in summer and 1995 kJ/d in winter. These values exceed FMR measurements by +22% in summer and by +8.1% in winter.

With males and females treated as separate morphospecies, four trophic characters that relate to killing and feeding behavior and skull length, as a measure of body size, were examined for evidence of morphological patterning, latitudinal size variation, and sexual dimorphism. The competitive basis for character displacement in intra- and interspecific variation in prey size was sought from dietary analysis at a field site. Even spacing in canine strength, but not in other characters, was found among species and sexes of quolls (Dasyurus viverrinus and D. maculatus), but not including the devil (Sarcophilus laniarius) or the thylacine (Thylacinus cynocephalus), in Tasmania. Even spacing was found in temporalis muscle size for all combinations of the four Tasmanian species. Canine breaking strength and muscle strength driving the canines can be construed as the most important trophic characters involved in prey capture, and therefore in determining the upper size of prey that can be handled. Even spacing was found in Tasmania, where there are two larger species in the guild, but not in any of the three mainland assemblages where the larger species of carnivores have been absent for many generations. The basis for the observed morphological patterning in killing behavior, evidence for even spacing in prey size, and partial character release on the mainland are consistent with the hypothesis of competitive character displacement. These size relationships result from a complex interplay of factors. Latitudinally correlated size variation has influenced an increase in body size and canine strength in D. viverrinus and an increase in body size in D. maculatus in Tasmania. This is countered by decreased canine strength in D. maculatus in Tasmania resulting from competitive character displacement. The result is character convergence.

To explore this possibility, we obtained flowers varying naturally in color, nectar reward, and morphology, from a hybrid zone between Ipomopsis aggregata and I. tenuituba in western Colorado, United States. We used aviary and field experiments to study preferences of hummingbirds for unmanipulated flowers and for flowers in which we experimentally dissociated color from nectar reward and morphology. Hummingbirds preferred red flowers of I. aggregata, which contain superior nectar rewards and have relatively broad corolla tubes, relative to flowers of I. tenuituba, which are white, contain small nectar rewards, and have narrow tubes. There was no evidence of flower constancy. When presented with flowers differing only in color, birds showed a spontaneous preference for red. However, this preference could be reversed by making white flowers more rewarding than red. When plants of both parental species and their hybrids were placed in an array in the field, with all flowers painted red, hummingbirds preferred to visit the more rewarding, wider tubed I. aggregata. These results suggest that pollinator-mediated selection could act on color, shape, and nectar separately.

We examined the relative importance of substrate type, shade from logs and shade cloth, density of understory vegetation, gap size, and forest age on the success of Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Seedlings originating from seed sown on experimental microsites were compared with seedlings regenerating naturally on a range of microsites. Seedling establishment was greater on decayed wood than on forest floor or mineral soil in closed-canopy areas, particularly for Tsuga. Differences in establishment among substrates declined with increasing gap size, although establishment on the forest floor tended to be low in portions of large gaps exposed to direct solar radiation. In exposed areas, shade from woody debris and shade cloth facilitated establishment for all species, while shade from understory vegetation aided the establishment of Pseudotsuga but not that of Tsuga. Establishment in shaded portions of gaps declined with vegetation and shade cloth cover. Seedling size increased with gap size, decreased with level of shade, and tended to be greatest on forest floor and lowest on decayed wood. Establishment and growth of the different species was related to differences in seed mass and tolerance of environmental extremes. Heterogeneity at the seedling scale (<10 cm) often overrode larger-scale environmental gradients (>2 m) associated with gap size and within-gap position.

We manipulated the growth rates of premigratory and nonmigratory salmon by either reducing food availability or maintaining water at low temperature (4-6°C). A third group of fish was kept at ambient temperatures (12-14°C) and fed ad libitum to provide a control. Fish in both experimental groups exhibited compensatory growth after the manipulation period, even though the manipulations had slowed growth rather than caused mass loss. The timing and duration of compensatory growth were affected by the nature of the constraint and the developmental pathway adopted. Compensatory responses were more persistent and stronger among premigratory fish than among nonmigratory. Fish kept at low temperature did not accelerate growth immediately after transfer to ambient temperatures, but they subsequently grew faster than controls for up to 215 d after the end of the manipulation period. This mitigated the effects of the period of low temperatures, although by the end of the experiment they were still smaller than the controls. Fish on reduced rations showed no such time lag, and they grew significantly faster than controls immediately upon regaining access to full rations. These fish attained the same body size as controls by the end of the experiment (day 215). The manipulations caused fish to reduce their growth in mass more than their rate of skeletal growth, but all fish achieved 'normal' mass for their length (as compared to controls) within a week of transfer to full feeding or ambient temperature. The main mechanism underlying compensatory growth rates was apparently the increase of intake rates, although this was insufficient to explain the strong compensation shown by temperature-manipulated fish in the presence of larger (and thus competitively superior) individuals. Instead these fish enhanced their growth rate by apparently increasing the duration of the daily feeding period, and avoiding aggressive interactions. We interpret the observed compensation for periods of slowed growth as indicating that growth rate is normally submaximal and can be increased if the animal has fallen below its expected trajectory; thus premigratory fish may have shown a greater compensation because survival rates during migration are strongly size-dependent.",240,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Aggressive behavior | Body size | Compensatory growth | Developmental plasticity | Energy allocation | Feeding activity | Life history | Salmo salar | Starvation | Temperature manipulations | Time constraints,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,12,NA,NA

In the 10 most common species, which spanned the range of phenological types, phenology was monitored every two weeks. To investigate the relationships between leaf phenology and plant water status, pre-dawn leaf water potential was monitored in eight common species every 4-6 weeks. Four main phenological types were described: (1) evergreen species, which retained full canopy throughout the year; (2) brevi- or partly deciduous species, in which the amount of canopy fell significantly, but briefly, during at least one dry season during the study period, but to levels not below 50% of full canopy; (3) semideciduous species in which canopy fell to below 50% of full canopy in each of the dry seasons; and (4) fully deciduous species, which lost all leaves during the early-mid dry season, and remained leafless for at least one month. Of these 49 species, 24% were evergreen, 20% were brevideciduous, 29% were semideciduous, and 27% were fully deciduous. Leaf fall occurred 1-2 months earlier in the dry season for the fully deciduous species than for the semideciduous species. Leaf fall in all species was coincident with the attainment of seasonal minima in leaf water potential, which were, on average, about -1.5 to -2.0 MPa in the evergreen and semideciduous species, compared with about -0.5 to -1.0 MPa in the fully deciduous species. Leaf flushing occurred throughout the dry season in the two evergreen species, with a major peak in the late dry season. In five semideciduous species and one of the fully deciduous species, leaf flushing commenced in the late dry season prior to the occurrence of any rain. In two fully deciduous species, leaf flushing occurred only after the first storms of the early wet season. There was variation in the timing of flushing, both between species within years and between years for some species.

The first, the wing-loading hypothesis, proposes that adults actively reduce mass in order to increase flight efficiency. The second, the reserve-mobilization hypothesis, proposes that females store reserves during the early stages of the breeding cycle, which they mobilize to sustain them during later stages. We tested these hypotheses by providing food supplements to House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon) breeding on a study area north of Bloomington, Illinois, during the 1990-1992 breeding seasons. Additional food had no effect on mass except late in one season. Females that were given additional food during the late-young stage in 1992 had significantly higher mass than controls, but their mass was not greater than that normally obtained by females not receiving food supplements in other years.

I tested predictions from the shelter bottleneck hypothesis, which proposes that shelter (or refuge) limitation can control population size structure and density by acting strongly on only one size class. I manipulated shelter for stone crabs in four haphazardly chosen bays in the northeast Gulf of Mexico to examine the shelter bottleneck hypothesis in a mixed-model design. I also examined four biotic factors (habitat structure, food, predation, and interspecific competition) that may contribute to population-level differences among bays. I found differences among bays in stone crab size structure and density and in crab responses to size-specific shelter supplementation. These differences in stone crabs among bays included: (1) natural median crab size differed by 5.5-fold, (2) size at maturity changed by 33%, (3) adult density varied 10-fold, (4) the density response of molting individuals and gravid females to supplemental shelter differed by more than 7-fold, and (5) the shelter preferred by crabs changed from 25 to 100 mm diameter pipes. The shelter bottleneck hypothesis and differences in habitat structure best account for these differences in stone crabs among bays. There appeared to be bottlenecks in three of the four bays, and the location of the bottleneck was predictable from measures of habitat structure. There were demographic consequences of shelter limitation on stone crab growth and fecundity at the individual level, and these effects appeared to explain population-level differences among bays. However, the bottleneck effects may be mediated by differences in food quantity and competition among bays.

One series of experimental ecosystems was scaled for a constant depth (1.0 m) as volume was increased from 0.1 to 1.0 to 10 m3. The other series was scaled for a constant shape (radius/depth = 0.56) across an identical range of volumes. Triplicate systems of each size and shape were housed in a temperature-controlled room illuminated with fluorescent and incandescent lights, and mixed by means of large, slow-moving impellers. All experimental ecosystems received an exchange of filtered estuarine water (10%/d). Nutrient concentrations, and ecosystem primary productivity and respiration, were traced over time during spring, summer, and fall experiments. During the nutrient-rich spring experiment, systems in the constant-shape series exhibited similar gross primary productivity (GPP) when rates were expressed per unit area or per unit light energy received. When productivity was expressed per unit volume, however, rates declined as the depth of the containers increased. We interpret this dimensional pattern of GPP in the spring experiment as a reflection of light limitation. During the summer experiment, when nutrient concentrations were low, GPP was constant per unit volume, and it increased with increasing depth when expressed per unit area. This reversed dimensional pattern is consistent with expectations under nutrient-limited conditions. Indeed, GPP increased and the scaling pattern returned to that observed in the spring experiment when we added nutrients to the containers. During the fall experiment, nutrient concentrations were intermediate between spring and summer, and the dimensional pattern of GPP exhibited characteristics of both light and nutrient limitation. Differences in productivity in the constant-depth series were less extreme and can be attributed to artifacts of enclosure, such as differences in light attenuation and differences in the ratio of wall area to the unit volume of the containers.

Seasonality forms the basis of aphid population dynamics. Analysis of time series of weekly and monthly data indicate statistically detectable seasonality in density changes. The monthly data statistically adjusted for seasonal effects (deseasoned) show that density fluctuates around a seasonally changing equilibrium value. Bulmer's test of density dependence applied to the seasonally adjusted monthly data reveals density dependence. The partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plots of smoothed deseasoned monthly density indicate time-lagged density-dependent processes operating between seasons and possibly on a shorter time scale of between 2 wk and 2 mo. The PACFs of smoothed deseasoned data provide statistical evidence for the existence of a 'see-saw' relationship between density in spring, autumn, and the following spring. Analysis of annual abundances calculated from the weekly data suggests that overall abundance in any year is influenced by abundance the previous year. The pattern of changes in abundance between years is most likely the consequence of the see-saw effect operating between seasons.

Temporary ponds are excellent arenas for the study of food webs because they are discrete communities that can be mimicked in containers that approach the realism of natural habitats. Artificial ponds permit repeatable initial conditions and sufficient replication of independent experimental units in complex experiments to test hypotheses about the control of structure and function in natural communities. I used a combination of observations of natural ponds, 'experimental natural history' of artificial ponds in my study area, and controlled experiments in an array of 144 replicate ponds to develop, then test, hypotheses about how the structures of food webs are regulated. Understanding food webs begins with population biology. Amphibians use the aquatic larval stage of their biphasic life cycle to exploit ephemeral opportunities for growth and development in temporary ponds. The regulation of population density and the fitness of individuals are determined by complex interactions among competition, predation, and uncertainty in the length of the time ponds retain water. Exponential models of densitydependent recruitment relate the number of metamorphs to the input of eggs into ponds without predators. Extensions of these models include interspecific competition and predation. The addition of predation to these systems has three effects. (1) Predators can reduce, even eliminate, prey. There are species-specific differences among co-occurring prey in their risks of predation, and these risks change with relative body sizes of predator and prey. (2) Individuals may evoke an inducible defense that reduces their risk by either decreasing active foraging or developing morphological adaptations, such as changes in the coloration and shape of tails. These defenses may entail costs in body size and timing of metamorphosis. (3) Finally, mortality due to predators may reduce competition, thereby benefiting the population of the prey by permitting individuals that escape predation to grow rapidly enough to escape drying ponds. The order of arrival of species at breeding ponds has an impact on their own success as well as having a lasting impact on the success of species that arrive later. Such priority effects may result from size-specific changes in trophic connections or indirect effects between species mediated through the food web. Anurans can have strong effects on the partitioning of the flow of nutrients through the phytoplankton vs. the periphyton. This effect on partitioning of production can then have strong effects on zooplankton and insects. Salamanders can play the role of keystone, or critical, predators by affecting the structure of the assemblages of zooplankton and anurans that determine much of the dynamics of nutrient flows within food webs in temporary ponds.",357,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,1,1,Amphibian | Competition | Complexity | Experimental design | Food web | Keystone species | North Carolina | Predation | Priority effects | Temporary pond | Trophic dynamics | Zooplankton,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,21,NA,NA

There was a curvilinear relationship between the light-saturated rates of leaf photosynthesis (P(max)) and N(L). CO2 elevation significantly increased P(max) as a function of N(L) in both species. Dark respiration (R(d)) was linearly correlated with N(L). CO2 elevation slightly but significantly increased R(d) in Abutilon, while it had no significant effect on R(d) in Ambrosia.

CO2 elevation increased canopy photosynthesis by 3050%. Based on the leaf photosynthesis model for Abutilon, we calculated daily canopy photosynthesis for a given LAI and N availability, in which N was assumed to be distributed optimally within a leaf canopy to maximize daily canopy photosynthesis. An optimal LAI to maximize daily canopy photosynthesis was obtained for each level of N availability and this optimum increased with increasing N availability. Contrary to the often predicted increase in LAI with CO2 elevation, the optimum LAI did not increase at high CO2 when N availability was limited. Two factors were suggested to be involved in counteracting the increase in LAI in a high-CO2 world. One is the higher φ(abs) of plants grown in elevated CO2, which makes leaves in the canopy more N limited, favors higher N(L) and thus lowers optimal LAI.

Benthic algae and aquatic insects accessible to fishes were subject to intense omnivory by a diverse assemblage of fishes.

As a result, a large zone of artificial sympatry of pumpkinseed and redear populations has been created in the last decade in lakes of southern Michigan. In this study I examined the feeding performance and diets of co-occurring redear and pumpkinseed both in Michigan lakes and in laboratory studies of these sunfish species from those lakes. Previous research on these species suggests that redear are morphologically and behaviorally more specialized for molluscivory than pumpkinseed, and results from the present study showed that at a given size, the crushing capacity of redear was ~2X greater than that of pumpkinseed. For at least the smaller size classes of sunfish, the extent of molluscivory was constrained by crushing strength. Therefore, greater crushing strength of redear allowed them to undergo an ontogenetic niche shift from a diet of predominantly soft-bodied invertebrates to a diet of snails at a smaller size than co-occurring pumpkinseed. Once molluscivorous, redear consumed larger snails than did pumpkinseed. Diet analysis also showed that following their earlier niche shift, redear were significantly more molluscivorous than sympatric pumpkinseed. Summing the effects of greater individual consumption of snails by redear and the effects of a greater proportion of a redear population being molluscivorous due to their earlier niche shift, redear were predicted to be more proficient competitors for snails.

These studies have generally concluded that food availability is the primary proximate factor affecting the timing of nesting in birds. None of these studies, however, has examined the relationship between food availability and the timing of nesting in piscivorous birds. To determine whether food was the primary proximate factor affecting timing of nest initiation in the piscivorous Belted Kingfisher (Ceryle alcyon), we conducted a food supplementation experiment from 1993 through 1995; additional descriptive data were collected in 1992. Belted Kingfishers that nested early had heavier nestlings and were more likely to renest, in the event of nest failure, than were late-nesting birds. This indicates a reproductive advantage in early nesting. In 1994 and 1995, when we began the feeding treatment early in the prebreeding season (8 March) and provided enough fish to meet the estimated energy requirements of a pair of kingfishers (90 g/d), nests of supplemented birds were initiated earlier than those of unsupplemented birds as predicted by the energy constraint model. In 1993, when we began the feeding treatment later (20 April) and provided less fish (20-30 g/d), there was no difference in the initiation dates of supplemented and unsupplemented nests. Although these data support the primary prediction of the energy constraint model, two patterns in our data were not explained by this model. First, few unsupplemented nests were initiated early in the breeding season relative to an unmanipulated reference population. Second, no supplemented nests were initiated outside the range of nesting dates recorded in our unmanipulated reference population. Based on these patterns, we argue that variation in arrival time of females on the breeding grounds, coupled with their selection of territories based on food availability, offers a feasible and testable alternative to the energy constraint model. This habitat selection model predicts that food availability influences the location of reproduction of individuals, but does not alter the timing of their reproduction. A literature review revealed few data that could distinguish the energy constraint and habitat selection models. We think that it is important to consider the habitat selection alternative before concluding that the results of food supplementation studies support the energy constraint model. We suggest that future studies use spatial and temporal controls to partition variation in nest initiation dates into multiple causes (e.g., energy constraints, habitat selection).",30,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Belted Kingfisher | Ceryle alcyon | Energy constraint | Experimental design | Food supplementation | Habitat selection | Literature review | Nest initiation date | Timing of reproduction,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,29,NA,NA

This study evaluated two alternate hypotheses for the 'pulse' in productivity following an infrequent fire: (1) enhanced ANPP results from increased net N mineralization rates due to the removal of surface litter and elevated soil temperatures following fire (the enhanced mineralization hypothesis) or (2) enhanced ANPP results from a transient release from both light and N limitation during a nonequilibrium period as a switch from energy to N limitation occurs (the transient maxima hypothesis). The former hypothesis predicts greater N availability following an infrequent fire, relative to either annually burned or unburned prairie. The latter predicts that N availability following an infrequent fire will decline to intermediate levels, relative to unburned and annually burned prairie, and continue to decline with successive annual fires. To test these hypotheses, I measured inorganic soil N, net N mineralization rates, and plant productivity and N content at Konza Prairie in sites with several different burn histories (unburned, annually burned, infrequently burned). Inorganic soil N and cumulative net N mineralization rates were greatest on the unburned sites, lowest in annually burned sites, and intermediate in infrequently burned sites. Net N mineralization rates and plant tissue N content both declined with successive spring burning. These results did not support the enhanced mineralization hypothesis but indicated that enhanced ANPP following an infrequent fire resulted from an accumulation of inorganic and mineralizable N in the absence of fire which, under conditions of adequate light availability, was utilized following a spring fire. This is consistent with the transient maxima hypothesis and suggests that nonequilibrium responses to multiple, variable resources (light, energy, N) are an important aspect of tallgrass prairie ecosystem dynamics.",270,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Fire | Kansas | Konza Prairie | LTER | N cycling | Nitrogen availability | Nitrogen mineralization | Nonequilibrium dynamics | Tallgrass prairie | Transient maxima hypothesis,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,30,NA,NA

I use mathematical models to investigate how treatment effects should vary with the size of the area manipulated in open predation experiments, i.e., in studies that allow prey to migrate in and out from experimental units. The most general result is that the influence of prey movements on prey densities decreases with increasing spatial scale of an experiment, while the effect of predation rate is independent of scale. Thus, the results seen in small-scale experiments tend to reflect prey movements, while the effects seen in large-scale experiments are due mainly to predator-related mortality. If predation rates are spatially variable (e.g., the habitat consists of refuge patches and predator-rich patches) the problem becomes more complex, because movement rates influence predation rates. Movements that are independent of predator density can swamp the effects of predation mortality in small-scale experiments. However, in larger scale experiments, the effect of movements is to increase the predation rate. This is because a larger proportion of the prey is exposed to predators at high movement rates. Predators can also affect local densities through effects on prey behavior. If prey increase movement rates out from predator patches, this will lead to increased treatment effects in small-scale experiments. In contrast, the result of such behaviors is to decrease treatment effects in large-scale experiments, because most prey will be in refuge patches and predation rates will be low. Alternatively, sometimes predators cause prey to decrease activity when close to a predator. This kind of behavioral response leads to decreased treatment effects in small-scale experiments. If the response is strong, the result can even be a reversed effect, i.e., reduced movements out from predator cages lead to increased prey densities in such cages. I argue that the effect of this type of behavior in large-scale experiments should also be to decrease treatment effects. This is because predation rates are usually low on inactive prey. However, freezing behaviors cannot lead to reversed predator effects on a large scale.",129,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Cage size | Field experiments | Global and local effects | Population effects | Predation | Predator avoidance | Prey movements | Spatial heterogeneity | Spatial scale,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,31,NA,NA

In this paper, we present a simple model of plant population dynamics that extends the concept of AOI by considering 'compensatory' growth of root systems. The ability of a plant to grow roots into soil zones free of neighbors in response to competitive pressures is expressed by the value of a single parameter, λ. Effects on population attributes resulting from competition in plants with compensatory growth are compared with populations with noncompensatory growth. Simulations show that compensatory plants are better able to utilize available space, have greater biomass, and outcompete noncompensatory plants. The change from a clumped to a regular distribution of individuals due to density-dependent mortality is delayed in noncompensatory plants.

Surprisingly, many sessile species that seemingly have limited potential to disperse often rapidly colonize areas that have been recently disturbed. The synchronous release of propagules during periods that promote advection may extend the dispersal of such species and promote their rapid colonization. Alternatively, rapid recovery may result from colonization by dormant stages that survive disturbance. Here we test for reproductive synchrony as a way of extending the dispersal potential of two common seaweeds, the kelps Macrocystis pyrifera and Pterygophora californica. Synchrony in spore release in their case is likely to be particularly useful in extending colonization distance because fertilization in these species occurs after spore dispersal; synchrony increases the chance of fertilization by increasing the concentration of spores. We also evaluate experimentally the relative importance of dormant stages vs. recently settled spores in accounting for the rapid recovery of local kelp populations following severe disturbances. Reproductive synchrony was evaluated by following weekly changes in the reproductive condition of adult kelp. The degree of reproductive synchrony in both Macrocystis and Pterygophora was significantly greater than that expected under conditions of asynchronous reproduction. In Macrocystis, periods of synchronous spore production and release occurred sporadically over a 2-yr period. At least 75% of the sampled population exhibited the same directional change in reproductive condition in 38 of 82 sample periods. Episodes of significant spore release varied in duration from as little as 1 wk to as much as 2 mo. The sharpest decline in reproductive condition occurred during a severe storm. In contrast to Macrocystis, relatively well defined cycles of spore production, maturation, and release were observed in Pterygophora. More than one cycle was observed within a single reproductive season, and each cycle lasted ~3-4 wk. The different patterns and degrees of synchrony observed between the two species likely reflect the degree to which their production of spores is influenced by environmental conditions; spore production in Macrocystis is greatly influenced by fluctuations in seawater temperature and nutrients while spore production in Pterygophora is not. Results from field experiments comparing the recruitment of small plants among rocks placed in the kelp bed for varying lengths of time indicated that microscopic life stages of Macrocystis and Pterygophora have little capacity for dormancy, and that the vast majority of recruitment resulted from recently settled spores. These results contrasted with those observed for the annual brown alga Desmarestia ligulata which showed a dormancy period of several months. Our findings suggest that mechanisms such as reproductive synchrony that extend the distances over which kelp spores can effectively colonize are likely to play a critical role in the dynamics of kelp populations, which often fluctuate greatly in time due to disturbance.",65,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Colonization | Dispersal | Disturbance | Dormancy | Fertilization | Immigration | Kelp | Ma crocystis pyrifera | Pterygophora californica | Recruitment | Reproductive synchrony | Spore,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,35,NA,NA

We use a graphical model to resolve this paradox. The model visualizes how facilitative patterns can be understood from the simultaneous effects of plant canopies on microsite light and moisture, and the growth responses of establishing seedlings to those factors. The approach emphasizes the fact that positive and negative effects of plant canopies always occur simultaneously. In the presented light-water model, facilitation only occurs when the improvement of plant water relations under the canopy exceeds the costs caused by lower light levels. This may be true under dry conditions, whereas in less dry situations, competition rather than facilitation is observed.

These findings indicate that native grazers increased N loss from this north-temperate grassland as a result of accelerated losses on urine- and dung-affected microsites and, potentially, from elevated N loss throughout the grazed landscape due to grazers promoting N cycling.

However, food intake per bite per gram of body mass was about twice as high for small iguanas as for large iguanas. Large iguanas of both islands showed a marked decline in body mass during the two study years, whereas small iguanas (SVL < 170 mm on Genovesa and <320 mm on Santa Fe) increased in mass. Growth rates of SVL reflected these findings. A comparison of measured metabolizable energy with published field metabolic rates (FMR) suggested that iguanas above a threshold size were in negative energy balance, because energy intake scaled to body mass with a lower exponent (0.3) than FMR (0.97). Threshold body size was lower on Genovesa than on Santa Fe and differed between years: In the lean El Nino year (1991/1992), iguanas >200 mm SVL on Genovesa and >310 mm SVL on Santa Fe significantly lost mass; in the more productive year (1992/1993), thresholds were 230 mm and 350 mm SVL, respectively. Thus, food abundance (length and turnover of algal swards) explained differences in adult body length and mass between islands as a result of energetic limitation. On a given island, foraging efficiency (intake/bite) explained the negative energy balance of large compared to small iguanas. This also explained why, on both islands, the largest animals suffered higher mortality rates than did medium-sized ones when food was scarce. The finding that small animals outcompeted larger ones because of their higher foraging efficiency resembles the grazing succession in ungulate herbivores.",77,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Algae | Body size | Energy limitation | Foraging | Galapagos | Grazing succession | Herbivores | Island populations | Marine iguanas | Primary productivity | Reptiles | Ungulates,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,43,NA,NA

We examined ecological and morphological data on 49 Anolis species (33 Caribbean, 16 mainland) to investigate whether the same set of ecomorphs has arisen in mainland regions. More generally, we investigated whether the relationship between ecology and morphology was similar among anoles in the two regions. Radiations in the two regions are very different. The majority of mainland anole species exhibit morphological characteristics unlike any Caribbean ecomorph. Furthermore, relationships between ecology and morphology are very different between the two sets of anole species. Among mainland anole species, toepad size is positively correlated with perch height, whereas tail length is negatively related to perch diameter. In contrast, among Caribbean anole species, both forelimb length and body mass are positively associated with perch diameter, and both tail length and hindlimb length are negatively related to perch diameter. Biomechanical considerations provide a functional basis for some of these correlations, but much variation remains to be explained.

In the branching coral Madracis mirabilis, corallite architecture and density, branch diameter and spacing, and overall aggregate morphology all vary among environments. To examine the role of phenotypic plasticity in generating these patterns, clonal replicates of five genotypes of M. mirabilis were transplanted from each of two source populations into four treatment environments on the north coast of Jamaica. Flow rate, sedimentation, irradiance, water temperature, and salinity all varied among these environments. DNA fingerprinting was used to ensure that the 10 transplanted genotypes were genetically distinct. Six morphological traits (intersepta area, septa length, columella area, corallite area, corallite spacing, and branch tip diameter) were measured after transplantation to determine whether they were altered in response to environmental conditions. Because these traits were correlated, principal components analysis was used to define new, uncorrelated traits for analysis. Four of the five corallite traits and branch diameter were significantly affected by the environment, demonstrating that morphological variation among environments in M. mirabilis is due in large part to phenotypic plasticity. No difference was detected between the two source populations in the magnitude or direction of their plastic responses, but there was substantial variation among genotypes (genotype x environment interaction). Many of the phenotypic changes of both populations resulted in the transplants becoming morphologically similar to resident conspecifics in each treatment environment.

Using naturally occurring clones of cottonwoods, we compared the arthropod communities found in the mature zones of upper tree canopies, in juvenile zones at the base of mature trees, and in juvenile ramets that have suckered from the roots of mature trees. Mature zones were shown to support 23% greater species richness and 108% greater relative abundance than juvenile ramets. Of 17 Common arthropod taxa, 8 showed significantly higher abundances on one developmental zone over another; 4 had higher abundances on mature zones, and 4 had higher abundances on juvenile ramets. The juvenile zones of mature trees resembled a transition zone, supporting intermediate species richness and relative abundance. We also detected a significant clone effect on arthropod relative abundance, indicating that plant development varies among clones. Because developmental-based resistance directly affects the distributions of the two dominant insect herbivores, we then removed these insects to quantify the indirect impacts of development on the rest of the arthropod community. The gall-forming aphid Pemphigus betae was removed from susceptible mature branches (juvenile branches and ramets are resistant), and the leaf-feeding beetle Chrysomela confluens was removed from susceptible juvenile ramets (mature branches are resistant). We found opposite impacts of removal: aphid removal decreased species richness and abundance in mature zones by 32 and 55%, respectively, while beetle removal increased species richness and abundance on juvenile ramets by 120 and 75%, respectively. These studies suggest that plant development is an important factor that contributes to the structuring of insect communities, and that the indirect impacts of plant development acting through common herbivores may rival direct impacts (e.g., competition and predation) in their overall importance.

Total enemy-induced mortality is higher in the late developmental stages, and overall, parasitoids kill more herbivores than do either predators or pathogens.

However, in addition to providing photosynthates to the whole plant, individual leaves may preferentially feed local sinks, including primordial meristems that develop later. For leaf damage, this may have local consequences and, in the case of preformed meristems, may result in time lags. To investigate such consequences and to determine the degree of independence among shoot modules, we studied shoot traits after damage to individual leaves in long shoots and vegetative and generative short shoots of field-growing mountain birch, Betula pubescens subsp. czerepanovii (Orlova) Hamet-Ahti. For short shoots, the results suggest that, due to the catkin, generative shoots have a higher priority in resource use than vegetative shoots. The overwinter survival of vegetative short shoots was decreased after their young leaves had been damaged early in the previous season. Otherwise, there were no significant effects of leaf damage on vegetative shoots. In generative shoots, leaf damage affected size and reproduction instead of survival. Because leaf damage significantly decreased leaf size in the generative shoots in the posttreatment year, leaves presumably competed with the catkin for resources within the shoot. Damage also reduced the catkin mass and the mean seed mass in the treatment year. In the posttreatment year, catkin mass and total seed mass were reduced by the treatments, but differences in the number of seeds and mean seed mass did not quite reach significance. The treatments had no effects on leaf mass of neighbors of vegetative or generative shoots in the treatment year or in the posttreatment year. In the treatment year, removal of long shoot leaves from a growing long shoot did not affect growth of the long shoot, indicating that such growth was supported by resources external to the shoot. However, local effects were evident in the posttreatment year: leaf mass decreased in shoots that developed from axillary buds in long shoots whose supporting leaves had been clipped in the previous year. Consequently, removal of individual leaves may have local effects on shoot survivorship, reproduction, and growth. Timing of damage and shoot type modified the consequences of local leaf damage, and there were no consistent responses for all situations. Due to the limited extent of damage, the effects were not likely to result from nutrient loss due to damage.

Yet, the generality of 'edge effects' has been hotly debated because results vary tremendously. To understand the factors responsible for this variation, we described nest predation and cowbird distribution patterns in forest edge and forest core habitats on 36 randomly selected plots in three states in the midwestern United States. We tested four hypotheses that may explain the variation and mechanisms responsible for edge effects among the 36 plots: (1) the landscape context, (2) the local predator community, (3) the local bird (host-prey) community, and (4) the nest site microhabitat structure. We used artificial nests baited with quail arid clay eggs to determine nest predation patterns and predators and used point count surveys to determine cowbird and host abundance in forest edge and forest core habitats. Raccoons, opossums, canids, and birds accounted for most predation of artificial nests. Neither local host abundance nor mean nest concealment of artificial nests significantly influenced nest predation rates in habitat edge or in habitat core. Nest predation was significantly greater in highly fragmented landscapes than in unfragmented landscapes and was significantly higher in edge habitats than in core habitats. However, detection of edge effects varied, depending upon landscape type. Higher predation rates in edge habitats were detected in highly and moderately fragmented landscapes, but not in unfragmented landscapes. Both mammalian and avian predator groups contributed to higher predation rates along edges in highly and moderately fragmented landscapes. Cowbird abundance was significantly related to host abundance, but the effect of hosts varied depending upon habitat type. In edge habitats, cowbird abundance was negatively associated with host abundance in all three landscapes studied. By contrast, cowbird abundance was positively associated with host abundance in core habitats. Once the effects of host abundance were removed, cowbird abundance in core habitat was greater in highly fragmented landscapes than in moderately and unfragmented landscapes, but did not differ between the latter two. In edge habitat, cowbird abundance did not differ between landscapes, but abundance in edges tended to be highest in the highly fragmented landscape and lowest in the unfragmented landscape. Cowbird abundance did not vary between edge and core habitat in any of the landscapes studied.

Yet very few studies have been carried out on the link between foraging and life history in the context of allocation of resources. Here we report a study examining the relationship between foraging and allocation of resources in the Wandering Albatross Diomedea exulans of Crozet Islands. We simultaneously studied individual foraging strategies at sea and differential allocation to reproduction and storage by measuring the energy supplied to chicks and the variation of body mass of the adult. Satellite tracking and continuous monitoring of nest attendance by adults showed that while rearing a chick Wandering Albatrosses have two specific alternative foraging strategies. They either forage in short trips, short in duration and close to the colony over the southeastern slope of the peri-insular shelf, or in long trips far from the colony in the oceanic waters north of Crozet. On average, birds made five successive short trips before making a long trip. Chicks received a meal every 1.8 d and were fed with fresh prey, 72% squid and 24% fish, and a liquid fraction composed of oil and water. During short trips birds appear to rely to a great extent on Moroteuthis ingens, a squid species probably available in large numbers at the southeastern edge of the Crozet shelf. The measure of energy flows indicates that 74% of the energy delivered to the chick comes from short trips, whereas only 33.8% of the total energy is gained at sea during these trips. Males spent a greater proportion of their time foraging in short trips than females, and consequently chicks received 61.3% of their meals from males and 38.7% from females. Adult birds tended to lose mass after short trips and to lose more mass with increased duration of short trips, whereas they gained mass after long trips. They initiated long trips when their body mass was low. Although Wandering Albatrosses are able to provision their chicks at a rapid rate because of the proximity of an abundant resource, birds still have to forage far from the colony to restore their body condition. Estimates of energy yield explain this paradox, as they suggest that the rate at which prey is caught during short trips in shallow waters is half that during long trips in oceanic waters.

They appear to be most common in environments with relatively high physical disturbance, stress, or predation, where associated species can increase the growth and survival of other species unable to survive in isolation. Although ecologists have documented direct positive interactions among species for decades, there is less known about how these interactions affect community species diversity patterns. In this paper, we present a qualitative theoretical model that considers how direct positive interactions affect community species diversity. The model uses, as its basis, familiar unimodel species diversity models (i.e., 'compensatory mortality' and 'intermediate disturbance' hypothesis) to understand where direct positive interactions are likely to be important. Initially, it predicts that direct positive interactions increase species diversity by facilitating species that might not normally survive under very high physical disturbance, stress, or predation. In addition, it suggests that, under intermediate physical disturbance, stress, or predation, facilitator species that might normally be competitively excluded are released from competition. We suggest that facilitator species may then create new interaction webs that would not be possible in their absence. To illustrate these ideas, we describe a case study taken from a New England salt marsh community where a gradient in physical conditions occurs. In this community, direct positive interactions, and their indirect effects, are predicted to increase the species diversity by at least 35%. This empirical case study and model show that by incorporating direct positive interactions into ecological experiments and theory, it is possible to expand our understanding of the mechanisms responsible for community species diversity patterns.",323,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Compensatory mortality hypothesis | Functional group | Interaction web | Intermediate disturbance hypothesis | Keystone species | Physical stress and disturbance | Positive interactions | Predation | Salt marsh | Species diversity,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,53,NA,NA

In this paper, we provide a new synthesis of theoretical and empirical evidence that elucidates and extends a mechanism of population regulation for species whose individuals preemptively use sites that differ in suitability. The sites may be territories, refuges from predation, oviposition sites, etc. The mechanism, which we call site dependence, is not an alternative to density dependence; rather, site dependence is one of several mechanisms that potentially generate the negative feedback required for regulation. Site dependence has two major features: (1) environmentally caused heterogeneity among sites in suitability for reproduction and/or survival; and (2) preemptive site occupancy, with the tendency for individuals to move to sites of higher quality as they become available. Simulation modeling shows that these two features, acting in concert, generate negative feedback when progressively less suitable sites are used as population size increases, reducing average demographic rates for the population as a whole. Further, when population size decreases, only sites of high suitability are occupied, resulting in higher average demographic rates and, thus, population growth. The modeling results demonstrate that this site-dependent mechanism can generate negative feedback at all population sizes in the absence of local crowding effects, and that this feedback is capable of regulating population size tightly. Operation of site dependence does not rely on the particular type of environmental factor(s) ultimately limiting population size, e.g., food, nest sites, predators, parasites, abiotic factors, or a combination of these. Furthermore, site dependence operates in saturated or unsaturated habitats and over a broad range of spatial scales for species that disperse widely relative to site diameter. A review of relevant field studies assessing the assumptions of the mechanism and its regulatory potential suggests that site dependence may provide a general explanation for population regulation in a wide variety of species.",330,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,Density dependence | Despotism | Habitat quality | Population regulation | Preemption | Simulation model | Territoriality | Territory suitability,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,54,NA,NA

Positive interactions, however, have not been emphasized in studies of intertidal communities. We first review studies of intertidal marsh plant communities that suggest that positive interactions play a dominant role in the structure and dynamics of these common assemblages. We then present the results of an experimental manipulation on New England rocky shores that suggests that group benefits are as important in maintaining the upper intertidal limits of dominant spaceholders on rocky shores as the negative forces of competition and predation are in maintaining lower distributional limits. We conclude by discussing the generality and implications of our results. We argue that biogeographic biases have limited appreciation of the role played by positive interactions in intertidal communities. Most of the work that has formed the foundation of marine intertidal ecology was done in cool temperate habitats, whereas positive interactions driven by the amelioration of thermal or desiccation stresses are likely more important in warmer climates. We further argue that many important positive feedbacks operate at large spatial scales, not conducive to experimental study, and thus have escaped critical attention and general acceptance. We suggest that recognizing the role of positive interactions in communities may be key to understanding population and community processes in physically stressful habitats, many large-scale landscape processes, and uncovering long-suspected linkages between biodiversity and community stability.",445,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Community ecology | Distributional limits | Group benefits | Habitat amelioration | Physical stress,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,56,NA,NA

We present one- and two-species models of sessile organisms incorporating competition for space and two forms of cooperation: habitat amelioration and positive recruitment. In these models, habitat amelioration reduces an organism's mortality rate when it is surrounded by other organisms ('safety-in-numbers'), and positive intraspecific recruitment enables juveniles to use the shelter of established individuals as settlement (or germination) sites. A single-species model incorporating both forms of cooperation may exhibit sharp discontinuities in population density along an environmental gradient. In a two-species model the same mechanisms may lead to sharp boundaries in species composition if, as empirical studies suggest, a trade-off exists between colonization and cooperation abilities (e.g., strong cooperators are poor colonizers).

Physical ecosystem engineering by organisms is the physical modification, maintenance, or creation of habitats. Ecological effects of engineers on many other species occur in virtually all ecosystems because the physical state changes directly create nonfood resources such as living space, directly control abiotic resources, and indirectly modulate abiotic forces that, in turn, affect resource use by other organisms. Trophic interactions and resource competition do not constitute engineering. Engineering can have significant or trivial effects on other species, may involve the physical structure of an organism (like a tree) or structures made by an organism (like a beaver dam), and can, but does not invariably, have feedback effects on the engineer. We argue that engineering has both negative and positive effects on species richness and abundances at small scales, but the net effects are probably positive at larger scales encompassing engineered and nonengineered environments in ecological and evolutionary space and time. Models of the population dynamics of engineers suggest that the engineer/habitat equilibrium is often, but not always, locally stable and may show long-term cycles, with potential ramifications for community and ecosystem stability. As yet, data adequate to parameterize such a model do not exist for any engineer species. Because engineers control flows of energy and materials but do not have to participate in these flows, energy, mass, and stoichiometry do not appear to be useful in predicting which engineers will have big effects. Empirical observations suggest some potential generalizations about which species will be important engineers in which ecosystems.

In this paper, we describe responses of benthic, trout stream communities to replicated, whole-ecosystem perturbations resulting from pathogen-induced reductions in populations of a dominant grazer, the caddisfly Glossosoma nigrior. Previous small-scale experiments suggested that Glossosoma had strong competitive effects on other grazers (through exploitation) and small-bodied filter-feeders (through interference). Glossosoma populations collapsed in a number of Michigan trout streams since the late 1980s and have been maintained at low levels by recurrent pathogen outbreaks. Here we address the effects on periphyton, grazers, and filter-feeders of parasite-induced Glossosoma reductions in six streams for which considerable pre- and post-collapse data are available, and we compare the results of this large-scale perturbation to responses predicted from a small-scale experiment that had been previously conducted in one of these streams. Periphyton and most grazers and filter-feeders showed marked increases in abundance following reduction in Glossosoma populations. Several grazers that were rare or absent prior to Glossosoma collapse have established sizable populations, suggesting that they had been excluded by competition with Glossosoma. The small-scale experiment successfully predicted the direction of response of most taxa to whole-stream reductions in Glossosoma abundance, but it tended to underestimate the extent and magnitude of Glossosoma's effects in the community.

Each species was offered different levels (0% and ~40% and 80% of maintenance energy requirements) of millet seeds and ad libitum fresh vegetation consisting of Atriplex halimus, Moricandia nitens, Zygophyllum dumosum, Lycium shawii, Anabasis articulata, and Thymelaea hirsuta, the dominant plants in the area inhabited by the rodents. Drinking water was not available. We hypothesized that: (1) smaller animals would be more dependent than larger animals on highly digestible food items such as seeds, and (2) smaller animals would be more selective than larger animals for highly digestible and energy-rich plant parts. The minimum levels of millet seeds needed to maintain body mass were 97%, 94%, and 36% of maintenance energy requirements for G. henleyi, G. dasyurus, and M. crassus, respectively. Therefore, G. henleyi was the most dependent on seeds, and M. crassus the least, supporting hypothesis 1. At similar levels of seeds consumed, apparent digestibilities of dry matter (DMD) and energy of the total diet were highest for G. henleyi. In the absence of seeds, vegetation DMD averaged 88% in G. henleyi and 70% in M. crassus, yet G. henleyi lost body mass, as a percentage, twice as fast as M. crassus.

Several authors have proposed that fungal endophytes of woody perennials, like endophytes of grasses, have a mutualistic association with their host and provide enhanced protection from herbivory. However, there have been few tests of this hypothesis, and most studies have focused on correlating the presence of endophytes and herbivores. We investigated a system where an endophyte was known to cause significant mortality on one species of gall-forming insect (Besbicus mirabilis), but not another (Bassettia ligni) that occupies the same plant host. We predicted that gall insects should avoid high-endophyte space and that mortality would be lowest in low-endophyte space if endophytes protect plants from herbivory. We used the spatial location, temporal infection patterns, and within-leaf growth activity of the endophyte as elements of endophyte space. Besbicus mirabilis avoided high-endophyte space at the within-leaf scale by occupying part of the leaf where endophyte infection and endophyte-caused mortality were predictably low. However, the within-leaf position was under opposing selection pressure from mortality caused by grazing herbivores and developmental constraints, so the gall did not occupy the region of the leaf where both infection and endophyte-caused mortality were the lowest. B. ligni was spatially correlated within leaves with the presence of the endophyte but suffered almost no endophyte-caused mortality. However, B. ligni occupies the leaf lamina, where the endophyte has no growth activity, in contrast to the leaf midrib, where B. mirabilis galls are found. Further, B. ligni emerges from the gall just as endophyte infection levels reach a peak, so this species temporally avoids prolonged contact with highly infected tissue. However, the between-leaf distributions of both insects were independent of endophyte infection. Fungal endophytes influence the spatial patterns of insect distributions, but at different scales.

The outcomes of such experiments are often difficult to anticipate solely on the basis of intuition. This is because the effects of a perturbation may pass through a complex network of direct and indirect pathways in a food web, and the outcome may be highly sensitive to the strength of interactions among species. One solution to understanding outcomes of press experiments is to quantify first the community matrix, the matrix of measured direct interactions between all species in a food web, and then obtain the inverse of this matrix. The inverse of the community matrix predicts the effect of all species presses on all other species. I evaluated the utility of the inverse community matrix in predicting the outcomes of press experiments in an old-field food web. I used data from field and laboratory experiments to quantify the interaction strengths between grasshoppers, four old-field plants, and nitrogen supply. These values were used to parameterize the community matrix and obtain its inverse in a Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation was used to predict the mean and standard error in the outcome of a simultaneous nitrogen and herbivore press on food-web structure and dynamics. The predictions were compared with data from an enclosure experiment in the field in which I manipulated nitrogen supply and herbivore abundance. There was a high degree of uncertainty predicted and observed in the study system. Despite this, I show that the degree and the sources of uncertainty were predictable for each species.

Recruitment of bluebanded gobies (Lythrypnus dalli) and blackeye gobies (Coryphopterus nicholsii) consistently increased with distance from a nearby large reef. Recruitment of Lythrypnus was enhanced by the presence of older resident conspecifics. I found no strong evidence of any competitive effects between the two species. Predators had a variety of important effects on the density of recruits. Recruitment of Lythrypnus was halved by predators; this was the result of direct and indirect effects of predators: in addition to directly reducing recruit density, predators also reduced recruitment indirectly by reducing the density of older residents to which recruits responded. I developed two related methods for quantifying the contributions of the direct and indirect components of the predator effect. The effect of predation was spatially variable for both species: the net effect of this variability was the elimination of recruitment patterns related to reef location. Hence, the effects of spatially variable input of recruits was dependent upon the presence of predators, and thereby, predation altered the relative importance of the other factors that affected recruitment of the gobies.

Data for three nymphalid butterfly species, Euphydryas editha, Speyeria mormonia, and Heliconius charitonius, were compared with the predictions. These three species differ in adult diet and fraction of oocytes mature at adult emergence (hence, potential for adult nutrients to be used to make eggs), with E. editha showing the least potential for use of adult nutrients in egg production and H. charitonius showing the greatest potential. For all three species, body mass declined with age, although nonlinearly for E. editha. This indicated that metabolic expenditures were greater than intake at all ages, and that a constant fraction of stored nutrients was allocated to reproduction and other metabolic uses at each age for E. editha. Reproductive effort also declined with age for all three species. The specific patterns seen suggested that incoming nutrients may be stored, to some extent, early in life and then used late in life by both S. mormonia and H. charitonius.

Previous researchers have suggested that Neomysis are superior prey because the growth rate and condition factor of juvenile weakfish in Delaware Bay are positively associated with the proportion of Neomysis in the diet. Laboratory experiments were conducted to (1) examine prey preferences of juvenile weakfish foraging on Neomysis and Crangon; (2) determine whether selective predation leads to short- and long-term energy maximization; and (3) identify pre- and postconsumptive factors that influence relative prey profitability and potentially constrain weakfish foraging success and growth. Weakfish preyed selectively on Neomysis over a range of relative prey abundances, including trials where available. Crangon biomass was ≃20 times greater than Neomysis biomass. Preconsumptive cost : benefit analyses based on prey energy content (E), prey biomass (M), and predator handling times (H(t)) failed to predict prey selection by juvenile weakfish. These analyses indicated that fish should select Crangon over Neomysis to maximize gross E/H(t) and M/H(t). The inadequacy of E/H(t) and M/H(t) as measures of prey profitability was revealed through consideration of postconsumptive processes. In particular, Neomysis were digested and evacuated from the stomach 1.8 times faster than Crangon. The hypothesis that differential prey digestibility influenced prey profitability was tested by comparing long-term energy intake rate and growth rate of weakfish foraging and libitum on Neomysis vs. Crangon. Mean daily energy intake and growth rate were significantly higher for fish foraging of Neomysis, providing evidence that selective predation on Neomysis functioned as a rate-maximizing strategy.

To separate the effects related to the age of the tree at the time the tree ring was formed from effects due to environmental changes, analyzed wood samples were extracted from a very large sample set including different tree ages and calendar dates of wood formation. For the first 75 yr of the life of Abies alba, δ13C of wood holocellulose increases with the age of the tree from -24.4‰ at age 15 to approximately -22.5‰ at age 75. Between the ages of 75 and 150 values remain constant at -22.5‰. Consequently, the effect of the tree age on isotopic discrimination has to be taken into account in studies on the long-term environmental effects on δ13C in tree rings. Divergent trends of δ13C during the last century were observed between tree rings formed at age 40 and bulk air data. The isotopic discrimination A varied insignificantly around a mean of 17.3‰ between the 1860s and the 1930s. It then decreased to 15.8‰ from the 1930s to the 1980s. Using these results and classical models of carbon discrimination, we calculated that the intrinsic water-use efficiency (A/g(w), the ratio of CO2 assimilation rate to stomatal conductance for water vapor), integrated over the year, has increased by 30% between the 1930s and the 1980s. These results, obtained at the level of mature trees, are consistent with the physiological effects of increasing CO2 concentrations as observed in controlled experiments on young seedlings. They are consistent with the strong increases in radial growth observed for Abies alba in western Europe over the past decades.

An increasingly popular way to investigate these large-scale processes is through regressions of local on regional species richness. We sampled local and regional species richness in a broad array of taxa from around the world to address five questions. First, is the relationship between local and regional species richness linear, or does local richness accumulate more slowly at progressively higher regional diversities, suggesting local saturation of species diversity? Second, do these relationships vary with locality size? Third, do taxa and continents differ in the form of relationships between local and regional diversity? Fourth, do relationships between local and regional diversity depart from that expected from a null model in which all individuals of a locality are randomly sampled from a regional pool of species whose abundances have a canonical log-normal distribution? Fifth, using this same null model, how does the expected relationship between local and regional species richness depend on the sampling intensity within localities? We used distribution maps to ensure that diversity was sampled in a consistent manner across diverse taxa. Each region was 500 × 500 km, and localities were 1% and 10% of the region size. There was no evidence of local species saturation, as local species richness was strongly and linearly related to regional richness at both spatial scales. Between scales, local diversity accumulated faster as a function of regional diversity at the larger spatial scale. The slope of this relationship between local and regional diversity was the same among taxa across continents, and between Australia and North America across taxa. In other words, at each spatial scale one relationship between local and regional diversity describes most cases very well. The null model showed that approximately linear relationships between local and regional diversity are expected when regional species abundances are log-normal and when the number of individuals sampled within localities is large (roughly 200 times the number of species in the most species-rich region examined). However, empirical slopes were less than expected from the null model, which we interpret as an effect of spatial turnover of species (beta diversity). Since these slopes were nevertheless similar among taxa and between regions, rates of spatial turnover must be approximately the same among these taxa and regions. The log-normal model also showed that nonlinear (concave down) relationships between local and regional diversity are expected under random sampling when sample size is small relative to regional diversity. Therefore, nonlinear relationships are not necessarily indicative of saturation. Our results suggest that at the scales investigated here local communities are unsaturated and that their diversities are strongly limited by species richness of the surrounding regions. Similarity between taxa and continents in the form of the local-regional diversity relationship implies that ""rules"" governing the assembly of local communities may be widely consistent. If so, understanding species diversity in local assemblages will require knowledge of processes acting at larger spatial scales, including determinants of regional species richness and spatial turnover of species.",366,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Biodiversity | Community saturation | Community structure | Local and regional | Log-normal distribution | Sampling methodology | Spatial scale | Species abundance | Species diversity | Species richness | Species richness among taxa | Species richness between continents,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,71,NA,NA

Ecological profile methods were used to investigate (for each species and each water quality variable) whether stress index or frequency of occurrence varied significantly along environmental gradients. Most stress profiles showed significant departures from uniformity, whereas many frequency profiles did not, indicating that the stress index approach is more sensitive to differences in water quality than are approaches based simply on presence/absence data. To further investigate relationships between water quality variables and D665/D665a ratio, canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used.

This research evaluated how plant phytochemical responses to enriched atmospheric CO2 are affected by the availability of soil nitrate (NO3-) and how these chemical changes, in turn, alter the performance of a tree-feeding folivore. Seedlings of three deciduous tree species - quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), red oak (Quercus rubra), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) - were grown in ambient (355 μL/L) or elevated (650 μL/L) CO2 in combination with low (1.25 mmol/L) or high (7.5 mmol/L) soil NO3- availability. After 60 d, foliage was analyzed for changes in nutrients and allelochemicals likely to be influenced by the availability of CO2 and NO3-. Penultimate gypsy moth larvae (Lymantria dispar) were reared on foliage (aspen and maple) to determine how performance would be affected by host chemical changes. Using the framework of carbon-nutrient balance (CNB) theory, we tested three hypotheses regarding the impact of CO2 and NO3- availability on plant chemistry and insect performance: (1) nitrogen-based compounds will decrease, and carbon-based compounds will increase in response to elevated CO2 and/or low NO3-; (2) aspen will exhibit the greatest change in C:N ratios, and maple the least; and (3) phytochemical changes will influence gypsy moth performance, with larvae fed aspen being affected more than those fed maple. Concentrations of nitrogen and soluble protein decreased, whereas concentrations of starch, condensed tannins, and ellagitannins increased, in response to elevated CO2 and/or low NO3-. Responses of simple carbohydrates and phenolic glycosides were variable, however, suggesting that foliar accumulations of ""dynamic metabolites"" do not follow the predictions of CNB theory as well as do those of stable end products. With respect to Hypothesis 2, we found that absolute (net) changes in foliar C:N ratios were greatest for aspen and least for oak, whereas relative (proportional) changes were greatest for maple and least for aspen. Thus, Hypothesis 2 was only partially supported by the data. Considering Hypothesis 3, we found that elevated CO2 treatments had little effect on gypsy moth development time, growth rate, or larval mass. Larvae reared on aspen foliage grown under elevated CO2 exhibited increased consumption but decreased conversion efficiencies. Gypsy moth responses to NO3- were strongly host specific: the highest consumption and food digestibility occurred in larvae on high-NO3- aspen, whereas the fastest growth rates occurred in larvae on high-NO3- maple. In short, our results again only partially supported the predicted pattern. They indicate, however, that the magnitude of insect response elicited by resource-mediated shifts in host chemistry will depend on how levels of compounds with specific importance to insect fitness (e.g., phenolic glycosides in aspen) are affected. Overall, we observed relatively few true interactions (i.e., nonadditive) between carbon and nitrogen availability vis à vis foliar chemistry and insect performance. Tree species, however, frequently interacted with CO2 and/or NO3- availability to affect both sets of parameters.

In both years, fish (the cyprinid Phoxinus eos) reduced the abundance of large Zooplankton species and increased the biomass of phytoplankton as predicted by the top-down control hypothesis. Fish had strong effects on the dynamics and fluxes of N and P. Total P concentrations in the water column declined over time in all enclosures, but fish slowed the rate of decline. Thus total water column P increased with increasing fish biomass. Total N increased less strongly with increasing fish biomass, and thus the total N:P ratio decreased with increasing fish biomass. The concentrations of particulate carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in the water column also increased with increased fish biomass. Particulate N:P ratio decreased with increased fish biomass, but effects were weaker compared to effects on total N:P ratios. Nutrient ratios of the Zooplankton fraction (particles >63 μm) showed a response that was transient but consistent with observed trends in Zooplankton species composition. In particular, when the large cladocerans Daphnia and Holopedium increased upon exclusion of fish, C:P and N:P ratios of the Zooplankton fraction showed distinct declines, corresponding to the relatively high body P contents of these taxa. Phosphorus budgets revealed that fish were a net source of P to the water column, because they lost mass during the experiments, even at densities below those in the lake. However, loss of P from fish could not account for the higher total P concentration observed in enclosures with fish compared to fishless enclosures. The absolute amount of P sinking from the water column increased with increasing fish biomass but decreased when expressed as percentage of total P sinking, again suggesting that the presence of fish increases the relative retention of P the water column. The rate of decline in water column total P in the presence of fish was accurately predicted by sedimentation of P from the water column and other fluxes.

Carex diandra, C. rostrata, and C. lasiocarpa are dominant in less productive mesotrophic fens, whereas C. acutiformis is dominant in more productive eutrophic fens. For each species, three types of litter were used: litter collected in the field (FLD); and litter from experimental populations grown at low (LN: 3.3 g N·m-2.yr-1) and high N supply (HN: 20.0 g N·m-2.yr-1). For all the litter chemistry parameters studied there were highly significant interactions between species and litter type. This implies that, due to differential plant-mediated controls on leaf litter chemistry, it is not always possible to predict changes in litter chemistry in response to increased nutrient supply. Litter decay was determined in a long-term (3 yr) field experiment using litter bags. The litter types of each species were incubated at their native growing sites. Contrary to what is generally found, the leaf litter decomposition rate of the species growing at the nutrient-poorest site (C. diandra) was higher than that of the species growing at the nutrient-richest site (C. acutiformis). Only for C. diandra and C. lasiocarpa was the decomposition rate of the litter from the HN treatment higher than that of the field litter. Thus, increased nutrient supply does not necessarily lead to higher litter decomposition rates. Nutrient controls on litter decay changed with time: initial litter decay (≤3 mo) was strongly controlled (high r2 values) by all P-related litter quality parameters, whereas long-term litter decay (>1 yr) was most strongly related with the phenolics : N ratio, the phenolics : P ratio, the lignin : N ratio, and the C:N ratio. Our data suggest that high levels of atmospheric N deposition, such as in the study area (The Netherlands), may lead to a relative shortage of P in the plant-derived substrates for bacteria and fungi. As a result, P-related litter chemistry parameters exert a strong influence on litter decay. Our data did not support the hypothesis that high-nutrient species increase nutrient cycling due to the production of easily decomposable litter with high rates of nutrient release. The leaf litter from Carex acutiformis, the species from the high-productivity fens, decomposed more slowly than that of the other species, immobilized more N and P and had a longer period of net N and P immobilization. However, this species has a higher litter production than the other species and thereby increases the rate of nutrient cycling. At the intraspecific level, increased nutrient supply led to lower amounts of immobilized N and P and faster N and P release from litter in most species, and thereby to a higher rate of nutrient cycling. This positive feedback between nutrient supply rate and the rate of nutrient cycling is reinforced by the increase in litter production in response to increased nutrient supply.",271,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,C:N ratio | C:P ratio | Carbon balance | Carex | Decomposition | Lignin | Litter chemistry | Nutrient cycling | Nutrient leaching | Nutrient release | Peatlands | Phenolics,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,75,NA,NA

We investigated the growth responses and biomass production of six Great Basin plant species growing in monocultures in the field following a single pulse of nitrogen applied in early, mid, or late spring. As a control, we applied the same total quantity of N that was in each of the individual pulses as a continuous series of applications at twice-weekly intervals over 10 wk in the spring. Surprisingly, most of the species grown under the control, continuous N supply had lower growth rates, fewer tillers, and less biomass production than plants receiving N in a pulse. At least one of the pulse treatments increased biomass production relative to controls in all but one species. The exception to this pattern was the shrub Chrysothamnus, which responded to all pulse treatments and the control supply with equivalent growth rates and biomass production. Each species responded differently to the set of pulses, with the greatest response occurring early in the growth phase when plants were small and growth rates were high. Thus, phenological stage determined the timing of maximum response. Four of six species not only responded to the early-spring pulse, but also had their greatest response to this pulse, suggesting that the cold-season-adapted species of the Great Basin system are well suited to take advantage of this pulse. The combination of rapid plant growth rates and predictable pulses following snowmelt would likely result in intense competition for nutrients at this time. Our study demonstrates that plants are remarkably capable of utilizing pulses of N, and that pulsed nutrients are potentially important in natural systems. In addition, it suggests that studies conducted under constant nutrient supply may not reflect the responses of plants growing under pulsed nutrient conditions.

The model predicts that foragers should seek patches that yield higher feeding rates in the presence of increased costs. GUDs also should increase, since they should correlate directly with quitting-harvest rates, as long as the forager experiences diminishing returns on its rate of resource harvest. We identified behavioral trade-offs made by deer mice when foraging in the presence of fire ants.

To answer this question, I measured energy budgets of individual female desert tortoises from July 1987 to July 1989. Females produced eggs in years with low levels of winter annual plants by relaxing their control of energy and water homeostasis. They tolerated large deficits and surpluses in their body dry-matter composition (both nonlipid and lipid) on a seasonal, annual, and longer time scale. They could increase body energy content (lipid and nonlipid energy) before winter and use this reserve (especially nonlipid energy) the following spring to produce eggs. Females used high-protein foods and rainwater, when available, to achieve energy surpluses that helped them survive periods of low resource availability (e.g., during hibernation and droughts). Adjusting seasonal and annual field metabolic rates (FMR) and food requirements to levels of food availability, they still managed to produce eggs, even in a drought year. Egg production in 1988 (mean ± 1 SD: 3.56 ± 1.94 eggs, N = 9) did not differ from that in 1989 (3.00 ± 2.69 eggs, N = 9); both were lower than during 1983-1987 (6.75 ± 3.05 eggs, N = 100). Energy per se did not limit egg production in 1988 and 1989, but the availability of nonlipid energy (probably protein) limited egg production in 1988 and was limiting in spring 1989. Yet, water was the primary resource limiting egg production in 1989. Females forgoing egg production in 1989 accumulated body nonlipid energy and lost less total body water than did females producing eggs. Females that produced eggs in 1989 forfeited body nonlipid energy. In 1988 and 1989, the paucity of new annual plants in spring contributed to a lower egg production. The amount of annuals that germinate in summer can affect egg production, because females stored nonlipid energy during summer 1988 when eating these annuals, and allocated this energy to eggs in the following spring (1989). Tortoises stored lipids during summer when consuming dry annuals. These lipids are critical for surviving the winter, but females forfeited body water and nonlipid dry matter to digest the dry annuals. Reproductive effort (RE) was higher during the drought year (July 1988-July 1989: RE = 26.1%) than during the wetter year (July 1987-July 1988: RE = 13.0%) because tortoises reduced FMR by 70-90% in 1989. Compared to two other chelonians, RE of desert tortoises was consistent with the K-selected trend of lower RE for larger, long-lived, and late-maturing species.

Estimated body temperature was highly correlated with telemetered body temperature (mean difference 0.8°C). Thus, our model for estimating lizard body temperatures may be useful in field studies where telemetry is not possible. Data from both telemetry and estimation with the model showed that green iguanas maintained relatively constant body temperatures (minimum 32.9 ± 1.4°C; maximum 36.6 ± 2.9°C; mean ±1 SD) during the midday period (0945-1545). Temperature measurements of taxidermic mounts and ambient air showed that body temperatures between 29°C and 40.5°C could readily be attained on Curaçao.

The objective of this paper was to assess the pattern and dynamics of Bromus pictus seed availability in this community, which represent the other portion of the recruitment equation. We first evaluated its seed bank along transects. Plant- or litter-covered areas had 85% of the sampled seeds; however, they accounted for 55% of the area. Bare-soil areas had seeds only if they were located close (≤10 cm) to a plant or litter microsite. In a second study, we analyzed the movement of seeds using pitfall traps. Traps located near plants captured seed amounts similar to those from traps located in bare-ground areas (far from plants). The contrast between the high number of seeds in transit and the low number of seeds retained by bare-ground microsites illustrates the importance of lateral secondary movement of seeds. We used this information on seed distribution and previous data about establishment probabilities to estimate the spatial pattern of recruitment. Microsites that are vegetated or close to individual plants are expected to recruit the greatest number of individuals.

The dynamics of allocation from these sources are predicted to differ among nutrient types, depending on the relative availability of each nutrient type from adult and juvenile feeding. Using radiotracer techniques, I examined reproductive allocation of glucose and amino acids from adult and juvenile sources in two nymphalid butterflies, Euphydryas editha and Speyeria mormonia. The species used were intermediate in expected importance of adult nutrients to egg production, with abundant carbohydrates but few nitrogenous compounds available from the adult diet. As predicted, for compounds abundantly available in the adult diet, incoming nutrients were used in preference to stored nutrients. For compounds present in low amounts in the adult diet, juvenile reserves were used throughout adult life, although adult sources were used if available. Nutrients received by the female from the male at mating, although expected to be treated as stored reserves, were immediately used in egg production. Thus, restriction of adult or juvenile feeding may cause different nutrient types (e.g., carbohydrates, nitrogenous compounds) to become limiting to reproduction. These results are consistent with earlier allocation studies examining age-specific changes in body mass and reproductive effort, and the effects on fecundity of quantitative adult food reduction. The work has implications for understanding the evolution of nutrient types donated by males to females, the effects of a holometabolous lifestyle on age-specific fecundity, and the effects of using stored reserves vs. income in reproduction.

Nearly all courtship and adult feeding occur on the inflorescences of this long-lived perennial. Furthermore, because females oviposit on inflorescences and larvae feed only on flowers and developing seeds, the window of opportunity for exploiting this resource is narrow. I demonstrated that inflorescence phenology varied according to the aspect and elevation of plant patches, and butterflies were most likely to occur in patches nearing full bloom. A mark - release - recapture study revealed that indi-vidual butterflies can disperse far enough to sample from a wide range of patch phenologies, and the movements of females are apparently influenced by those phenologies. In particular, an uphill bias in female movement appeared to be the result of greater emigration from senescing low-elevation patches than from phenologically delayed, high-elevation patches. Males showed no such uphill movement. The apparent result of the uphill movement by females was that larval densities increased fourfold over a 300-m elevational gradient in each of two years. Differential mortality is an unlikely explanation for this variation in larval density, as both parasitism rates and frequency of visitation by ants, which tend larvae, did not vary with elevation. To demonstrate the influence of host plant phenology on adult behavior, I manipulated flowering phenology in an artificially established grid of small host plant patches and observed the encounters of adult butterflies with those patches. Inflorescences in patches that were nearing full bloom received disproportionately many visits by females, indicating that patches in this phenological state were more attractive to females. Small sample sizes prevented me from determining if this result was due to increased entry into those patches by females, an increased number of inflorescence visitations per female, or both. The frequency with which inflorescences in the different patches were visited by males did not vary with patch phenology. These results suggest that the uphill bias in dispersal by females is indeed a response to host plant phenology.

The prey were Manduca sexta (Sphingidae) caterpillars, Solanaceae specialists with a preference for tomato. Whether an allelochemical had a negative, neutral, or positive effect on developmental time or mass gained by the predators depended on thermal regime and the combination of allelochemicals in the prey's diet. The effects of multiple allelochemicals were not always additive. For the most part, the allelochemicals had greater negative effects at the warmer thermal regime. Effects of allelochemicals also depended on the stage of the predator. Individually, chlorogenic acid and rutin prolonged developmental time of second-instar nymphs. In contrast, only rutin and tomatine together affected developmental time of fourth-instar nymphs, and this combination of allelochemicals reduced developmental time. Tomatine substantially reduced mass gained by second-instar nymphs but had no effect on mass gained by fourth-instar nymphs. Rutin and tomatine together had no effect on second-instar nymphs but increased the mass of fourth-instar nymphs. There were no allelochemical by temperature interactions for second-instar nymphs, whereas allelochemical by temperature interactions influenced stadium duration, final dry mass, and relative growth rate of fourth-instar nymphs. Rutin and tomatine together eliminated the negative effect of chlorogenic acid on consumption of prey by the fourth-instar nymphs. Chlorogenic acid by itself and rutin and tomatine together increased the efficiency of conversion of ingested prey to nymphal biomass.

Although this species was formerly thought to be strictly dioecious, in a survey of 24 Ochradenus populations along a latitudinal rainfall gradient, we found sex expression to be extremely variable. While females reproduced only by seeds, males ranged across a continuum from ""pure males"" that produced only pollen to ""inconstant males,"" which produced seeds in addition to pollen. For sexual dimorphism to evolve from cosexuality, it is believed that the sex morphs must be compensated for their loss of one sex function (e.g., pollen production) by an increase in the remaining sex function (i.e., seed production). In our study we found that females produced 9-20 times as many seeds as males, and we showed in a controlled laboratory experiment that their offspring had higher germination and seedling growth rates. Pure males invested more biomass in stamens than did inconstant males. Previously published models concerned with the evolution of sexual dimorphisms have predicted that: (1) the frequency of inconstant males should be inversely related to the frequency of females, and (2) if the degree of male inconstancy is influenced by environmental factors, then seed production in males should decline along with habitat quality. We found support for both of these predictions. Although the sex ratio did not differ significantly from 1:1 in 19 of the 24 populations surveyed, the frequency of male inconstancy did vary geographically. The fraction of males that produced fruit in a population declined on a north-south gradient that reflected a three-fold decline in rainfall. Among populations, the frequency of females was negatively correlated with the frequency of inconstant males.

Three mechanisms can account for these ""top-down"" effects of fish: decreased herbivory by Zooplankton when fish biomass is high; modification of nutrient recycling rates by the herbivorous Zooplankton assemblage as fish biomass varies; and nutrient recycling by fish. These processes were experimentally separated and their relative importance quantified in Tuesday Lake, Michigan. This was accomplished by manipulating the abundance of planktivorous fish or Zooplankton in enclosures containing natural phytoplankton communities, and by incubating phytoplankton in nutrient-permeable chambers (which excluded herbivores) placed inside these enclosures. In large enclosures with all trophic levels, several phytoplankton taxa and total phytoplankton biomass showed increased abundance in the presence of fish compared to enclosures without fish. Several taxa also showed significantly greater abundance in nutrientpermeable chambers incubated in enclosures with fish than in chambers incubated in enclosures without fish. The latter result indicates that some phytoplankton taxa respond to fish even when separated from direct herbivory but exposed to nutrients recycled by consumers. Thus, consumer-mediated nutrient recycling had strong effects on phytoplankton community dynamics and could partly explain the ""top-down"" effects of fish. Most phytoplankton taxa responded to consumer-mediated nutrient recycling, especially dinoflagellates and chrysophytes. In separate enclosures, phytoplankton were exposed to contrasting Zooplankton assemblages shaped by fish predation but without fish being present. The response of phytoplankton was not as strong as in the case of fish manipulations. Furthermore, the communitylevel response of phytoplankton was weaker in nutrient-permeable chambers placed in these enclosures than in chambers incubated in enclosures with fish. Nutrient limitation assays showed that manipulation of fish decreased phosphorus limitation of phytoplankton, while direct manipulation of Zooplankton had no effect on phosphorus limitation. These results provide experimental evidence that food web effects on nutrient recycling are important in controlling phytoplankton community dynamics. Results also suggest that some of these effects are expressed via direct recycling of nutrients by fish, as well as by fish-induced effects on nutrient recycling by herbivores.

Males that spawned at 3 yr of age obtained on average many more eggs than males that delayed reproduction, suggesting that age at reproduction is a conditional strategy. Body size appears to be the trait used to determine the value of the life history decision; small age-3 males were more likely to delay reproduction than large males. The tactic adopted by males may also depend on events that occur well before the time of the life history decision, as males of a cohort that were large at age 3 were also large at age 1. Furthermore, growth over that time period was depensatory. Thus, environmental influences during early ontogeny could potentially direct males into alternative life history pathways. Males that delayed reproduction ultimately reproduced at a larger body size than males that spawned at age 3. Due to size-dependent reproduction within a spawning season, and indeterminate growth, males that delayed reproduction also reproduced relatively early within a spawning season. The progeny of males that spawn at age 3 should consequently experience a relatively short period of growth prior to winter; males that delay reproduction should produce progeny that are large at age 1, whereas the progeny of males that spawn at age 3 should be relatively small. These patterns suggest that the association between timing of reproduction and body size within a spawning season will produce a negative paternal effect for age at reproduction such that the life history alternates in successive generations; males that spawn at age 3 produce progeny that delay reproduction and vice versa. Environmental changes at various stages of the life cycle could alter the proportion of males that adopt each tactic.

The experiments manipulated these variables over 3- to 9-yr periods and were intended to simulate anticipated changes in the arctic environment. Our objective was to use the model to extend the analysis of the experimental data so that unmeasured changes in ecosystem C storage and the underlying mechanisms controlling those changes could be estimated and compared. Using an inverse calibration method, we derived a single parameter set for the model that closely simulated the measured responses of tussock tundra to all of the experimental treatments. This parameterization allowed us to infer confidence limits for ecosystem components and processes that were not directly measured in the experiments. Thus, we used the model to estimate changes in ecosystem C storage by inferring key soil processes within the constraints imposed by measured components of the ecosystem C budget. Because tussock tundra is strongly N limited, we hypothesized that changes in ecosystem C storage in response to the experimental treatments would be constrained by several key aspects of C-N interactions: (1) changes in the amount of N in the ecosystem, (2) changes in the C:N ratios of vegetation and soil, and (3) redistribution of N between soil (with a low C:N ratio) and vegetation (with a high C:N ratio). The model results reveal widely differing patterns of change in C-N interactions and constraints on change in ecosystem C storage among treatments. For example, after 9 yr the elevated CO2 (2 x ambient) treatment and the N fertilized (10 g N · m-2 · yr-1) treatment increased ecosystem C stocks by 1.4 and 2.9%, respectively. Whereas the increase in the CO2 treatment was due solely to an increase in the C:N ratios of vegetation and soil, the increase in the fertilized treatment was due to increased ecosystem N content and a shift of N from soil to vegetation. In contrast, the greenhouse (3.5°C above ambient) and shade (one-half ambient light) treatments decreased ecosystem C stocks by 1.9 and 2.7%, respectively. The primary reason for the net C losses in these treatments was an increase in respiration relative to photosynthesis, with a consequent decrease in the ecosystem C:N ratio. However, when we simulated the elevated temperatures in the greenhouse treatment without the confounding effects of decreased light intensity (an artifact of the greenhouse structures), there was a long-term increase in ecosystem C stocks because of increased photosynthetic response to the temperature-induced shift of N from soil to vegetation. If our simulated changes in ecosystem C storage are extrapolated for the ≃43 Pg C contained in arctic tundras globally, the maximum net gain or loss (≃0.3% per yr) from tundra would be equivalent to 0.13 Pg C/yr. Although fluxes of this magnitude would have a relatively minor impact on current changes in atmospheric CO2, the long-term impact on tundra C stores could be significant.

We used a model (MBL-GEM, Marine Biological Laboratory General Ecosystem Model) of ecosystem C and nitrogen (N) dynamics to predict and analyze historical (1829-1990) changes in C storage in a N-limited, tussock-tundra ecosystem near Toolik Lake on the North Slope of Alaska. The model simulates stand-level photosynthesis and N uptake by plants, allocation of C and N to foliage, stems, and fine roots, respiration in these tissues, turnover of biomass through litterfall, and decomposition of litter and soil organic matter. We first calibrated the model by deriving a single parameter set that closely simulated the response of tussock tundra to decade-long experimental manipulations of nutrients, temperature, light, and atmospheric CO2. The calibrated model predicts that historical increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 have increased total ecosystem C storage. Higher temperatures increased soil and plant respiration, but those losses of C were overcompensated by increased photosynthesis resulting from redistribution of N from soil to plants. This redistribution of N was due to increased net mineralization and uptake of N. Increases in atmospheric CO2 also increased photosynthesis, but consequent increases in C storage were constrained by limits on increases in the C:N ratio of vegetation. In contrast, hypothesized historical decreases in soil moisture substantially decreased simulated total ecosystem C storage as a result of large increases in soil respiration. With decreased soil moisture, increases in photosynthesis associated with redistribution of N from soil to plants only partially compensated for respiratory C losses, as plant uptake of N could not keep pace with increased N mineralization rates. Consequent losses of N from the ecosystem contributed to the declines in C storage under drier conditions. Based on the combined effects of reconstructed historical changes in atmospheric CO2, mean growing-season temperature, and two alternative soil moisture scenarios, the model predicts a -5.4 to +2.3% change in ecosystem C from-1829 to 1990. These estimates are consistent with field evidence that historically recent changes in C storage of tussock tundra have been relatively small. However, the model also predicts that relatively large transient losses of ecosystem C (50-180 g · m-2 · yr-1) may frequently have occurred since the late 1800s, with one of the largest simulated C losses of the 20th century occurring from 1988 to 1990 (3-yr average = 133 g C · m-2 · yr-1). These simulated losses were similar to losses measured in tussock tundra at Toolik Lake from 1983 to 1990 (e.g., 1990 losses = 156 g C · m-2 · yr-1) but nonetheless suggest that these measured losses may be transitory in nature.",66,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Arctic | Carbon | Climate change | CO 2 | Light | Marine Biological Laboratory General Ecosystem (MBL-GEM) model | Models | Nitrogen | Soil moisture | Temperature | Tundra,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,94,NA,NA

For intertidal snails, the probability of dislodgment by a given flow is determined, in part, by shell size and shape, and by the attachment strength of the foot. This study addressed two questions. First, do habitat-specific differences in traits that reduce the risk of dislodgment of an intertidal snail (Littorina obtusata) parallel differences in wave energies? To address this question, I measured variation in (1) shell size (defined as the maximum projected surface area, MPSA); (2) foot size; (3) maximum shear dislodgment force; and (4) tenacity (dislodgment force per unit foot size) of two wave-exposed and three protected snail populations. Second, are habitat-specific differences in foot size, and hence attachment strength, the product of selection or of phenotypic plasticity in response to increased hydrodynamic stress? I conducted field transplant experiments and a laboratory flume experiment that manipulated water velocity to test for plasticity in foot size. Wave-exposed snails exhibited traits that reduce the risk of dislodgment. Their shells were smaller (MPSA) and more squat (shell height relative to MPSA and shell length) than were shells of protected conspecifics. Wave-exposed snails also had larger foot sizes and were thus able to resist greater shear dislodgment forces than protected conspecifics of similar MPSA. Neither wave exposure nor collection site influenced tenacity, indicating that the greater dislodgment forces of wave-exposed snails were due to their larger foot sizes. Assuming that MPSA is proportional to speed-specific drag, which is reasonable for bluff bodies, I found that dislodgment force was proportional to drag. Foot size scaled isometrically with MPSA, and dislodgment force scaled isometrically with foot size, indicating that the risk of dislodgment does not change as snails grow. The field and laboratory flume experiments provide the first clear demonstration that increased hydrodynamic stress induces plastic increases in foot size. Protected snails raised on a wave-exposed shore produced a larger foot than controls raised on their native shore. Selection on the foot size of protected snails raised on both shores was not detected in either habitat. Protected snails also produced larger foot sizes when raised in high-velocity flumes relative to snails raised under low-velocity flow. In contrast, wave-exposed snails exhibited no change in foot size when raised under both high- and low-velocity flow. Hence, variation in the foot size of wave-exposed snails is less flexible than that of protected conspecifics.

We take a relatively new approach to gradient analysis to quantify the changes in forest dominance (basal area of dominant tree species) and environmental factors (elevation, slope, aspect, intercepted photosynthetically active radiation [PAR], summer soil moisture, and soil depth and texture) across current lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) ecotones in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado, USA. Based on canonical correspondence analysis on data from eight 20 m wide, 140-480 m long vegetation transects, we found that lodgepole pine distribution, is described generally by elevation and moisture gradients, and to a lesser degree by soil characteristics. The first two ordination axes explained 72% of the variance in forest patterns. Environmental factors significantly correlated to the first ordination axis included: elevation, summer soil moisture, and percentage sand in the soil. Environmental factors significantly correlated to the second ordination axis included: growing-season soil moisture, surface rockiness, percentage silt, and percentage clay. However, superimposed on these general environmental gradients are ecotone-specific gradients that cannot be detected by typical gradient analysis approaches using only homogeneous plots. The basal area of lodgepole pine decreased nonlinearly and more sharply toward the ecotones than did the basal area of the neighboring tree species. Stepwise multiple linear regression and path coefficient analysis models showed that the basal area gradients of lodgepole pine into spruce/fir (Picea engelmannii Abies lasiocarpa) forests correlated with summer soil moisture; lodgepole pine gradients into lower elevation ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests correlated strongly with intercepted PAR, slope, percentage silt, soil depth, and percentage clay; and lodgepole pine gradients into limber pine (Pinus flexilis) forests correlated largely with elevation, intercepted PAR, percentage sand, and percentage clay. Furthermore, the factors controlling tree species distributions at ecotones are not symmetrical. For example, at the lodgepole pine to limber pine ecotone, different factors or different magnitudes of the same factors determined the upper limit of lodgepole pine and the lower limit of limber pine. We conclude that: (1) different factors control a species' upper and lower elevation limits; (2) unequal competition for resources occurs between tree species where their ranges overlap; and (3) generally, soil differences may not substantially restrain the movement of some forest types into neighboring types.",45,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,9 species-environment relationships | Forest distributions | Gradient analysis | Lodgepole pine | Pinus contorta | Vegetation ecotones,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,97,NA,NA

We describe a situation in which parasitism causes a host to change its feeding behavior and this change improves the expected fitness of the host and probably the fitness of its parasites. We have found that a tachinid parasitoid (Thelaira americana) often emerges from its caterpillar host (Platyprepia virginalis) without killing the host. Whether the host caterpillar survives its parasites depends in part on what it has been eating. Unparasitized caterpillars were more likely to survive to adulthood when feeding on lupine, whereas parasitized caterpillars were more likely to survive on poison hemlock. Development time and pupal masses of caterpillars (both parasitized and unparasitized) were not found to be affected by the host plants that they fed on. Survival of fly larvae in caterpillars that we determined were parasitized using ultrasound was not affected by host plant. However, fly pupae that emerged from caterpillars that had been reared on hemlock were heavier than those emerging from lupine-fed caterpillars. This was due primarily to the direct effect of diet on the flies and less so to the indirect benefit to flies whose host caterpillars survived their parasites by feeding on hemlock. Parasitized caterpillars were more likely to select hemlock, and unparasitized caterpillars were more likely to select lupine when offered both host plants in field tests. These results were consistent for the two years that the choice experiments were conducted. These results were also consistent with the hypothesis that caterpillars change their food plant choices so as to increase their conditional success. Conditional food choices that increase success depending upon parasite load are well accepted for humans, controversial for other primates, and unknown for insects. If caterpillars alter their host plant choices as a result of their parasite load, then this phenomenon could help to explain the evolution of host plant choices that have defied explanation in the past. Such a suggestion assumes that nonlethal parasitism is a common phenomenon. We believe that this may be the case since we did not detect the nonlethal nature of this interaction until we began the unconventional practice of rearing in the field. Other workers have described nonlethal parasitism for several tachinid-host systems, and many families of flies are similar to tachinids except that their hosts are vertebrates; these interactions are nonlethal.

This study documents a massive decline in phytoplankton biomass concurrent with the invasion of an exotic benthic bivalve, the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), and demonstrates that the zebra mussel actually caused this decline. In the fall of 1992 the zebra mussel became established at high biomass in the Hudson River Estuary, and biomass of mussels remained high during 1993 and 1994. During these 2 yr, grazing pressure on phytoplankton was over 10-fold greater than it had been prior to the zebra mussel invasion. This increased grazing was associated with an 85% decline in phytoplankton biomass. Between 1987 and 1991 (pre-invasion), summertime chlorophyll averaged 30 mg/m3; during 1993 and 1994 summertime concentrations were <5 mg/m3. Over this same period, light availability increased, phosphate concentrations doubled, some planktonic grazers declined, and average flow was not different from the pre-invasion period. Thus, changes in these other factors were not responsible for phytoplankton declines. We developed a mechanistic model that reproduces the spatial and temporal dynamics of phytoplankton prior to the invasion of the zebra mussel (1987-1991). The model accurately predicts extreme declines in phytoplankton biomass after the invasion (1993-1994). The model demonstrates that zebra mussel grazing was sufficient to cause the observed phytoplankton decline. The model also allows us to test which features make the Hudson River sensitive to the impact of benthic grazers.

Capture-recapture data arising from Pollock's robust design provide the basis for obtaining unbiased estimates of demographic parameters in the presence of temporary emigration, and for estimating the probability of temporary emigration.

We propose a solution to the problem of estimating the parameters describing the relationship between habitat characteristics and biology or behavior, and of testing the statistical significance of these parameters; this problem is referred to as the fourth-corner problem, from its matrix formulation.

Elephant seals (178 mothers and 445 pups) were weighed during four breeding periods at South Georgia Island. Maternal mass change during lactation increased markedly with the mass of the mother at parturition. Postpartum maternal mass accounted for 75% of the variation in mass loss and 62% of the variation of pup mass at weaning. Size of the pup at birth explained <4% of this variation, and the sex of the pup explained virtually none (<0.1%). The duration of lactation was positively correlated with the postpartum mass of mothers, but negatively correlated with the rate of maternal mass loss when corrected for the effect of maternal postpartum mass. Mothers giving birth late in the season had shorter lactation periods than those that gave birth early but seemed to compensate for this by increasing the rate of mass transfer. Average transfer efficiency (pup mass gain/maternal mass loss) was 46 ± 0.5%. Mothers lost, on average, 35% of their postpartum mass during lactation and 40% during the whole breeding period. Females whose postpartum mass increased between seasons increased their expenditure on their pups; females whose postpartum mass decreased, decreased their expenditure. These data from mothers with single pups do not clarify whether differences in investment were controlled by mothers or their offspring. However on three occasions, study females raised two pups in a season. Despite the increased demand, these females did not increase their expenditure, suggesting that levels of investment are maternally controlled.

Using demographic information collected during eight summers of field work we built a stochastic matrix population model. The model successfully reconstructed the observed decline in the population during the course of the study. The predictions of the model agreed with the observed population level in 1993, 5 yr after the study was completed. Sensitivity analysis showed that the population trend was most sensitive to changes in adult survivorship and to immigration of adults onto the site. We ran simulations to consider five possible reasons for the decline: (1) low adult survivorship, (2) low fecundity, (3) delayed recruitment into the population, (4) low juvenile survivorship, and (5) insufficient immigration. For biologically reasonable values of these parameters, only adult survivorship and immigration rates could account for the observed decline, although juvenile survival also had some impact. These simulations also illustrate that sensitivity is a complex function of the demographic variables, and in particular, sensitivity to adult survival varies across the range of adult survival values that we considered. In addition, we used the model to explore the influence of annual variability in demographic parameters. It is known that the general effect of annual variation is to depress population trends. We showed that the sensitivity of the model to annual variability in survival is tied to the sensitivity of the model to changes in mean values of survival. With the empirical parameter values from this local population, we found that, when survival is high enough to promote stability of the population, the population is highly sensitive to the level of survival, and also to the amount of annual variability in survival.

The energy that female moose (Alces alces) store during the summer as body fat is used to meet energy needs in winter. The foraging strategy used by an animal affects its daily and annual energy balance. Consequently, foraging strategies and the distribution of food in the landscape can affect individual fitness and population growth through their effects on the energy balance of reproductive females. Models that unify landscape structure, foraging theory, and animal energy metabolism can be used to investigate the effects of foraging strategies on survival and reproduction. We developed an energy and activity simulation environment (EASE) model that predicts the seasonal changes in energy requirements of a female moose foraging in a spatially explicit landscape with a resolution of 1 m2. We validated EASE for both moose and deer (Odocoileus spp.) with respect to body mass changes reported for feeding trials, activity times, and browse intake rates. Energy intake and body mass depended on forage abundance, its spatial distribution, and foraging strategy. In simulations with stochasticity imposed on model parameters, mean moose body mass decreased 4 kg in comparison to simulations that were deterministic. Simulated moose body mass was most sensitive to browse digestibility and least sensitive to maximum intake per day in 1-yr simulations. Moose using nonrandom foraging strategies had higher body mass and survival than moose using random foraging strategies. Differences between strategies increased as browse density decreased.

Many proximate and ultimate mechanisms underlying this geographic pattern have been suggested, but none has been adequately tested. I measured offspring growth rates in one northern and one southern strain over three consecutive laboratory generations, employing two separate experimental protocols (cross-mating and cross-fostering) to control for differential maternal investment. Paternal investment in the young was evaluated in separate tests. Northern root voles were larger at birth and grew faster than southern voles. Litter size and litter mass at birth were largest in the southern strain, when maternal body mass was adjusted for, indicating a larger prenatal reproductive expenditure in southern females. Cross-fostering and cross-breeding experiments demonstrated that the north-south difference in body mass is of genetic origin. Postnatal growth rate of cross-bred litters was intermediate between the two purebred strains, thus being consistent with an additive genetic mechanism. In contrast, neonatal mass of offspring from cross-bred pairs was similar to that of the southern strain, consistent with southern genetic dominance. Cross-fostering between the two strains showed that parental investment had no discernible effects on postnatal growth rate, although southern fathers showed more parental care than did northern fathers. Together, the cross-fostering and the cross-breeding experiments suggest that the growth rate of southern root voles was constrained by their own genotype and not by the characteristics of their mothers.

Here we examined the crucial all-else-equal assumption using a lake population of freshwater snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) in which both diploid sexual and triploid parthenogenetic individuals coexist.

Several features of guppies' biology co-vary with the predatornities including their social and sexual behaviors and the demograpby of their populations. Here, we test the hypothesis that some of the observed phenotypic variation in life history traits is induced by differences in the social environment of guppies. We tested this by rearing focal individuals in the laboratory in experimental populations composed of wild-caught guppies. The experimental populations were designed to represent two types of guppy communities: (1) Rivulus communities, where guppies co-occur only with a small killifish, Rivulus hartii, that preys on small guppies, and (2) Crenicichla communities, where they co-occur with several larger species of predator including Crenicichla alta a cichlid that prefers to prey on large guppies. We manipulated both the demography and the origin (predator community) of the guppies comprising the experimental populations. The focal guppies were offspring of guppies from one of the two predator localities. We found that guppies responded to both the demography and origin of the conspecifics with which they were reared. Therefore, phenotypic plasticity in response to social, environment is probably contributing to the variation in life history traits that has been observed in the field.

We quantified variability in the thermal regime using long-term meteorological records, and constructed an analytical model using empirical components for growth and reproduction. The model predicted that females should switch to diapause egg production in early August, a finding that was corroborated by experimental and field observations. The form of the switch between egg types predicted by the model was a transition that spanned only a few days and was similar to that estimated from a laboratory experiment.

Success in nonequilibrium environments depends in part on the ability to store energy and control its allocation during periods of extreme food limitation or outright starvation. Starvation resistance is one measure of the ability of a species to persist when energy intake s less than energy expenditure. The life-history responses of nine species of planktonic rotifers to food deprivation were compared using cohort life-table experiments. Allometric patterns of energy storage and respiration rate lead to the prediction that larger species should have greater starvation resistance than smaller species. Contrary to this prediction, when rotifers were acclimated to high resource levels and starved as young adults, body mass did not predict starvation time. Rather, there was a trade-off between survival and reproduction during starvation. Some species did not reproduce during starvation and had high starvation times (up to 5.0 d). Other species maintained or increased fecundity relative to fed controls and had low starvation times (as low as 0.4 d). Species with more rapid senescence when fed tended to have shorter starvation times. However, the interspecific trade-off between survival and reproduction remained after removing the effect of control survivorship. Differences in life-history responses to starvation may be critical in determining competitive outcome and community structure in variable environments. When acclimated to low food levels prior to food deprivation, simulating conditions of declining resource abundance in nature, rotifer starvation time decreased.

Populations of guppies that co-occurred with Rivulus had fewer small, immature guppies and more mid- and large-sized, mature guppies than populations of guppies that lived in the community of larger predators.

Ninety percent of all samples had a female-biased sex ratio. Season (wet vs. dry season) did not have a statistically significant influence on sex ratio or on stage or size distributions. The observed variation in guppy demography could be simply a result of differences in the prey size preferences of the predators. However, guppies from the two types of localities show considerable differences in life history traits, including age at maturity and fecundity. This variation in traits could be contributing to the differences in demography. Indeed, results from an individual-based computer model suggest that fecundity, offspring size, and individual growth rates were most influential in producing interlocality differences in size distributions and the proportions of the populations that were immature.

Likewise, larvae within mines injected with known quantities of spores and hyphae from three endophytic fungal species did not differ in survival or pupal mass from larvae in control mines. However, larvae in leaf mines injected with two of the endophytes developed more slowly than did larvae in control branches and thus may suffer more mortality from leaf abcission.

However, live roots may have very different effects than dead roots, the quality of the soil surrounding the roots may itself affect the influence of the roots, and the nature of the soil profile may modify all of these interactions. We have used experimental, field-based mesocosms to dissect the differing effects of live and dead roots in organic and mineral horizons of spodosolic forest soils. Mesocosms were constructed in a simple ecosystem dominated by pitch pine (Pinus rigida Mill.) and blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) in the New Jersey Pinelands. They contained 5 cm deep surface horizons of either organic matter or an inert substitute (vermiculite), placed above 10 cm of mineral material from the E horizon, with defined amounts of live or dead roots added. Sampling was conducted over a 2-yr period. In mineral soil, live roots stimulated ammonification rates but had little effect on extractable N, and the stimulation occurred only if an organic surface horizon was present. In contrast, live roots in organic material reduced both ammonification rates and extractable N. Dead roots increased extractable N in the mineral material, but not the organic material. The presence or absence of an organic horizon had a dominating effect on all aspects of nitrogen dynamics in the mineral soil; not only extractable inorganic N, but also transformation rates, were higher in soils under organic matter. The results showed that the effects of roots on soil nutrients depended on (1) the ratio of live to dead root biomass, (2) the quality of the soil material in which the roots occurred, and (3) the structure of the soil profile.

Experiments were replicated for Dipteryx panamensis, Gustavia superba, and Virola nobilis, all of which have large seeds. To assess seed removal, seeds were placed in wire exclosure cages and nearby outside the cages. There was no difference in removal rates between forest types, with almost all unprotected seeds removed at all sites.

It is also not known whether these variables and their relationships differ between evergreen and deciduous forests, or across soil types. To address these questions we compiled data on annual rates of in situ net N mineralization and ANPP for 16 conifer and 34 hardwood forests, including plantations and natural stands on a range of soils at six locations in Wisconsin and Minnesota, USA. For 31 natural stands, 48 stands with native species (including plantations), and all data, ANPP increased linearly with annual net N mineralization rates. Native evergreen conifer and two deciduous hardwood types (oaks and mesic hardwoods) followed similar patterns in this regression, indicating common functional relationships at the ecosystem level. The relationship of N mineralization and ANPP differed between finer textured Alfisol soils and sandier Entisols, with higher ANPP at any given N mineralization level in Alfisols. A multiple regression of N mineralization on soil texture (percentage silt plus clay), litterfall N, and mean annual temperature explained 81% of the variance in annual N mineralization for natural stands, and a multiple regression of ANPP on soil texture and annual N mineralization rate explained 83% of the variance in ANPP. Naturally regenerated forest types differed in mean annual net N mineralization, litterfall N, and ANPP, and all were greater in oaks than in mesic hardwoods or conifers, respectively. However, differences among the 50 stands and six locations were largely a result of differences in soils and stand origin. For all natural hardwood stands, ANPP and N mineralization were greater on fine-textured Alfisols than on sandy Entisols. For evergreen conifers, ANPP and N mineralization were greater in plantations on Alfisols than in natural stands on Histosols, Entisols, or Spodosols. Hardwood and evergreen conifer stands did not differ significantly in ANPP or N mineralization on comparable soils and stand origin: they differed neither as plantations on Alfisols nor as natural stands on Entisols. This suggests that observed average differences among natural forest types in ANPP and N mineralization resulted largely from variation in their distribution on differing soils, and not from feedback effects on N mineralization or differing productivity per available N. These data suggest that, at a regional scale, at least half of the variation in ANPP can be attributed to variation in annual N mineralization. Both ANPP and N mineralization differ more strongly with soil type/parent material than with forest type; ANPP at any given level of N mineralization is higher on silty/loamy Alfisols than on sandy Entisols, Histosols, or Spodosols, but not different for coniferous and broad-leaved deciduous species.

The magnitude of Daphnia's effect on microzooplankton taxa varied quantitatively and qualitatively between experiments. The rotifer Synchaeta pectinata and the ciliate, Didinium sp., showed extreme differences between experiments, exhibiting opposite responses in small vs. large enclosures. The relative rankings of responses for two rotifers (Polyarthra dolichoptera and Synchaeta pectinata) and two ciliates (Coleps sp. and Didinium sp.) were reversed in small vs. large enclosures. Polyarthra was depressed by Daphnia more than Synchaeta in small enclosures, while Synchaeta was depressed more than Polyarthra in the large enclosures. Didinium was depressed more than Coleps in the small enclosures, while the reverse occurred in large enclosures. Microzooplankton responses also changed over time in the large-enclosure experiment. Daphnia significantly suppressed total ciliate dry biomass, but not total rotifer biomass after 6 d, but suppressed dry biomass of both groups by the end of the 23-d experiment. This result may reflect changes in the relative importance of Daphnia's predatory and competitive effects over time. Daphnia's effects on the rotifers, Polyarthra and Hexarthra mira, took 3 wk to be expressed but were very strong by the end of the large-enclosure experiment, suggesting that short-term experiments may underestimate competitive effects.

Our main goal in this study was to provide estimates of true annual and lifetime reproductive success of male Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) to determine the importance of extra-pair mating to reproductive success. Males that were more successful at extra-pair mating, both annually and over their lifetimes, were also more successful on their own territories, so extra-pair success was not achieved at the expense of within-pair success. Relative to within-pair success, extra-pair success accounted for only one-fifth as much variance in total success (annual and lifetime). For some individuals, however, extra-pair success was a substantial part of their total success. Standardized variance in true annual success was 16% higher overall than the variance in apparent success, although the effect was inconsistent from year to year. Standardized variance in lifetime success increased 39% due to extra-pair paternity. Thus, extra-pair mating modestly increased the opportunity for sexual selection. Males with the highest annual success on their own territories mated with more females on their territories, had fewer of those females mating with other males, and lost fewer nests to predation. Annual extra-pair success was highly correlated with the number of extra-pair mates. The number of years a male bred and the number of females with which he mated contributed significantly to the variance in lifetime success, both within pairs and extra-pair. Reproductive success in the first breeding season was significantly positively correlated with lifetime success. Positive correlations between true and apparent reproductive success and between true mating success and harem size suggest that conventional (i.e., nongenetic) estimates of success provide reasonable estimates of population patterns, despite being unreliable for estimating individual success. Many of the ecological factors that affected lifetime success (e.g., territory acquisition, longevity) of males and females appeared similar between our Canadian population and a population in Washington state, USA.

Populations both sympatric and allopatric to the predator were tested, and meta-analysis was used to synthesize the results of all experiments, and to test for heterogeneity of effects of actual vs. perceived predation (predator unable to kill prey). In the presence of this predator, A. triseriatus from both sympatric and allopatric populations had lower mass at pupation, as predicted. This effect was present in both sexes, but was more pronounced in females. The presence of the predator also increased time to pupation for females (but not for males). Reduced size at pupation appears to result from decreased growth rate in the presence of the predator, and we tested the hypothesis that this predator induced behavioral changes in A. triseriatus that lead to reduced growth (e.g., reduced movement and foraging). Behavioral observations did not support the hypothesis of behavioral change.

We (1) quantified the exchange of birds between these habitats, and (2) evaluated whether there was phenotypic variation between dispersing and philopatric birds. Only 6% of immigrants in Wytham were born in the surrounding area, and only 5% of emigrant recruits from Wytham bred in the surrounding area. This indicates that most nonphilopatric birds dispersed >2 kin, considerably farther than expected. The effect of sex on dispersal depends on the scale on which it is studied: females dispersed longer distances than males, but the exchange of birds between woodlands was not sex biased. The proportion of immigrants among breeding birds was similar for both sexes, confirming the latter result.

This effect was not found in Wytham, suggesting that there is an interaction between phenotypic quality and habitat quality with respect to dispersal: birds of high phenotypic quality disperse when they are born in low-quality habitat. As a result, birds breeding in Wytham (high-quality) had greater mass as nestlings than birds breeding in the surrounding area (low-quality).

Ecologists have long been interested in physiological mechanisms that reduce the effects of stress and result in improved fitness. It has previously been suggested (1) that selection for stress resistance will bring about the evolution of lower standard metabolic rates and (2) that organisms with increased stress resistance will have a lower metabolic rate during stressful conditions, compared to stress-sensitive organisms. We have tested these hypotheses using replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Desiccation and starvation-selected populations and their controls, as well as populations selected for postponed senescence and their short-generation controls were examined. The metabolic rate of each selected and control population was measured under three different environmental conditions: (1) desiccation (no food or water), (2) starvation (water present, no food), and (3) food condition (food and water present). The carbohydrate and lipid content of each population were also measured. All selected and control populations lowered their metabolic rates when measured under starving conditions compared to food conditions. The metabolic rates of flies under desiccating conditions did not differ from food conditions regardless of selection treatment. When comparing the mass-specific metabolic rates of stress-selected populations to their controls, stress-selected populations had a significantly lower mass-specific metabolic rate in all cases, regardless of the environmental conditions under which the measurements were made. However, once the mass of nonmetabolizing lipid and carbohydrate was accounted for and metabolic rate was expressed in carbohydrate-lipid free mass, selected populations did not differ significantly in metabolic rate from control populations, regardless of the environmental condition under which the measurements were made. We conclude that in the case of D. melanogaster, resistance to stress does not require the evolution of a lower metabolic rate. Instead, the accumulation of metabolic resources such as carbohydrate and lipid may be important for resistance to specific forms of stress.",119,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,"Drosophila melanogaster | Metabolic rate | Stress resistance | Stress, physiological response to",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,135,NA,NA

We studied seasonal and yearly variation in endophyte infections in five Emory oak trees over a 4-yr period from 1989 to 1993. In the 1992-1993 growing season, we documented seasonal patterns of abundance of the three most common fungal endophyte species, an ascomycete, Ophiognomonia cryptica, and two coelomycete species, Plectophomella sp. and Asteromella sp. To determine the association of fungal endophytes with macroherbivores, we compared infection frequencies of endophytes in unmined leaves harboring living and dead larval leafminers of Cameraria sp. nov., the dominant macroherbivore on Emory oak, over the 4-yr period. In the 1992-1993 growing season, we monitored survival and mortality of leafmining larvae on the five study trees. We then determined the association of total infections and infections by individual endophyte species with seasonal survival and sources of mortality of leafminers. Infection levels of endophytes varied over the 4-yr period, but seasonal patterns within years were consistent. The three dominant species of endophytes varied differently in frequencies over the growing season. Leafminers were positively associated with endophytic infections in all years. In two of the four years, leaves with living leafmining larvae had greater total infection frequencies than unmined leaves. In one of these years, infection frequencies were greater in leaves with dead larvae than in those with living larvae, suggesting that endophytes may increase mortality of leafminers. However, when infection of individual species were compared among leaf types, only levels of Asteromella were greater in mined leaves relative to unmined ones. This difference was explained largely by higher infection levels in leaves with living larvae than in leaves with dead larvae. Furthermore, seasonal changes in endophyte levels varied independently from seasonal changes in leafminer mortality from unexplained causes or natural enemies. We conclude that leafmining activity is associated with higher endophyte infections, but increased infections are not associated with increased leafminer mortality. Higher infections on mined leaves are likely caused by leafmining damage that enhances fungal colonization and penetration into oak leaves. Although endophytes of Emory oak are diverse and abundant and their presence is associated with leafmining activity, we do not find strong correlative evidence that endophytes interact mutualistically with Emory oak by increasing resistance to a dominant herbivore, the leafminer Cameraria.

Here I propose and test two hypotheses: (1) that food-hoarding herbivores behaviorally overcome consumption limits imposed by secondary compounds by storing food until the toxins degrade; and (2) that the presence of secondary compounds in cached plant maternal facilitates the preservation of these items, as well as other cached items that lack such compounds. To evaluate these hypotheses, I conducted a number of field and laboratory experiments using the North American pika, Ochotona princeps, a generalist herbivore that consumes low-phenolic vegetation in the summer while it simultaneously collects and stores high-phenolic vegetation for subsequent consumption during winter. In experiments investigating decomposition of summer and winter diets of pikes, after 10 mo of storage, the winter diet retained 20.5% more biomass, and was higher in energy, lower in fiber, and equal in nitrogen compared to the summer diet. Moreover, a common food item in the winter diet, Acomastylis fossil, which contains high levels of phenolics, was the only plant extract tO deter bacterial growth in a bioassay. Acomastylis rossii leaves with experimentally reduced phenolic levels retained significantly less biomass than leaves with natural phenolic concentrations. However, the presence of A. fossil in artificial caches containing a low-phenolic species, Trifolium parryi, did not facilitate the preservation of T. parryi. Approximately halfway through the typical storage period, phenolic concentrations of pika winter diet samples in artificial caches decreased to levels readily consumed by pikes in their summer diet. Examination of natural haypiles of pikes before and after storage revealed that pikas do increase their intake of A. rossii from the haypile sometime during the winter. In experiments with captive pikes, pikas preferred A. rossii with experimentally reduced phenolic concentrations over those with natural concentrations. Observations of pikas foraging from natural and artificial haypiles suggested that pikas do not increase their intake of A. rossii from the haypile until phenolics levels decrease. Taken together, the results support both of the hypotheses. Pikes manipulate plant chemistry by storing plants rich in allelochemicals and by delaying consumption of these plants until the toxins decay. Moreover, plants with high levels of secondary compounds exhibit superior preservation qualities so that more biomass and nutrients are retained during storage. As food caching is a common strategy among several animal classes and many foods contain potentially deleterious compounds, the manipulation of food toxins by storage may be a prevalent phenomenon.",74,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Bacterial inhibition | Decomposition | Ochotona princeps | Phenolics | Pikas | Plant-herbivore interactions | Toxin manipulation,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,137,NA,NA

The Directed Toxicity Hypothesis states that these compounds are most toxic to frugivores that do not disperse seeds (e.g., fungi), whereas its alternative, the General Toxicity Hypothesis, states that they are generally toxic to all frugivores. The Removal Rate Hypothesis states that highly rewarding fruits, which are removed rapidly by dispersers, require only low levels of glycoalkaloids for protection against insects and microbes. The alternative Nutrient-Toxin Titration hypothesis states that highly rewarding fruits may be able to maintain higher levels of glycoalkaloids because high nutrient content may offset the negative effects of glycoalkaloids on dispersers. Our previous work with vertebrate frugivores supported the General Toxicity and Removal Rate hypotheses. We used artificial fruit pulp media to measure how the mycelial growth rate of nine fungal species was affected by two glycoalkaloids, α-solasonine and α-solamargine, both common in ripe Solanum fruits. In one set of fungal growth trials, we mimicked two species of fruit, S. americanum with low levels of glycoalkaloid in ripe fruit and S. carolinense with high levels, to determine the relative effects of nutrient and toxin content. In another set of trials, we examined the relative and interactive effects of the two glycoalkaloids. Finally, we tested whether or not increases in nutrient content could offset the negative effects of glycoalkaloids on fungal growth. All fungi tested were inhibited by the glycoalkaloids, with lower levels of antifungal activity for agars corresponding to (low-toxin) S. americanum fruits than to (high-toxin) S. carolinense fruits. Because fungi varied in their degree of inhibition by glycoalkaloids, we found only limited support for the Directed Toxicity Hypothesis. The degree of inhibition for fungi was, on average, similar in magnitude to the negative effects upon vertebrate feeding rates, providing further support for the General Toxicity Hypothesis. Additionally, we found no evidence for differences in antifungal effects between the two glycoalkaloids and no evidence of synergism between them. Nutrient effects were generally small, with little evidence that nutrient variation could compensate for the antifungal activity produced by levels of glycoalkaloids found in ripe S. carolinense fruits. Fruits that are presumably more profitable (S. americanum) are preferred by vertebrate frugivores and contain much lower levels of glycoalkaloid. These results support the Removal Rate Hypothesis.

Our goal was to determine the degree to which secondary metabolites might explain fruit-frugivore interactions that heretofore have not been explained by other fruit-related variables (e.g., color, nutrient content, seediness, etc.). Using feeding trails with real fruits and artificial fruit pulp media, we tested two sets of hypotheses, one relating to the specificity of secondary metabolites and the other to intra- and interspecific variation in secondary metabolite content. First, the Directed Toxicity Hypothesis was tested against its alternative, the General Toxicity Hypothesis. The Directed Toxicity Hypothesis posits that fruit pulp secondary metabolites are directed primarily toward organisms that destroy seeds following fruit consumption, remaining nontoxic to organisms that disperse seeds. The General Toxicity Hypothesis states that these secondary metabolites are general in their effects. Second, the Removal Rate Hypothesis was tested against its alternative, the Nutrient-Toxin Titration Hypothesis. The Removal Rate Hypothesis posits that profitable fruits, with high natural rates of removal, contain only low levels of secondary metabolites as defenses against seed predators and pathogens. In contrast, the Nutrient-Toxin Titration Hypothesis states that profitable fruits are better able to afford protection by high levels of secondary metabolites because high nutrient levels compensate for deterrent effects of secondary metabolites. We compared Solanum carolinense, with high levels of secondary metabolites (glycoalkaloids) in ripe fruit, and S. americanum, with negligible levels, conducting four sets of feeding trials: (1) Real Fruit trials to determine the preferences of our study animals for real fruit of each plant species; (2) Fruit Mimic trials using artificial fruit pulp media to determine the relative effects of nutrient and glycoalkaloid content on fruit preferences; (3) Interaction trials using artificial fruit pulp media to examine relative and interactive effects of the two main glycoalkaloids in our fruits (α-solasonine and α-solamargine); and (4) Nutrient-Toxin Titration trials using artificial fruit pulp media to determine how much nutrient content might compensate for deterrent effects. Both seed predators and seed dispersers preferred the low-glycoalkaloid S. americanum fruits and were deterred by glycoalkaloid levels typical of ripe S. carolinense fruits. Because of the generality of the deterrent effects, we rejected the Directed Toxicity Hypothesis. Additionally, we found no evidence for differences between the two glycoalkaloids in their deterrent effects, and no evidence of synergism between them. Nutrient effects were generally small; we found no evidence that nutrient variation could compensate for the deterrence produced by levels of glycoalkaloids found in ripe S. carolinense fruits. Ripe fruits of the presumably more profitable, preferred S. americanum contain much lower levels of glycoalkaloid. Taken together, our results support the Removal Rate Hypothesis. Secondary metabolites of ripe fleshy fruits are an important determinant of fruit use by frugivores. We suggest that a primary function of these metabolites is defense against pests and pathogens.

What we do know about seed resources in deserts is based primarily on seeds extracted from soil samples, but this might present a distorted view of resource availability if animals mostly harvest newly produced seeds before they enter the soil seed bank. In order to assess how large the distortion might be, we simultaneously monitored the seed bank and seed ran over a 19-mo period in the eastern Mojave Desert of California. The seed bank averaged ≃ 106 000 seeds/m2 and 38 g/m2, much higher than values reported for other North American desert sites. This corresponds roughly to the seed production of a single year, since daily seed rain averaged 262 seeds/m2 and 0.26 g/m2. However, input from the seed rain did not accumulate in the soil. Instead, the seed bank decreased by a daily average of 114 seeds/m2 and 0.007 g/m2 during our study. This suggests that virtually all seeds germinate, die, or are harvested by granivores soon after being dispersed. Large seeds comprised a greater fraction of the seed rain than of the seed bank, suggesting that such seeds are differentially depleted, probably by granivores, before they enter the soil. Because seed drop was seasonal, temporal variation comprised a significant component of among-sample variance in the seed rain. Temporal variance in the seed bank was much smaller, presumably because granivores harvested most of the seed rain. Conversely, spatial variance was a significant component for the seed bank, but not the seed rain, perhaps as a result of spatial patterns of seed harvest or seed caching by granivores. By virtue of these variance patterns, as well as other attributes, seeds in the soil present different challenges to granivores than do newly produced seed.

However, tree/shrub encroachment has also coincided with the eradication of a once widespread native herbivore, the black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus). We used field experiments and repeat aerial photography to demonstrate that prairie dogs, and the herbivores and granivores associated with their colonies, probably maintained grassland and savanna by preventing woody species such as Prosopis glandulosa (honey mesquite) from establishing or attaining dominance. Prosopis seed and pod disappearance was 3-99 times greater within prairie dog colonies. Ants were the primary agent of seed removal, whereas prairie dogs and associated vertebrates were the primary agents of pod removal. Survival of Prosopis Seedlings protected from vertebrate herbivory was similar on and off prairie dog colonies (≃60%), whereas survival of unprotected seedlings was 3 times greater off- than on-colony. On-colony, prairie dogs and associated herbivores girdled and destroyed all Prosopis saplings within 2 d of planting; survival of 1-yr-old seedlings was reduced by 50% after 3 mo of exposure to on-colony herbivores. Despite high levels of woody plant seed disappearance and seedling herbivory, on-colony 'seedling' reserves were substantial (950 plants/ha). Thus, prairie dogs and the fauna that occur on their colonies suppressed rather than eliminated Prosopis from the colony site. Removal of prairie dogs led to rapid development of Prosopis stands. Repeat aerial photography showed that Prosopis canopy cover on a colony eradicated in 1950 (27%) increased to a level (61%) comparable to that of off-colony Prosopis stands (65%) within 23 yr. These data illustrate how transitions from grassland to woodland vegetation can be mediated by a rodent herbivore. They further demonstrate how purposeful or inadvertent removal of native herbivores can have unforeseen effects on plant species composition and landscape physiognomy. Investigations of environmental constraints on vegetation distribution and abundance should take into account the historical role of herbivores in shaping the present system. Inconsistencies among historic accounts of woody plant distribution and abundance in semiarid western North America may be resolved by considering population dynamics of prairie dogs. Widespread eradication of this formerly abundant rodent has eliminated a significant constraint to woody plant establishment on many semiarid grassland and savanna landscapes and has thereby facilitated transitions to shrubland and woodland states.

MAT, MAP, and soil texture explained 67-81% of the variation in relative and absolute production of C3 and C4 grasses. Both measures of production of C3 grasses were negatively related to MAT and SAND, and positively related to CLAY. Relative production of C3 grasses decreased whereas absolute production of C3 grasses increased with MAP. Production of C4 grasses was positively related to MAT, MAP, and SAND, and negatively related to CLAY. MAP was the most explanatory variable in the model for C4 absolute production.

Tree-ring and growth-form patterns of cross-dated black spruce (Picea mariana) remains in peat were used to analyze stand responses in two contrasting topographical settings: a moderately protected valley-bottom peatland, and an exposed hilltop peatland. Dense, old-growth spruce populations occupied the studied peatlands between the 11th and 16th centuries, with stunted and erect spruce dominating the hilltop and the valley sites, respectively. Spruce continued to colonize the peatlands as long as the adjacent well-drained sites were occupied by forest trees able to attenuate the damaging effect of winter snow-drifting conditions. The surviving conifer stands exhibited similar growth responses following deforestation of the well-drained sites by wildfire in AD 1567-1568. These responses included dieback of supranival (above snow) stems and death of trees due to drowning in permafrost-induced ponds. The postfire degradation and disappearance of the conifer stands from the peatlands were the ultimate stage of a positive feedback process triggered by a modification of the snow regime at the landscape scale. Deforestation of the well-drained sites led to reduced snow accumulation and enhanced snow-drift exposure, thus inducing permafrost aggradation and drainage impediment in the nearby peatland sites. While the hilltop conifer stand responded immediately to forest exclusion in the nearby sites, ecosystem changes in the valley peatland were delayed until AD 1580-1590, at the beginning of the Little Ice Age.

We reconstructed blowdown history (patch sizes, dates of origin, return intervals) since the late 1700s to assess how periodic large-scale wind disturbance influenced landscape pattern in a relatively simple system. Most previous studies have focused on single storms in more diverse forests and in landscapes influenced by several disturbance types and human activities. Boundaries of post-blowdown stands were digitized from aerial photographs and analyzed within a geographic information system. Ages of blowdowns and return intervals were determined from scars, growth releases, and maximum tree ages. Discrete blowdown patches (0.1 to >100 ha) covered two-thirds of the study area and ranged from 19 to ≃200 yr of age, with 20-30 yr between major events. The meteorology of these storms was unknown, but we suspect they were caused by intense low-pressure systems originating in Antarctica. The mean return interval for 34 sites was 145 yr, with a range of 103-218 yr. Based on treefall size distributions, most stands blown over in the past 100 yr were even-aged, with mean tree dbh (diameter at breast height) between 20 and 32 cm. Aerial photographs taken in 1970 were used for before-and-after comparisons of a 1972 blowdown. Seventy-one percent of the area blown over in 1972 was even-aged, and 35% of the boundaries from this storm exactly coincided with previous stand boundaries. Damage patterns from storms in 1924 and 1972 suggested that forests located on valleys parallel to the wind, windward side slopes, and possibly upper leeward slopes were most vulnerable to blowdown, but few landscape positions escaped being hit by repeated storms. Return intervals were not significantly related to slope, elevation, or aspect; but surprisingly, shorter return intervals were associated with deeper soils. The landscape pattern of blowdown and recovery shifted over time because of variation among individual storms and because a small proportion of old-growth stands were converted to blowdowns and vice versa. Browsing by guanacos (Lama guanaco), a large native camelid, has severely inhibited tree regeneration during the past 75 yr in small blowdowns and the perimeters of larger ones, converting some stands to open meadows and incipient alpine communities.

The most frequently used estimate of resilience is based on the eigenvalues of the system at its equilibrium. In most cases, this estimate describes the rate of recovery only asymptotically, as time goes to infinity. However, in the short term, perturbations can grow significantly before they decay, and eigenvalues provide no information about this transient behavior. We present several new measures of transient response that complement resilience as a description of the response to perturbation. These indices measure the extent and duration of transient growth in models with asymptotically stable equilibria. They are the reactivity (the maximum possible growth rate immediately following the perturbation), the maximum amplification (the largest proportional deviation that can be produced by any perturbation), and the time at which this amplification occurs. We demonstrate the calculation of these indices using previously published linear compartment models (two models for phosphorus cycling through a lake ecosystem and one for the flow of elements through a tropical rain forest) and a standard nonlinear predator-prey model. Each of these models exhibits transient growth of perturbations, despite asymptotic stability.

The keystone predator hypothesis maintains that intense predation by one consumer species is necessary to prevent a prolific, competitively dominant prey species from eliminating other species using the same resource. This study considers the consequences of extreme spatial and temporal variation in the recruitment of a prey species supporting keystone and diffuse predation. Prior experiments on rocky shores of Santa Catalina Island, California, USA, demonstrated that predation by spiny lobsters (Panulirus interruptus) maintained a distinctive red algal turf by killing juvenile mussels (Mytilus californianus and M. galloprovincialis) that otherwise overgrow and replace the algae. In the present study, long-term surveys revealed that high recruitment of the predominant mussel, M. californianus, occurred only on the most wave-exposed sites in certain years; mussel recruitment was slight to nil on relatively protected sites in most years. A predator exposure experiment consisting of seven replicates placed along the gradient of wave exposure demonstrated that the effects of predation depended upon the spatial differences in recruitment rates. Lobsters on wave-exposed sites functioned as keystone predators; on more sheltered sites, little or no predation, whether by lobsters or the fishes and whelks also foraging on the sheltered sites, was necessary to maintain the algal assemblage. Similar species assemblages can be maintained by markedly different relative levels of crucial ecological rates. In the mid-intertidal zone of Santa Catalina Island, the intense species interactions depicted in the keystone predator hypothesis occurred only at productive, high wave exposure locations; low recruitment of mussels elsewhere preempts both predation and the competition between the mussel and algal assemblages. Thus, red algae dominates rocky shores through different mechanisms over a range of physical conditions. The occurrences of low mussel recruitment do not appear to be anomalies, but rather a consequence of the life history of Mytilus californianus.",67,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Algal turfs | California | Diffuse predation | Growth | Keystone predation | Mytilus | Panulirus | Productivity | Recruitment | Spiny lobsters,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,150,NA,NA

Recruitment to marine populations should then result from larval production external to each population (i.e., an open population). However, it has been suggested that self-recruitment to these populations may also be important (i.e., a closed system). The contribution of these two sources of larval supply to recruitment were explored using the Hawaiian domino damselfish, Dascyllus albisella. Spawning and recruitment were monitored daily and weekly in the southeast section of Kaneohe Bay, Oahu, Hawaii, during 1992. Daily increment formation in the otoliths of this species was validated, and the spawning dates of arriving recruits were back-calculated using otolith rings. Since this section of Kaneohe Bay is sheltered, with a water exchange rate of only 26% per day, I predicted larvae would be retained (passively and behaviorally) after hatching; therefore recruitment from locally spawned larvae would be important. Contrary to my prediction, no self-recruitment was evident. Spawning times and back-calculated production of recruits did not overlap on a daily or seasonal basis. During the first half of the year, recruitment pulses were large and associated with rises in water temperature. During the latter half of the year, recruitment rates were lower and recruitment events were not associated with water temperature. Given the apparent absence of self-recruitment and the seasonal pattern of oceanographic currents in the Hawaiian Islands, recruitment episodes in the first half of the year may have originated from distinct reproductive episodes at upcurrent islands.

A PCA identified three distinct flock types based on species composition: 'Sooty Tern Flocks' (n = 941 flocks) with a large number of Sooty Terns (Sterna fuscata), 'Juan-Wedge Flocks' (n = 402 flocks) with a large number of Juan Fernandez Petrels (Pterodroma externa) and Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (Puffinus pacificus), and 'Booby Flocks' (n = 407 flocks) with a large number of Red-footed and Masked Boobies (Sula sula and S. dactylatra, respectively). Flock types exhibited largely disjunct distributions that mirrored patterns in thermocline depth and surface water chlorophyll content. Sooty Tern Flocks occurred in areas with deepest thermocline (77.6 m) and lowest chlorophyll (0.14 mg/m3), Juan-Wedge Flocks in areas of intermediate thermocline (68.8 m) and chlorophyll (0.16 mg/m3), and Booby Flocks in areas of shallowest thermocline (62.5 m) and highest chlorophyll (0.17 mg/m3). These differences were statistically significant. As thermocline depth and surface water chlorophyll are reliable indicators of surface water productivity, we conclude that Sooty Tern Flocks foraged in waters of low productivity, Juan-Wedge Flocks in waters of intermediate productivity, and Booby Flocks in waters of highest productivity. Differences in published cost-of-flight values support the hypothesis that energetic constraint determines flock structure at the low-productivity end of the system. Sooty Terns have the lowest flight costs (4.8 w) and feed in waters of lowest productivity. Flight costs are progressively higher for those species feeding in more productive waters (9.9 W for Wedge-tailed Shearwaters, 19.0 W for Red-footed Boobies). Differences in body size support the hypothesis that interference competition determines flock structure at the high-productivity end of the system. The largest species, Masked Boobies (1987 g) and Red-footed Boobies (1003 g), feed in areas of highest productivity; progressively smaller species, Juan Fernandez Petrels (430 g) and Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (388 g), and Sooty Terns (180 g), feed in areas of decreasing productivity. We hypothesize that this community is largely structured by two factors, competition and energetic constraint, that operate at opposite ends of a productivity gradient. As productivity decreases (low prey abundance), flight proficiency is increasingly important because only species with relatively low flight costs will be able to transit between prey patches. As productivity increases (high prey abundance), competitive ability is increasingly important because competitive dominants will exclude other species from feeding flocks.

However, although these relationships have been well documented, there have been no manipulative field experiments demonstrating that wave forces are directly responsible for limiting plant sizes. In this study, I examined the effects of wave forces on plant sizes in the field by reciprocally transplanting Fucus gardneri (rockweed) individuals between wave-exposed and wave-protected intertidal sites at Fogarty Creek Point, Oregon. Mean sizes of wave-exposed plants transplanted to protected sites increased significantly relative to exposed control transplants. Mean sizes of wave-protected plants transplanted to exposed sites decreased significantly relative to protected control transplants. These data support but modify an accompanying mathematical model that predicts size-dependent survivorship of Fucus under conditions of high and low wave exposure.

We tested this hypothesis using the cabbage butterfly Pieris rapae and its larval parasitoid Cotesia glomerata. We conducted a series of field and laboratory experiments to determine how variation in the larval development of P. rapae within and among four species of host plants (Brassica oleracea, Tropaeolum majus, Lunaria annua, and Cleome spinosa) influenced parasitism rates by C. glomerata. On the same host plant species, fast-developing larvae incurred less parasitism than slow-developing larvae of the same age, because once larvae reached the third instar they became much less vulnerable to attack due to the onset of encapsulation. Thus, the 'window of vulnerability' was extended for slow-developing larvae. Similarly, the window of vulnerability was prolonged and larvae were susceptible to parasitism for a longer period of time on host plant species on which development was delayed. Also, simply exposing larvae for a longer period of time to parasitoids resulted in increased rates of parasitism. Consequently, the window of vulnerability sets the temporal limits within which parasitoids may act. These findings are all consistent with the slow-growth-high-mortality hypothesis. Slow growth, however, did not always translate into increased parasitism. We found no evidence for a positive relationship between host development time and parasitism when the relationship was examined across host plant species. In fact, the parasitism rate was highest on B. oleracea, the plant species on which P. rapae developed most rapidly. The adverse effects of some host plant species on the host-location behavior of parasitoids apparently offset the potential for increased risk of parasitism due to delayed larval development. In contrast, within the same host plant species, there was good correspondence between slow growth in P. rapae and high mortality inflicted by C. glomerata. We argue that the relative effects of plant variation on adult parasitoid behavior are probably much less among conspecific plants than across plant species, thus allowing the potential effects of extended development on increased parasitism to be realized. By experimentally manipulating larval development time using temperature and diet treatments (host plant effects removed), slow growth also resulted in increased parasitism. In a survey of published studies in which the association between slow growth and high enemy-inflicted mortality could be assessed, support for the hypothesis was found for free-living insects feeding on the same or closely related host plant species. The hypothesis was not supported for herbivores that fed on different species of host plants, or for herbivores whose vulnerable stage was concealed in plant tissue. The extent to which the slow-growth-high-mortality hypothesis finds support depends on the interactive effects of plant variation on herbivore development as it indirectly increases the risk of enemy attack and on the direct effects of plant features on enemy access to herbivores.",431,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Cotesia glomerata | Encapsulation | Parasitism | Pieris rapae | Risk of parasitism | Slow-growth-high-mortality hypothesis,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,155,NA,NA

We examined the effects of tree seed and seedling predation by small mammals on the rate, spatial pattern, and species composition of tree invasion in old fields. We performed field experiments inside U-shaped enclosures built at forest-field edges, within which we manipulated the density of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus), which are major seedling predators. Although we did not directly manipulate density of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), which are major seed predators, mouse density was high wherever vole density was low. We introduced cohorts of seeds and seedlings of red maple (Acer rubrum) or sugar maple (Acer saccharum) [as specified in the methods for each trial], white ash (Fraxinus americana), white pine (Pinus strobus), and tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima), all common early invaders of old fields in our study area. Rates of seedling predation were higher in enclosures with higher density of voles, and voles showed distinct preferences for red maple, white ash, and Ailanthus over white pine. Predation rates on small seedlings were higher than on larger seedlings. Seedlings near the forest edge were killed at a lower rate than those >5 m into the field. Predation rates on seeds were higher in low-vole-density treatments, where mice were more abundant. Mice showed distinct preferences for white pine, avoided Ailanthus, and consumed sugar maple and white ash at intermediate rates. Predation rates on seeds were higher in shrub-dominated than in herbaceous old fields. Overall density of mice increased dramatically between 1994 and 1995, and seed predation rates increased concomitantly. In 1994, seed predation was most intense 5 m and 10 m into the field, and less intense at the forest-field edge and 20 m into the field; although a similar pattern was observed in 1995, the variation was not statistically significant. We conclude that both of these common small mammal species can have profound effects on survival of tree propagules near forest-field edges, but that their effects are strongly dependent on density. Voles had a strong, negative direct effect on seedling survival, but a positive indirect effect on seed survival by inhibiting seed predation by mice.

Spectrophotometrical analysis of their calcium balance during the molt cycle reveals that, whereas all animals are equally calcified during the intermolt, the decalcification during the premolt and the recalcification during the postmolt are more rapid in animals from limestone areas than in those from crystalline sites. Translocation experiments in both natural and artificially calcium-enriched waters confirm these differences. A significant increase in the duration of the molt cycle was observed in animals translocated to water of lower calcium concentration and vice versa, whereas no significant difference was observed between controls and animals translocated into water of comparable calcium concentration. Current results, supported by such a new synthetic experimental approach, indicate that variations in water calcium levels may generate important ecophysiological differentiation between populations, which may suggest a possible influence of environmental calcium on the geographic distribution of Gammarus fossarum.",12,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Adaptive diversity | Amphipods | Calcium metabolism | Experimental ecology | Gammarus fossarum | Molt cycle,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,157,NA,NA

Above- and belowground fungal fruiting bodies (epigeous and hypogeous sporocarps) were sampled for 46 mo in managed-young, natural-mature, and old-growth western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) stands in Washington State. Screen exclosures were placed over the surface of half of the sample plots to prevent aboveground predation of sporocarps. Standing crop of epigeous sporocarps was low in most seasons and then increased 30-fold to a mean of 2.28 kg/ha in the fall. Epigeous biomass varied little between stand types, and animal consumption of these sporocarps was low. Standing crop of hypogeous sporocarps was 0.78 kg/ha in managed-young stands, compared to 4.51 and 4.02 kg/ha in natural-mature and old-growth stands. In all stands, standing crop peaked in the summer and was lowest in the winter. Mean animal consumption of hypogeous sporocarps was 0.64 kg/ha, a value that exceeded the available standing crop quantity of 0.36 kg/ha in managed-young stands during the winter. In natural-mature and old-growth stands, truffle biomass remained high year-round and exceeded consumption in all seasons. Low hypogeous sporocarp biomass in the managed-young stands resulted from the general absence of large clusters of Elaphomyces granulatus, which made up >90% of the biomass in older stands. This absence in managed-young stands may be associated with the thin organic layer that has developed following harvest and burning 60 yr ago. The consistent level of animal consumption indicates that truffles may be an important and readily available year-round food source, compared to the ephemeral fruiting of epigeous sporocarps.

In an effort to distinguish these two types of effects, during the summer of 1994 I compared abundances, patterns of microhabitat use, and diets of P. maniculatus on four areas of shrub-dominated prairie in north-central Colorado to these characteristics on four similar sites where O. leucogaster was removed. The abundance of P. maniculatus decreased during the study on both control and removal sites, but the decline was greater on controls, where numbers of O. leucogaster increased. Declines in the abundance of P. maniculatus on individual study plots were correlated with abundances and recolonization rates of O. leucogaster. Only 6% of P. maniculatus present on controls during pre-removal trapping were captured 7 wk later, compared to 32% of those initially present on removal sites. Furthermore, changes in the number of P. maniculatus were inversely related to the amount of shrub cover on sites, suggesting that shrubs may have provided refuge from O. leucogaster, which rarely uses these microhabitats. Analyses of microhabitat use support this assertion; individual P. maniculatus increased their use of shrubs on control sites when O. leucogaster was abundant, but there were no shifts in microhabitat use on removal sites. The proportions of arthropods in the diets of the two species were similar prior to Onychomys removals, and although P. maniculatus consumed fewer arthropods as the experiment progressed, diets did not differ between control and removal sites. In addition, Ord's kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ordii) increased slightly in number following removals, and western harvest mice (Reithrodontomys megalotis) colonized two removal sites. These results suggest that predatory or aggressive interference by O. leucogaster, rather than exploitative competition, was responsible for the observed changes in abundance and microhabitat use.

Standard matrix analysis allowed us to project forest structure (i.e., the proportion of patches of each type) at equilibrium, and to explore the effect of different disturbance rates on canopy dynamics. Simulations showed that higher disturbance rates result in a lower proportion of the forest under closed-canopy conditions, and that variation in disturbance rate has a dramatic effect on turnover rate.

Most previous studies rely on ad hoc calculations or are flawed with unwarranted assumptions about survival. We use a recently developed approach, based on capture-mark-recapture, in which analysis of local recruitment is similar to a time-reversed analysis of survival. The basic data set consists of capture histories viewed in reverse order, with initial capture at year of birth, and subsequent observations corresponding to years when the animal has bred. The model considers two essential components, the probability for any breeding individual to reproduce for the first time (β, the probability of first reproduction) and the probability of recapture (p), both conditional on survival. Contrary to previous attempts at modeling recruitment, the present approach does not assume an age at which breeding propensity stabilizes to a maximum value. The flexibility achieved allows the comparison of recruitment among groups within a population and also allows one to consider the effects of environmental variables, as well as interactions between such effects. Practically, the procedure starts from a global model, based upon the a priori knowledge of the biology of the species, and assesses its fit. Then more parsimonious models are selected using Akaike's Information Criterion and likelihood ratio tests. Finally, maximum likelihood estimates of model parameters are obtained with estimates of precision. We used a modified version of program RELEASE for goodness-of-fit tests, and program SURGE for iterative model fitting and the computation of likelihood ratio tests. We illustrate the method with the study of local recruitment of Greater Flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber roseus) in the Camargue (southern France) between 1984 and 1994.

Recruitment was noticeably higher in the year following an increase in mortality rate due to a particularly severe winter. Long-lasting effects of this increased mortality on recruitment were observed in the three following years: There was no evidence for an effect of sex or cohort (year of birth) on recruitment.

We found that the joint pattern of selection acting on tolerance and two resistance traits, trichome density and total glucosinolate concentration, indicated that there were not alternate peaks in the fitness landscape favoring either resistance or tolerance. Rather, selection favored the retention of both tolerance and resistance. One reason for the absence of mutually exclusive alternative resistance/tolerance strategies is the absence of a negative genetic correlation between resistance and tolerance.

A shortage of mutualists could potentially limit the rate of population growth for an invading species. The introduced shrub Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom, Leguminosae) is a pest plant on the west coast of North America. It produces flowers that are 'tripped' open when pollinated and has a nearly obligatory relationship with resident bumble bees and honey bees. Experiments in the state of Washington showed that < 1% of untripped flowers produced fruits and that outcross-pollinated flowers yielded fourfold more fruit than self-pollinated flowers, revealing apparent inbreeding depression. Mean pollinator, visitation rate, as determined by the proportion of flowers tripped, varied among three years and among four populations but was low (3-30%) in every case. Two urban populations (Magnuson Park and Discovery Park in Seattle) received higher numbers of visits than two native prairie populations (Johnson Prairie and 13th Division Prairie in southwestern Washington). Hand-pollination experiments revealed significant pollinator limitation in all populations in both 1993 and 1994, with the mean increase in fruit production ranging from 280 to 2620%. Prairie populations were more pollinator limited than urban populations. Resources available for per-flower fruit production appeared to be equally available in all populations in 1993 but more available in prairie populations than in urban populations in 1994.

Birds were censused on all islands and at mainland control sites by spot mapping in 1993, and via point counts in 1995. Instead of orderly 'nested sets' of species on landmasses of graded size, the species composition of small (≃ 1 ha) and medium (11-12 ha) islands was highly variable. Spot mapping substantiated the occurrence of 58 species of forest-nesting birds, collectively, on the 11 small and medium islands, which supported means of only 9 and 12 resident species, respectively. No species was found on all islands, and only five species were found on as many as 7 of the 11 small and medium islands. The mean number of islands per resident species was 3.0 for the 11 islands. Transients of many species were detected on all islands, but were more frequent on near (≤0.5 km from a larger landmass) than on far islands (≤1.0 km from a larger landmass). A large majority of the populations on the 1-ha islands consisted of a single pair, implying that few such populations could have survived since isolation without new colonizations to replenish individuals lost to dispersal and mortality. Notwithstanding low species numbers, both census methods indicated that avian densities were approximately twice as high on the 1-ha islands as on the mainland. In contrast, two of three medium-sized islands supported anomalously low densities of approximately one-fifth the mainland level. Both islands retain relict populations of capuchin monkeys (Cebus olivaceus). One hundred percent of artificial nests set out on one of these islands were raided, whereas no more than 30% of nests were lost on any of the other islands or on the mainland. For small and medium islands, we conclude that the founding communities present when the waters of Lago Guri reached their final level have already collapsed and been reconstituted. Species loss on some islands may have been accelerated by relict populations of predators, such as capuchins. Changes in composition thus appear to have been driven by a combination of biological (nest predation) and stochastic processes (high turnover).",88,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Bird communities | Colonization | Ecological release | Extinction | Faunal relaxation | Island biogeography | Lago Guri | Land-bridge islands | Venezuela,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,168,NA,NA

Using family-specific DNA fingerprints, the reproductive success of male smallmouth bass in Lake Opeongo, Ontario was estimated and evaluated at the point when their offspring were fall young-of-the-year (YOY). For the 1992 spring spawning season, we generated family-specific fingerprints using DNA of fry captured from 116 nests in Jones Bay. In the fall of the same year, 283 YOY were captured by electrofishing along the shoreline of the study area. Using DNA obtained from fin tissue, a fingerprint was generated for each fall YOY and compared to the family fingerprints to determine the family of origin. Males were considered successful if at least one of their offspring survived to the fall YOY stage. Although 27.7% of all males who acquired eggs (N = 57) had at least one offspring surviving to the fall YOY stage, only 5.4% of all spawning males (N = 11) produced 54.7% of the total number of fall YOY captured. If recruitment frequently depends on the success of such a small number of males, then population abundance will be extremely vulnerable to adverse natural and anthropogenic impacts. Because natural resource managers cannot differentiate these few successful males a priori, they cannot differentially protect them from potentially adverse human activities, such as opening the fishing season on a preset date that may fall before the end of brood-guarding in a given year. The evaluation of variables that might influence differences in male reproductive success included male length and age, spawning date, number of eggs and fry within a nest, nest depth, and dominant substrate type both within and surrounding the nest. Logistic regression analysis indicated that none of these variables were significant predictors of male reproductive success (P > 0.05). Additionally, linear regression analysis suggested the lack of a relationship between the number of fall YOY produced per male and these variables. However, a goodness-of-fit test to the Poisson distribution indicated that the number of YOY produced per male does not occur at random (P < 0.001), suggesting that reproductive success was influenced by factors not measured in this study.",34,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,"DNA fingerprinting | Family size | Genetic marks | Lake Opeongo, Ontario | Micropterus dolomieu | Reproductive success | Smallmouth bass | Young-of-the-year",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,169,NA,NA

These induced responses are defensive if they reduce future tissue loss or disperse future damage and, as a result, increase fitness relative to conspecifics with a weaker induced response. We assessed three predicted effects of early-season damage in white oak (Quercus alba L.): (1) early-season damage elicits both systemic and localized responses in leaf quality; (2) mid- and late-season herbivores respond to changes in leaf quality both among and within trees; and (3) plants with high early-season damage suffer less subsequent tissue loss than plants with low early-season damage. In a field experiment, we manipulated levels of early-season damage in white oak saplings and monitored subsequent changes in leaf quality, herbivore distributions, and plant damage levels at two spatial scales: (1) between experimental and control trees differing in overall level of early-season damage, and (2) between damaged and undamaged leaves within individual trees. One-third of the plants had herbivores removed at 2-3 d intervals throughout the early-season, one-third had damage from natural densities of herbivores plus additional damage from hole-punching, and one-third were attacked by natural densities of herbivores and served as controls. Early-season treatments influenced leaf quality both among and within trees. We observed differences in protein-binding capacity (PBC) among treatments, indicating a systemic response to early-season damage for this trait. The treatment with the most early-season damage (control) had higher average protein-binding capacity than the treatment with the lowest level of early-season damage (herbivore-removal treatment). Within trees, damaged leaves (>10% leaf area missing) had higher protein-binding capacity and lower nitrogen content than intact leaves (≤ 10% leaf area missing), suggesting localized induction to herbivory for these traits. Despite differences in protein-binding capacity among treatments, herbivore densities did not differ among treatments at any time following the early season. In addition, species composition of herbivores did not differ among treatments. However, within individual trees, herbivore densities were higher on intact leaves than on damaged leaves. This finding is consistent with patterns of leaf quality: intact leaves were higher quality (i.e., more nitrogen and lower PBC) and had higher herbivore densities than damaged leaves. Because herbivores appeared to avoid previously damaged leaves, induction may have led to dispersed damage in this study. Finally, saplings that suffered the highest level of early-season damage (controls) had less subsequent damage than saplings with the lowest amount of early-season damage (herbivore-removal). This result supports the hypothesis that leaf quality changes following insect herbivory reduce subsequent damage to individual plants.",106,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Caterpillars | Dispersed damage | Induced response | Induction | Insect herbivores | Lepidoptera | Oak-hickory forest | Phytochemistry | Plant defense | Plant resistance | Plant-herbivore interactions | Quercus alba,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,170,NA,NA

In North American Rocky Mountain populations of Silene acaulis, a host to M. violaceum, reproduction in infected individuals is severely affected, but disease spread is slow (<1% new infections over a 4-yr period). This study addresses whether diseased plants can affect reproduction in healthy individuals even if the healthy plant does not become diseased. I studied Silene acaulis in the field to examine traits of diseased and healthy plants, pollen deposition, spore deposition, and seed production in healthy plants. Diseased plants were significantly larger than healthy plants, and in contrast to other studies of anther smut with different hosts, infected individuals did not produce more flowers than healthy individuals. Timing of flowering was similar for healthy and diseased plants, but peak deposition of pollen and fungal spores differed at some sites. Therefore, plants could potentially maximize their fitness by flowering at times of peak deposition of pollen while avoiding exposure to peak deposition of fungal spores. Finally, healthy flowers receiving additions of pollen and moderate to high loads of fungal spores produced significantly less seed compared to flowers receiving only pollen. Although the risk of becoming diseased may be low in this population, healthy individuals can be affected by anther smut because the majority of flowers receive fungal spores, which may be interfering with pollen grains and reducing seed production.",27,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Fungal spore deposition | Gynodioecy | Microbotryum violaceum | Pollen deposition | Pollinator-transmitted disease | Silene acaulis | Ustilago violacea,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,172,NA,NA

Although there is clear evidence supporting the existence of trophic cascades, the mechanisms driving this important dynamic are less clear. Trophic cascades could arise through direct population-level effects, in which predators prey on herbivores, thereby decreasing the abundance of herbivores that impact plant trophic levels. Trophic cascades could also arise through indirect behavioral-level effects, in which herbivore prey shift their foraging behavior in response to predation risk. Such behavioral shifts can result in reduced feeding time and increased starvation risk, again lowering the impact of herbivores on plants. We evaluated the relative importance of these two mechanisms, using field experiments in an old-field system composed of herbaceous plants, grasshopper herbivores, and spider predators. We created two treatments, Risk spiders that had their chelicerae glued, and Predation spiders that remained unmanipulated. We then systematically evaluated the impacts of these predator manipulations at behavioral, population, and food web scales in experimental mesocosms. At the behavioral level, grasshoppers did not distinguish between Risk spiders and Predation spiders. Grasshoppers exhibited significant shifts in feeding-time budget in the presence of spiders vs. when alone. At the grasshopper population level, Risk spider and Predation spider treatments caused the same level of grasshopper mortality, which was significantly higher than mortality in a control without spiders, indicating that the predation effects were compensatory to risk effects. At the food web level, Risk spider and Predation spider treatments decreased the impact grasshoppers had on grass biomass, supporting the existence of a trophic cascade. Moreover, Risk spider and Predation spider treatments produced statistically similar effects, again indicating that predation effects on trophic dynamics were compensatory to risk effects.

Maximizing the expected cumulative harvest before extinction puts the optimal threshold at carrying capacity, regardless of the form of expected dynamics or the magnitude of stochasticity. Maximizing the mean annual yield lowers the optimal threshold, which then depends on the form of expected dynamics and the magnitude of stochasticity. Uncertainty in estimated population sizes increases the threshold, and with large uncertainty, the optimal strategy is proportional threshold harvesting, involving harvest of only a fraction of the excess in estimated population above the threshold. The theoretical justification for the common strategy of a constant harvest rate is extremely weak in comparison to that for optimal threshold strategies.

Correlations of control variables such as climatic factors and response variables such as vegetation and soil carbon storage across broad regions have played a crucial role in predicting the response of ecosystems to global climate change. Despite the importance of these large-scale space-for-time substitutions, there are substantial limitations. One of these limitations is that many of the possible control factors covary with one another, and only some of the important control factors actually exist in large-scale databases. Thus, the true proximal controls may be difficult to identify. A second limitation is that models of spatial variability may not be appropriately applied to temporal variability. In this paper, we utilize a new approach to determine the extent to which N availability may constrain aboveground primary productivity in the Central Grassland region of the U.S. The strong relationship between average annual primary production and average annual precipitation found in spatial patterns in ecosystems globally has often been interpreted as evidence of a fundamental water limitation. However, temporal variation in annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) indicates that other factors constrain production. We generated a spatial and temporal database for annual aboveground net primary production and annual net N mineralization by linking a database of input variables (precipitation, temperature, and soils) with predictive models. We generated independent data sets of aboveground net primary production and net N mineralization by using regression models to predict aboveground net primary production, and the Century model to simulate net N mineralization. Our analyses indicate that net primary production and net N mineralization both increase with mean annual precipitation; thus, it is not possible to separate the extent to which ANPP is controlled by water or N availability. Nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) increased with increasing precipitation across the region. Aboveground net primary production decreased with increasing temperature across the region, while N mineralization increased slightly, leading to decreasing (NUE) with increasing temperature. At high precipitation levels, aboveground net primary production increased and N mineralization decreased slightly with increasing soil fineness. Nitrogen use efficiency generally increased with increasing pools of soil organic matter, likely because in grasslands, the proportion of recalcitrant organic matter increases with the total organic matter pools. A comparison of interannual variation in net N mineralization with average spatial variation indicated a high degree of inertia in the response of N availability to precipitation levels. Our simulation results as well as field results of Lauenroth and Sala (1992) raise important questions about the applicability of space-for-time substitutions when dealing with ecosystem function.

We show that variability can decrease herbivore performance if herbivore performance is a concave function of the level of resistance. In particular, if herbivores can choose among different plants and plant tissues, then variability created by induced resistance may benefit plants under attack and hence may be favored by selection.

In two experiments, female sail fin mollies (Poecilia latipinna), raised on high and low levels of food, produced neonates of similar mass and percentage of fat by varying egg size and the amount of supplemental nourishment provided to embryos as they developed. In one experiment, females displayed plasticity in ovum size, but not neonate size; females raised in a low-food and low-salinity treatment produced larger eggs than those raised on higher food levels and at higher salinity. In a second experiment, the amount of nourishment provided to embryos, in addition to that in the egg yolk, was dependent on brood size and maternal food level. Females with small broods were less matrotrophic than those with large broods; female body size and brood size were highly correlated. The brood size at which egg mass equaled neonate mass was smaller for females raised on low levels of food than for females raised on a higher food level treatment. In the second experiment, females from two populations, different from the source of fish for the first experiment, were studied and found to differ in the amount of fat stores remaining after reproduction. Females from a population with low postparturition fat stores displayed greater brood reduction during gestation (via resorption or abortion) and fewer offspring per unit mass than females from the population with more fat. In sailfin mollies, matrotrophy appears to be an adaptation that diminishes the offspring size-offspring number trade-off by permitting a reduction in ovum size and increase in fecundity without compromising neonate size. However, matrotrophic supplementation of yolk nourishment was greatest in relatively large females raised on a restricted food level.

In these cases, a count of the number of plants observed in a particular year may greatly underestimate the true population size, just as a count of animals in traps does not adequately estimate the total number of animals in an area.

The influence of combining life forms on productivity and resource use was evaluated using three fast-growing tree species (Hyeronima alchorneoides, Cedrela odorata, and Cordia alliodora); each species was grown alone and with two perennial, large-stature, self-supporting monocots (Euterpe oleracea and Heliconia imbricata). Aboveground net primary productivity was extremely high in all stands. The monocots did not contribute significantly to the productivity of the Hyeronima polycultures, which was 4.5-8.4 g · m-2 · d-1 between 18 and 36 mo.

The leaf area and density of fine roots in the Cedrela and Cordia polycultures were also significantly increased by the presence of the monocots, reaching or surpassing the levels found in the Hyeronima stands. The high productivity of Hyeronima, coupled with poor growth of its interplanted monocots, indicated that Hyeronima was able to achieve nearly complete use of resources. Ecosystem productivity and resource capture were increased when the monocots were grown with the other two tree species, and this occurred because of the inability of the tree species to completely utilize available resources, which provided an opportunity for the monocots to flourish in the understory. Monocot productivity in the Cedrela stands was additive to that of the trees, indicating complementary resource use between the monocots and this tree species. In the case of Cordia, tree productivity was slowed by the monocots, but this decline was more than compensated for by the high productivity of the associated monocots. Whether in natural forests or human-constructed agroforestry systems, the presence of dominant species that do not fully exploit all available resources allows the coexistence of other species and creates the potential for complementary resource use.

Annual production (as dry mass) was among the highest estimates reported for caddisflies, ranging from 43.5 to 63.9 g/m2 of snag surface (or from 14.2 to 25.5 g/m2 of channel bottom) in two consecutive years.

Somewhat lower amounts of their production (40.7 and 23.5%) were due to ingestion of amorphous detritus. Production of the microfiltering species Chimarra moselyi was primarily due to eating amorphous detritus (91%). Removal of amorphous detritus from the system by the major taxa was highest in summer, and diatom removal was highest in fall, whereas animals were eaten consistently throughout the year. A quantitative food web showed that while the linkages among nine taxa were complex, the ingestion pathways were dominated by amorphous detritus (total consumption = 62.5 g.m-2·yr-1) and animal prey (22.3 g·m-2·yr-1), with >99% of food resources being consumed by the three dominant filter-feeding taxa.

We demonstrate that large bullfrog competitors and caged Anax affect traits (foraging activity level) of small bullfrog and small green frog tadpoles and that these changes in traits, in turn, affect interactions of the small tadpole species with each other and with the other species. In particular, the following four trait-mediated indirect interactions were evident: (1) Presence of large bullfrog competitors increased the predation rate of Tramea on small green frogs and small bullfrogs. (2) Presence of nonlethal Anax reduced the predation rate of Tramea on small green frogs. (3) Presence of nonlethal Anax increased the competitive advantage of bullfrogs over green frogs. (4) Presence of nonlethal Anax facilitated midge invasion of the experimental units. The proposed mechanisms (changes in small tadpole activity) involved in these trait-mediated indirect interactions were supported by observational data on tadpole activity and resource levels in the experimental units, and in laboratory experiments examining tadpole activity responses to predators.

Protandry is higher in lines selected for slow development than in lines selected for fast development or in unselected control lines. Protandry is therefore capable of evolving. Contrary to predictions based on sexual selection, southern populations with multiple, overlapping generations are just as protandrous as northern bi- and univoltine populations with discrete generations. Voltinism and developmental synchrony of the population do not appear to have been major selective factors in the evolution of protandry in W. smithii.

Selection should minimize development time in males but maximize growth rate in females. In W. smithii, females achieve higher growth rate than males but also harbor greater genetic variation for development time, indicating that selection has, indeed, minimized development time to a greater extent in males than in females.

Water pythons (Liasis fuscus) on the Adelaide River floodplain in tropical Australia prey almost exclusively on dusky rats (Rattus colletti). Rat numbers varied dramatically among years of the study. Feeding rates of pythons were highest when rats were abundant, and the snakes were in good condition (mass relative to body length) at these times. The proportion of adult female pythons that reproduced in a given year was also tightly linked to rat abundances. However, reproductive output per litter (offspring size, and fecundity relative to maternal body size) was unaffected by prey availability, perhaps because of high fecundity-independent costs of reproduction. Instead, female phytons reproducing in 'good' years where in better condition after oviposition. These data support an energy-limitation model for snake reproduction, whereby prey availability determines predator reproductive output, but the relationship between the two variables is complex. The degree to which prey availability influences feeding rates of phytons and the degree to which feeding rates influence body condition depend crucially on snake body size (due to size-related shifts in foraging abilities and metabolic costs). Thus, a given prey abundance translates into different energy reserves for different-sized predators. Also, females delay reproduction until they can gain enough energy for a large clutch of eggs, and reproductive output per litter does not then increase with additional energy availability.

Larvae feeding on chokecherry were more likely to continue development and produce a second generation than larvae feeding on red maple or black ash. Paper birch was intermediate in diapause induction. Laboratory experiments with excised foliage supported the results of the field experiments and demonstrated that the induction of diapause depended on host species under constant conditions of photoperiod and temperature. A further study with low- and high-quality artificial diet demonstrated that the nutritional quality of larval diet has a direct effect on diapause induction: low-quality diet favored diapause induction. Dispersal of neonate larvae from host foliage did not necessarily reflect host quality and the potential for bivoltinism.

To illustrate this, we build on work by J. H. Brown, D. W. Mehlman, and G. C. Stevens, who demonstrated spatial patterns in bird abundances that can be explained by fixed spatial variation in the environment. Using a pair of simple stochastic models of bird population dynamics, we show that similar patterns can be generated through temporal environmental variation that has no fixed spatial component. This occurs when population dynamics are characterized by very weak density dependence, so that population densities exhibit near-random-walk behavior.

A high frequency of diagnostic tree rings (light rings and narrow rings) allowed the cross-dating of 142 individuals and the construction of a master chronology spanning AD 690-1591. Three floating chronologies covering 964 (≃178 BC-AD 785), 349 (≃587-239 BC) and 210 (≃1274-1065 BC) years were also developed. The buried stems were classified as arborescent (75%), small fragments of unknown origin (13%), stumps (11%), and portions of stunted stems (1%). The high frequency of arborescent individuals indicates that the buried spruces were the remains of a former forest. The forest bordered the peatland between 600 BC and AD 1568, and successfully regenerated after two fires around 350 BC and 10 BC. Winter-damaged trees dominated during periods of suppressed growth at AD 760-860 and AD 1025-1400, whereas undamaged trees were more frequent during periods of rapid growth around AD 700-750, 860-1000, 1400-1450, and 1500-1570. Fast growth between AD 860-1000, along with the concurrent establishment of symmetrical trees, suggests well-defined boundaries for the Medieval Warm Period in northeastern Canada. The forest abruptly shifted to an open krummholz (stunted spruce) after the last fire in AD 1568, indicating that a climatic threshold inhibiting postfire regeneration was crossed between the second and the last fires. The maintenance of this old growth forest over 1500 yr, in the absence of external disturbances except climate change, was probably due to the buffering effect of aggregated trees on wind-drifted conditions at the snowpack line. With the exclusion of the forest influence on microclimate and local growth conditions, the AD 1568 fire caused the forest vegetation to shift to krummholz. The amplitude of these ecosystem changes at tree line does not mirror that of climate change.

Connected fragments were linked by 100 m wide riparian buffer strips. Each size class within treatments and controls was replicated three times. We sampled the passerine community using point counts before, and in each of two years after, forest harvesting, accumulating 21 340 records representing 59 species. We detected no significant change in species richness as a result of the harvesting, except in the 1-ha connected fragments, where the number of species increased two years after isolation. This increase was accounted for by transient species, suggesting that the adjacent buffer strips were being used as movement corridors. Diversity (log series alpha index) was dependent on area in the isolated fragments only after cutting, having decreased in the smaller areas. Turnover rates in the isolated fragments were significantly higher than in similar connected or control areas, due to species replacement. Crowding occurred in the isolated fragments immediately after cutting, but two years after fragmentation, the responses in abundance of species varied with migratory strategy. Numbers of Neotropical migrants declined in both connected and isolated fragments, and resident species declined in isolated fragments. Most species in these groups require older forest, many favoring interior areas. Abundance of short-distance migrants, most of which are habitat generalists, did not change. Overall, although there was no decrease in species richness from our recently fragmented areas, community structure was altered; maintaining connections between fragments helped to mitigate these effects. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the fragmentation effects we documented is small compared with those observed elsewhere. Birds breeding in the boreal forest, where frequent small- and large-scale natural disturbances have occurred historically, may be more resilient to human-induced habitat changes, such as those caused by forest harvesting. However, these results should be interpreted with caution. First, they are short-term and address only broad-scale community responses based on species richness and relative abundance.

In 1992, winter precipitation was 5.4 times the historical mean, and winter precipitation over the entire El Nino was the highest two-year amount ever recorded. Increased precipitation led to an explosion of annual plant growth on the previously barren (0-4% cover) islands: plant cover increased 10-160 times over what it had been. With the resumption of arid conditions in 1994, live plant cover returned to the low levels seen before the onset of El Nino. Insect abundance tracked this pulse in plant productivity and approximately doubled in 1992 and 1993 compared to 1991 levels. In 1994, the crash of annual plants caused insect densities to drop to the lowest levels recorded during the 5-yr study. El Nino also affected the composition of the insect assemblage. In the dry years 1990-1991, the assemblage was dominated by insects feeding on products originating in the ocean: detritivores/scavengers on shore drift of marine algae and carcasses, avian parasites, and detritivores of bird products. Herbivores were extremely rare. The heavy plant growth in 1992 stimulated large (40-190 times pre-El Nino levels) increases in herbivores. The great increases in land plant biomass and insect abundance are indicative of an important change in the dynamics of this system. Previously, most material flowing through the food webs of these islands originated directly or indirectly in the ocean. In contrast, during this El Nino, most material originated via productivity by terrestrial plants. Thus, wet El Ninos represent an agent that switches the system from one dependent primarily on allochthonous input to a system driven to a greater extent by in situ productivity. The influence of this pulse of terrestrial productivity extends beyond the El Nino years: the persistence and slow release of plant and detrital biomass reserves may also greatly affect dynamics for years after the El Nino event has passed.

From an evolutionary perspective, we discuss how pollen and ovule provisioning may be negatively genetically correlated and how this would maintain genetic variation for pollen performance within populations.

This rarity could be due to high cost of pollination, phylogenetic constraints, alternative life history shifts to reduce or avoid risk of seed nondevelopment, or ecological factors such as co-pollinators that can satiate pollen requirements and mask variation in pollinator effectiveness among ovipositing seed eaters. Ecological costs of being a pollinator were measured for a yucca moth species and were found to be low: active time allocated to pollen pickup and deposit was on average 4.1%, an average of 0.42% of female body mass was allocated to specific structures for pollen manipulation, and the average pollen load weighed <4% of moth body mass. These estimates suggest that ecological costs need not be a major obstacle to evolution of active pollination. In contrast, recent combined ecological-phylogenetic analyses for the yucca moth family suggest that the evolution of active pollination and transition to mutualism depended largely on preadaptations, and that few traits were truly novel. If general, active pollination would be predicted to be likely to evolve only in lineages with life histories that facilitate mutualism. Alternative outcomes to evolution of active pollination include delayed oviposition, detection of floral pollination status, egg placement that allows the larva to select a fruit, and modified egg dispersion strategies to balance the cost of pollination. The historical significance of these factors can be assessed only when mechanisms are documented in many lineages and analyzed in a phylogenetic framework. Active fungal inoculation among arthropods is ecologically analogous to active pollination, and offers a complement for comparative analyses.

I assessed the potential role of larval competition in contributing to this displacement in a series of field manipulations of tadpole density and species composition. The impact of R. catesbeiana on native tadpoles in the natural community agreed with the outcome of more artificial experiments testing pairwise and three-way interactions. In 2-m2 enclosures with ambient densities of tadpoles and natural river biota, bullfrog tadpoles caused a 48% reduction in survivorship of R. boylii, and a 24% decline in mass at metamorphosis.

Responses to bullfrogs in field settings were similar qualitatively to results seen in smaller-scale experiments designed to study size-structured competition among disparate age/size classes of species pairs and trios.

Thus, incubation temperatures of this species are influenced both by nest site selection and by maternal care. We experimentally simulated three thermal regimes typical of different types of natural nests in our study population. These were (1) hot, stable temperatures typical of nests laid in the burrows of varanid lizards (constant 32°C); (2) lower and more variable temperatures typical of nests laid inside tree root boles, either with maternal attendance (diel range 27.1°32.9°C); or (3) in root boles but without maternal attendance (24.3°-32.9°C).

This procedure generated detailed hypotheses about the evolution of anti-herbivore defense and pollination systems. These hypotheses were tested using the results of chemical analyses and bioassays of foliar and floral secretions. Multiple lines of defense appear to have evolved in sequence in Dalechampia. The first defense system to originate was deployment of triterpene resins to defend the staminate flowers. This feature was a preaptation (preadaptation) that allowed the evolution of a resin-based, pollinator-reward system. Thus pollination by resin-collecting bees originated as a 'transfer exaptation' (a new function replaced the old). This hypothesis is supported by anti-herbivore activities of floral resins and by chemical similarity of floral defense and reward resins. After the resin defense of flowers was lost by conversion into a reward system, there followed (in evolutionary time) a sequence of defensive innovations. These included nocturnal closure of large, involucral bracts to protect both staminate and pistillate flowers. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the large bracts themselves probably originated as a floral advertisement system, and the bracts assumed a defensive function through 'addition exaptation' (a new function was added to the old). Additional lines of defense to evolve were deployment of resin to defend the developing ovaries and seeds (an addition exaptation), deployment of sharp, detaching trichomes on enveloping sepals to defend developing seeds (apparent adaptations), closure of involucral bracts around the developing fruits and seeds (an addition exaptation), and deployment of resin to defend the leaves and growing shoot tips (also an addition exaptation). Support for this scenario also derives from the chemical similarities of sepal, foliar, and floral resins, and the anti-herbivore properties of foliar resins. It appears that at least one pollinator-reward system originated by modification of a defense system, and several defense systems originated by modification of pollinator reward and advertisement systems. Thus exaptations have been important in the origin of new defense and pollination systems, and each system has significantly influenced the evolution of the other on several occasions.",150,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Dalechampia | Euphorbiaceae | Evolution | Exaptation | Herbivory | Phylogeny | Plant defenses | Plant-anim al interactions | Pollination | Preadaptation | Preaptation,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,222,NA,NA

Spot moved to shallow water in the presence of flounder and aggregated more tightly in the presence of birds. The observed nonadditive effects could have been due to interference between flounder and birds.

Although it is conceivable that this reflects biases in reporting or frequency of application, we suggest that there is a puzzle here worthy of scrutiny, and we outline several potential underlying causes. In order of discussion (not necessarily of importance), these are: (1) lack of genetic variation; (2) genetic constraints on selection; (3) weak selection; (4) temporally varying selection; and (5) coevolutionary dynamics. We, in particular, focus on the potential for weak selection on the host for increased resistance, despite effective control. The very spatial mechanisms (e.g., refuges, metapopulation dynamics) believed to facilitate the persistence of many natural enemy-victim systems with strong biological control may also incidentally provide an environment where selection is weak on target pests to evolve improved resistance to control agents, thereby biasing coevolution toward the enemy. The basic insight is that in a spatially heterogeneous environment, a strong limiting factor on a population can be a weak selective factor.

In addition, our study was conducted in the year following record rainfall, allowing us to assess the potential for high precipitation amounts to affect subsequent N cycling and plant production. Both fire treatment and topography affected soil N availability. In general, N mineralization was greater on unburned than on burned sites and was up to five times greater on uplands than lowlands. Total extractable soil N was highest early in the season and least at midseason, and it also tended to be higher in unburned sites than burned sites on unfertilized plots. Added N increased ANPP, but there were no differences between plots fertilized in 1994 and those fertilized in 1993. In general, patterns of ANPP on control plots were consistent with known production responses to topography and burning (higher in annually burned sites and in lowland sites) but were inversely related or unrelated to patterns of N availability (higher in unburned sites and at upland topographic positions). Potential loss of N by volatilization during spring burning was greater than in years with normal rainfall amounts and represented a significant portion of aboveground plant N mass.

The root zone of A. arenaria contains pathogens that contribute to the degeneration of their host when dunes become stabilized. These pathogens (plant parasitic nematodes and pathogenic fungi) are relatively harmless to the immediate successor F. rubra. We tested the hypothesis that F. rubra, when grown in a mixed culture with A. arenaria, will be favored when A. arenaria is exposed to soil-borne pathogens from its own root zone. In a greenhouse, seedlings of both species were grown in replacement series in sterilized (pathogen-free) and unsterilized (pathogen-containing) soils originating from the root zone of natural A. arenaria. Nutrient additions, soil moisture, and the length of the experiment were based on two pilot studies. When exposed to its soil-borne pathogens, A. arenaria was outcompeted, especially when it constituted <50% of the planted mixture. Nutrient limitation enhanced the replacement of A. arenaria by F. rubra especially in unsterilized soil. This was due to reduced plasticity of A. arenaria in responding to nutrient limitation when exposed to its pathogens.

We tested the hypothesis that the N:P ratios in fish excretion (supply ratios) are high but potentially variable because of fishes' high P requirement and the likelihood of P limitation of fish growth. A survey of 186 cases representing 18 fish species demonstrated that limitation of fish growth due to availability of P in food was exceedingly rare in natural ecosystems. Fish growth rates were energy limited in almost all systems. Fish grew at an average of 26% of the maximum potential rate determined from bioenergetics. As a result, the predicted N:P supply ratio from fish excretion was low and relatively constant (the median mass ratio for piscivores was 6.1, and 13.1 for all other fishes). Excretion rates for N and P by fishes were predictable from body size, food nutrient concentration, and environmental temperature. Nutrient recycling by fishes will tend to alleviate P limitation of phytoplankton growth, but the importance of this effect will be directly proportional to the magnitude of nutrient regeneration rates from fishes relative to other sources available to phytoplankton.",173,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Bioenergetics | Fishes | Limnology | Nitrogen | Nutrient cycling | Phosphorus | Stoichiometry | Supply ratio,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,228,NA,NA

We studied landscape-scale effects of gradients in forest cover type, litter chemistry, rates of litter input (including fine woody litter), temperature, and moisture on forest-floor pools and input-output fluxes of C and N. We coupled a new model of decomposition processes to a Geographic Information System (GIS) and applied it in 10-ha cells in the White Mountain National Forest. We sought to synthesize current understanding of forest-floor leachate qualities and quantities in humid forests with measured changes in carbon fractions ('lignin,' 'cellulose,' and 'extractives') in decomposing litter. We included N dynamics as transfers of N among C fractions, including the production of dissolved organic N in leachate from the forest floor. We calibrated fluxes of dissolved organic C and N (DOC and DON) to measurements from two stands at the Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA. We calibrated rates of humus decay to two sites at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. By including leaching as a mechanism of mass loss from the forest floor, we were able to calculate CO2 mineralization fluxes by difference. Predicted masses of forest floor were higher and peaked over a broader elevational range in spruce-fir forest than in hardwoods, due primarily to a slower decay rate of humus in coniferous forests. DOC and DON fluxes were higher in coniferous forests, while CO2 fluxes were higher in hardwood forests. Predicted residence times for C in the forest floor were longer, and organic N concentrations were higher, in spruce-fir forests than in hardwood forests. Along a generalized elevational ecotone from hardwood to spruce-fir forests in the region, predicted mass and N in the forest floor increased and DOC and DON fluxes increased, while CO2 fluxes decreased.",135,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,"Biogeochemistry | Carbon stocks | CO  fluxes 2 | Decomposition | Dissolved organic carbon | Dissolved organic nitrogen | Geographic Information System (GIS) | Humic substances | Landscape | Leaching | Litter quality | Nutrient cycling | White Mountains, New Hampshire",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,229,NA,NA
