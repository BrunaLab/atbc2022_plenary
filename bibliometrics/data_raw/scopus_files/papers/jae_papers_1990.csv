Because of this, the models are stable even without spatial heterogeneity. To obtain spatial density dependence without temporal density dependence, the authors derive a model differing from De John's (1979) only in making the fraction dying in a patch a function of the relative density, ie (density in patch)/(average patch density for that generation), rather than the absolute density. Thus, mortality on a patch with the average density is the same in each generation. This model shows that spatial heterogeneity and density dependence can induce temporal density dependence and greater stability. When there is no heterogeneity, mortality is constant and the model becomes the null model of geometric growth or decline (or stasis, if fertility and mortality are exactly matched). When heterogeneity is added, the model yields a region of values of fertility and mortality (on a patch of average density) giving stability.

Woodlands in natural areas of savanna Africa have declined over the past 30 yr. Three general hypotheses have been proposed: 1) expanding human populations have concentrated elephants Loxodonta africana into protected areas, elephants then caused the decline of woodlands but man-induced fires prevented regeneration (2 stable states); 2) fires caused the decline and also prevented recovery (one stable state); 3) fires caused the decline while elephants inhibited recovery through density-dependent mortality of seedlings (2 stable states). Two time periods, the 1960s when woodlands changed fastest and the 1980s when grasslands prevailed, produced 4 specific hypotheses. 1) ""The 1960s elephant hypothesis' and 2) ""the 1960s fire hypothesis' hold that elephants and fire, respectively, caused woodland change. 3) The ""1980s elephant hypothesis' and ""the 1980s fire hypothesis' hold that these factors, respectively, prevented woodland recovery. Mortality due to combinations of burning rates, elephant browsing, wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus trampling, and antelope browsing was estimated and used to model tree population dynamics; predictions for rates of decline and increase were compared with independent estimates from aerial photographs. Maximum rates of elephant and antelope browsing could not have caused the observed decline of woodlands in the 1960s. The most conservative burning rates in the 1960s, without elephants, could have caused a decline consistent with the 1960s fire hypothesis. The combined impact of fire and browsing most closely matched the observed rate of woodland loss. Wildebeest grazing in the 1980s reduced dry grass and minimized fire incidence. The model predicted that fire mortality and wildebeest grazing could not maintain the present grassland state. The present high elephant density was sufficient to prevent an increase in the woodlands consistent with the 1980s elephant hypothesis. Wildebeest trampling and other browsers ensures that the vegetation is currently stable in a grassland state. Thus, an external perturbation, such as fire, was necessary to change the vegetation from woodland to grassland. Once the grassland was formed, elephants could hold it in that state. Results are consistent with the 3rd general hypothesis that there are 2 stable states of woodland and grassland, the latter maintained by herbivores. Simulation of conditions in the 1890s suggests that the rinderpest epidemic combined with elephant hunting could have caused the woodland regeneration observed before the 1950s. Therefore, savannah woodlands may regenerate in pulses as even-aged stands, and there may have been more grassland in Africa before 1890. -from Authors",455,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,7,NA,NA

Rainfall over the late wet season exerted the strongest influence. A negative relation was evident between survival and preceding biomass density of kudus.

Survival rates were significantly correlated with resource supply relative to population demand, as indexed by the rainfall/biomass ratio, except in the case of prime females. The higher kudu density in one area counterbalanced the higher mean rainfall there. Juvenile survival post-conception functioned as the key factor causing population fluctuations as well as being density-dependent. Prime females 2-5 yr old conferred a degree of population resilience to drought due to their insensitivity to resource limitations. Rainfall is presumed to act through its effects on the food supply, in particular of high quality components such as forbs, but the effects of wet season rainfall on juvenile survival appeared to be partially density-independent. Predation was probably responsible for a background mortality level of 5-10% per annum even among prime-aged animals.

Density-dependent mechanisms responsible for population regulation occurred during, but not after, this period. Survivor density was strongly density-dependent on egg density during, but not after tc. Number of juveniles decreased markedly during tc to reach a fairly constant value for territorial fish and a negligible value for non-territorial fish by the end of tc. Selection intensity for territorial fish was highest during tc and was density-dependent on egg density. Territorial possession was linked to size-dependent selection for the holders. Territorial trout formed groups of 1-6 fish with a social hierarchy within each group. Number of groups and mean number of fish per group both decreased during tc to fairly constant values after tc. Territorial fish distribution between groups became more even as density-dependent selection intensity increased. The maximum area defended by each territorial fish was simply a function of fish size. Attack rates in defence of a territory were a function of territorial size at the start of tc and after tc, when trout without territories were absent, the relationship being well-described by the same power function for all year-classes. Attack rates greatly increased during tc, the increase being directly related to the number of trout without territories. Territorial possession and the size of territorial fish provided the link between density-dependent survival, selection intensity and size-dependent mortality. Territorial size and defence were chiefly related to fish size but as egg density increased, the number of trout without territories increased and time spent in territorial defence during tc increased. Increasing defence costs were probably responsible for elimination of larger juveniles at high egg densities, and for increasing selection intensity for an optimum size of trout during the critical period. -from Author",163,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,22,NA,NA

Average number of queens in colonies varied with colony size (worker number). When the variation due to sampling different sized colonies was removed statistically, both species had significant annual differences. In the case of M. rubra this could be explained by climatic variations and the best model was a quadratic function of late-summer temperatures. M. rubra colonies appeared to be at their smallest, with fewest queens, when the temperature averaged 16°C; this coincided with the long-term average late-summer temperature in Dorset. Data for M. limanica showed that the number of queens can vary between different months in the same year.

Each site had the same pattern of annual variation, a result which can be explained by the general influence of climate on these proximate sites.

In Alderfen Broad, Norfolk, competition between young-of-the-year and breeding individuals acts to reduce growth and fecundity in years following good recruitment. In Slapton Ley, Devon, good growth allows the fish to breed at a younger age (at the end of their 2nd year of life), so that a year of good recruitment if followed 2yr later by another, when the previous prolific year-class comes to breed. This paper constructed simulation models of the 2 populations. Known features of the populations, including age at 1st reproduction, inter-age-class competition, fecundity and survival rates, were incorporated into the models, together with reasonable values for parameters that could not be measured. Simulation models for Alderfen Broad confirmed that density-dependent loss of fecundity, operating with a time delay, could produce stable limit cycles with the observed period and amplitude. With slightly different, but still reasonable, parameter values, a perturbation to a stable population yielded a 2yr oscillation that damped out after 10-15yr. This could also be the explanation for the fish dynamics in Alderfen. Models for Slapton Ley revealed that a discrete perturbation was necessary to produce a damped oscillation, with the observed period and lasting for 6-20yr, in such an age-structured population in which breeding individuals are effectively from a single age-class. This perturbation was cause by an epidemic of the cestode parasite Ligula intestinalis. Cycles are absent from both models when annual survival rate is >50%. Survival rates in Alderfen Broad (19.0%) and Slapton Ley (22.3%) are both unusually low, probably as a result of eutrophication. Cycles do not occur in most roach populations, probably because survival rates are typically much higher. -from Authors",40,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,40,NA,NA

Nesting success was exceedingly low and variable due to intense storms late in the nesting season; the annual average of 0.34 fledglings per breeding pair was attained by about age 9 yr. Survivorship of skuas aged 2-10 yr averaged 0.89, and of older birds 0.96. The lower rate amoung younger birds may be an artefact of lower visibility. High survivorship may be due to low breeding stress. Life expectancy appeared to be shorter for individuals that began breeding at youngest ages. The population of Cape Crozier is the largest known, and was stable; a Leslie model gave a growth rate of 0.98%, which was probably compensated by immigration.

The activity (forager traffic) of M. scabrinodis and M. ruginodis was related to temperature, time of day, and the activity and presence of other ant species. In the absence of competitors, Myrmica tended to be active independently of the time of day, but preferred slightly lower temperatures. On baits, Myrmica were more often present at night, especially at high temperatures. Most potential competitors were day-active and preferred higher temperatures. The territorial Formica truncorum and F. exsecta reduced the presence of Myrmica on the baits, but not their traffic to the square. Myrmica shifted their foraging at the baits to lower temperatures and used the baits mainly at night. Of the 2 aggressive but non-territorial species, the large Camponotus ligniperda did not affect the foraging of Myrmica, but circumstantial evidence indicated exclusion by the similarly sized Lasius niger. The submissive F. fusca had no effect on Myrmica. Earlier studies implied that, in spite of interference and reduced foraging success on the baits, Myrmica are able to coexist with most of the aggressive ant species. Coexistence may be facilitated by: phylogenetically based differences in morphology and size; small colonies and foraging areas of Myrmicinae in contrast to most of the aggressive Formicinae; inclination to forage at low temperatures at night; and a tendency to forage in the litter and nest underground. -from Authors",72,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,62,NA,NA

The regulation model predicts food allocation assuming that the parent eats the amount of food necessary to compensate its expenditure and gives the excess to the chicks. The LRS model uses assumptions derived from maximization of lifetime reproductive success. The main assumptions are that: 1) current brood productivity is a positive, negatively accelerated function of rate of food provisioning to the nest, and 2) residual reproductive value of the parent is a positive, negatively accelerated function of rate of parental intake. Instantaneous control of food allocation is assumed to maximize the sum of current brood productivity plus residual reproductive value of the parent. The role of biparental food provisioning is discussed. Food allocation, measured in field experiments using artificial feeding stations, was sensitive to both harvest rate and brood size, as predicted by the LRS but not by the regulation model. The LRS model has acknowledged shortcomings: it uses rates of intake and provisioning without reference to consequent changes in state of brood and parent, it does not incorporate the finite time horizon imposed by the time of independence of the young and stochasticity is not considered. These shortcomings can be overcome using stochastic dynamic modelling techniques. -from Authors",58,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,65,NA,NA

Similar data were obtained from the equilibrium density population at Amchitka Island in 1971 and 1986. Rate of increase for the 4 northern populations was 17-20% year-1. Density- or size-dependent changes in rate of increase could not be demonstrated for any of these populations. The California population has undergone 3 apparent growth phases: the early 1900s to the mid-1970s when it increased about 5% yr-1; mid-1970s to mid-1980s when it declined c5% yr-1; and the mid-1980s to 1988 when it increased c7% yr-1. An exponential growth model accounted for 92-98% of the variation in counts through time in all cases. Population increase at Attu Island was achieved largely by range expansion as opposed to increased density. Range expansion in lineal and areal habitat occurred at 11% and 13% yr-1, respectively. Despite similarities in island size and physical environment, the most conservative estimates of population density at Amchitka Island were >3 × greater than maximum density estimates for Attu Island. Surveys of Amchitka Island from the mid-1930s through the mid-1980s indicate that the population increased to a peak in the 1940s; declined abruptly thereafter; and subsequently increased to a new and higher equilibrium in the 1960s, where it has since remained. Population data, together with information on sea otter foraging and benthic community structure at Attu and Amchitka, suggest that multiple population equilibria exist in this system, emanating from complex trophic interactions low in the food web. The lower population equilibrium may be achieved largely or exclusively on an invertebrate diet consisting principally of herbivorous sea urchins. When unregulated by sea otter predation, the rocky benthos is deforested by sea urchin grazing. As growing otter populations compete increasingly for food, grazing intensity declines and the system shifts to one dominated by kelp beds, in turn leading to increased production, a shift in habitat structure, and population increases of kelp bed fishes. Apparently this new food resource elevates the sea otter population to a higher and more stable equilibrium. -from Author",113,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,68,NA,NA

Breeding success on the 1st attempt with a new partner was greater in later pair-bonds. Breeding success on the 1st attempt with a new partner was greater in later pair-bonds. Thus, increasing total breeding experience and increasing familiarity with a particular partner are both related to increasing reproductive performance.

This differential persisted throughout the 1st 2 pair-bonds, but not thereafter.
