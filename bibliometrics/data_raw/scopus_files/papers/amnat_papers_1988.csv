Both joint and solitary nesting coexist within the same California population, even though females that nest jointly destroy each other's eggs and have significantly lower annual reproductive success than females that nest singly. A number of ecological and social factors influence the relative advantages and disadvantages of joint nesting. The fitness of females that nest jointly appears to be comparable to (or only slightly lower than) that of females that breed singly. Factors reducing short-term reproductive costs of joint nesting include the absence of strong reproductive bias between jointly nesting females, the limited availability of independent-breeding opportunities, and the increased probability of such females' acquiring and maintaining tenure in a breeding territory. Higher annual survival probabilities of jointly nesting females may play an important role as well, although this potential benefit of joint nesting is not statistically significant. -from Authors",27,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Data on the range expansion of California sea otter is analysed within the context of a classical mathematical model incorporating growth, diffusion and advection. Classical theory predicts that population fronts will form, that asymptotic rates of advance will be constant with homogeneous habitat, and that these asymptotic rates are given by twice the square root of the product of 2 factors, the intrinsic rate of increase and the diffusion coefficient. These patterns were observed in the historical data for range expansion of the otter. The central remaining problem is explaining the observed differences in the rate of spread between the northern and southern fronts. Analysis suggests that advection plays, at most, a minor role in those differences and that estimated differences in the diffusion coefficients are sufficient to account for observed patterns. Habitat-dependent differences in mortality seem to present the major competing hypothesis, and both factors may contribute to the observed differences. -from Authors",118,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA,NA

This suggests that workers should try to prevent other workers from reproducing, and hence producing sons, in species with queens that mate ≤2 times. It also provides a possible reason for the absence of reproductive workers in many hymenopteran societies. Reproductive harmony may therefore result from lowered relatedness among workers. The necessary behaviors and discriminatory ability to favor queen-produced over worker-produced males are referred to as ""worker policing'. Population-genetics simulations of the fate of a ""police allele', which confers any marginal increase in policing behavior to the workers carrying it, indicate that such an allele will invade and spread to fixation provided that queens mate two or more times. This conclusion is supported empirically by what is known about queen mating frequency and worker reproduction in the highly eusocial bees and wasps.

If Hamilton's condition is met, the ESS is usually a mixed strategy of altruism and selfishness, with a decreasing (yet positive) probability of helping as the number of potential helpers increases. -from Authors",19,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,23,NA,NA

Local-stability analysis is used to explore the behavior of the model in an equilibrium setting, in the absence of environmental variability. Spatial subdivision and migration have no effect (or a detrimental one) on the stability of a collection of host-parasitoid subpopulations; they therefore have no effect on persistence in an equilibrium setting. Persistence is also unlikely in the absence of density-dependent coupling between the host and parasitoid. When these features are combined, however, even an unstable host-parasitoid system can be highly peristent. Migration can strongly buffer host and parasitoid densities, but if migration rates themselves are high or too strongly density-dependent, persistence may not occur; environmental variability, model stability, and migration rate have qualitative effects on host density and variability; and the temporal patterns of parasitism are also affected by migration and environmental variability. -from Author",133,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,24,NA,NA

Mass-flowering dipterocarp species in Shorea section Mutica significantly reduce the overlap in flowering times by staggering their flowering periods, thereby reducing competition for pollinators and/or the clogging of stigmas with foreign pollen. Time of floral induction in Shorea section Mutica is derived using the linear relationship between the duration of each species' flowering period and mean flowering date. Induction is caused by a drop of c2°C or more in minimum nighttime temperature for ≥3 nights. This extraordinary trigger is probably the most reliable signal associated with an invasion of the aseasonal tropics by a dry air mass. Such a trigger does not appear to be directly adaptive in the aseasonal tropics, but in the seasonal tropics it would result in flowering at the onset of dry season and ripening fruits at the beginning of rainy season. This suggests that the Dipterocarpaceae may be have arisen initially in the seasonal tropics, even though their center of species diversity is now in the aseasonal tropics. Invasion of the aseasonal tropics by having such a floral trigger, adapted to the seasonal tropics, could help explain the origin of a phenological core of species flowering and fruiting more or less synchronously at intervals of several years.

Recruitment thus occurs primarily within open spaces created by the deaths of large trees. Variable time lags may occur before the colonization of open spaces, however, because of temporal variation in seed production and occurrence of summer ground fires. Recruitment within the mapped plot has occurred frequently for at least the past 250 yr. Temporal variation in adult mortality and recruitment into open spaces, coupled with strong negative interactions between cohorts of different ages, appears likely to produce alternating phases of population growth and decline that are highly variable in length and magnitude. An upper bound to population size occurs when all available space is filled with trees; but no lower bound exists, and extinction probabilities may be increased at very low densities.

Large-bodies species tend to have long lifetimes but low rates of increase, which have opposite effects on the risk of extinction per year. In comparisons of a large- and small-bodied species at the same average population size (N), the large-bodied species should be at less risk at low N but at greater risk at high N. These predictions were tested using a data base of short-term survivals of 355 populations belonging to 100 species of British land birds on 16 islands. Mean N and risk of extinction are known for these populations, and CVs for 39 species can be calculated. Risk of extinction does decrease sharply with N. After correcting for much of the effect of N, the theoretical prediction is confirmed that the relative susceptibility to extinction of large- and small-bodied species reverses with increasing population size.

In habitats with moderate AETs, the decreased control by lignin over annual decomposition rates of surface litter is due in part to a significant periodic or seasonal influence of other carbon-based plant secondary metabolites over rates in the initial phase of decomposition. The influence of other secondary metabolites over decomposition rates should be a function of other correlates of AET: phytochemical composition of the community and persistence of various secondary metabolites in litter. As AET decreases from the highest extreme, one expects more, but perhaps short-term seasonal, influence of monomeric phenolics and tannins. In warm, dry environments with still-lower AETs, one expects some control by terpenes. On an annual basis, the relative influence of components other than lignin should therefore increase with decreasing AET, and the influence of lignin content alone on decomposition rates of surface litter should be reduced proportionately. Effects of these various classes of compounds should exhibit different temporal patterns in litter and soil.

Position of seeds fathered by pollen donors may thus act as a selective arena. Because of this position-dependent abortion, successful fathers sire the seeds most likely to mature and to be larger than average, but siring these high-quality seeds may reduce the quantity of seeds sired by a donor after mixed pollination because pollen tubes must grown past fertilizable stylar ovules to reach middle and basal ovules, allowing pollen tubes from other donors to sire many seeds in the less favoured positions.

This observation does not refer to steppe and tundra environments, which are green for only a few weeks and where there is an obvious shortage of forage during the unfavorable season. The limitation of grazers by resource depletion in such environments and the strong impacts of herbivory on the vegetation are straightforward consequences of the exploitation view in HSS, applied to relatively unproductive ecosystems.

When a group captures only a single prey per hunt, the expected benefits from cooperation rarely outweigh the advantages of hunting alone, since the prey must be divided between group members. Cooperation to capture the same prey can confer sufficient mutual benefit only when solitaries have low foraging efficiency; otherwise, each individual would do better to hunt separate prey. Species that capture multiple prey in a single hunt are not faced with similar disadvantages from grouping and should not be similarly constrained to hunt alone by high individual foraging effeciency. However, these predictions are not well supported by comparisons of individual hunting success in species that hunt alone and in groups. Cooperative hunting in many species is more often a consequence of gregariousness than its evolutionary cause. The conditions under which group members should hunt cooperatively are also specified. A temptation to cheat is prevalent in species that capture prey large enough to be scavenged by noncooperative companions. Cheaters can thereby avoid the costs of hunting and prey capture. Cooperation is most likely when an individual has a low probability of capturing a large prey by itself. Under these conditions, a 2nd hunter can sufficiently increase the pair's chances of capturing the prey to overcome its own costs of participating in the hunt. However, the temptation to cheat increases with group size, since each additional hunter is decreasingly likely to overcome his costs of hunting. There is no temptation to cheat when prey size is so small that only the successful hunter can feed from the captured prey. Data from 28 studies of group hunting generally conform to these predictions. -from Authors",311,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,93,NA,NA

Egg mortality is minimized if the female provides maternal care at the maximum level throughout brooding. Numerical analyses using data from studies of the energetics, behaviour and demography of D. ochrophaeus indicate that the food intake of sexually mature females probably is not sufficiently high to allow growth before egg production. Also, reproductive success depends on the relationship between female size, efficacy of maternal care, and predation risk. Egg clutches of small females may be subject to high mortality in spite of maternal care. Thus, energetics, behaviour, and the consequences of body size may have resulted in the evolution of delayed maturity. -from Author",17,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,95,NA,NA

The spatial heterogeneity of prey is highest when the leeches are present. The spatial heterogeneity of the chironomids decreased when they were released from predation, perhaps to minimize competition between the larvae. Intraspecific competition strongly affected chironomid growth rates during these experiments. Because the leeches consumed a lower proportion of larvae at higher level densities, it is likely that predation rates would be higher, and larval survival lower, if larvae did not aggregate when exposed to predation. Differences in the spatial distribution of prey were not detectable by 3 days after but appeared before 28 days had elapsed. Prey organisms were sufficiently mobile to avoid positive correlations with predators, and the predators were sufficiently tenacious to prevent negative correlations with prey. The plasticity of spatial behavior of the chironomid larvae probably contributes to maintaining this dynamic balance. -Authors",14,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,96,NA,NA

Scramble competition for food affects viability and adult size, which are correlated with the fecundity of females. Adult effects on fecundity are also explicitly modeled.

Resulting population dynamics of the 2 submodels are qualitatively different. For both submodels population stability requires some degree of adult effects on female fecundity for parameter values typical of Drosophila. When genetic variation is present for competitive ability and minimum food required, natural selection at equilibrium population size favors increasing competiitve ability and decreasing the minimum food requirement. Decreases in minimum food requirements typically increase the equilibrium adult population size but have variable effects on equilibrium egg numbers. Competitive ability and minimum food requirements may be positively correlated. Genetic models with this antagonistic pleiotropy can maintain allelic variation without overdominance in either character. -from Author",65,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,97,all,All Open Access

A model is developed in which risk of detection is varied in relation to group size and degree of prey distastefulness and aposematic coloration, both of which affect the number of prey a predator samples during avoidance learning. Members of small groups may have a higher rate of death from predation than solitary individuals, but above a certain minimum group size, group members do better than solitary individuals. Factors unrelated to predation constrain group size. Such constraints must be weak enough to allow groups larger than the minimum size. The model predicts that 1) gregarious insect species should be distasteful, and evolution of distastefulness should precede that of gregariousness; 2) distribution of group sizes among species should show a bimodal form; and 3) largest aggregations should be found in forms that have fewer constraints unrelated to predation on group size. -from Authors",93,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,98,NA,NA

Widely accepted hypotheses for the evolution of host-plant alternation (heteroecy) in aphids exemplify such assumptions, eg the hypothesis of complementary host growth states that heteroecy is a result of selection for optimizing nutrient intake in a seasonally varying environment. However, these optimization hypotheses are inconsistent with many of the facts concerning aphid heteroecy. Heteroecy is frequent in aphids, and originated several times; it is rare or absent in other insects, implying that an adequate explanation must invoke features of aphids not found in other insect groups using similar resources. An alternative hypothesis, the fundatrix-specialization hypothesis, is based on the narrower range of tolerances of one of the seasonal morphs of the life cycle, the first spring female, or fundatrix. The fundatrix specializes on ancestral woody host plants when they are in their most favorable seasonal state. Heteroecy appears to be a consequence of the seasonal polymorphism of aphids, which causes some morphs (the fundatrices) to be more evolutionarily constrained than others (the summer females) in their abilities to acquire hosts. Some aphid lineages have escaped this constraint by replacing the ancestral fundatrix morph and remaining all year on former secondary hosts, thus becoming secondarily autoecious. Most of the large and species-rich groups of Aphidinae on herbaceous angiosperms probably are derived from ancestors showing such life-cycle reduction. -from Author",129,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,99,NA,NA

Learning by males of P. lucida to discriminate against one unisexual clone does not generalize completely to new clones; thus, unfamilar clones are more likely to be courted than familiar clones. Although all members of a triploid clone are genetically identical, members of a diploid hemiclone share only an identical monacha genome. The unfamiliar-female advantage persists, among diploid hemiclones even when the lucida genome of clonal members varies.

In models of the Lotka-Volterra type, either trend 2 or a combination of trends 1 and 3 leads to the prediction that the abundance of both Daphnia and their algal prey should increase along a nutrient gradient in natural habitats where inedible algae and predators of Daphnia both occur.
