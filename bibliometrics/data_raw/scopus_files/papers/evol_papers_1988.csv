Rapid development is expected to be advantageous in short-duration ponds, but slower development, allowing more time for growth, may be advantageous in ponds of longer duration. There was no evidence for genetic variation in plasticity of development; all sibships exhibited faster development and decreased larval period in ponds of short duration. Plasticity in development appears to be adaptive, as size at metamorphosis was correlated with duration of larval period. The slowest developing sibship, however, suffered higher mortality compared to other sibships in short duration ponds. Sibships did not differ in growth or size at metamorphosis in short-duration ponds, but the slowest developing sibship metamorphosed at the largest size in long duration ponds, resulting in a significant genotype × environment interaction for size at metamorphosis. Thus, there appears to be genetic variation for plasticity in growth, and a genetically determined trade-off between fitness in short-duration ponds (via rapid development) and fitness in long duration ponds (via large size at metamorphosis). This may explain the existence of both phenotypic plasticity and genetic variation in development. -from Author",201,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,2,all,All Open Access

In particular, the rate of saturation should be determined largely by the height of a plant because, other factors being equal, pollen-flight distances (and thus access to mates) are dependent on the height of the pollen-emitting source. A diminutive plant with a restricted pollen shadow might be able to fertilize most or all of the few available ovules even at low levels of pollen production. Allocation to additional polliniferous flowers would not alter the dispersal range or ovule pool and so would merely increase the local mating competition (LMC) among sib pollen. In contrast, a taller individual should experience reduced LMC and have a less saturating male-fitness curve, due to wider dispsersal of its pollen. Thus, contrary to the traditional expectation of greater female effort in larger plants, larger wind-pollinated plants should have relatively greater male investment.

A model is proposed that provides an explanation in terms of evolutionary ecology for why males copulate with unisexuals. It assumes that, before copulation, a male attempts to identify a female as conspecific or not but that the correctness of the identification depends on the length of time spent on the identification process. Some cost is involved in the passage of time, so an optimal time spent on identification must exist. Because subordinate males risk being driven away by dominant males, the optimal time is longer for males at the top of the dominance hierarchy than for males at the bottom.

There is a theoretical conflict of interest between founding queens and their daughter workers over how many and which individuals should be the extra reproductives. Both castes should prefer their full sisters. Therefore, primary polygyny (multiple related foundresses) may favor queens while secondary polygyny (related queens added to mature colonies) may favor workers. Polygyny, itself, was favored by high colony survivorship and low probability of queens contributing eggs to successive broods. Polygyne colonies, however, did not need to produce more offspring per brood to be selectively favored; they could be half as productive per brood as monogyne ones and still have higher lifetime fitness under some conditions. For reproductive data from 8 ant species with both monogyne and polygyne colonies, the model generates results that are consistent with a kin-selection explanation of polygyny in all of them. It is proposed that queen number is an ecologically flexible trait that is influenced by a broad set of factors but is not necessarily linked to specific habitat types. Neither polygyny nor monogyny may be reliably considered as the primitive or ancestral Hymenopteran social system.

The temperate species of this group studied here may be subdivided into the warm-temperate species (D. lutescens, D. rufa) and the cool-temperate species (species of the auraria complex). The warm-temperate species were more cold-hardy than were their tropical relatives (D. takahashii or D. melanogaster) at the larval and imaginal stages, and the cool-temperate species were more cold-hardy than the warm-temperate species, although only at the imaginal stage. However, these species showed little or no intraspecific variation in cold-hardiness, despite great variation in winter temperature within the species' ranges. It is assumed that cold-hardiness is one of the main factors restricting their distributions at high latitudes and that it is the key for evolution of the warm- and cool-temperate species from their subtropical or warm-temperate ancestors. Both warm- and cool-temperate species had photoperiodically controlled reproductive diapause. In the cool-temperate species, development of cold-hardiness was affected by diapause, but diapause had little or no effect on cold-hardiness in the warm-temperate species. Critical daylengths and the diapause rates varied from species to species according to variation in their overwintering plans and also varied geographically in consequence of their adapatation to local climates. Species showed different responses to temperature in preimaginal and ovarian development. These differences probably reflect adaptation to different environmental temperatures. -Author",95,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,45,NA,NA

Genetic variation and interspecific genetic differentiation based on 10 enzyme loci are described for Dubautia and Wilkesia. Genetic identities among species span the range of values expected from interpopulation comparisons within a single species (I = 0.90-1.00) to those typical of interspecific comparisons (I = 0.67). Genetic-identity values correspond to biogeographic distribution and morphological distinctiveness, supporting a correlation of increasing genetic distance associated with the time of separation among lineages. The high genetic identities observed within the Hawaiian Madiinae and other island plant groups are apparently due to limited time spans available for taxa to accumulate new genetic variation through mutation. Species may remain genetically similar (I > 0.90) even after time spans on the order of magnitude of 1 000 000 yr. -Authors",96,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,46,NA,NA

Study of regeneration of E. risdonii and E. amygdalina indicated that the current selective regime was favoring E. risdonii, but dispersal of E. risdonii by seeds is shown to be limited. Flow of E. risdonii genes into the range of E. amygdalina by pollen dispersal and F1 hybridization is widespread. While the actual level of hybridization is low, interspecific hybridization effectively doubles the dispersal of E. risdonii genes into the range of E. amygdalina. This pollen flow can have a significant genetic impact, since isolated hybrids or patches of abnormal phenotypes have been found 200-300 m from the species boundary. Results suggest that E. risdonii may invade suitable habitat islands within the E. amygdalina forest, independently of seed migration, by long-distance pollen migration followed by selection for the gene combinations of the pollen parent. -from Authors",107,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,48,NA,NA

Two genera one a parrot and one a toucan, corroborate a well known biogeographic disjunction in which taxa endemic to southern Central America and northwestern South America are the sister-group to a radiation within the Amazon basin. These two genera, also document a pattern of historical interrelationships for four well known areas of endemism within Amazonia. These generalized historical patterns are interpreted to have arisen via fragmentation (vicariance) of a widespread ancestral biota. A review of the paleogeographic evidence suggests that these vicariance events could have originated as a result of several different mechanisms operating at various times during the Cenozoic. The inference that diversification of the neotropical biota is primarily the result of the most recent of these possible vicariance events is unwarranted. These patterns of historical congruence are also interpreted as direct evidence against the hypothesis that diversification of the forest biota was a consequence of parapatric differentiation along recently established ecological gradients.-from Authors",229,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,51,all,All Open Access
