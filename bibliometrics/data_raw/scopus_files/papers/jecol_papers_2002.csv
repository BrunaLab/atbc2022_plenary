The simultaneous use of fruits and seeds by invertebrate seed predators and vertebrate seed dispersers produces complex ecological interactions that reduce the predictability of seed fate. 2. Cocosoid palm seeds in the Neotropics are subject to high mortality by bruchid beetle infestation and such attack is the major cause of mortality for seeds of the palm Attalea maripa at our study site in the northern Brazilian Amazon. 3. The exocarp and mesocarp of 1400 fruits were manipulated in different ways to simulate handling by vertebrates. No eggs of the bruchid beetle, Pachymerus cardo, were laid on intact control fruits, while the highest numbers of eggs were received by fruits whose exocarp and mesocarp had been partially removed, as if by primates and rodents (mean of 15.9 and 18.9 eggs fruit-1, respectively, during the peak fruiting season). Fruits with intact mesocarp but no exocarp, and fruits with all mesocarp and exocarp removed, received low numbers of eggs (mean of 4.6 and 6.6 eggs per fruit, respectively, during the peak fruiting season). Thus both exocarp and mesocarp deter oviposition, and removal of these fruit structures increases fruit susceptibility to infestation. 4. Oviposition rates declined as the fruiting season progressed, but oviposition preferences remained the same. Seed mortality was high for any fruit on which eggs were laid. 5. Large rodents and primates, which have been considered among the most effective seed dispersers for large-seeded Neotropical trees such as palms, actually increased the susceptibility of seeds to bruchid beetle attack. Removal of (intact) seeds by other dispersers may be necessary to ensure seed survival. 6. These results indicate that the reliability of seed dispersers cannot be gauged without a complete understanding of variables that affect seed viability.",46,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Attalea maripa | Frugivory | Fruit traits | Seed dispersal | Tropical forests,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA,NA,NA

The effectiveness of a seed disperser depends on the quantity of seed dispersed and the quality of dispersal provided to each seed. Relationships between the quantity and quality components and their dependence on characteristics of the dispersers remain largely uninvestigated. 2. The effectiveness of different waterfowl species at dispersing seeds of Ruppia maritima was evaluated in a wetland in south-west Spain. Droppings were collected during autumn and spring waterfowl migrations and the number of seeds ingested (estimated from seed fragments), undigested and viable in germination trials were determined. 3. Ingestion by waterfowl enhanced the rate of germination and, for several duck species, it also had a positive effect on germinability. Both the presence of seeds in the diet and the effects of gut passage showed high interspecific and temporal variance. Some of the interspecific variation in dispersal quality was related to gut structure: species with heavier gizzards destroyed a higher proportion of seeds and undigested seeds ingested by species with more grit in the gizzard germinated better. 4.

Whereas B. hordeaceus individuals did not differ in fitness with respect to infection, average fitness of infected S. viridis was approximately half that of uninfected individuals, and in one out of two years, infected S. lutescens had approximately 25% higher fitness. Variability among hosts appears to contribute more than variability among BYDV serotypes to the pattern of infection outcomes. 3. These correlations suggest that the relationship between BYDVs and these co-occurring host species ranges from antagonism to mutualism. If so, BYDVs can act as agents of selection in natural populations in which the symptoms of infection are unapparent. 4. The results also demonstrate that infections can be unapparent due to large trait variance rather than small mean effects.

The interactive effect of grazing and small-scale variation in primary productivity on the diversity of an annual plant community was studied in a semiarid Mediterranean rangeland in Israel over 4 years. The response of the community to protection from sheep grazing by fenced exclosures was compared in four neighbouring topographic sites (south- and north-facing slopes, hilltop and wadi (dry stream) shoulders), differing in vegetation, physical characteristics and soil resources. The herbaceous annual vegetation was highly diverse, including 128 species. Average small-scale species richness of annuals ranged between 5 and 16 species within a 20 Ã— 20 cm quadrat, and was strongly affected by year and site. 2. Above-ground potential productivity at peak season (i.e. in fenced subplots) was typical of semiarid ecosystems (10-200 g m-2), except on wadi shoulders (up to 700 g m-2), where it reached the range of subhumid grassland ecosystems. Grazing increased richness in the high productivity site (i.e. wadi), but did not affect, or reduced, it in the low productivity sites (south- and north-facing slopes, hilltop). Under grazing, species richness was positively and linearly related to potential productivity along the whole range of productivity. Without grazing, this relationship was observed only at low productivity (< 200 g m-2). 3. The effect of grazing along the productivity gradient on different components of richness was analysed. At low productivity, number of abundant, common and rare species all tended to increase with productivity, both with and without grazing. Rare species increased three times compared with common and abundant species. At high productivity, only rare species continued to increase with productivity under grazing, while in the absence of grazing species number in the different abundance groups was not related to productivity. 4. In this semiarid Mediterranean rangeland, diversity of the annual plant community is determined by the interaction between grazing and small-scale spatial and temporal variation in primary productivity, operating mainly on the less abundant species in the community.",191,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Competition | Disturbance | Mediterranean sheep | Species richness,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,4,NA,NA,NA,NA

The gradient relations proposed by Wheeler & Proctor for NW European mires were tested for six Carex species common in north Japanese mires. Hydrochemical properties of their preferred habitats were compared with above-ground biomass data. 2. Canonical discriminant analysis showed that soil water pH was the strongest discriminant between habitats of the Carex species, with total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentration also contributing, independently of pH. 3. Two major patterns were apparent in the distribution of Carex species: pH determines a bimodal distribution into fens with pH > 5.0 and bogs with pH < 5.5, whilst TDN captures the variation in above-ground biomass within both fen and bog, but does not differ significantly between them. 4. Concentrations of Ca and Mg were low throughout the pH range. The floristic gradients associated with base richness seen in Euramerican mires do not therefore apply in north Japanese mires, where periodic flooding with neutral water removes the acid fractions in fens, and is the major determinant of pH. 5.

Habitat fragmentation as a result of intensification of agricultural practices decreases the population size and increases the site productivity of remnant populations of many plant species native to nutrient-poor, species-rich grasslands. Little is known about how this affects the colonization capacity of populations, which is highly important for regional species survival. We studied the effects on four wind-dispersed forbs that represent two major dispersal strategies in grasslands: Cirsium dissectum and Hypochaeris radicata, which have plumed seeds and are adapted to long-distance dispersal by wind, and Centaurea jacea and Succisa pratensis, which have plumeless seeds and are adapted to only short-distance dispersal by wind. 2. Colonization capacity decreased with decreasing population size. This was due to lower seed germination ability in all species, and a lower seed production and a narrower range of seed dispersal distances in the species with plumed seeds. Inbreeding depression is the most likely cause of this. We found no evidence for a stronger selection for reduced dispersal in smaller populations. 3. Increasing site productivity changed the colonization capacity of all species. The capacity for colonization of nearby sites increased, due to higher seed production and seed germination ability, but the capacity for colonization of distant sites decreased, due to a lower long-distance dispersal ability. 4. Seed dispersal ability and germination ability were negatively correlated in the species with plumeless seeds, but not in the species with plumed seeds. The dispersal ability of individual plumed seeds remained constant under changes in population size and site productivity. This indicates a strong selection pressure for long-distance dispersal ability in these species. 5. When habitat fragmentation results in a simultaneous decrease in population size and increase in site productivity, both the local survival probability and the colonization capacity of remnant populations of wind-dispersed grassland forbs are likely to be severely reduced. This increases regional extinction risks of the species.",113,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Germination | Habitat fragmentation | Population size | Seed production | Site productivity | Wind dispersal,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,7,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Monocarpy in facultative biennials can be favoured by selection when there is a more than proportional increase in fitness with size. The possible contributions of larger reproductive output and higher offspring quality to such an increase were investigated in the facultative biennial plant Digitalis purpurea. Straw mass (rosette leaves and flowering stem excluding fruits and seeds) was determined for 100 individuals of varying size and correlated with the number of flowers and seeds per flower to examine whether sex-allocation is size dependent. 2. To determine whether maternal size influences offspring growth, and whether this effect is more pronounced in the presence of competition, seeds from 32 maternal plants were grown alone, and with one, two or four competitors. 3. Total seed number increased proportionally with size. Seed quality, measured as seed size, germination percentage and speed also increased with maternal size. The combined fitness measures of total seed mass (seed number x seed size), number of seedlings (seed number x germination percentage) and total female fitness (seed number x germination percentage x mean offspring dry mass after 14 weeks) all increased disproportionally with size. 4. Sex-allocation was size dependent, with large plants emphasizing the female function. 5. Offspring dry mass after both 8 and 14 weeks of growth was strongly influenced by competition, whereas the effect of maternal size was significant only at the first harvest date. Competition did not accentuate the effects of maternal size. 6.

Using 18 years of permanent-plot data from a 4-ha stand, we investigated whether stand dynamics is predictable, i.e. driven by competition (inferred from species shade tolerances), or unpredictable (driven by frequent exogenous disturbance or other factors). We also considered whether small disturbance might accelerate or retard succession. The study involved dynamics of stems â‰¥ 4.5 cm diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) for 10 important species in a southern mixed hardwood forest 80 years after selective removal of Pinus taeda. 2. Shade-tolerant species (Ilex opaca, Fagus grandifolia, Magnolia grandiflora, Acer rubrum, Nyssa sylvatica) increased in small d.b.h. classes, whereas intermediate (Quercus alba) and shade-intolerant species (Q. nigra, Q. hemisphaerica, Liquidambar styraciflua, Pinus taeda) did not. 3. Per-capita ingrowth was higher for shade-tolerant species (0.016-0.024) than for intermediate and shade-intolerant species (0-0.006), whereas mortality was lower ((0.006-0.015 vs. 0.019-0.035). 4. Over 18 years, ingrowth exceeded mortality loss slightly, resulting in an increase in number of stems of about 1%, from 995 to 1029 stems ha-1; average live basal area (BA; 35.9 m2 ha-1) varied by less than 2% over eight surveys spanning 18 years. Basal area increased substantially for three species (Ilex opaca, Pinus taeda, Acer rubrum), and declined strongly for three others (Quercus nigra, Q. hemisphaerica and Fagus grandifolia). 5. The stand d.b.h. distribution had a rotated sigmoid form which became flatter over time. Species d.b.h. distributions were mostly bell-shaped for intolerant species, and irregular-to-monotonic declining for shade-tolerant species.

Compositional change was most rapid during the hurricane interval and ingrowth was highest in the two intervals following the hurricane. Effects on species trends in density, basal area, mortality or recruitment were minor. 7. Temporal trends in species abundances mostly supported the hypothesis of predictable successional change related to competition for light.

The feedback between individual plants and their soil communities is a major driver of plant community processes. We analyse the rate at which plant-soil feedback develops in the root zone of the clonal dune grass Ammophila arenaria. 2. Ammophila arenaria grows vigorously when it can form new roots in newly deposited windblown beach sand. The colonization zone is hypothesized to provide an enemy-free space, with root pathogens and parasites possibly contributing to degeneration of A. arenaria when deposition stops. 3. We quantified root biomass and plant parasitic nematode densities in new and 1-year-old root zones, as well as in degenerate stands, in the field at monthly intervals. Each month, we studied the biomass production of Ammophila seedlings in controlled conditions in sterilized and non-sterilized soil from the different sampling sites, with and without nematicides. 4. Colonization of newly deposited sand by the endoparasitic nematodes Heterodera arenaria and Pratylenchus spp. within 1 month of root formation coincided with a negative feedback in the bioassays. Nematicides counteracted growth reduction significantly, but their effectiveness decreased in soil samples collected later in the growing season. 5. In older layers, roots and nematodes were already present before the sampling started. Growth reduction in unsterilized sand was observed at all sampling events, but was not counteracted by nematicides. 6. In the field, root biomass of A. arenaria in the newly colonized sand increased throughout the growing season, despite the development of a negative plant-soil feedback. 7. We conclude that the development of negative plant-soil feedback in the root zone of A. arenaria closely follows the colonization of newly deposited sand by roots and then by the endoparasitic nematode species Heterodera arenaria. There seems to be a shift in organisms causing this feedback during the first growing season, but root biomass nevertheless increases. However, in older root layers and in the degenerate stand, ongoing negative plant-soil feedback may contribute to a gradual decrease in root biomass.",80,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Clonal growth | Coastal foredunes | Enemy-free space | Natural plant communities | Nematicides | Parasitic nematodes | Soil pathogens | Spatio-temporal patterns,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,10,NA,NA,NA,NA

Observed habitat specificity was more likely to correspond to physiology in the common species. In particular, one common species, Mnium spinulosum, was limited by intolerance of high light conditions and is characteristic of deeply shaded conifer stands, while another, Bryum pseudotriquetrum, lacked desiccation tolerance and is typical of moist areas such as stream banks. However, the rare species, Mielichhoferia macrocarpa, which occurred in the darkest and wettest sites was not intolerant of high light or desiccation. 3. The relationship between desiccation tolerance and habitat moisture (based on a mesic to xeric scale) was less clear than in prior bryophyte studies, suggesting that a more rigorous quantification of habitat moisture is needed. 4. Contrary to predictions, the rare species did not have narrower physiological tolerances than the common species. The match between environment and physiology for common species probably results from their occupation of more of the potentially suitable sites. 5. There may also be selection for broader physiological tolerance in rare species resulting from their greater reliance on asexual reproduction, which might explain their relatively high desiccation tolerance both as colonies and fragments.",41,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Bryum | Desiccation | Didymodon | Gametophyte fragment | Mnium,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,15,NA,NA,NA,NA

Plants were grown at a factorial combination of two irradiances (50 and 350 Î¼mol m-2 s-1) and three photoperiods (13, 16 and 22 h) and morphology, gas-exchange rate and biomass accumulation were recorded. 2. The overall response to variation in irradiance and photoperiod was similar for all three clones. 3. Differences in irradiance resulted in strong acclimative changes in morphological and physiological characteristics. At low irradiance, pronounced vertical shoot extension compensated for the limited plasticity in leaf area production, while photosynthetic capacity, apparent quantum yield and total chlorophyll concentration increased. As a result, biomass yield at the end of the experimental period was similar in both treatments. 4. A decrease in photoperiod also resulted in plastic changes in morphology (increase of leaf biomass per unit plant biomass) and physiology (increase of photosynthetic capacity). However, these acclimative responses did not fully compensate for differences in photoperiod, since biomass was significantly lower under 13 and 16 h photoperiods than at 22 h. 5.

We reconstructed the spatial fire history in a c. 4400 ha area by first identifying distinct patches in the landscape on aerial photographs, and then in the field by determining the disturbance history of each patch by dating fire scars, ages of post-fire cohorts and releases of remnant trees. 3 Both topographic position and fire history contribute to susceptibility to wind damage. Stands at higher elevations, on easterly slopes and closer to ridges were most affected. Younger stands (i.e. more recently affected by stand-initiating fires) were less affected particularly in areas affected by low-moderate severity blowdown (< 80% damage). The ecological effects of the very severe 1997 windstorm were mediated by the legacies of fires which occurred several centuries ago.

Relatively few studies have looked for patterns of invasion by non-native species within communities. We tested the hypotheses that: (i) some types of microhabitats within a community are more invasible than others; (ii) microhabitat types that differ in invasion also differ in resource availability; and (iii) invasibility is mediated by effects of these resources on competition between native and non-native species. 2. To test the first two hypotheses, we measured plant cover and soils in a coastal grassland in northern California. Consistent with these hypotheses, cover of non-native plants was consistently high where nitrogen-fixing shrubs had recently grown, in the bottoms and sides of gullies and on deep soils, and these microhabitats tended to have relatively high nitrogen or water availability. 3. Cover and number of native species tended to be lower where cover of non-native species was higher, indicating that non-native species as a group negatively affected native species. However, the number of non-native species also tended to be lower where the total cover of non-natives was higher. This suggests that a few non-native species excluded natives and other non-natives alike. 4. To test the third hypothesis, we grew a common non-native, the annual grass Lolium multiflorum, and a common native, the perennial grass Hordeum brachyantherum, at different levels of water and nitrogen. The relative competitive ability of the native was higher at lower nitrogen availability but not at lower water availability. When 10-week-old native plants were grown with non-native seedlings and nitrogen was relatively low, the native out-competed the non-native. However, the non-native out-competed the native at all resource levels when species were both grown as seedlings. Competition between native and non-native grasses in this system may thus help prevent invasion by non-natives in microhabitats where nitrogen availability is low, but invasion may be relatively irreversible.",127,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Invasive plant species | Northern California coast | Plant competition | Soil characteristics | Water and nitrogen availability,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,18,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

In the Drentse A nature reserve, the Netherlands, a relatively productive grassland, represented by H. lanatus, has gradually been replaced by a less-productive community, represented by A. odoratum, after the application of fertiliser was stopped. Stressed plants are generally considered to be more sensitive to herbivory. 2. We hypothesized that plant-feeding nematodes would exacerbate the competitive disadvantage of H. lanatus resulting from nutrient limitation. We compared performance in an adjusted De Wit replacement series with monocultures, grown in soil that was either treated or untreated with nematicides at both low and high nutrient supply. 3. The biomass production of both plant species was negatively affected by intra- and interspecific competition. Although H. lanatus was a stronger competitor than A. odoratum in mixed cultures, it was more sensitive to plant-feeding nematodes and nutrient limitation. Nematodes and nutrient stress therefore reduced the competitive suppression of A. odoratum by H. lanatus. Low nutrient availability did not enhance the effect of plant-feeding nematodes on plant growth and competition, indicating additive rather than synergistic effects on plant performance. 4. We conclude that plant-feeding nematodes may contribute to species replacements in grasslands after fertilization has been stopped, albeit to a lesser extent than reduced nutrient availability.

A dynamic competition kernel for a plant growing in the presence of a neighbour is a function describing how the competitive effect experienced by the plant depends on its own size, and the size of and distance to a neighbour.

The experiments entailed growing target plants in isolation, and with single neighbours of different relative sizes, and at different distances. Growth was determined from repeated measures of the area occupied by each plant. Target plants with smaller neighbours, or with neighbours that were further away, grew to a larger size than targets with larger, or closer, neighbours. 3. Relative growth rate (RGR) of isolated plants was best described by the Gompertz equation, a standard plant growth equation that reduces RGR in proportion to the logarithm of plant size. 4. Competition kernels were constructed by modifying the Gompertz equation to include the competitive effect of a neighbour. Alternative kernels (including the zone of influence model), with and without a parameter of asymmetry of competition, were constructed from observed growth rates of target plants with neighbours over short time intervals.

A spatially explicit, rule-based model for three co-occurring Banksia species was developed to investigate coexistence mediating processes in a fire-prone shrubland in western Australia. Fecundity, recruitment, mortality and other biological data for two non-sprouting (B. hookeriana, B. prionotes) and one resprouting (B. attenuata) species were available from 15 years of empirical field studies. 2. Without interspecific competition, each species could persist for a wide range of fire intervals (10 to > 20 years). The resprouting species performed better under shorter fire intervals (10-13 years), while both non-sprouting species were favoured by longer (15 to > 20 years) fire intervals. These results conform with those obtained from single-species, non-spatial population models. 3. When interspecific competition for space was included in the model, all three species exhibited optima at shorter fire intervals and with a narrower range than in isolation. The three species did not co-occur under any fire regime. At intermediate fire frequencies (11-13 years), B. hookeriana excluded the other species, while for longer intervals between fires B. prionotes became dominant. 4. The introduction of temporal (stochastic) variability in fire intervals (drawn from a normal distribution) failed to produce coexistence, unless spatial variability as a spatial ignition gradient was also included. The spatial arrangement of the non-sprouters observed in the field was then reproduced. 5. Observed patterns of coexistence and spatial distributions of all species occurred when a spatial establishment gradient for the resprouter species was included in the model (individuals of B. attenuata are known to produce more seeds in swales than on dune crests and recruit seedlings here more frequently). 6. Coexistence appears to be highly dependent upon the mean interfire period in combination with subtle gradients associated with fire propagation and recruitment conditions. Variation around the mean fire interval is less critical. When the system is modelled over a long time period (1500 years) coexistence is most strongly favoured for a narrow window of mean fire intervals (12-14 years).",44,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Dispersal | Fire regime | Grid-based model | Non-sprouter | Proteaceae | Resprouter | Topographic gradient,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,23,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

The calendar year of death of the standing dead trees was determined by cross-dating ring-width patterns of dead trees to reference chronologies from living trees. This procedure is not, however, exactas there may be multiple intermittent missing rings. 3 A remarkable discrepancy (up to 31 years) was found between the tree-death year estimated through crown condition assessment (i.e. the presence or lack of green needles) and the date of the outermost tree ring (when tree-ring production ceased). New needles may form and existing ones remain green for some years after the cambium at different heights along the stem has ceased activity and no new wood cells are being formed. 4 Ring-patterns in trees infected by Armillaria differ from those in trees infected by H. annosum. All dead trees infected by Armillaria had a slow growth decrease indicating suppression for several decades, and suggesting that Armillaria attacked trees that were already weakened by competition. In contrast, trees infected by H. annosum died over a very short period of time, although they may have been infected a long time previously. Nevertheless H. annosum seems to infect and kill trees directly, whereas Armillaria, at this site, is a secondary pathogen. 5 This study demonstrates that tree rings may be used as indicators of the history of tree decline prior to tree death.

Surprisingly, this was mostly due to numbers increasing at lower densities, probably because microscopic forms were not removed during the experimental thinning. 3 The allometric length-dry mass relationship fitted a simple linear model on log-log scale for both the highest and the lowest densities, but had different slopes. At higher densities plants became taller and thinner as a consequence of variations in the production and growth of modules. 4 Mean size (dry mass) and the development of size hierarchies of plants were affected by both the addition of further (microscopic) recruits and asymmetrical competition among plants. Plant length distributions were also influenced by changes in the growth form of plants. The length hierarchies of main branches also suggested the presence of asymmetrical competition at this modular level. 5 Density influenced both mean size and morphology of the plants and thus induced changes in reproduction. The negative effect of density on individual plant size reduced the percentage of fertile plants and possibly their annual reproductive allocation, but these effects may be attenuated by morphological responses. 6 The responses of S. muticum to crowding are closely linked to its ability to colonize bare space.

External environmental factors are therefore more likely to contribute to seasonal changes in the probability of germinating in the autumn than are the characteristics of the seeds. 4 The frequency of annual offspring varied among maternal plants. The association between the time a flower was open and offspring germination season suggests that evolution of life history schedule may be accomplished by altering maternal flowering phenology. 5 The association between the time of a flower's anthesis and its fruit maturation was weaker in two years when water was limiting. Limited water also resulted in earlier seed maturation, and consequently a greater proportion of a population's seed being produced during the period when autumn germination was likely.

The site today lies in birch forest tundra, approximately 25 km north of the pine treeline and 90 km south of the Murman Coast. 2. The record begins approximately 10 050 14C years before present (BP). The post-glacial tundra, typified by various herbaceous taxa and Artemisia, was followed by Betula-dominated woodland forest with Polypodiaceae-Gramineae pollen types. Such vegetation assemblages are not analogous to any in the western Kola Peninsula today. 3. Stomate evidence demonstrates that Pinus sylvestris immigrated to the study site as early as 8150 14C BP. Pine forest probably expanded northwards from sparse or small disjunct populations, which established c. 1000 14C BP before the expansion evident in the pollen and wood macrofossil records (7200 14C BP). Betula and other shrub and herb taxa declined at this time, possibly as a result of shading by the pine canopy. 4. The presence of fossil Pinus sylvestris stomates and wood, together with AP: NAP ratios, indicates that the pine treeline was some 100 km north of its present position by the end of the middle Holocene warming (7000-6000 14C BP). This places it near the Barents Sea coast, currently tundra vegetation. An approximate 2Â°C increase in regional summer temperatures would be necessary to move the treeline to the present-day coastline. 5. From 6000 14C BP the pine treeline gradually retreated southward to its present modern position. Birch woodland has grown at the site since c. 3000 14C BP.",50,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Kola Peninsula | Northern treeline | Palynology | Pinus sylvestris | Stomates,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,30,NA,NA,NA,NA

Slow growth is associated with high mortality risk for trees, but few data exist to assess interspecific differences in the relationship between growth and mortality. Here we compare low growth tolerance for seven co-occurring species in the southern Appalachian Mountains: Acer rubrum, Betula lenta, Cornus florida, Liriodendron tulipifera, Quercus prinus, Quercus rubra and Robinia pseudo-acacia. 2. For all species, mortality was greater for understorey individuals than for canopy trees. Species varied widely in the length of growth decline prior to death, ranging from 6 years for L. tulipifera to more than 12 years for Q. rubra. 3. Growth-mortality functions differ among species, but we found little evidence of a trade-off between tolerance of slow growth and an ability to show rapid growth in high light conditions. 4. A. rubrum stands out in its ability both to grow rapidly and to tolerate slow growth, suggesting that its density may increase at our study site as in other parts of the eastern United States. In contrast, C. florida shows high mortality (15% per annum) as a result of infection with dogwood anthracnose. 5. We modified a forest simulation model, LINKAGES (which assumes that all species have the same ability to tolerate slow growth), to include our functions relating growth and mortality. The modified model gives radically altered predictions, reinforcing the need to rethink and re-parameterize existing computer models with field data.",157,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Biological trade-offs | Community structure | Forest demography | LINKAGES,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,31,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

The genetic constitution of populations may significantly affect demography. Founder populations or isolated remnants may show inbreeding depression, while established populations can be strongly adapted to the local environment. Gene exchange between populations can lead to better performance if heterozygosity levels are restored (heterosis), or to reduced performance if coadapted gene complexes are disrupted (outbreeding depression). 2. Five populations of the self-incompatible perennial Arnica montana (Asteraceae) were analysed for the demographic consequences of inbreeding and of intra- and interpopulation outcrossing, using both small and large populations as donors for the latter. We analysed seed production and seed weight and monitored growth, survival and flowering of offspring introduced as seeds and as 4-week-old seedlings in a 4-year field experiment. 3. Reduced seed set after selfing was probably due to the self-incompatibility system rather than to inbreeding depression. There was a significant increase for seed set after interpopulation crosses, which resulted from the alleviation of low mate availability in one of the small populations. 4. Significant inbreeding depression was observed for growth rates of plants introduced as seedlings. We found significant heterosis for flowering probability of plants introduced as seeds, but for plants introduced as seedlings, heterosis for seedling size and flowering probability was only marginally significant. Outbreeding depression was not observed. 5. The results of this study are important for reinforcement measures in small, remnant populations. Significant differences among populations for all measured fitness components suggest that reinforcement is best achieved using material from several populations. 6. The observed higher survival of seedlings as compared with seeds suggests that it is better to plant individuals than to sow. Sowing, however, is easier and cheaper, and was more likely to eliminate poorly adapted genotypes before they contribute to the next generation.",62,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Heterosis | Mate availability | Offspring fitness | Restoration | Self-incompatibility | Survival,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,32,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We modelled the growth in estimated biomass of individuals in experimental populations of Chenopodium album grown at two densities and measured sequentially nine times over 128 days. Competition is modelled by coupling individual growth equations and, within the population, the growth rate of a plant at any point in time is a function of its size to the power a, a measure of the degree of size-asymmetry of competition. 2. The growth of individuals in these crowded populations was significantly better fit by a Richards growth model than by models with one fewer parameter (e.g. logistic or Gompertz growth models). The additional parameter determines the location of the inflection point and provides great flexibility in fitting growth curves. Density had a significant effect on this parameter. 3. At the higher density, the maximum size that plants achieved was decreased and the exponential phase of growth was reduced. The estimate of the size-asymmetry parameter a was always greater than 1 and it increased significantly at the higher density. Growth was reduced and the number of very small individuals increased at the higher density, although a few plants still achieved a large size. 4. Our approach combines several recent innovations in the modelling of stand development, including (a) modelling of individual growth with biologically meaningful growth models and (b) modelling the relationship between size and growth of individuals within the population. Sequential, non-destructive data on the growth of individuals over time, in combination with modern statistical computing techniques, can lead to major advances in the modelling of plant population development, providing powerful tools for exploring variation in individual growth and for testing a wide range of hypotheses.",51,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Density effects | Growth equations | Individual-based models | Richards model | Sequential measurements,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,33,NA,NA,NA,NA

We use our model to examine the extent to which the conclusions of analytical, patch-based coexistence models depend on their assumptions. 3. We found that the need for an inferior competitor to be a superior colonizer was reduced by using a dispersal kernel to distribute seeds, and totally removed by relaxing the assumption of instantaneous competitive displacement. These results hold for annual or perennial plants with or without seedbanks, for global, local and stratified dispersal, for delayed competitive exclusion, two-way competition and neighbourhood competition, and for landscapes where habitat patches are either adjacent or disjunct. 4.

Propagule (diaspore) predation by crabs has been shown to be a major source of mortality for mangroves. We measured predation by crabs on seeds of nine tropical mangrove species in multifactorial experiments by following the fates of tethered propagules. 2. We tested whether planting, intertidal position and canopy gaps influenced predation of propagules and whether the predation of propagules was reduced in the presence of conspecifics. We also tested if predation influenced patterns of propagule establishment. 3. Mortality due to predation ranged from 22 to 100%, with Aegiceras corniculatum > Avicennia marina > Bruguiera parviflora > Aegialitis annulata > B. exaristata > Ceriops australis > C. decandra = B. gymnorrhiza > Rhizophora stylosa. Initial predator preference was correlated with the size of propagules. 4. Propagule planting (prone vs. implanted) and canopy type had the largest magnitude of effects across all species for treatment effects. Propagules dispersed in the prone position had more mortality while those dispersed into canopy gaps were generally less preyed upon. Three species were tested for dominance-predation by regression of stand relative density with final predation by crabs for canopy treatments. No species had significant effects that supported the hypothesis. 5. Predation by crabs often changed with intertidal position but showed no consistent pattern among species or gap treatments. Interactions of canopy treatment and tidal position showed that predation by crabs did not have a major influence on the zonation of mangroves in our study sites. 6. Analyses of covariance of predation and establishment showed that establishment success is strongly controlled by predation in six of the nine species tested. This suggests that herbivores have a greater impact on recruitment than do microhabitat effects on resources. The combined effects of predator refuge and growth preference enhance recruitment in large canopy gaps.

Removal of the above-ground portion of clonally regenerating trees results in a massive imbalance in the ratio of root to leaf area. We investigated the resilience of clones following above-ground disturbance in terms of root carbohydrates, leaf area renewal and root retention. 2. In a 2 Ã— 2 factorial experiment, 40 Populus tremuloides saplings were cut at times of high (late fall) or low (spring after leaf flush) root carbohydrate reserves. Leaf area renewal was manipulated by allowing either only one or all root suckers to re-grow. 3. Rootstarch concentrations were 10 times higher at the time of cutting in the fall compared with the spring, whereas sugar concentrations were only 10% higher. When saplings were cut in fall and all suckers were allowed to develop (FA treatment), suckers were taller, and had more biomass and leaf area and higher leaf area ratio than all other treatments. In particular, leaf area and leaf area ratio recovered within a year to near pre-treatment levels compared with at least a 50% reduction in the other treatments. 4. At the end of the first season after cutting FA saplings also had the greatest root mass and lowest amount of dead root mass, and root starch concentrations of these saplings had returned to pre-treatment values, compared with a 20% recovery for spring-cut saplings with a single sucker. Root mass and root starch concentrations were correlated with leaf mass in all treatments. 5. Adequate carbohydrate reserves at the time of disturbance and rapid redevelopment of leaf area by extensive sprouting seem critical for resilience of the clone and allow for the retention of the clonal root system and a rapid rebuilding of carbohydrate reserves.

No effects were seen on chlorophyll or carotenoids in S. magellanicum, although, for UV-B-absorbing compounds, a significant interaction between UV-B and year suggests some response to solar UV-B reduction. 4. The climate-related growth of the dwarf shrub E. rubrum was assessed retrospectively by correlating an 8-year record of annual stem elongation with macroclimatic factors including solar UV-B and visible radiation, precipitation and temperature. 5.

Seed size-related traits (length, width, diaspore mass and seed mass) varied mostly among localities and ant reward-related traits (elaiosome mass and elaiosome to seed mass ratio) mainly within plants. 3. Ant communities showed distance-dependent patterns in composition and abundance. Almost all ant species responded positively to diaspore offerings and preferred seeds with elaiosomes. The extent of the preference differed among species and was affected by ant size. Ant size was however, similar in almost all localities and the quality of the disperser guild, estimated as the ant response to seed offerings, did not vary. 4.

Nor could structural and functional ant community parameters explain variation in seed traits. 5. Comparison of ant sizes, position on a Principal Components Analysis of seed traits, and indirect estimates of dispersal success, suggests that there is a mosaic of wellmatched and mismatched situations which probably obscures the overall relationships among seed traits and ant assemblages.

We present a critical review of the application of metapopulation theory to the regional dynamics of plants. We consider whether there is evidence that regional populations of plants show a metapopulation structure. We then review the alternatives to the metapopulation regional population structure for plants. 2. Although metapopulation theory primarily deals with regional dynamics, it is, however, also commonly applied to patch dynamics within local populations ('metapatch' systems). These apparently analogous systems are very different: systems of patchy local populations do not exhibit the dissociation of processes operating at different spatial scales that is characteristic of metapopulations. 3. The parameters of classical metapopulation studies, such as colonization, re-colonization and extinction, may be hard to measure for many plant populations, in particular for populations with long-lived seedbanks. 4. The assumption of metapopulation theory that suitable habitat occurs as discrete patches within a matrix of unsuitable habitat is not always true, as regional populations of some species may exist on largely uninterrupted swathes of suitable habitat. Alternatively, suitable patches may be hard or impossible to define a priori. 5. Using detailed case studies from the literature we outline a possible classification of the spatial dynamics of plants at both regional and local scales. 6. At the regional scale we define: metapopulations, in the classic sense, where regional persistence is governed by the processes of patch colonization, extinction and recolonization; regional ensembles, systems of essentially unconnected local populations persisting in an ill-defined mosaic of suitable and unsuitable habitat; and spatially extended populations, essentially a single extended population occupying large tracts of suitable habitat, but whose regional dynamics are essentially a simple extension of local dynamics. 7.

In water-limited environments, the availability of water and nutrients to plants depends on environmental conditions, sizes and shapes of their root systems, and root competition. The goal of this study was to predict root system sizes and shapes for different plant growth forms using data on above-ground plant sizes, climate and soil texture. 2. A new data set of > 1300 records of root system sizes for individual plants was collected from the literature for deserts, scrublands, grasslands and savannas with â‰¤ 1000 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP). Maximum rooting depths, maximum lateral root spreads and their ratios were measured. 3. Root system sizes differed among growth forms and increased with above-ground size: annuals < perennial forbs = grasses < semi-shrubs < shrubs < trees. Stem succulents were as shallowly rooted as annuals but had lateral root spreads similar to shrubs. 4. Absolute rooting depths increased with MAP in all growth forms except shrubs and trees, but were not strongly related to potential evapotranspiration (PET). Except in trees, root systems tended to be shallower and wider in dry and hot climates and deeper and narrower in cold and wet climates. Shrubs were more shallowly rooted under climates with summer than winter precipitation regimes. 5. Relative to above-ground plant sizes, root system sizes decreased with increasing PET for all growth forms, but decreased with increasing MAP only for herbaceous plants. Thus relative rooting depths tended to increase with aridity, although absolute rooting depths decreased with aridity. 6. Using an independent data set of 20 test locations, rooting depths were predicted from MAP using regression models for three broad growth forms. The models succeeded in explaining 62% of the observed variance in median rooting depths. 7.

There were strong effects of nutrient addition on the above-ground biomass of both dominant (dwarf shrubs) and subordinate (grasses and mosses) plant functional groups, with responses by the latter being of greater magnitude. Responses to temperature were less frequent and of a smaller magnitude. 3. There were marked changes in the abundance of insect herbivores in response to the treatments. Changes in the above-ground biomass of subordinate plant species had a greater impact on the composition of the insect herbivore community than the smaller responses of dominant dwarf shrubs. For example, the abundance of a moss-feeding Heteropteran in fertilized plots was as little as 6% that of controls, while Homoptera specializing on grasses were over 400% more abundant. In addition, gramnivorous taxa (the Delphacidae) were present only in those plots that received nutrients. 4. Despite some species-specific effects of the perturbations on the quality of dwarf shrub annual shoots (defined as the concentrations of nitrogen and phenolic compounds), little change in leaf herbivory was observed. Insect herbivores removed less than 1% of annual biomass from dominant dwarf shrub species. 5.

Leaf life span (LL) and leaf mass per area (LMA) are fundamental traits in the carbon economy of plants, representing the investment required per unit leaf area (LMA) and the duration of the resulting benefit (LL). Species on dry and infertile soils converge towards higher LMA. It has been generally assumed that this allows species from low-resource habitats to achieve longer average leaf life spans, as LMA and LL are often correlated. 2. Leaf life span and LMA were measured for 75 perennial species from eastern Australia. Species were sampled from nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sites within high and low rainfall regions. LL and LMA were positively correlated across species within each site. In addition, evolutionary divergences in LL and LMA were correlated within each site, indicating that cross-species relationships were not simply driven by differences between higher taxonomic groups. 3. Within a rainfall zone, LL-LMA combinations shifted as expected along common axes of variation such that species on poorer soils had higher LMA and longer LL, but significantly so only at high rainfall. 4. Low rainfall species were expected to have shorter LL at a given LMA or, equally, require higher LMA to achieve a given LL, i.e. shift to a parallel axis of variation, and this was observed on both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils. On average, 30% higher LMA was seemingly required at dry sites to achieve a given LL. Thus, convergence towards higher LMA has different consequences for leaf life span in dry and nutrient-poor habitats. 5. The broad shifts in LL-LMA combinations between site types were also seen when comparing closely related species-pairs (phylogenetically independent contrasts) occurring on nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor soils (within each rainfall zone), and at high- and low-rainfall sites (at each soil nutrient level).",318,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Adaptation | Leaf life span | Phylogenetic analysis | Sclerophylly | Specific leaf area,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,54,NA,NA,NA,NA

Vegetation change induced by large herbivores is driven by the effects of grazers on populations of individual plant species. Short-term experimental or demographic studies may be insufficient when investigating the population responses of long-lived clonal plant species. 2. We therefore examined the effects of grazing on such a plant (Veratrum album) by comparing the spatial and genetic structure of populations in grasslands subject to long-term grazing or mowing for hay. 3. V. album is a locally dominant species that is avoided by large herbivores due to its toxicity. RAPD-phenotypes of a subsample of c. 50 shoots, and co-ordinates and dry weight of all shoots, were determined in a 5 Ã— 10 m plot in each of four meadow and four pasture populations. 4. The breeding system of the genus Veratrum was previously unknown but our experimental finding that cross-pollinated but not self-pollinated or unpollinated flowers produced as many seeds as freely pollinated flowers suggested that V. album is a predominantly cross-pollinating species. 5. Both the spatial and genetic population structure differed markedly between the two grassland types. Clonal expansion of established plants in pastures led to populations consisting of larger shoots that were significantly more aggregated at a small spatial scale. Populations also had a higher proportion of flowering shoots, less seedling recruitment and a lower genotypic diversity in pastures than hay meadows. 6. The differences in population structure appear to be due to hay meadow populations reproducing primarily by seeds, whereas clonal reproduction accounts for half of the population growth in pastures. We suggest that, as livestock selectively avoids V. album shoots, grazing indirectly promotes plant growth, which results in an enhanced vegetative reproduction as well as a higher seed production. Experimental studies are, however, needed to determine why and how grazing adversely affects seedling recruitment. 7.

Under fertilization, however, Betula produced much more primary stem growth than the other species, because axillary buds that would have grown as short shoots in control ramets were instead stimulated to produce long shoots (structural branches). There appeared to be a trade-off between allocation to length per stem segment and number of stem segments produced in a given year, for both Betula and Ledum. 3 Although secondary growth in stems is the largest component of above-ground net primary production in forests, it is often ignored in shrub-dominated ecosystems. We derived an expression for secondary growth in shrubs based on distributions of stem mass and length with age, and allowing for experimentally induced changes in secondary growth rate. 4 There was good agreement between measured ramet stem mass and calculated values for all three species, validating our mathematical analysis of secondary growth. 5 Fertilization greatly increased the relative rate of secondary growth only in Betula, consistent with observed accumulations of its stem mass in ecosystem-level quadrat harvests. Secondary growth of Betula was a major component of ecosystem NPP in fertilized plots and probably contributes significantly to ecosystem carbon storage. 6 The increase in its secondary growth enabled Betula to become dominant under fertilization, whereas the inability of older stems of Ledum to respond in this way prevented it from growing into the canopy.",128,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Arctic tundra | Betula nana | Carbon storage | Elevated temperature | Nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,59,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Separate analyses were performed for each life-history stage: seedlings, juveniles; pre-reproductives and reproductives, for a total of 55 analyses. Emergent patterns for stages were evaluated (Fisher's combined probability test) by combining years.

Up to 17 species were tested on peat with various natural substrates added and with different mire waters. In a field experiment, the effect of cover of nutrient depleted Eriophorum-litter was also tested. 3 There were large differences between substrates, and establishment appeared to be limited by the amount of phosphate released. Added moose dung or litter of Betula pubescens promoted establishment well above the low level seen on peat alone, or with added litter from Pinus sylvestris. 4 Species differed slightly in response to different mire waters and to added substrates, but these differences could not be attributed to the natural habitat of the species or their breeding system. There was a weak negative relationship between spore size and establishment success. 5 In the field experiment, about 1% of the sown, viable spores established in the presence of moose dung or Betula litter. With moose dung there was an indication that protonemata and plants of other bryophytes had a negative effect on the establishment of Sphagnum. 6 Nutrient release from litter and cover provided by vascular plants are needed to generate safe sites for the establishment of Sphagnum from spores, especially on wet, acidic and relatively nutrient-poor soils and peat.

We evaluated the responses of native grassland sods to a variety of types of disturbance in order to assess hypotheses about the competitive effects of established vegetation on seed germination and seedling establishment. In particular, we consider whether germination is more responsive to the magnitude and duration of vegetation removal (competitive release) or to individual disturbance types (specific effects). 2. Field-collected sods of coastal tallgrass prairie were subjected to no manipulation, cutting with clippings left, cutting with clippings removed (hayed), burning, and complete destruction of established vegetation under greenhouse conditions. The emergence and fate of seedlings, as well as light penetration through the canopy, were followed for a period of 4.5 months. 3. Total seedling emergence increased from cut to control, hayed, burned and plants-removed treatments. Several periods of increased seedling emergence suggested responses to both light penetration and seasonal change. 4. Species richness was lowest in cut sods and highest in sods that had plants removed or were burned. Rarefaction analysis showed that these differences were largely those expected from differences in seedling number, except for the cut treatment, which produced fewer species per seedling than other treatments. 5. Indicator species analysis and ordination methods revealed that seedling community composition overlapped strongly across all treatments, although the area of ordination space did increase with increasing numbers of seedlings. 6. Overall, most of the effects of disturbance could be explained by cumulative light penetration to the soil surface, an indicator of total competitive release, although a few specific effects could be found (particularly for the cutting treatment).

Vegetation - environment relationships are well understood at the geographical scale, but it is still not clear what role chance and historical contigency play in the assembly of communities from the local species pool. We addressed this question experimentally by comparing the performance of congeneric species introduced into a grassland community. 2. We used the National Vegetation Classification and distribution maps to define the local pool of grassland species suited to our experimental site. From this we selected five pairs of congeneric species. One member of each pair was native to the experimental site ('present' species) and one member was represented in the local species pool but absent from the community ('absent' species). 3. If community assembly processes are deterministic, then absent species should underperform present congeners. Any other result would imply that chance, dispersal limitation or historical contingency plays a role in community assembly. Our experimental arrangement allowed us to assess the consistency of comparisons across different grazing treatment combinations. 4. Two field experiments were undertaken. The first investigated the effects of dispersal limitation by introducing seed of congeners and monitoring performance. The second investigated the survival of congeners introduced as small plants at the early stages of growth in 'plugs'. A laboratory germination test and a combined analysis of both field experiments were also undertaken. 5. Some species showed markedly different responses from their congeners in the two field experiments. Overall, the present species did not consistently perform better than their absent congeners. This indicates that the study community bears the strong imprint of dispersal limitation or other historical factors, a finding consistent with results previously obtained for the same community using a trait-based model. 6. We conclude that the accuracy of predictions about community composition will be limited by the success with which factors such as propagule dispersal and differential effects of seed predation and herbivory can be modelled.

The density hypothesis predicts that more above-ground competition leads to mortality of small individuals of all species, and thus a random loss of species from plots. 2. Fertilizer was added to old field plots to manipulate both below-ground and above-ground resources, while shadecloth was used to manipulate above-ground resources alone in tests of these hypotheses. 3.

This was done to test whether vegetation composition was controlled by resource level alone (bottom-up control), herbivory alone (top-down control), or by both (interactive control). 2. The density of the major herbivore, the snowshoe hare, varied 25-fold, declining from 148 km-2 in 1990 to 8 km-2 in 1994, and increasing to a second peak of 198 km-2 in 1998. 3. In control plots most species were remarkably constant in percent cover.

Some species took up to 5 years before a response was detected. 4. Fertilization caused (i) a decline in the number of species, and species evenness in the community, (ii) a reduction in the proportion of woody species, and (iii) an increase in herbaceous dicotyledons and grasses. 5.

Spruce became dominant in the fifth stand (Blackwoods, Mount Desert Island) only in the last 2000 years. This is in contrast to pollen stratigraphies from two inland forest hollows and from inland lakes that indicate a significant region-wide increase in the abundance of spruce only 1000 years ago. 2. All five coastal pollen stratigraphies suggest that conditions along the east coast of Maine became cooler and moister sometime between 6000 and 5000 years ago. Mid-Holocene changes in vegetation and sediment accumulation correspond with the timing of rapid increases in tidal amplitude and diurnal mixing of cold water in the Gulf of Maine, suggestive that these resulted in increased marine effects on the local climate at a time that was generally warmer than present. 3. Two inland forest-hollow stratigraphies do not show evidence of mid-Holocene cooling. Coastal effects therefore persisted for several thousand years despite regional climate changes. 4. The pollen data suggest that refugia along the coast (and probably in isolated sites inland), may have played a critical role in allowing the rapid regional expansion of spruce around 1000 years ago. The steep increases in the abundance of spruce pollen in all forest-hollow and lake pollen stratigraphies in northern New England at that time corroborate other evidence of a region-wide shift to cooler and moister conditions. 5.

With increasing size, pools became deeper relative to their surroundings and more convoluted and elongated in shape. Pool orientation and bathymetry were related to direction of slope. Small pools were located on the periphery of a focus now occupied by the largest pools. Peat depth varied systematically across the complex, leading to changes in both direction and gradient of water flow. 4. The evidence suggests that pools formed initially where water tended to pond, and subsequently spread outward as the flat plateau expanded.

Traditional ageing differentially underestimates tree age; species classified as early successional (Populus tremuloides, Betula papyrifera, and Pinus banksiana) are less severely underestimated than those classified as mid- and late-successional (Picea glauca, Picea mariana, and Abies balsamea) (0-11 vs. 0-43 years), and also have relatively fewer locally missing growth rings.

Distance- and direction-dependent components were examined separately for both intra- and interspecific patterns. The significance of departures from randomness was determined using Monte Carlo techniques. 3. The smaller-scale data showed that all three species were significantly aggregated, Agrostis to a greater distance (8 cm) than Holcus or Lolium (4 cm). The intensity of aggregation decreased in the order Lolium > Holcus > Agrostis. The larger-scale data suggested that this aggregation extended to greater distances, and that it was most intense in Agrostis. 4. Despite the lack of visual directionality in the environment, Agrostis showed a directional pattern at both scales, with Lolium varying in the same direction at the larger scale. 5. Only Agrostis and Lolium showed a significant interspecific relationship (segregated to 2 cm at the small scale, but aggregated to 8 cm at the larger scale). There was no evidence of directionality in the interspecific components of pattern. 6. The nature of spatial structure appears to depend on the scale of observation, but the smaller-scale data are more likely to provide a biologically interpretable measure of local spatial structure in this community.",99,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Anisotropy | Plant community dynamics | Spatial aggregation | Spatial covariance functions | Spatial pattern,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,74,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Recent elevational range-margin performance of tree and shrub species was studied at a site in the Swedish Scandes. The methods included comparisons of historical and present-day range-margin records (m a.s.l.) in conjunction with age-determination of newly established saplings. 2. Since the early 1950s, the range-margins of Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa (mountain birch), Picea abies (Norway spruce), Pinus sylvestris (Scots pine), Sorbus aucuparia (rowan) and Salix spp. (willows) have advanced by 120-375 m to colonize moderate snow-bed communities. The non-native Acer platanoides (Norway maple) has become established just below the birch forest-limit. In concert with tree-limit rises by 100-150 m in the same region, the present results suggest a shift in reproduction and a significant break in the late-Holocene vegetation history. 3. Ring-counting (in 2000) of a subsample of the recovered saplings revealed that, with one exception, they were aged between 7 and 12 years, i.e. they germinated after 1987. Since 1988 there has been strong and consistent winter warming, with some very warm summers, and this may ultimately have forced the vegetational changes. 4. Reduced summer snow-retention has favoured seedling establishment and juvenile growth, and mild winters, with reduced risk of frost-desiccation, have enhanced survivorship and height increment. 5.

Alternatively, pronounced phenotypic plasticity in the response to temperature could enable individual clones to perform well over a wide range of environmental temperatures (i.e. high degree of thermal tolerance). 3 The overall pattern of thermal response was similar for all clones. In addition, we detected acclimative phenotypic plasticity in both physiological and morphological plant parameters. The optimum temperatures for gross or for net photosynthesis did not vary with growth temperature, but morphological acclimation partly compensated for the loss of photosynthetic capacity at higher temperatures, enabling comparable rates of ambient gross photosynthesis. Respiratory reactions also showed some degree of thermal acclimation to higher temperatures. 4 As a result of the combined effects of changes in morphology and physiology, all clones produced similar amounts of plant biomass over a relatively wide range of water temperatures.

The short- and long-term dynamics of Nothofagus pumilio were investigated across an altitudinal gradient in Tierra del Fuego. Declining probability of establishment of individuals with increasing altitude (spatial restriction) is expected to lead to increasingly sporadic recruitment towards the alpine timberline (AT) (temporal restriction). Longevity of adult trees and difficulties in establishment at altitude should result in a static AT. 2. The number of annual growth buds of seedlings suggests that the species regenerates episodically at all altitudes in cycles of a similar length (7-8 years) to those for seed production. Nevertheless, the seedling density in a year of high regeneration (1996) was considerably higher at lower altitudes than at the AT. 3. Counting of the growth rings of adult individuals revealed a massive episode of establishment between 1800 and 1850 at all altitudes. There was poor establishment between 1920 and 1980. The age range for the entire population fluctuated between 49 and 377 years in 1996. 4. Although there is no evidence for more frequent recruitment at lower altitudes, differential regeneration ensures that establishment there is more probable. 5.

In recent decades, foraging by increasing numbers of lesser snow geese has led to loss of vegetation and changes in soil conditions in marshes on the hudson bay coast. 2. Changes in species composition were recorded in areas unprotected from goose foraging and in exclosures of varying age (5-15 years) erected in intact swards and on bare sediments where foraging had occurred at la pÃ©rouse bay, manitoba. 3. In the supratidal marsh, plants failed to establish naturally in either open or exclosed (15 years) plots in bare areas. In moist intertidal soils, vegetative fragments of the asexual species puccinellia phryganodes readily established and formed a mat in exclosures (5 years). 4. Changes in species assemblages occurred over 11 years in exclosed and adjacent open plots in intertidal and supratidal marshes. Loss of vegetation cover and species richness, particularly dicotyledonous species, and the reversion of later successional plant assemblages to earlier successional assemblages occurred in open plots. In the absence of foraging, late successional graminoids and willow species replaced early successional graminoids. 5. Late successional grasses of the upper intertidal marsh died when transplanted into degraded soils but still survived after one season in control plots, suggesting that an early successional template is needed for establishment. 6. In the absence of goose foraging, natural re-vegetation by clonal propagation can occur only where edaphic conditions are suitable. Within exclosures, vegetation changes resemble those in undamaged areas where goose foraging pressure is still moderate. We propose a state and transition model for vegetation change in the system based on succession patterns, alternative vegetation states and geomorphological events.",68,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Alternate stable states | Arctic | Habitat degradation | Lesser snow geese,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,89,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Genetic differences among populations of a keystone species may affect ecosystem functional properties. We tested this by planting Spartina alterniflora from different geographical regions in a newly created salt marsh in Delaware, USA. 2. Spartina alterniflora plants from morphologically distinct short-form (back marsh) populations were originally collected from Massachusetts (41Â°34â€² N), Delaware (38Â°47â€² N), and Georgia (31Â°25â€² N) in the USA and vegetatively propagated for 6 years in a salt water-irrigated common garden in Delaware before transfer to a newly created salt marsh. 3. The magnitude of the expression of marsh functions in the created marsh, measured over 5 years, remained distinct in patches of each ecotype. End of season aerial biomass, below-ground biomass, root and rhizome distribution, canopy height, stem density, and carbohydrate reserves were closer to values reported for the plants' native sites than to those typical of Delaware. Thus, many of the plant features characteristic of particular latitudes appear to be under genetic control. Such ecotypic differentiation influences ecosystem function through keystone resource and keystone modifier activities. 4. Respiration of the microbial community associated with either dead shoots or the soil varied with plant ecotype in the created wetland and the patterns reflected those reported for their native sites. High edaphic respiration under the Massachusetts ecotype was correlated with the high percentage of sugar in the rhizomes. Edaphic chlorophyll was greater under the canopies of the Massachusetts and Delaware ecotypes than under the Georgia canopy and exhibited a relationship similar to that of algal production rates reported for the native sites. Larval fish were most abundant in pit traps in the Massachusetts ecotype.",111,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Community respiration | Ecotype | Edaphic algal chlorophyll | Fish larvae | Keystone species | Latitude | Marsh functions | Plant morphology,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,90,NA,NA,NA,NA

How fungicides affect growth and survival of the orchid Lepanthes rupestris in the field,Bayman P.,Journal of Ecology,00220477,90,6,1002-1008,2002-01-01,December 2002,10.1046/j.1365-2745.2002.00733.x,"1. Mycorrhizal associations of tropical, epiphytic orchids have been studied in vitro, but the importance of the relationship has not been demonstrated in the field. We investigated the effect of fungicide treatment on seedlings and juveniles of the lithophytic orchid Lepanthes rupestris. As mycorrhizas, endophytes and pathogens coexist in orchids, fungicide treatment might have either a positive or negative effect on growth and survival of plants. 2. The experimental design included benomyl-treated, propiconazole-treated, and control plots. Each treatment consisted of about 140 2 Ã— 2 cm plots divided among eight rocks, with one seedling or juvenile (occasionally two) per plot. Fungicides were applied every 2 weeks and plants were censused and measured every 3 months for 8-9 months. 3. Propiconazole-treated plants had higher mortality, significantly fewer leaves, significantly fewer fungal colonies in their roots, and significantly fewer degraded pelotons than did control plants. Benomyl-treated plants had significantly lower mortality than controls and significantly fewer fungi in leaves than control plants, and did not differ in number of degraded pelotons. There was little or no recruitment in any treatment. 4. Few potentially mycorrhizal fungi were isolated. Guignardia, Colletotrichum and Xylaria, which are generally endophytes, pathogens and/or saprotrophs, were more common. There was evidence of antagonism between Colletotrichum and Xylaria and between Colletotrichum and Guignardia. 5. Results suggest that fungi have both positive and negative effects on growth and survival of L. rupestris plants. However, conclusions about the importance of mycorrhizas are complicated by the simultaneous occurrence of a range of orchid-fungus interactions.",57,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Endophyte | Mutualism | Mycorrhiza | Orchidaceae | Rhizoctonia,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,91,NA,NA,NA,NA

Direct observations of long-term plant succession can be made using quantified plant macrofossil records from peat bogs, providing a means to re-evaluate theories of succession previously based on time-space substitution studies or field stratigraphic surveys. 2. Multiple successions from fen towards raised mire recorded at Crymlyn Bog demonstrate that divergent pathways exist, even when initial conditions are similar within a single bog. 3. Over time-scales relevant to the later stages of mire succession, allogenic forcing factors are significant and may be responsible for driving the direction and rate of species turnover in both forward and reversed hydroseral successions. 4. Differences in the local climatic regime may be responsible for the contrasting character of the mid- and late-Holocene transitional mire communities represented in Core CRB93 at Crymlyn Bog. 5. Plant macrofossil analyses show that Sphagnum is not always a dominant part of the mire community before the establishment of raised peats.

The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi colonizing plants at a woodland site in North Yorkshire (UK) have been characterized from the roots of five plant species (Rubus fruticosus agg. L., Epilobium angustifolium L., Acer pseudoplatanus L., Ajuga reptans L. and Glechoma hederacea L.), and identified using small-subunit rRNA (SSUrRNA) gene amplification and sequencing. 2. Interactions between five plant species from the site and four co-occurring glomalean fungi were investigated in artificial one-to-one AM symbioses. Three of the fungi were isolated from the site; the fourth was a culture genetically similar to a taxon found at the site. Phosphorus uptake and growth responses were compared with non-mycorrhizal controls. 3. Individual fungi colonized each plant with different spatial distribution and intensity. Some did not colonize at all, indicating incompatibility under the conditions used in the experiments. 4. Glomus hoi consistently occupied a large proportion of root systems and out-performed the other fungi, improving P uptake and enhancing the growth of four out of the five plant species. Only G hoi colonized and increased P uptake in Acer pseudoplatanus, the host plant with which it associates almost exclusively under field conditions. Colonization of all plant species by Scutellospora dipurpurescens was sparse, and beneficial to only one of the host plants (Teucrium scorodonia). Archaeospora trappei and Glomus sp. UY1225 had variable effects on the host plants, conferring a range of P uptake and growth benefits on Lysimachia nummularia and T. scorodonia, increasing P uptake whilst not affecting biomass in Ajuga reptans and Glechoma hederacea, and failing to form mycorrhizas with A. pseudoplatanus. 5. These experimental mycorrhizas show that root colonization, symbiont compatibility and plant performance vary with each fungus-plant combination, even when the plants and fungi naturally co-exist. 6. We provide evidence of physical and functional selectivity in AM. The small number of described AM fungal species (154) has been ascribed to their supposed lack of host specificity, but if the selectivity we have observed is the general rule, then we may predict that many more, probably hard-to-culture glomalean species await discovery, or that members of species as currently perceived may be physiologically or functionally distinct.",356,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Archaeospora | Glomus | Phosphorus | Plant growth | Scutellospora | Sequence diversity | SSUrDNA,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,94,all,All Open Access,NA,NA
