Despite the restricted geographical range of the species tested, the optimum constant temperature for germination varied considerably. For 17 of the species studied, it was between 20 and 25 °C while for three, germination was highest at 30 °C. Germination was virtually inhibited (<20%) for eight of the species at 10 °C and eight of the species at 30 °C. There was no clear division in temperature response between plants differing in habitat. For four out of 12 species tested, fluctuating temperatures (20/12 °C) resulted in significantly higher germination than the constant temperature treatment (20 °C), suggesting that field-germination would be favoured by disturbance to the canopy or soil. Speed of germination was negatively correlated with the logarithum of seed size. Most species lay in the range 3-15 d to reach 50% of final germination at their optimum temperature for germination. Germination was significantly suppressed in darkness for a large number of species, particularly for those with seed size less than c. 3 mg. When these were incubated under leaf-filtered light, germination was in most cases even more effectively suppressed. Most of these species are known to have large soil seed banks. Mechanical scarification improved germination over the control in nine species. Five of these also responded to heat or sulphuric acid scarification. Circumstantial evidence suggests that the species showing heat-induced germination may be fire adapted, although fire is probably a rare natural phenomenon in the Afromontane forest proper. Only one species, Bersama abyssinica, showed a classic recalcitrant behaviour. Germination dropped from 88% when the seeds were fresh to less than 20% after 1 mo of dry storage and 0% after 3 mo. Germinability of seeds of Ekebergia capensis also declined significantly with increasing storage time, although less rapidly; after 24 mo of dry storage, germination was 4%. In contrast, germinability of Juniperus procera was not significantly altered during 54 mo of storage. The results indicate that dormancy plays a major role in regulating germination in dry Afromontane species. Out of the 25 species studied, 15 (60%) showed some degree of initial dormancy. In most of the species with initially non-dormant seeds, dormancy would evidently be induced if the seeds are dispersed under a closed forest canopy or buried in the soil. These patterns of dormancy may have evolved in response to a highly unpredictable climate and small-scale disturbances, and should make the Afromontane forest flora relatively resilent also to anthropogenic disturbances.",19,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Dry storage | Light | Regeneration | Scarification | Speed of germination | Temperature,23435,NA,undefined,NA,0,FALSE,3,NA,NA

Many authors have proposed that Raphia taedigera Maur., the sole Neotropical representative of an otherwise African genus, has been introduced to the New World. Paleoecological data from a freshwater swamp in Nicaragua, which yielded R. taedigera pollen dating to 2800 ± 90 y before present (BP) and Raphia seed fragments from 2040 ± 60 BP are presented. These illustrate that Raphia taedigera arrived in the New World before trans-Atlantic trade by humans and thus arrived as a result of a natural phenomenon. The lack of differentiation of R. taedigera from the African sister taxon, R. vinifera, suggests recent separation of the two species (i.e. after the creation of the southern Atlantic Ocean by the splitting of West Gondwana). Other evidence supports dispersal of Raphia by ocean currents. The palm probably arrived from Africa by floating as an individual fruit or on a raft of vegetation.

Increment measurements, based on 4 or 5 y of growth, were arrayed in scatter diagrams against the midpoints of the growth intervals. A loess regression of the points, weighted for the higher mortality of slow-growing individuals, was then conducted to generate a 'best estimate lifetime growth trajectory' (BELGT) of a 'typical' individual surviving to maturity. The BELGT curves were integrated to generate a set of derived curves describing the time required by a 'typical' surviving individual to attain any given size up to the maximum for the species.

Both sites were mosaics of patches: the former showed soil patches of varying sizes subject to distinct flooding durations (from 0 to 300 d per year) and in the latter, the tank bromeliads which densely occupied the understorey, trap litter and provided 'suspended soil' patches. In the periodically flooded site, the occurrence of regenerants (< 1.0 m tall) of the actively regenerating tree populations of Calophyllum brasiliense, Symphonia globulifera and Tovomitopsis paniculata (all Clusiaceae), originating from seed or vegetative organs, was recorded for 1 m2 quadrats placed in flooded (n = 82) and unflooded (n = 103) patches. In the permanently flooded site, dominated by Tabebuia cassinoides (Bignoniaceae), the presence of germinated seedlings was counted for 400 rosettes of the terrestrial tank bromeliad Nidularium procerum. The results showed that unflooded patches, including tank bromeliads, favoured seedling establishment.

(Rosaceae), an uncultivated bramble widely distributed throughout southeast Asia - Malesia. Central goals were to determine whether apomictic propagation was detectable in R. moluccanus and to examine whether populations isolated on separate islands, or on mountain tops on a single island, were genetically differentiated. Sampling 22 individuals per population, the findings include: (1) no two individuals shared identical VNTR band profiles and thus apomictic propagation was not detected; (2) the mean number of bands scored per individual was 24.3 (SD = 3.91) and the proportion of polymorphic loci within populations ranged from 0.69 to 1.00 (mean = 0.86 ± SD = 0.085); (3) the average proportion of bands shared between individuals within populations ranged from 0.39 to 0.67 (0.50 ± 0.067), while average interpopulation similarity ranged from 0.21 to 0.50 (0.32 ± 0.092); and (4) estimated heterozygosity within populations ranged from 0.42 to 0.79 (0.62 ± 0.083), while interpopulation heterozygosity ran from 0.62 to 0.81 (0.74 ± 0.062). Permutation tests were used to estimate the statistical significance of differences in similarity between populations. A Luzon population isolated by 1200 km was always significantly different in similarity tests when compared with each of the other three populations, all located on Mindanao (and separated by at least 100 km but less than 250 km). Of the latter three, only one population differed significantly from the other two in the degree of VNTR markers shared, possibly reflecting biogeographic partitioning suggested for the island. Across all populations, average estimated Fst was 0.154, although mean inter-island Fst (0.224) was significantly higher than mean intra-island Fst (0.085). These results suggest that, while intra-island gene flow is relatively high, significant differentiation of tropical species may occur even over short distances on individual islands.

In contrast, at MSG C. canjerana diaspores were eaten by 14 bird species. At this area, the red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus, Vireonidae) was the most important seed disperser, but it was also a 'waster' which dropped seeds beneath parent plants, or carried them to sites unsuitable for germination. At PEI, exposed seeds on the forest floor were heavily preyed upon by rodents and insects. Insects destroyed mainly seeds deposited near to parent plants. Insect predation was less intense at MSG than at PEI. The rodent density at MSG was unusually small, and part of the post-dispersal seed predation may be done by terrestrial birds, such as doves and tinamous, which are especially common at MSG.

To expand our understanding of the role of fire in tropical dry forest, the physical and thermal properties of barks of tree species were studied to determine their relative resistances to cambial damage by fire. For 16 tree species found in the dry forest of the Lomerio region of eastern Bolivia, bark thickness, moisture content, and specific gravity were measured. Insulating capabilities of bark were measured by obtaining cambial and surface temperatures during experimental wick fires. Bark thickness on trees 5-100 cm dbh (diameter at 1.4 m) ranged from 2-51 mm and both thick- and thin-barked species were represented. For all species, bark thickness increased as stem diameter increased. Bark thickness explained more (63%) of the variation in peak cambial temperatures during fires than did bark moisture content (4%) or specific gravity (1%). A threshold bark thickness of 18 mm was associated with the ability to withstand lethal cambial temperatures during the experimental, low intensity fires. For 13 of the 16 species included in this study, trees ≤20 cm dbh have bark thickness below the threshold 18 mm and, therefore, are likely to experience cambial injury from low intensity fires.

Using previously published nest population data and fungus comb weights in relation to nest size, the expected gas production rates for intact nests were calculated. These estimates were compared with direct observations of the gaseous outflow from intact nests. The rates were in reasonable agreement, but some nests emitted excess carbon dioxide, probably produced by respiration of tree roots and non-termite soil organisms.

Falling litter may cover seeds and thereby enhance their survival by making their detection by seed predators more difficult. Tests were made to determine whether Astrocaryum murumuru and Dipteryx micrantha seeds survive better in microsites covered by leaf litter. Seed numbers and litter cover on the forest floor were experimentally manipulated. How natural variation in leaf litter cover and thickness affects seed and seedling survival of these two plant species was also examined. Seed survivorship was significantly higher for both plant species in microsites with leaf litter than in those with bare soil. Results from an experiment in which the litter was not disturbed showed that Astrocaryum seed survival was positively correlated with litter thickness (defined as the number of overlying dead leaves). Astrocaryum seedling survival was also significantly affected by leaf litter; more seedlings survived in shallow litter. Leaf litter had no effect on Dipteryx seedling survival.

Aboveground biomass C ranged from 70 to 179 Mg ha-1 and soil C from 125 to 257 Mg ha-1, and they represented the two largest C components in all plots.

Significantly more potential insect pollinators were trapped around the trunk flowers of two caulifiorous species than were caught around their canopy flowers. Trunk flowers were found to be larger than canopy flowers in four of the seven caulifiorous species studied, but they were smaller in one species. The higher probability of fruit set on trunks than in the canopy may have selected for cauliflory and subsequently increased trunk flower size in insect-pollinated understorey tropical trees. There was a tendency for flowers on the trunk not only to be larger but also to allocate relatively more dry weight to female parts and result in larger fruit than those in the canopy. These observations are consistent with Wallace's theory of the evolution of cauliflory, which argues that the condition arose in the dark understorey of the tropical forest, as a result of selection for trunk flowers which are more apparent to pollinators than are canopy flowers.

These were located primarily along one of the largest white-water tributaries of the Amazon (=Solimoes), the Jurua river. On average, terra firme forests contained twice as many primate species, lower population densities, and less than half of the total community biomass than did adjacent varzea forests. There was a clear habitat-dependent positive association among primate species, particularly within virzea forests, as well as marked shifts in guild structure between forest types. Species turnover between these two forest types involved primarily understorey insectivores (e.g. Saguinus sp.), which do not occur in seasonally inundated forest. These were consistently replaced by squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sp.), which are extremely abundant in annually flooded varzea forests. Similarly, large-bodied folivores such as red howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus) were uncommon or rare in terra firme forests, but very abundant in varzea forests, even though they are hunted less intensively in the former than in the latter. This can be largely explained by the nutrient-rich alluvial soils of young floodplains, compared to the heavily weathered terra firme soils occurring even within short distances of major white-water rivers.

Both species are heliothermic, basking to gain heat. Their association with open patches results from high activity temperature requirements in an environment where sun availability is low. Null temperature distributions from forest and treefalls showed that forest does not offer opportunities for heat gain similar to treefalls. Moreover, the large proportion of time spent basking by both species indicates the importance of these patches for thermoregulation. K. calcarata is slightly larger in body length and heavier at a given body length than M. nigropunctata.

The blackwater sites Lagos Amana, Iama and Tefe had a low turbidity (Secchi disc 2.0-2.2 m), a conductivity of 7-11 μS cm-1 at 25°C and a pH of 5.3-6.0.

Fish density within floating meadow was estimated during high water April and May 1994, and low water October 1994 and March 1995. During the high water season fish biomasses in blackwater lakes (31.1 g m-2) were significantly greater than those of either whitewater lakes (13.4 g m-2) or whitewater river channels (3.45 g m-2). At low water, in October, whitewater channels were generally found to hold the highest fish biomass (204 g m-2) although in March a blackwater site yielded the highest fish biomass recorded (285.9 g m-2). The amount of floating meadow habitat within whitewaters is however much greater than that in blackwaters. It is suggested that blackwaters may offer a stable habitat resulting in a high standing crop. In comparison, variation in conditions such as dissolved oxygen concentration in the whitewater may limit standing crop, but still allow periods of high productivity. Evidence was found for migration of fish from varzea lakes during periods of low oxygen availability.

The first 9 mo of 1991 were relatively dry (range 1027-1533 mm) with a total of 1157 mm at the reference site as compared to a long-term average of 1330 mm. Concentrations of all investigated constituents in bulk rainfall were low, except during the passage of cyclone Sine due to the deposition of large amounts of, especially, chloride, sodium and sulphate in sea spray. Concentrations of sodium and magnesium could be explained fully by maritime contributions to the rainfall composition at all sites. Maritime contributions to the concentrations of calcium, sulphate and potassium accounted for 10-40% of the total, whereas bicarbonate, ammonium, nitrate, silicon, aluminium, iron and manganese were derived exclusively from terrestrial sources. The annual atmospheric nutrient deposition rates were low by pantropical standards, particularly when the contribution of cyclone Sine was excluded. Annual totals (in kg ha-1) ranged from 2.4-8.8 for nitrogen, 0.4-1.1 for phosphorus, 2.3-4.9 for potassium, 1.41.9 for calcium and from 1.1-1.3 for magnesium.

Decomposition, nutrient release and rates of asymbiotic N fixation in Dicranopteris litter were determined over an elevational range of oligotrophic sites. 'Hot spots' of nitrogen fixation occurred in Dicranopteris litter, as evidenced by acetylene reduction rates as high as 22 nmol g-1 h-1. However, potential N fixation rates for the entire litter mass were 0-0.1 g m-2 y-1, less than other N inputs such as rainfall. Dicranopteris' decomposition rates were low compared to other tropical species, even under high temperature and rainfall conditions, with ≤50% of the original leaf and > 77% of the stem mass remaining after 2 y of decomposition. Slow decomposition was related to high lignin:nitrogen ratios (56-129) in litter and above-ground positioning of unabscised, decomposing litter.

Yet little is known about the demography and seed dispersal ecology of Bertholletia, particularly in natural stands which have not been previously harvested. This study presents data on the population density, spatial distribution, and seed dispersal ecology of Brazilnut trees at a pristine stand located within the Kayapo Indian Area of southeastern Amazonia, Para, Brazil. Brazilnut trees were primarily found within groves (castanhais) of 75 to 149 trees, with a few isolated trees in between. Although the density of trees ≤10 cm in diameter at breast height (hereafter, dbh) at two groves was 4.8 to 5.1 trees ha-1, the overall density for the entire study area of c. 950 ha was estimated at 1.3 tree ha-1. Within-grove nearest neighbour distances averaged 21 m and were markedly skewed towards even shorter distances. Seed dispersal experiments using 709 marked seeds indicated that this pattern can be largely explained by the highly restricted seed shadows imparted by the main seed dispersal agents of Bertholletia at this site, the red-rumped agouti (Dasyprocta leporina). Agoutis on average scatterhoard Bertholletia seeds to an average distance of 5 m, and rarely beyond 20 m, from seed stations. We suggest that, once edaphic and climatic conditions are suitable, the highly contagious spatial distribution of Bertholletia trees at the landscape level can be largely accounted for by the quantitatively dominant effect of short-distance dispersal by caviomorph rodents, and rare events of long-distance dispersal provided by other vectors.
