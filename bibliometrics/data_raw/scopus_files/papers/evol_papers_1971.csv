Their average sizes were greater than those of the parental forms. As observed in the parental forms, there were also correlations between total size and degree of differentiation of eyes of F1 hybrids. The largest were characterized by features which none of the parental forms possess (remains of outer nuclear and outer reticular layers, horizontal cells, lens rudiments). This proves again that the eye is a developmental unit, whose various structures are interdependent and whose degree of differentiation is correlated with size. Both are less dependent on which particular eye genes are present than on how many eye genes there are. As regards structure and size, the eyes of both parental forms exhibit practically no differences. Both cave populations possess more or less the same number of eye genes. The enlarged eye size of F1 hybrids demonstrates that both cave populations possess a rudimentary eye gene system, which because of separate evolution is partly non allelic. Random mutations are the basis of evolutionary processes, the number of degenerative ones thereby being higher than that of constructive ones. This must be interpreted as caused by the fact that within a balanced genic system for example as exhibited by the genic basis of eye development rise of disorder is far more likely than persistence of order. Usually degenerative mutations are eliminated by selection. In the case of an organ which has lost its function, however, it is not subjected to selection. Thus neither constructive nor degenerative mutations get lost. On account of their large number, degenerative mutations cause a preponderantly regressive development of the organs concerned. The type of reduction is determined by developmental interdependence within and between all structures of an organ. It is not the kind but the number of degenerative mutations which is decisive in determining the degree of differentiation and correlated size of an organ. Organs in which reduction has started are characterized by variability. This is diminished when at the end of a degenerative process there are only genes left which are connected pleiotropically to others. Rapidity of reduction which is probably high on account of the possibility of all mutations, the whole raw material of evolution, becoming expressed, is now diminished. A rudiment which is almost completely homozygous now will persist for a long time.",NA,NA,NA

While no new model or predictor of inbred state is presented it is shown that no existing model adequately predicts this population parameter. The simulation results are interpreted in the light of the age and fecundity distributions of the populations and it was found that the rate of inbreeding or effective size of a population is a function of the age distribution of proportionate reproduction. The simulation shows that highest rates of inbreeding, and presumably lowest effective number, are associated with high early fecundity and low average fecundity in later age classes.",NA,NA,NA

Natural selection has apparently included compensation in the resistance decreasing influence of increased diameter of the tracheal lumen. While antagonistic in regard to resistance, the increases in tracheal length and diameter in birds act synergistically in increasing the tracheal dead air space volumes of birds, which are 4 1/2 times those of mammals of equal body mass.

In this paper the paleontological evidence for dating the hominoid lineages leading to the Hylobatidae (gibbons and siamangs) and to Gorilla and Homo is presented. The dates of divergence based on paleontological data differ from those based on biochemical data by at most a factor of five. The discrepancy between the sets of dates can therefore be resolved by variation by a factor of at most five in the rate of protein evolution. The biochemical technique used to estimate dates of divergence of taxonomic groups measures the similarity of molecules. it is phenetic rather than phyletic. As time since divergence increases, phenetic comparisons increasingly underestimate the total amount of evolution that has occurred since divergence. Phenetic approaches to sequence data do not detect parallel fixations, fixations of back mutations, or alternative routes of fixing amino acid substitutions. The frequency distribution of fixations per codon, when these are phenetically inferred, can be well described by means of a Poisson distribution if the zero fixation category is adjusted to an optimal value. This suggests that molecular evolutionary events are equally likely to occur, and that protein evolution should occur at a constant rate. The frequency distribution of phyletically inferred fixations per codon, however, cannot be well described by a single Poisson distribution, even when the zero fixation category is adjusted. This suggests, as does a considerable body of other data, that molecular evolutionary events are not equally likely, and that rates of evolution of proteins may be expected to vary. Estimated dates of divergence older than dates used to calibrate phenetically based estimates tend to be too young, while dates younger than calibration dates tend to be too old. Dates of divergence of primate groups based on phenetic comparisons, if corrected for this effect, conflict with the best documented part of the primate fossil record, the later Hominidae, not with the less well established parts. It therefore seems prudent to accept the best paleontological dates for divergence of major primate taxa rather than to question them on the basis of the biochemical data. Branching sequences determined on the basis of biochemical data appear to be relatively reliable, but even these must be considered with caution.",NA,NA,NA
