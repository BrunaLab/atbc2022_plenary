This pattern of differential reduction can be explained by assuming that a proportion of the reduction that has taken place in the dentition has been secondary to skeletal reduction, through selection for harmony between size of teeth and size of jaws. Primary reduction of jaw size implies that the teeth were always genetically too large for the jaw in which they developed, and under such conditions of restriction were likely to have shown compensatory interaction due to competition for requirements necessary for growth. In order to explain differential reduction of tooth size in terms of selection for harmony between size of teeth and size of jaws it is necessary to show that genotypes with the potential to produce relatively large early and small late developing teeth were likely to have been favoured over genotypes with the potential to produce relatively small early and large late developing teeth. That is, it must be shown that the genotypically large early and small late combination results in a smaller combined phenotype, which is presumably better suited to a reduced jaw. A model that embodies these features is proposed. The model predicts that among populations of contemporary individuals greater compensatory interaction is associated with greater asymmetry of the late relative to the early developing teeth within a morphological class. A test of this prediction in twelve genetically different samples of mice showed a slight though non significant tendency in accordance with this prediction for the relationship between first and second molars in both the upper and lower jaws.",NA,NA

Heterokaryotypes and homokaryotypes were analyzed with respect to fecundity, longevity and egg to adult viability. Heterozygote superiority was observed for fecundity and longevity, but not for viability. The rank order of fitness with regard to fecundity and longevity was determined to be AR/CH > AR/AR > CH/CH. A comparison was also made between populations polymorphic for the reextracted AR + CH strains and monomorphic ones, by independently competing each population against a standard strain of Drosophila nebulosa.
