Here, we present a method for estimating the average vital rates that parameterize a demographic matrix using a series of measurements of population size and structure (an ""inverse problem"" of demographic analysis). We join a deterministic, density-independent demographic matrix model with a stochastic observation model to write a likelihood function for the matrix parameters given the data. Adopting a Bayesian perspective, we combine this likelihood function with prior distributions for the model parameters to produce a joint posterior distribution for the parameters. We use a numerical technique (Markov chain Monte Carlo) to estimate and analyze the posterior distribution, and from this we calculate posterior distributions for functions of the demographic matrix, such as the population multiplication rate, stable stage distribution, and matrix sensitivities. Although measurements of population size and structure rarely contain enough information to estimate all the parameters in a matrix precisely, our analysis sheds light on the information that the data do contain about the vital rates by quantifying the precision of the parameter estimates and the correlations among them. Moreover, we show that matrix functions such as the population multiplication rate and matrix sensitivities can still be estimated precisely despite sizable uncertainty in the estimates of individual parameters, permitting biologically meaningful inference.

However, little is known about winter demography because studies with temporal and spatial replication at the population level and an adequate sample of individuals with known fates within each population are rare. In this study, we monitored the winter demography of 48 local tundra vole populations introduced to experimentally enclosed plots the preceding spring for four years in Norway. The rate of population change over the winter (November-May) was density dependent due to recruitment. However, the large variation in the rate of change between the different winters was due to a density-independent, and most likely a climatically driven, variation in survival rate. In particular, mild weather that led to the formation of ice on the ground seemed to be detrimental for winter survival. We predict that if increased frequency of such events arose, due to climate change, normal cyclic dynamics of northern small rodent populations would be disrupted. We found support for the hypothesis that voles adjusted their body mass toward a certain mean during the winter so as to maximize winter survival: The survival rate of males was lower than that of females, possibly due to their larger body mass, and this resulted in female-biased population sex ratios in the spring. This result suggests a link between sexual selection (responsible for the sexual size dimorphism) and natural selection (operating though size-dependent winter survival) with implications for the demographic structure of the population.",183,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Body mass | Density dependence | Microtus oeconomus | Norway | Population cycles | Sex ratio | Survival rate | Tundra vole | Winter climate,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA,NA,NA

We quantified population-level impacts of floral herbivory by specialized insects on cobweb thistle (Cirsium occidentale var. occidentale) in a California coastal dune ecosystem, and then compared these demographic effects to those published for Platte thistle (Cirsium canescens) in similarly designed exclusion experiments in the continental sand dune ecosystem in the Great Plains. As a separate test of the strength of the seed-to-seedling linkage, we quantified seedling establishment rates in seed addition plots and compared these results to those obtained in herbivore exclusion experiments. This is the first test of direct vs. indirect methods of evaluating the potential impact of seed loss in plant dynamics. Floral herbivory on cobweb thistle in coastal dunes substantially reduced key components of plant fitness. Reduction of insect feeding within flower heads with insecticide increased mean per capita seed production by 144-316% and led to a 130-196% increase in cumulative seedling recruitment in the next generation, depending on dune habitat. Juvenile plant densities around insecticide-treated plants subsequently increased by >50%. Both seed and flower head addition experiments corroborated the seed limitation of recruitment and juvenile plant establishment for cobweb thistle; exclusion of postdispersal seed predators did not substantially alter this relationship. While seed addition results were qualitatively similar to herbivore exclusion results, seed addition overestimated the seed-seedling transition. These results are broadly parallel to those found previously for Platte thistle in continental dunes, where reduction of insect feeding in Platte thistle flower heads increased mean per capita seed production by 37-240%, depending on year and microhabitat. This reduction in seed translated into a 33-580% increase in cumulative seedling recruitment and juvenile plant density. Thus in both systems, insect exclusions demonstrated that floral herbivory limited numbers of seeds and seedlings and population density of juvenile plants.

In salt marshes on the Atlantic coast of the United States, a community-wide pattern exists in which 10 species of low-latitude plants are less palatable to a diverse suite of herbivores than are high-latitude conspecifics. Examination of proximate plant traits (toughness, palatability of polar and nonpolar extracts, nitrogen content) of high- and low-latitude conspecifics of nine plant species suggested that all these proximate traits had the potential to contribute to latitudinal differences in palatability of some plant species. Southern plants were tougher than northern plants (five species), had less palatable polar extracts (four species), and had lower N content (six species). Experimental evidence linking traits to latitudinal differences in palatability was strongest for polar extracts and lacking for N content. For one plant species, none of the traits we studied correlated with latitudinal variation in palatability. Because palatability differences may change when moving from fresh plants to freeze-dried plants to plant traits, studies of latitudinal variation in freeze-dried plants or plant traits are likely to under- or overestimate latitudinal variation in palatability of fresh plants.

To confirm this general observation and to explore the factors affecting habitat and host-plant use by this beetle, we collected data from 12 study sites in Finland during two consecutive gears. All sites included three habitats: (1) water, where the willows were growing in permanently waterlogged soils, (2) flood zone, where the willows underwent periods of flooding, and (3) dry zone, where the willows grew in well-drained soils. G. lineola was, on average, 16 times more abundant on willows growing directly from water as compared to willows in well-drained soils nearby. To explain this, we proposed three general hypotheses. (1) The food-quality hypothesis states that the apparently stressed willows growing in waterlogged soils provide superior food for the beetles. (2) The predation hypothesis states that open water surface around the willows in wetlands impedes dispersal of predators providing enemy-free space for the beetles. (3) The climate hypothesis states that wetlands provide better abiotic conditions for the adults, eggs, or larvae of this leaf beetle. These hypotheses were tested by using observational data and by performing both laboratory and field experiments. Contrary to the food-quality hypothesis, adult beetles preferred S. phylicifolia grown in dry habitats both for food and oviposition medium in the laboratory, and produced fewer eggs when fed on willow leaves from wetlands. Consistently, larvae performed poorly on leaves from wetland willows in the laboratory, most probably due to low water content of the leaves, also rich in phenolic secondary compounds and poor in nitrogen. The densities of crawling predators did not differ between the habitats, and the predation experiments revealed no difference in predation pressure between the habitats. However, during a rainless period, the first-instar larvae performed relatively poorly in drier habitats despite the high quality of food. When ramets of S. phylicifolia were exchanged between the habitats the first-instar larvae performed best in sunny wetland habitats on willows originally from dry sites. Spraying with water improved the performance of neonate larvae more on willows growing in dry habitat than on wetland willows. The results show that G. lineola does not attack S. phylicifolia growing in wetlands because of the superior food quality or lower predation pressure, but because of the strong affinity by adult beetles to the moist habitat where also the first-instar larvae, vulnerable to desiccation, usually perform best. An apparently ancestral physiological constraint hinders the beetles from using the best food resources and restricts their occurrence primarily to moist habitat patches with poor quality food and high risk of intraspecific competition.",21,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Abiotic habitat | Desiccation | Enemy-free space | Food quality | Habitat selection | Herbivory | Humidity | Predation | Salix phylicifolia | Secondary chemistry | Waterlogging | Wetlands,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,8,NA,NA,NA

To determine the relative roles of advanced recruits and seed banks in regeneration, we studied the demography of seedling cohorts of the deciduous canopy tree, Swida controversa, in an old-growth temperate forest in Japan. Five cohorts that germinated in 1988-1992 were followed for 10 yr, relating their survival and growth to the environment. We measured distance to the nearest conspecific adult, initial local density of conspecific seedlings, herbaceous plant coverage, light intensity, and soil water content. Seed production occurred only in 1988 and 1990, but seedlings emerged every year from 1988 to 1992. Only increasing distance to the nearest conspecific adult had a significant, positive effect on seedling survival. Damping-off by fungal pathogens was the most common cause of seedling mortality, especially near conspecific adults. Growth of seedlings was significantly and positively affected by light level; rapid growth occurred mostly in a large gap (∼200 m2). Even here, however, the growth rate of seedlings decreased over time. A stochastic simulation suggested that the relative importance of soil seeds and advanced recruits changes with the distance. In sites <25 m from conspecific adults, colonization of gaps should occur via the soil seed bank, because seedlings do not survive at these distances.

We mapped the distributions of A. agestis and A. artaxerxes at their range margins, where both species are restricted to isolated fragments of calcareous grassland containing the larval host plant Helianthemum chamaecistus. We present evidence that Aricia is likely to persist as metapopulations at its range margins. First, both individual habitat patches and semi-independent networks of patches showed colonizations and extinctions of Aricia. Second, the smallest and most isolated habitat patches were least likely to be occupied. Third, persistence was more closely related to the total area and configuration of habitat in each network (consistent with a metapopulation interpretation) than to the area of the largest patch (predicted for mainland-island systems). In addition, the occupancy of entire networks depended on their isolation from other networks, well beyond the empirically measured dispersal range of the species. We suggest that species may persist as ""metapopulations of metapopulations"" at coarse spatial scales. In some systems, all networks may be prone to extinction, but we suggest that regional persistence more often depends on the continued occupancy of extinction-resistant core areas (""core/marginal metapopulations"").

Maternal effects associated with herbivory could mediate induced defenses across generations of plants if damaged plants produce more resistant progeny than undamaged plants. I report that wild radish plants (Raphanus raphanistrum) damaged by herbivores (Pieris rapae) or treated with a chemical elicitor of induced resistance (jasmonic acid) during the vegetative growth stage, induced resistance of the plants' progeny compared to controls. Conversely, clipping of leaves with scissors, which results in loss of photosynthetic area but not induced resistance, tended to increase susceptibility of progeny plants to P. rapae compared to controls. Progeny plants exhibited further induced resistance when damaged as seedlings, although maternally induced plants were less inducible than maternal-control plants. Herbivory in the maternal generation also affected the growth of progeny plants in two ways: (1) seed mass, which was influenced by maternal herbivory, strongly positively correlated with early plant growth; and (2) when seed mass was accounted for, maternal herbivory still had an effect on plant growth, but these effects varied by plant family. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the defensive phenotype of plants is determined, in part, by the maternal environment, and that this allocation can affect the growth trajectories of progeny.",139,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Herbivory and maternal effects | Jasmonic acid | Pieris rapae | Plant-insect interactions | Transgenerational adaptive plasticity | Wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum),20308,undefined,0,FALSE,14,NA,NA,NA

We examine the performance of principal coordinates analysis with different choices of the resemblance function and different types of a single underlying gradient. Whereas unimodal species response to long gradients always leads to horseshoe (or arch)-shaped configurations in the first two dimensions, the converse is not true; curvilinear arrangements cannot generally be explained by the Gaussian model. Several resemblance coefficients widely used in ecology produce paradoxical arches from perfectly linear data. Species richness changes alone may also lead to a horseshoe for even more distance functions, with the noted exception of Manhattan metric. The appearance of arches is a mathematical necessity in these cases; true artifacts are introduced only if distances are treated inappropriately before eigenanalysis. Examples illustrate that similar configurations (curves and even circles) may arise from very different data structures; therefore the shape of the point scatter is insufficient by itself to identify background ecological phenomena. The horseshoe effect may be diminished and eigenvalue extraction may be made more efficient if input measures are raised to high powers; but this operation is recommended only in combination with standard analyses, as part of a comparative approach. We derive a new distance function, implying standardization by species totals, from the chi-square distance.

Heliothis subflexa Guenee is a specialist on plants in the genus Physalis, while Heliothis virescens Fabricius is an extreme generalist. In North America, these species serve as the only known hosts for the specialist parasitoid Cardiochiles nigriceps Vierick; oviposition into Helicoverpa zea, a non-host, does occur but results in lethal encapsulation of C. nigriceps' eggs. Heliothis virescens larvae are parasitised by C. nigriceps far more frequently than are H. subflexa larvae. Parasitoid attraction to volatiles emitted by tobacco in response to herbivory by H. virescens has previously been demonstrated. Using field experiments, we examined the possibility that pre-detection defenses against parasitoid attraction to herbivore-induced plant volatiles are responsible for H. subflexa's relatively low rates of parasitism by C. nigriceps. Herbivore-damaged plants were significantly more attractive to C. nigriceps than were larvae, larval frass, larval saliva, or damaged leaves alone. Plant species affected parasitoid attraction: tobacco was the most preferred plant species, followed by Physalis angulata, and then cotton. The parasitoid was also more attracted to host species (H. subflexa and H. virescens) than to the non-host species, H. zea. There was an interaction between plant species and herbivore species: each plant species was most attractive when infested by its typical herbivore (e.g., H. virescens on tobacco). We compared these data with those of a previously published experiment on field parasitism of H. virescens and H. subflexa, conducted at the same time and place. Our results indicate that differences in parasitoid attraction to herbivore-induced plant volatiles do not contribute to H. subflexa's relatively low parasitism rate. For the generalist, H. virescens, rates of attraction correspond with rates of parasitism; for the specialist, H. subflexa, they do not. Attraction to H. subflexa on P. angulata is greater than to H. virescens on P. angulata, yet parasitism of H. subflexa is much less than parasitism of H. virescens.

Rodents removed simulated wind-dispersed Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi) and sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana) seeds significantly more rapidly in mast years than in the non-mast year. Radioisotopes were used to follow the fates of individual pine seeds taken from three source trees.

Mean dispersal distances of seeds in primary caches were 5.9 and 4.6 m (28.6% and 22.1%) farther in the two mast years than in the non-mast year. Rodents often excavated cached seeds and moved them to new sites (secondary caching). During mast years, some seeds were found in as many as three cache sites, but during the non-mast year, the level of secondary caching approximately tripled, with some seeds being found in five or six separate cache sites. Large seed crops were associated with reduced secondary caching of seeds, reduced seed consumption, and greater seed survival in the following spring.

Although precise mechanisms to account for such phenomena are not fully known for all plant species, a combination of theoretical and empirically driven mechanisms often resolves this paradox. Here, we couple a series of direct and indirect field and laboratory exercises on one marine macrophyte, Zostera marina L. (eelgrass), to measured distances between new patches and established beds in order to elucidate the long-distance dispersal and colonization potential of this marine seagrass. Detached, floating reproductive shoots with mature seeds were found to remain positively buoyant for up to 2 wk and retain mature seeds for up to 3 wk before release under laboratory conditions. Analysis of the detritus wrack along a remote shoreline found reproductive fragments with viable seeds up to 34 km from established, natural beds. Analysis of different regions of the Chesapeake Bay and coastal bays of the Delmarva Peninsula that once supported eelgrass populations, revealed natural patches at 13 sites ranging from 1 to 108 km from established populations. A combination of tidal currents and wind influences has the potential to move a passive particle at the surface (e.g., a floating reproductive fragment) up to 23 km in a 6-h tidal window suggesting that most unvegetated areas in this region that can support eelgrass are within the colonization potential envelope. We suggest that, when combined with earlier work on seed dispersal ecology of this species, eelgrass has strong qualities for high colonization potential of new habitat. The finding of natural patches at such great distances from established beds when studied in the context of the dispersal mechanism (currents and wind) make the dispersal distances of this species one of the highest for angiosperms, comparable in scale to mangroves and coconuts.

Second, habitat fragmentation in dendritic landscapes has different (and arguably more severe) consequences on fragment size than in either linear or two-dimensional systems, resulting in both smaller fragments and higher variance in fragment size.

The community that occurs in a given site is proposed to be stochastic and dependent on the size of the original disturbance and subsequent recruit availability. Large disturbances are postulated to be dominated by mussel beds and barnacles with widely dispersed larvae, whereas smaller disturbances are dominated by seaweeds, with limited dispersal. Positive feedbacks are proposed to maintain these two communities. We tested this hypothesis in a tidal estuary in central Maine. At eight mussel bed and eight seaweed canopy sites, we created 9-m2 and 1-m2 clearings and an unmanipulated control area, and in each plot established control, caged, and cage control quadrats. After three years of monitoring, our results do not support the alternate stable state hypothesis. Instead, they suggest that the occurrence of mussel beds and seaweed canopies is highly deterministic. Seaweed canopies dominate habitats with relatively little water movement, whereas mussel beds dominate habitats with high flows; and largely independent of disturbance size, mussel beds and seaweed canopies rapidly returned to their original community type, but only in the absence of consumers (crabs and snails). With consumers present, neither community showed significant signs of recovery, even after three years. In the presence of consumers, community recovery appears to be dependent on cracks and crevices providing refuges from consumers to seaweed and mussel recruits. The idea that natural communities may represent stochastically determined alternate stable states has important implications for understanding and managing natural ecosystems, but the very existence of alternate stable states in nature has been difficult to establish. Our results suggest that intertidal seaweed canopies and mussel beds in tidal rivers in the Gulf of Maine are highly deterministic alternative community states under consumer control.

Temporary emigration can be viewed more generally as involving transitions to and from an unobservable state, and frequently the state itself is one of biological interest (e.g., ""nonbreeder""). Development of models that permit estimation of relevant parameters in the presence of an unobservable state requires either extra information (e.g., as supplied by Pollock's robust design) or the following classes of model constraints: reducing the order of Markovian transition probabilities, imposing a degree of determinism on transition probabilities, removing state specificity of survival probabilities, and imposing temporal constancy of parameters. The objective of the work described in this paper is to investigate estimability of model Parameters under a variety of models that include an unobservable state. Beginning with a very general model and no extra information, we used numerical methods to systematically investigate the use of ancillary information and constraints to yield models that are useful for estimation. The result is a catalog of models for which estimation is possible. An example analysis of sea turtle capture-recapture data under two different models showed similar point estimates but increased precision for the model that incorporated ancillary data (the robust design) when compared to the model with deterministic transitions only.

Assimilation experiments quantified the digestibility of 32P-labeled resources. Daphnia growth was much lower on resources from deep compared with shallow lakes (0.13 ± 0.01 d-1 and 0.30 ± 0.03 d-1, respectively) but was independent of resource concentration. Growth was negatively correlated with the resource C:P ratio, but the relationship was not causal as responses to the P supplement were very weak. Adding EFA also produced weak responses. In contrast, supplements of readily digested algae stimulated moderate (P-deficient) and strong (P-rich) increases in growth that accounted for growth variation among the lakes. Changes in Daphnia P balance were also contrary to P limitation. In all, our growth assays implicate energy limitation unrelated to food concentration and, therefore, support the digestion resistance hypothesis.

Seabirds have provided evidence for the hypothesis that food depletion due to intraspecific competition explains variability in colony size. However, the predictions derived from this hypothesis have not been fully tested due mainly to the difficulties in measuring food availability in marine environments. We measured stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ15N) and carbon (δ13C) in the blood of Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus), which reveal information about their consumed prey and foraging habits. We tested if conspecific competition causes food depletion, affecting penguin breeding performance and, ultimately, the size of the colonies, Blood δ15N values of adults and chicks significantly decreased with increasing size of their colonies and with the number of conspecifics breeding within the parental foraging ranges. This suggests that high breeding densities provoke the depletion of high-quality prey (mainly anchovy). We also found positive relationships between δ13C values and density of conspecifics within the parental foraging ranges, indicating that when competition for food is high, individuals tend to feed closer to the colony on prey of lower quality. Adult δ15N values were positively correlated with breeding success at the colonies, which was negatively correlated with the density of conspecifics within foraging ranges.

However, studies integrating responses at different levels of the community trophic structure are lacking. We report here the consequences on the soil microarthropod community of a four-year, multivariate, climate-manipulation experiment carried out over vegetation near Palmer Station, Anvers Island, western Antarctic Peninsula. The experiment used a multifactorial randomized-block design, deploying filters to raise temperatures and reduce ultraviolet (UV)-B (280-320 nm) or both UV-B and UV-A (320-400 nm) radiation of existing vegetation, with further water and fertilizer amendment treatments. Seven microarthropod species recovered in sufficient numbers for statistical analyses showed considerable spatial aggregation independent of treatment, a feature typical of many soil invertebrates. Analyses using negative binomial generalized linear modeling identified further significant and consistent treatment impacts on both individual species and species groups. Relative to controls, manipulations increasing temperature decreased numbers of microarthropods (particularly Collembola), as did exposure to near-ambient levels of UV radiation (separate significant effects for both UV-A and UV-B), while water amendment increased numbers. The impacts of temperature and water are consistent with our understanding of the importance of these two environmental variables and their interaction in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems.

We crossed detritus-addition with predator-removal treatments in replicated 8 x 8 m open and fenced plots of cucumbers and squash. Collembola, a major detritivore, became 2-4 times more abundant in detritus-addition than control plots; densities of other detritivores also increased.

This result contrasts with predator-removal experiments in previous years in the same study area, which revealed strong cascades affecting cucumber yield.

Here, using a combination of field experiments and observations we examine interactions among introduced species in New England kelp forests and ask whether these interactions have altered paradigms describing subtidal communities in the Gulf of Maine. The green alga Codium fragile was observed at the Isles of Shoals, Maine, USA, in 1983 and has since replaced the native kelp as the dominant seaweed on leeward shores. Experiments manipulating kelp and Codium reveal that Codium does not directly inhibit growth or survival of kelp. Codium does, however, successfully recruit to gaps in the kelp bed and, once established, inhibits recruitment of kelp. A second nonindigenous species, Membranipora membranacea, grows epiphytically on kelp, and experiments reveal that the presence of Membranipora reduces growth and survival of kelp, resulting in defoliation of kelp plants and gap formation in kelp beds. In the absence of Codium, kelp recolonizes these gaps, but when present, Codium colonizes and prevents kelp recolonization.

In addition, subsidies may have indirect effects on the in situ prey of these consumers. These indirect effects can be either negative (e.g., apparent competition) or positive (e.g., via diet shifts) depending on the relative strength of the predator's functional and numerical responses to prey subsidies. Here we report a numerical response by a lizard (Western fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis) to experimental reductions in the flux of river-derived insects. Initially, equal densities of lizards declined significantly faster in plots in which aquatic insect abundance was reduced by nearly 50% (season average) relative to controls. Abundance and biomass of terrestrial arthropods declined significantly between the start and end of the experiment across treatments. Despite consistently lower lizard abundance in plots with reduced subsidy levels, however, relative declines in the abundance and biomass of in situ terrestrial arthropods (all taxa combined) were not significantly different between reduced- and ambient-subsidy plots. Relative declines in spider biomass differed significantly between treatments and were higher in reduced-subsidy than ambient-subsidy plots, but only over one of three 3-wk sampling intervals. Thus, over the biologically active summer season, aquatic subsidies exerted brief positive or no significant indirect effects on the in situ prey of riparian lizards.

Nonlinear time-series analysis revealed that wolves display phase-dependent dynamics with stronger density dependence during the decline phase than during the increase phase. This phase dependence was also reflected in predation rates: the number of moose killed daily by wolves was greater during the wolf increase phase than during the wolf decline phase. Accordingly, moose displayed multi-annual cycles generated by an interaction between weak self-regulation and strong delayed density dependence during periods of wolf increase, and strong self-regulation with negligible delayed density dependence during periods of wolf decline.

Yasuní National Park, near the equator in eastern Ecuador, has one of the most diverse tree communities in the world. Manu National Park, at 12°S in Peru's Madre de Dios region, is only moderately diverse by upper Amazonian standards. Following the field inventories, a database of morphological, ecological, and other traits was compiled from the taxonomic literature for 1039 species from the plots. Our goals were (1) to describe how terra firme tree communities at the two sites differed in composition, diversity, and structure; (2) to characterize the ""extra"" species responsible for the higher diversity at Yasuní; and (3) to assess, in the light of those observations, some explanations for why forests near the equator are so diverse. Yasuní has ∼1.4 times as many tree species as Manu at all three spatial scales we examined: local (1 ha), landscape (<10000 km2), and regional (<100000 km2). Yasuní samples contain more families and genera, more individual trees per unit area, and a larger proportion of small trees. Tree species at Yasuní have smaller stature, larger leaves, larger seeds, and smaller geographic and altitudinal ranges than those at Manu, and disproportionate increases in species diversity are observed within the Myrtaceae, Lauraceae, Melastomataceae, and several other families. Community structures were strikingly similar, with the same species (Iriartea deltoidea, a palm) dominating both sites at identical densities. Common species at Yasuní occur at the same densities as equally ranked species at Manu, but there are substantially more very rare species at Yasuní. The poorer tree flora is not a nested subset of the richer tree flora, though a majority of species in each inventory do occur at the other site. Several models that offer explanations for geographic variation in tropical tree species diversity are assessed in light of these data. Most do a poor job of accounting for the patterns revealed by the inventories. We speculate that the most important factor in producing the higher diversity in Yasuní is its rainier, aseasonal climate, and we discuss two specific rainfall-related mechanisms that appear to be supported by the data: (1) year-round water availability allowing more species to persist in the understory at Yasuní and (2) a newly described ""mixing effect"" related to the higher stem density there.",115,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,"Amazon basin | Ecuador | Manu National Park, Peru | National Park, Ecuador | Peru | Species diversity | Tropical forests | Tropical trees | Yasuní",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,36,NA,NA,NA

One of many ways to represent the influence of predator density is ratio-dependent predation, where kill rate depends on the ratio of prey to predator rather than the actual numbers of prey and predator. Determining the role of ratio dependency in predation theory has been contentious. Assessments of the influence of predator density on kill rate have been primarily limited to theoretical considerations, indirect evidence, and simplified laboratory demonstrations. We directly observed the influence of both prey and predator density on kill rates in an unmanipulated terrestrial system of large mammals wolves (Canis lupus) and moose (Alces alces). Predator density explained more variation in kill rate than did prey density (R2 = 0.36 vs. R2 = 0.17, respectively). Moreoven the ratio-dependent model greatly outperformed the prey-dependent model. Nevertheless, the ratio-dependent model failed to explain most of the variation in kill rate (i.e., R2 = 0.34).

The most commonly suggested mechanisms to explain spatial synchrony include dispersal and regional stochasticity (i.e., ""the Moran effect"").

We used a recently developed statistical method (the nonparametric covariance function) for quantifying the magnitude and spatial range of synchrony in both outbreak and corresponding weather data. The varying dispersal capabilities of the species enabled us to speculate on the relative importance of dispersal vs. the Moran effect as potential mechanisms behind the observed patterns. Our results indicated that spatial synchrony was not directly associated with dispersal capabilities at the spatial scales considered. In contrast, the spatial correlation in weather variables was high enough to account for the levels of synchrony observed in the outbreak data. Therefore, the Moran effect appeared to be the more dominant process affecting the spatial dynamics of these species at the landscape scale. In general, however, the synchrony in outbreaks declined more steeply with geographical distance than the correlation in the weather variables, breaking with the predictions of Moran's theorem. A more detailed analysis of gypsy moth outbreak data showed that local dynamics varied considerably in a spatially dependent manner. The existence of such variation violates one of the assumptions of the Moran's theorem, namely, that the dynamic properties of disjunct populations are identical.

ANOVA showed a modest increase in bird density at the wood side of the ecotone, which may be partly due to sampling biases rather than to some inherent habitat value in the ecotone. The outstanding pattern was that bird density and species richness in the wood habitat were twice as high as in the heath habitat.

Such ontogenetic bottlenecks are common in piscivorous fish because competition with future prey may retard growth and prevent a size advantage. In pikeperch (Stizostedion lucioperca), year class strength of 0+ cohorts is highly variable and positively related to early onset of piscivory. To identify the causes of this pattern, we experimentally quantified size-dependent planktivorous and piscivorous foraging capacity and incorporated the data into a growth model. For any given prey type and size, foraging capacity described a hump-shaped relationship with predator size. Foraging capacity on daphnids peaked at a pikeperch length of 66 mm, suggesting a narrow scope of planktivory. The highest capacity in the piscivorous niche was reached at a predator-to-prey length ratio of 5, where the ratio was an integrated measure of predator size over several prey sizes. With the growth model, we derived size distributions of 0+ cohorts as functions of resource levels. Simulations revealed two major determinants for the year class strength of pikeperch. First, discontinuous availability of prey sizes counteracted switching to piscivory within the first growing season. This was accentuated by prey fish growth, which caused the planktivory and piscivory niches to separate over time and limited the time window when diet shift was possible. Second, the hump-shaped relationship between size and foraging capacity resulted in growth reduction when growing out of the planktivorous niche. Switching to piscivory in our model occurred along a perpendicular relationship between fish prey and zooplankton density. Zooplankton density determined whether pikeperch reached a size advantage over prey, and fish prey density affected whether the foraging return of piscivory was higher than planktivory. Individuals not reaching a size advantage over prey and failing to become piscivorous were stunted at a size when consumption balanced metabolic requirements. Piscivorous individuals, however, continued to grow fast throughout the season by feeding on the wave of the prey cohort. Our results highlight the importance for predators that shift diet to be synchronized with fluctuations in resource availability, such as the pulses of new cohorts of prey fish.",56,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Growth model | Ontogenetic diet shift | Pikeperch | Piscivory | Planktivory | Size-based model | Size-structured population | Stizostedion lucioperca,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,44,all,All Open Access,NA

Calendula arvensis starts flowering when pollinators are still scarce. Mean temperature of the inflorescence surface was positively related to solar radiation and was 2°C higher than the surrounding air. Inflorescences proved to be heliotropic, traversing a 19° mean arc from east to west every day, and maintaining excess temperature during the period of maximum sunshine. Calendula arvensis showed high fruit production by self pollination. Neither fruit production nor fruit mass was limited by pollinators, but pollen germination was heavily limited by temperature. The optimum range for germination in the laboratory was 25-40°C. Under natural conditions, the temperature on C. arvensis heads surpassed the minimum threshold for optimum pollen germination only during the period of maximum sunlight (midday). Usia aurata adults only foraged on C. arvensis heads, they only moved to feed, and they flew from head to head when sunshine was intense. In the laboratory, the temperature at which insects were able to fly ranged from 22° to 31°C for females, and between 21° and 31°C for males. No efficient physiological ability for thermoregulation was found either in females or in males, although females were able to warm themselves slightly. Nevertheless, heat captured passively on C. arvensis inflorescences was sufficient to reach the flying temperature range. Fly behavior on inflorescences also depended on their surface temperature: the higher is the temperature on heads, the longer the time spent feeding, and the shorter the period spent basking. The role of solar warming of heads in plant reproductive fitness was related to stimulation of pollen germination rather than to pollinator attraction. The optimal temperature range for pollen germination overlapped with optimal temperature range for insect flying.

We measured euphotic zone GPP and CR along a latitudinal (40°N-30°S) transect across the Atlantic Ocean, which included two open-ocean oligotrophic provinces: the eastern area of the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (NAST-E) and the center of the South Atlantic Gyre (SATL).

While characters that contribute to resistance, such as secondary chemicals and trichomes, are relatively well understood, characters that contribute to a plant's ability to tolerate damage have received much less attention. Using Helianthus annuus (wild sunflower) and simulated damage of Haplorhynchites aeneus (head-clipping weevil) as a model system, we examined morphological characters and developmental processes that contribute to compensatory ability. We performed a factorial experiment that included three levels of damage (none, the first two, or the first four inflorescences were clipped with scissors) and eight sires each mated to four dams. We found that plants compensated fully for simulated head-clipper damage and that there was no variation among plant families in compensatory ability: seed production and mean seed mass did not vary among treatments, and sire X treatment interactions were not significant. Plants used four mechanisms to compensate for damage: (1) Clipped plants produced significantly more inflorescences than unclipped plants. Plants produced these additional inflorescences on higher order branches at the end of the flowering season. (2) Clipped plants filled significantly more seeds in their remaining heads than did unclipped plants. (3) Clipped plants, because they effectively flowered later than unclipped plants, were less susceptible to damage by seed-feeding herbivores other than Haplorhynchites. (4) In later heads, seed size was greater on clipped plants, which allowed mean seed size to be maintained in clipped plants. Although there was genetic variation among the families used in this experiment for most of the characters associated with compensation for damage (seed number, mean seed size, mean flowering date, length of the flowering period, and branching morphology), in analyses of these characters, no sire X treatment interactions were significant indicating that all of the families relied on similar mechanisms to compensate for damage.",61,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Haplorhynchites aeneus | Helianthus annuus | Herbivory | Mechanisms of compensation | Mechanisms of tolerance | Plant-herbivore interactions,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,47,all,All Open Access,NA

We studied the spread of a fatal nonnative root pathogen, Phytophthora lateralis, across a heterogeneous landscape of its host, Port Orford cedar (Chamaecyparis lawsoniana). Within our 37-km2 study area in southwestern Oregon and northwest California, Port Orford cedar populations are generally restricted to riparian zones along creeks. The pathogen is spread between watersheds in two ways: (1) by spore-infested material being dislodged from vehicles, and (2) by animals or people moving infested mud (i.e., via foot traffic). Using dendrochronological techniques, we determined the date of infection for dead cedars and reconstructed spread history across our study area from 1977 to 1999. Twenty-six of the 36 (72%) separate infection events we identified were caused by dispersal via vehicles along roads, and the remainder by foot traffic. Survival analysis demonstrated that cedar populations in creeks crossed by roads were more likely to be infected than those creeks that were not crossed by roads. Also, a comparison of minimum dispersal distances showed infections that moved via road moved significantly farther than those vectored by foot traffic, and the distance infection traveled declined significantly through time. We also coupled our spread history with measures of landscape and host features, including abundance of potential host trees, the distance from the road surface to the nearest potential host, length of road in immediate contact with the riparian zone, catchment area (a measure of stream flow), elevation, slope, and solar radiation. Our results show that catchment area, host abundance, and proximity to the nearest tree are significantly and positively associated with infection risk.

Over five control years, 61% of 515 sparrow nests were parasitized at three riparian study sites. When we removed female cowbirds from two of these sites, parasitism fell to 43% of 65 nests at Westham in 1996, to 30% of 117 nests at Westham in 1997, and 18% of 78 nests at Delta in 1998.

A potential drawback of this and other ant-plant mutualisms is that ant-guards may drive away useful, insects, particularly pollinators. We assess the potential for ant-pollinator conflict in a Mexican ant-acacia, Acacia hindsii. This Acacia is guarded by a highly aggressive ant (Pseudomyrmex veneficus), which resides entirely within the host plant canopy and is provided with extrafloral nectar and protein-rich Beltian bodies. Acacia hindsii flowers released their pollen from 0700 to 0830 hours, and were visited by pollinators from 0730 to 1300 hours. Over the same time period ants maintained high activity levels at extrafloral nectaries on young leaves. Although daily activity of ants and pollinators overlapped substantially in time, it was largely separated in space: resources exploited by the ants are predominantly concentrated within new growth, while inflorescences are present only on shoots from the previous year. Ants nevertheless visit extrafloral nectaries on older leaves near inflorescences, and there is thus potential for ant-pollinator conflict. Bioassays of ant behavior showed young A. hindsii inflorescences induce an avoidance response in its ant-guards, which reinforces spatial segregation between ants and pollinators. This effect is absent from buds or postreproductive flowers. Young flowers of two non-myrmecophilous Acacia species also induced significant (though less potent) repellent effects, suggesting a general role for ant-repellents in Acacia, with selective enhancement in myrmecophilous species.",84,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Acacia hindsii | Ant-plant | Ant-pollinator conflict | Ant-repellent | México | Mutualism | Pollination | Pseudomyrmex veneficus,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,50,NA,NA,NA

The fraction of bulk DOC contributing to microbial metabolism was assessed in five streams representing the regional range in surface-water DOC concentration in eastern New York State, USA (range 0.5-7.7 mg/L; n = 82). Transects of shallow wells along two hyporheic flowpaths (i.e., saturated sediments found below and lateral to the open-stream channel in active exchange with surface waters) in each of five streams were sampled monthly at baseflow to determine changes in subsurface DOC and dissolved oxygen concentrations. Hyporheic DOC concentrations ranged from 50% to 100% of surface-water concentrations and decreased along hyporheic flowpaths in four of five streams. Dissolved oxygen losses along hyporheic flowpaths paralleled DOC loss, and bacterial activity on tiles incubated at points along the flowpaths generally declined as hyporheic DOC was depleted. DOC losses along natural flowpaths exceeded the quantity of DOC lost during laboratory bottle incubations, even when samples were amended with inorganic nutrients. Hyporheic mesocosms were used to examine the fate of stream-derived DOC along replicated flowpaths under controlled hydrologic conditions. The overall patterns of DOC losses along mesocosm flowpaths supplied with water from previously studied streams were similar to DOC losses along natural flowpaths. DOC declines were paralleled by declines in bacterial activity and dissolved oxygen. Mesocosm results indicated that variation in percentage of DOC loss along natural flowpaths was not a function of dilution, residence time, or initial DOC concentration and that subsurface DOC dynamics were linked to variation in microbial metabolism. The fraction of total DOC available for metabolism varied markedly among regional streams and was independent of initial DOC concentration. DOC near the end of hyporheic flowpaths was not subject to further degradation, regardless of the bioavailability of surface-water DOC entering these flowpaths. Hence, in streams with significant hyporheic exchange, the amount and bioavailability of DOC transported to downstream ecosystems may be affected by subsurface metabolism.

Five years' demographic data were evaluated in a stochastic matrix population model, and studies of seed set, pollinator abundance, and inbreeding depression were performed in order to examine possible links between population viability and pollination. In all six sites, plants with reduced capacity of self-pollination (due to herkogamy) showed strongly reduced population viability in locally fragmented grassland habit, with pronounced extinction thresholds at certain levels of local fragmentation. Population viability was reduced because of inbreeding depression and reduced seed production in combination, both caused by pollinator deficit in locally fragmented grasslands. Plants with high selfing capacity had low population viability over the entire local fragmentation gradients. Selfing yielded high seed set in the absence of pollinators and was advantageous in fragmented parts of the grasslands. However, selfing had negative effects in nonfragmented parts of the grasslands, because it decreased the chances of cross-pollination and because selfed progeny had reduced fitness compared to outcrossed offspring.

We assessed the efficacy of different caterpillar defenses against parasitoid wasps, flies, and nematodes, and compared the results to earlier work with predatory invertebrates. Third to fifth instar caterpillars from 266 species and 30 families were collected in a lowland wet forest in Costa Rica during wet and dry seasons from 1996 through 1999, scored for various behavioral and morphological defenses, and then reared in the laboratory. Defense categories were used as predictor variables in logit models with parasitism as the response variable. Whether or not a particular caterpillar defense was effective depended on the taxon of parasitoid that attacked. Caterpillars attacked by flies benefited from a solitary, exophytic feeding habit; wasps were most deterred by biting, dropping, and regurgitating; and larvae attacked by nematodes benefited from both a solitary habit and behavioral defenses. Mortality caused by parasitoids was high for caterpillars that are normally protected from predators.

For example, parasitic plants obtain defensive compounds as well as nutrients from their hosts, and thus many attributes of parasitic plants are dependent on the quality of their host species. Here I measure the effect of a lupine host species (Lupinus argenteus) compared to other host species on herbivory, pollination, and female plant fitness in the hemiparasite Indian paintbrush (Castilleja miniata) using a series of field experiments. Association with lupine was determined in the field by assaying Indian paintbrush leaves for lupine alkaloids. I found that Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing lupines experienced reduced herbivory from plume moth larvae, agromyzid fly larvae, and deer, relative to Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing other host species. However, there was no correlation between alkaloid content of inflorescences and plume moth performance. Host species did not affect pollinator preference for Indian paintbrush in the field. Indian paintbrush parasitizing lupines produced twice as many seeds overall as Indian paintbrush parasitizing other host species. Correlations suggest that this benefit arises both from reduced herbivory and increased nitrogenous resources. The reduction of herbivory in Indian paintbrush plants parasitizing lupines indicates that host species can affect performance of hemiparasites via indirect pathways, and that the larger community of herbivores could alter the impact of a host on its plant parasites.",32,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Castilleja miniata | Hemiparasitic plants | Herbivory | Host-parasite interactions | Indian paintbrush | Indirect effects | Lupine | Lupinus argenteus | Plant chemical defense | Pollination | Quinolizidine alkaloids,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,57,all,All Open Access,NA

We monitored the demography of two populations of S. purpurea in ombrotrophic bogs of northern New England (USA) and described population growth with a four-stage matrix model.

Here, we develop a spatially explicit simulation model to examine interactions between the evolution of herbivore resistance and competitive ability in the goldenrod Solidago altissima. We define competitive ability as either competitive effect, the ability of a plant to deplete resources and make them unavailable to competitors, or competitive response, the ability to grow, survive, and reproduce despite depletion of resources by neighboring competitors. We considered symmetric and asymmetric modes of competition and explored the following questions: (1) Does the selective effect of competition differ for the two components of competitive ability? (2) What are the effects of the evolution of competitive ability and resistance on each other? (3) Can trade-offs between competitive ability and resistance emerge, given no relationship between these two traits prior to selection? Our results showed that competitive response evolved quickly regardless of the mode of competition, but self-suppression hindered the evolution of competitive effect. The evolution of resistance appeared to be independent of the evolution of competitive ability. Intraspecific competition was the major selective force in our model. At natural levels of herbivory, selection for resistance played a secondary role in structuring the population. Resistant genotypes were only favored at very low resistance costs. At high cost levels, the costs of maintaining resistance far outweighed the benefits. The selective forces of competition and herbivory resulted in trade-offs between competitive response and herbivore resistance, but only at low costs of resistance. Vigorous growth associated with a high competitive response might translate into trade-offs between herbivore tolerance and resistance. The strong selective effects of competitors, coupled with the weaker selection from herbivores, suggest that plant traits directly associated with growth that confer tolerance to both competitors and consumers may be the targets of selection.",22,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Competitive effect | Competitive response | Goldenrod | Herbivore resistance | Solidago altissima | Trade-offs,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,60,all,All Open Access,NA

The long-term stability of these ecosystems is explained by interactions among sea level, land elevation, primary production, and sediment accretion that regulate the elevation of the sediment surface toward an equilibrium with mean sea level. We show here in a salt marsh that this equilibrium is adjusted upward by increased production of the salt marsh macrophyte Spartina alterniflora and downward by an increasing rate of relative sea-level rise (RSLR). Adjustments in marsh surface elevation are slow in comparison to interannual anomalies and long-period cycles of sea level, and this lag in sediment elevation results in significant variation in annual primary productivity. We describe a theoretical model that predicts that the system will be stable against changes in relative mean sea level when surface elevation is greater than what is optimal for primary production. When surface elevation is less than optimal, the system will be unstable. The model predicts that there is an optimal rate of RSLR at which the equilibrium elevation and depth of tidal flooding will be optimal for plant growth. However, the optimal rate of RSLR also represents an upper limit because at higher rates of RSLR the plant community cannot sustain an elevation that is within its range of tolerance. For estuaries with high sediment loading, such as those on the southeast coast of the United States, the limiting rate of RSLR was predicted to be at most 1.2 cm/yr, which is 3.5 times greater than the current, long-term rate of RSLR.",1172,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Coastal wetlands | Model | Optimal elevation | Salt marsh | Sea-level rise | Sediment accretion | Sedimentation | Spartina,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,61,NA,NA,NA

The number of functional groups, specifically intratrophic group (e.g., plant or herbivore) functional richness (F), serves as a simple index of ecological diversity, while species richness (S) Serves as a simple index of taxonomic diversity. F and S are, however, roughly correlated measures of biodiversity, and disentangling the relative influence of one over the other on ecosystem functioning (H) requires a multivariate index. Appropriate multivariate biodiversity indices can be derived by applying principal component analyses to the set of possible combinations of S and F in an experimental design. The first principal component (PCAI) represents covariation between F and S, while the second principal component (PCAII) provides information on functioning that is associated with the independent effects of F and S. Thus, one can replace the conventional model H = f(F, S) with H = f(PCAI, PCAII). This approach obviates a number of statistical problems encountered when following the traditional approach. Furthermore, if the question being addressed concerns the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning and not the relative contributions of F and S, PCAI may be used to develop more tractable, yet effective experimental designs than the conventional, exhaustive F X S experimental studies currently in favor.

We predicted that herbivores would enhance soil microbial processes in the fertilized areas, but retard them in the unfertilized ones. Microbial respiration and microbial C were significantly lower in grazed areas than in herbivore exclosures in both unfertilized and fertilized treatments, indicating that herbivores limit the C available for the soil microbes. Microbial N was significantly increased in the exclosures in the fertilized treatment, but there were no effects in the unfertilized one. This reflects both an increase in resources by fertilization and the effect of herbivores on microbial N acquisition: there was surplus N in the fertilized areas to be immobilized by microbial biomass only when access by herbivores was prevented. Thus, mammalian grazers affect the resource coupling between the plant and microbial trophic levels. Fertilization did not affect the soil inorganic, organic, or microbial N contents, or litter decomposition rates, but it significantly increased soil and microbial P. Microbial C was significantly decreased by fertilization, contradicting some earlier fertilization studies in the arctic. One reason for deceleration of soil nutrient cycling in our study area may be that herbivory by both reindeer and rodents occurs mainly outside the growing season; hence, mammalian waste products do not contribute to soil nutrient availability at the times of highest nutrient demands by plants.

We conducted studies to examine competition for hosts at the population and plant levels, compare parasitoid searching behaviors, and model the interactions between two parasitoids on their single host. At the population level, P. pequodorum achieved relatively higher parasitism than A. ervi when the overall level of parasitism (and hence competition) was higher; this is explained by P. pequodorum's superior within-host competitive ability. A negative correlation between A. ervi and P. pequodorum parasitism per plant suggested strong competition by larvae within hosts or behavioral avoidance of previously parasitized hosts by P. pequodorum. Comparison of searching behavior revealed that A. ervi is a superior among-host competitor, searching longer on a plant after an aphid is encountered, moving more rapidly within plants, and attacking and parasitizing more aphids per unit time than P. pequodorum. Using a simple model, we show that high searching efficiency such as that exhibited by A. ervi could lead it to extirpate a superior larval competitor such as P. pequodorum. This competitive exclusion is facilitated by severe or frequent disturbances (such as regular harvesting of alfalfa) that cause mortality of both hosts and parasitoids. Disturbances place a premium on searching efficiency that allows rapid parasitoid population growth.

This variation between lotic and lentic water bodies results in various environments for establishment and growth of plants, but also presents a range of conditions under which plant propagules are transported and deposited along riverbanks and lakeshores. Propagules may be differentially deposited in specific types of fluvial settings depending on their buoyancy. Among riverbanks and lakeshores, we predicted that lakeshores would capture the highest proportion of long-floating seeds, because short floaters will sink before reaching the shoreline. We also predicted that turbulent reaches would receive the highest proportion of short-floating seeds, because these are the sections where buoyancy is least important. Tranquil reaches of rivers were predicted to be intermediate between turbulent reaches and lakes with respect to their efficiency in capturing of long- and short-floating seeds. We tested whether these differences were mirrored in the floras of the different reach types, using reaches of a range of current velocities in 67 sites along a free-flowing river system in northern Sweden. We also related floristic differences to environmental conditions in each of the three reach types (turbulent sections, tranquil sections, and river lakes). The proportions of species with long-floating propagules, herbs, and aquatic species were higher along river lakeshores and tranquil reaches than along turbulent reaches, and the opposite was true for species with short-floating propagules, dwarf shrubs, graminoids, and terrestrial species. The patterns remained when the largest species groups (herbs and graminoids) were tested for floating ability, i.e., the highest proportions of long-floating herbs and graminoids were found in lakes, and the lowest in turbulent reaches; tranquil reaches were intermediate or similar to lakes. Exposure to waves and currents and peat cover explained most of the variation in proportions of species with different floating abilities.

The finite population growth rate, based on a Leslie matrix model of average life-history parameters, was only 0.72 (i.e., significantly <1.0). Growth rate was more sensitive to proportional changes in juvenile female survival than to any other single life-history parameter. Comparisons with self-sustaining populations of closely related ground squirrel species revealed that juvenile survival and breeding rates of yearling females were anomalously low. We believe that the ultimate cause of the population's collapse was inadequacy of food resources, particularly seeds, due to drying of the habitat and changes in plant species composition, likely the result of fire suppression and grazing. No ""rescue"" by immigration occurred, probably because S. b. brunneus seldom disperse long distances and fire suppression has allowed conifers to encroach on inhabited meadows, shrinking them and closing dispersal routes. The proximate cause of the population's collapse was mortality of older breeding females, which reduced the mean age of breeders. Younger females had lower average pregnancy rates and litter sizes. To place our results in context we developed a new, general classification of anthropogenic population declines, based on whether they are caused by changes in the means of the life-history parameters (blatant disturbances), their variances (inappropriate variations), or the correlations among them (evolutionary traps). Many S. b. brunneus populations have disappeared in recent years, apparently due to blatant disturbances, especially loss of habitat and changes in food-plant composition, resulting in inadequate prehibernation nutrition and starvation overwinter.

Retention, therefore, is expected to be greatest during aggrading phases of forest succession. In general, studies of this type have compared watershed retention efficiency by monitoring stream nutrient export at the base of the catchment. As such, streams are viewed only as transport systems. Contrary to this view, the nutrient spiraling concept emphasizes transformation and retention of nutrients within stream ecosystems. In this paper, we address how biogeochemical theory developed for forests may apply to lotic ecosystems in the context of catchment-level succession. Using measures of nutrient spiraling to document uptake, we focus on later seral stages by comparing streams draining second-growth (i.e., 75-100-yr stands) and old-growth (i.e., >400 yr) forests of the southern Appalachian Mountains, USA. Standing stocks of large woody debris (LWD) in old-growth streams were orders of magnitude greater than in second-growth streams where logging practices removed LWD from stream channels. Debris dams were also more frequent in old-growth streams. Solute injections were used to quantify retention of dissolved inorganic phosphate (PO4-P), the limiting nutrient in Appalachian streams. Uptake velocities in old-growth streams were significantly greater than in second-growth streams and were closely related to debris dam frequency, LWD Volume, and the proportion of fine-grained (<2 mm) sediments present in the stream bed.

However, A. longimana and Dictyota overlap only in the southern portion of the amphipod's range; Dictyota is not available to amphipods from more northerly regions. We used this disjunction in distribution to test the hypothesis that A. longimana populations co-occurring with Dictyota would have greater tolerance for the seaweed's chemical defenses and would display higher feeding preference for, and fitness on, the seaweed than would more northerly populations. We also evaluated the genetic vs. phenotypic basis of these patterns and attempted to detect trade-offs between tolerance for Dictyota and ability to use other plants as foods. Such geographic studies of herbivory have been conducted using terrestrial insects, but few studies have focused on other herbivores, and this is especially true for marine systems. In multiple-choice feeding assays with both field-collected and laboratory-reared adults, a North Carolina population of A. longimana sympatric with Dictyota more readily fed on Dictyota and was more resistant to Dictyota's deterrent chemistry than was a Connecticut population from outside of Dictyota's geographic range. When raised on Dictyota menstrualis and D. ciliolata, A. longimana juveniles from North Carolina grew faster, matured faster, and produced more reproductive females than did Connecticut juveniles. The differential tolerance for Dictyota has a genetic basis, as it was maintained through two generations grown to maturity in a common environment. When several northern and southern populations were assayed, they displayed similar regional differences in feeding preferences. Though southern juveniles had higher fitness on Dictyota than northern juveniles, southern juveniles performed as well as northern juveniles when raised on seven other seaweeds, including seaweeds (e.g., Fucus vesiculosus and Sargassum filipendula) that produce secondary metabolites in a different class from those found in Dictyota. Thus, tolerating Dictyota did not incur detectable performance trade-offs when juveniles were confined to feeding on alternative seaweeds.

At Sunset Crater National Monument, Arizona, USA, some pinyon pines (Pinus edulis) are highly susceptible to the stem-boring moth, Dioryctria albovittella, and suffer chronic attack, while other adjacent trees are resistant and have remained relatively moth-free for years. Five major patterns emerged: (1) Susceptible trees suffer from 11 times more shoots killed per tree and produce <0.05 times as many cones as resistant trees. (2) This herbivore is largely restricted to reproductively mature trees that, at this site, are generally older than 46 yr. (3) Analysis of tree-ring data from resistant and susceptible trees shows that trees that eventually became susceptible grew more vigorously during their attack-free juvenile years than resistant trees (growth rings were 29% wider). However, when they matured and suffered chronic herbivory, susceptible trees produced growth rings 13% smaller than resistant trees. (4) Although previous studies showed that resistance was associated with higher oleoresin flow, we did not observe this pattern. Instead, we found that resistance was best correlated with slower juvenile growth rates. Current-year shoots of susceptible mature trees averaged 50% larger than those on resistant mature trees. (5) Tree-ring analyses supported the hypothesis of a trade-off between growth and resistance. This study shows that dendrochronology can be used as a tool to predict future herbivory and demonstrates that the fastest growing juvenile trees suffer the poorest performance decades later when they become moth-susceptible mature trees.

One such debate deals with the effects of biodiversity, and the loss thereof, on ecosystem processes. Recent studies demonstrate that resource-use complementarity, now known as the ""niche-differentiation effect,"" and the presence of a competitive species with strong effects on ecosystem processes, now known as the ""sampling effect,"" can explain why productivity and nutrient retention are sometimes enhanced with increasing species richness. In a well-replicated outdoor mesocosm experiment, we tested these and other alternative mechanisms that could explain the effects of submersed aquatic plant (macrophyte) diversity on wetland ecosystem processes. Algal biomass increased and phosphorus loss decreased as species richness increased. This result can best be explained by an indirect sampling effect caused by one of the weakest competitors, which appeared to facilitate algal growth and thereby filtering of particles, and thus phosphorus, from the water column. The dominant competitor also appeared to decrease phosphorus loss through direct effects on phosphorus availability in the soil and water. Thus, the effects by one of the weakest and the most dominant competitors combine to produce a diversity effect on phosphorus loss. Macrophyte biomass was not enhanced, but converged toward the intermediate biomass of the most competitive species. Such an ""inverse sampling effect"" may be produced when the most competitive species is not the most productive species owing to species-specific feedbacks and adaptations to the wetland environment. In summary, we reject the niche-differentiation effect as the dominant mechanism in our macrophyte communities and expand on the role of sampling effects in explaining the relationship between plant communities and ecosystem processes. In particular, indirect and inverse sampling effects combine to drive the relationship between species richness and wetland ecosystem processes. Thus, we demonstrate that plant diversity may affect wetland ecosystem processes when inferior competitors drive system productivity and nutrient retention. To ensure coexistence of such species with superior competitors, wetland systems may need to be maintained in a nonequilibrium state, such as with hydrologic disturbances, which would maintain both higher diversity and enhance ecosystem functioning.",110,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Algal colonization | Competitive ability | Diversity | Ecosystem functioning | Indirect sampling effect | Inverse sampling effect | Nutrient retention | Productivity | Sampling effect | Submersed aquatic macrophytes | Wetland,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,72,NA,NA,NA

In this study we relate germination requirements and seed size for 16 species of pioneer trees to microclimatic conditions present in gaps in semi-deciduous rain forest in Panama. We found that, whereas increased duration of direct irradiance can be an effective indicator of the presence of a canopy gap across all scales of canopy openness, diel fluctuations in soil temperature effectively discriminate both understory sites and small gaps (25 m2) from larger gaps. Germination response was significantly related to seed size. Small-seeded species (seed mass <2 mg) showed significantly greater germination in response to irradiance of 22.3 μmol·m-2·s-1 than in complete darkness. Their germination was unaffected by an increasing magnitude of diel temperature fluctuation up to a species-specific threshold, above which it declined. Large-seeded species (seed mass >2 mg) germinated equally in light and darkness (with one exception) and either showed a positive germination response to an increasing magnitude of temperature fluctuation (four species) or no significant response (four species). The maximum seed burial depth from which seedlings could emerge successfully was strongly positively associated with seed mass. We conclude that photoblastic germination of tropical pioneer trees results in small-seeded species germinating in gaps only when seeds are located in microsites that are suitable for seedling emergence. A positive germination response to increasing temperature fluctuation can stimulate germination of larger-seeded species in larger gaps and when they are buried beneath an opaque soil or litter layer.

The net influence of ants on willow growth will depend on a balance between the benefits ants provide to the plant through predation on herbivores and the costs to the plant through the protection of aphids. Using both field observations and experimental manipulations of the densities of ants and tended aphids, I tested the hypothesis that this balance differs between the two willow species. On both observational and experimental willows, I followed the insect densities throughout one growing season and measured leaf damage and willow growth. The results from both data sets suggest that the effects of ants on the herbivory and consequent growth of these willows differ. Especially F. aquilonia had a positive effect on the growth of S. phylicifolia, whereas the effect on S. myrsinifolia was negligible or even slightly negative. These differences can be derived from three factors: (1) the ant-tended aphid Pterocomma salicis L. was very abundant on both willow species, leading to strong negative impact of ants on the willows, (2) S. myrsinifolia harbored lower densities of leaf-chewing insects, which made the positive effect of ants through reduced leaf damage less likely, and (3) the dominant leaf-chewing herbivore on S. myrsinifolia, a leaf beetle Phratora vitellinae L., is chemically defended against predatory ants, being thus less preyed on than the predominating generalist leaf-chewing herbivores on S. phylicifolia. Furthermore, when ants were not attending aphids, they even facilitated P. vitellinae, apparently by removing other predators.

Despite growing evidence that early mortality of marine reef fishes can be density dependent and can involve predation, the underlying biological mechanisms have not as yet been fully explored in any system. Here we examine the causes of density-dependent juvenile mortality for two tropical damselfishes, Dascyllus flavicaudus and D. trimaculatus. These species shelter in branching corals or anemones, and they feed on plankton above their microhabitats during the day. Field experiments confirmed that density-dependent juvenile mortality of both Dascyllus species arose from predation and that most of the density-dependent loss could be attributed to small-bodied, resident piscivores (e.g., sandperch, squirrelfish) rather than larger, transient species (e.g., jacks). Over the diel cycle, mortality was strongly density dependent during the dark when damselfish were sheltering but not during daylight when fish were actively foraging. Infrared video recordings revealed the species of predators responsible for most losses and indicated that most predatory events occurred from late twilight to early night, when damselfishes were in shelters and not feeding. Individuals were most at risk when located near or just outside the perimeter of a shelter. The proportion of a cohort in the riskiest areas of a microhabitat increased with density. The cause of the increased fraction of individuals at risk with increasing density was intraspecific interactions among sheltering fish jostling for space in the safest regions; this resulted in the displacement of less aggressive individuals to riskier locations. Thus, density-dependent mortality in both damselfishes arose from interference competition for refuge space from crepuscular and nocturnal predators.",302,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Competition | Coral reefs | Damselfish | Dascyllus | Density dependence | Interference | Population dynamics | Predation | Refuge | Regulation,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,76,NA,NA,NA

This provision may facilitate protection against herbivory. However, plants often cannot prevent other organisms from utilizing these foods as well. There are many examples of herbivorous arthropods that can feed on plant-provided foods such as extrafloral nectar and pollen. The question therefore arises whether individual plants still gain protection when not only the predators, but also the herbivores, can feed on these foods. We investigated this question using a mathematical model and experiments that assessed the impact of supplementary pollen on the dynamics of predatory mites (Iphiseius degenerans (Berlese)) and herbivorous thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande)), two arthropods capable of using pollen for reproduction. Replicated greenhouse experiments showed that addition of pollen every two weeks to one young mature leaf of a male-sterile cucumber plant increased predator population growth and greatly reduced herbivore numbers. A stage-structured predator-prey-pollen model with experimentally established parameters gave reasonably accurate predictions of population trends observed in the greenhouse experiments with and without pollen. Model analysis yielded three important results. First, herbivore (prey) equilibria always settled to lower values in the presence of pollen. Second, mean herbivore numbers during the transient phase following predator release were not always lower under pollen supply, depending on the initial numbers of predators and prey. Third, limiting the plant area covered with pollen led to a decrease in mean herbivore numbers, provided that the predators aggregated in (and thereby ""monopolized"") pollen patches.

To facilitate studies of the degree of individual specialization, this paper outlines four quantitative indices of intrapopulation variation in resource use. Traditionally, such variation has been measured by partitioning the population's total niche width into within- and between-individual, sex, or phenotype components. We suggest two alternative measures that quantify the mean resource overlap between an individual and its population, and we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of all four measures. The utility of all indices depends on the quality of the empirical data. If resources are measured in a coarse-grained manner, individuals may falsely appear generalized.

Sixth-instar larvae feeding on -M-E plants attained greater mass than those feeding on plants with one or both symbionts. There was an M X E interaction with the total amount of grass consumed per larva. The foliar endophyte increased relative consumption rate and reduced efficiency of conversion of ingested food of larvae, while the mycorrhizal fungus had no effect on insect nutritional indices. Larvae preferred -E over +E leaf blades regardless of mycorrhizal infection status. They showed no preference with respect to plant mycorrhizal status. When foraging among mixed stands of intact plants, larvae inflicted more damage on -E than on +E plants. Mycorrhizae reduced feeding damage, but only in -E plants and to a lesser extent than the foliar endophyte. The relative difference between +E and -E plants, in terms of grazing damage, was decreased but not eliminated by mycorrhizae. When P was limiting to plant growth, mycorrhizae still decreased the survivorship of larvae between their second and fifth instar, independently of the foliar endophyte. They accelerated larval development slightly. The foliar endophyte increased the survivorship of fifth-instar larvae, independently of mycorrhizae. We concluded that both foliar endophytes and mycorrhizae affected larval growth and survivorship. Some effects were additive, while others were nonadditive and depended to some extent on host P nutrition.

Results of this study are some of the first to link both population responses and individual condition of nonbreeding birds to prevailing ecological conditions across divergent habitats. Our data suggest that Cape May Warblers are habitat generalists and generally unspecialized resource opportunists, but that differences in food resources result in competitive interactions, sex and age class segregation, and differences in site fidelity and physiological condition among habitats. Diet of the Cape May Warbler varied between habitats: in desert, Cape Mays were primarily insectivores; in dry forest, they foraged primarily on homopteran honeydew; in pine forest, they were principally frugivores. Abundance of warblers as measured by mist-net captures was highest in pine forest sites. Males were more common than females in pine habitat, whereas there was a female-biased sex ratio in other sites. Adult birds were more common in the desert and the pine forest, but there was a bias toward immature birds in dry forest habitat. Overwinter site persistence was 76% in pine, but only 28% and 33% in dry forest and desert, respectively. Annual return rate averaged 57% and did not vary significantly among habitats. Adjusted body mass of site-persistent birds was highest in pine and dry forest and lowest in desert. Pectoral muscle mass scores increased in the pine forest throughout the Sampling period, whereas muscle mass scores decreased in the desert. These data suggest that, among the habitats sampled, pine was preferred. It is likely that stability and predictability of resources, particularly fruiting Trema trees and nectar sources, attracted dominant Cape May Warblers to pine forests and kept them as site-persistent individuals in good body condition. In contrast, dry forest may have been suboptimal, unless an individual was able to hold and defend a tree with honeydew-producing homopteran scale insects.

In long-lived seabirds, one might expect adults not to jeopardize survival by excessive reproductive investment when environmental conditions for breeding are adverse. Some environmental factors have reduced the fecundity of Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridacryla) breeding in Shetland, UK, a metapopulation that has declined substantially during the last two decades. Two hypotheses are proposed to explain this decrease: (1) reduced availability of sandeels (the main prey for kittiwakes), which has occurred since the late 1980s; and (2) increased predation by Great Skuas (Catharacta skua), the main predator of kittiwakes. Detailed data on food supply (sandeel stock size, by age groups), kittiwake body condition and breeding success, and diet and productivity of Great Skuas allowed us to assess the influence of each of these factors on adult kittiwake survival from 1986 through 1997. Capture-recapture models were constructed to examine correlations between local adult survival rate and environmental parameters. Body condition at the end of the breeding season and availability of 0-group (juveniles ≤ 1 yr old) sandeels positively influenced adult survival, whereas survival was lower when Great Skua productivity was high. Adult survival varied greatly during the study, from 0.53 ± 0.04 to 0.98 ± 0.01 (mean ± 1 SD), and was independent of sex. Both hypotheses were supported. Contrary to predictions of life history theory, kittiwakes did not refrain from breeding in years of poor food supply or high predator activity to buffer their survival at the cost of not rearing chicks. Although 0-group sandeel availability affected breeding success of kittiwakes, its influence on adult survival was also significant.

This phenotypic handicap exacts a cost of reduced growth and elevated mortality from the last-hatched or ""marginal"" offspring, while conferring advantages to the more senior ""core"" brood: David Lack long ago proposed that marginal offspring allow parents to track resources that are uncertain at the time of clutch initiation. If food is insufficient for the entire brood, hatching asynchrony allows surplus marginal offspring to be culled from the brood efficiently. This in effect represents a secondary adjustment of clutch size. Today Lack's hypothesis remains a central, although controversial, component, of discussions of hatching asynchrony and avian brood reduction. Most field workers report results inconsistent with Lack's hypothesis (e.g., a failure of asynchronously hatching broods to produce more fledglings than do experimentally synchronized broods) and have offered a variety of alternative explanations. Previous workers have focused, with limited success, on single explanations for the complex phenomena of hatching asynchrony. Here we use parental optimism theory to study the secondary adjustment of clutch size in an integrated framework emphasizing ecological (tracking uncertain resources) and developmental (unpredictable survival, quality and/or sex of progeny) uncertainty. We present the results of a 6-yr study of Yellow-headed Blackbirds (Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus), a marsh-nesting icterid. Marginal offspring that are the products of hatching asynchrony serve multiple functions simultaneously: in tracking resources that vary temporally; as a hedge against hatching failure; and in progeny choice via sex-biased brood reduction. The effect of the phenotypic handicap was diminished both by improving ecological conditions and by hatching failure/experimental clutch reduction. Marginal offspring represent high variance progeny, and synchrony represents a high variance strategy. Brood reduction occurred at low cost and was rendered more efficient by hatching asynchrony, particularly under conditions of stringency.",39,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Brood reduction | Core offspring | Hatching asynchrony | Marginal offspring | Parental optimism | Phenotypic handicap | Resource tracking | Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus | Yellow-headed Blackbird,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,88,NA,NA,NA

However, because invasive ants reach extraordinary densities at introduced locations, increased feeding efficiency or increased exploitation of new foods should be important in their success. Earlier studies suggest that honeydew produced by Homoptera (e.g., aphids, mealybugs, scale insects) may be important in the diet of the invasive ant species Solenopsis invicta. To determine if this is the case, we studied associations of S. invicta and Homoptera in east Texas and conducted a regional survey for such associations throughout the species' range in the southeast United States. In east Texas, we found that S. invicta tended Homoptera extensively and actively constructed shelters around them. The shelters housed a variety of Homoptera whose frequency differed according to either site location or season, presumably because of differences in host plant availability and temperature. Overall, we estimate that the honeydew produced in Homoptera shelters at study sites in east Texas could supply nearly one-half of the daily energetic requirements of an S. invicta colony. Of that, 70% may come from a single species of invasive Homoptera, the mealybug Antonina graminis. Homoptera shelters were also common at regional survey sites and A. graminis occurred in shelters at nine of 11 survey sites. A comparison of shelter densities at survey sites and in east Texas suggests that our results from east Texas could apply throughout the range of S. invicta in the southeast United States. Antonina graminis may be an exceptionally important nutritional resource for S. invicta in the southeast United States.

We tested predictions based on these hypotheses and selected alternatives in three outdoor aviary experiments. Mourning Doves failed to equalize food giving-up densities (GUDs; food densities at the point of patch departure) between rich and poor patches, and no indirect interactions took place between multiple foods in patches. The ratio of GUDs between rich and poor patches equaled the ratio of initial food densities. Neither selectivity among, nor ratio of GUDs between, multiple foods varied with degree of patch exploitation. Results of all experiments supported a fixed-time patch-departure strategy among Mourning Doves; this may be a general pattern among open area-foraging avian granivores. A fixed-time strategy in this guild may indicate inability to assess patch resource density, possibly due to lack of olfactory capabilities or to a constant rate of seed intake at most seed densities.

However, results of experimental and observational studies often conflict, leading to vigorous debate about the mechanistic importance of diversity in determining invasion success in the field, as well as other ecosystem properties, such as productivity and stability. In this study, we employed both field experiments and observational approaches to assess the effects of diversity on the invasion of a subtidal marine invertebrate community by three species of nonindigenous ascidians (sea squirts). In experimentally assembled communities, decreasing native diversity increased the survival and final percent cover of invaders, whereas the abundance of individual species had no effect on these measures of invasion success. Increasing native diversity also decreased the availability of open space, the limiting resource in this system, by buffering against fluctuations in the cover of individual species. This occurred because temporal patterns of abundance differed among species, so space was most consistently and completely occupied when more species were present. When we held diversity constant, but manipulated resource availability, we found that the settlement and recruitment of new invaders dramatically increased with increasing availability of open space. This suggests that the effect of diversity on invasion success is largely due to its effects on resource (space) availability. Apart from invasion resistance, the increased temporal stability found in more diverse communities may itself be considered an enhancement of ecosystem function. In field surveys, we found a strong negative correlation between native-species richness and the number and frequency of nonnative invaders at the scale of both a single quadrat (25 × 25 cm), and an entire site (50 × 50 m). Such a pattern suggests that the means by which diversity affects invasion resistance in our experiments is important in determining the distribution of invasive species in the field.

In a factorial field experiment, cattle were excluded from half the subplots, and neighboring plants were removed from half the subplots. Transplants of each of the species were planted in plots on hillsides and in flat areas, and the entire experiment was replicated in two pastures. The effects of grazing were negative and were proportional to the ungrazed height of each species. In the absence of grazing and competition, the flat plots were more favorable than the hillside plots. Grazing reversed the relative favorableness of flat and hillside plots, most likely because grazing was more intense in the flat plots due to cattle preference for flatter ground. The removal of neighboring plants always had a positive effect, indicating competition from neighboring plants. The relative impact of competition from pre-existing plants was generally greater in the flat plots than in the hillside plots. The relative impacts of grazing were generally greater in the absence of competing plants, and the relative impacts of competition were generally greater in the absence of grazing. The most likely explanation for this antagonistic interaction between the effects of herbivory and competition is an indirect positive effect Of grazing that arose from a reduction in competition experienced by a target plant due to the defoliation of its neighbors.

We measured predawn water potential (Ψ), gas exchange, leaf δ15N, carbon isotope discrimination (Δ), and growth of target plants for the duration of the study. We found that G. sarothrae used resource pulses to a larger extent than A. confertifolia, which has more functional roots at depth. In all species, the addition of a water or nitrogen pulse did not significantly affect maximal rates of photosynthesis or branch growth. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we did not find that pulse use was reduced by the presence of neighboring plants. Nevertheless, there was strong evidence for competitive interactions, which were more likely mediated by water at depth than by nitrogen. In the more deep-rooted species A. confertifolia, neighbor removal affected Ψ, gas exchange, Δ, percentage of carbon, and growth. G. sarothrae, which has a much smaller proportion of roots at depth, was less affected by the removal of neighboring shrubs, and not at all when only predominantly shallow-rooted herbaceous species were removed.

Two experiments were performed using the African migratory locust, Locusta migratoria (L.). In both cases, locusts were given access to multiple synthetic foods that varied in their concentration of the two most strongly regulated nutrients (protein and digestible carbohydrate) and a carbon-based PSM, tannic acid (TA). Insects in the first experiment were given two suboptimal but complementary foods: a high-protein, low-carbohydrate food and a low-protein, high-carbohydrate food. Tannic acid was then added to one food type but not the other, to both, or to neither food type. Here we could see how the addition of TA to a food with a specific protein: carbohydrate profile influenced nutritional regulatory responses. In a second experiment, locusts were given a high-protein, low-carbohydrate food and a low-protein, high-carbohydrate food, both of which contained TA. A third TA-free food containing one of five different protein: carbohydrate ratios was also provided. This experiment provided an opportunity to measure the extent to which a TA-free resource would be incorporated into the diet in relation to its nutrient content. Results indicated that the extent to which locusts regulated their protein: carbohydrate intake depended on the protein: carbohydrate composition of the TA-free foods in their environments. It was evident that TA is more effective as a feeding deterrent than as a post-ingestive toxin, but its effectiveness as a feeding deterrent is strongly linked to the protein: carbohydrate composition of the food in which it occurs.

The first method, proposed previously, is a traditional hypothesis test for evidence that detection probabilities are unequal. However, we feel that, a priori, it is more likely that detection probabilities are actually different; hence, the burden of proof should be shifted, requiring evidence that detection probabilities are practically equivalent. The second method we present, equivalence testing, is one approach to doing so.

Analyses of collections of food webs based on these properties have revealed regularities that fostered the formulation of models of food-web structure. However, it has been shown that most of these qualitative descriptors are highly sensitive to the varying levels of sampling effort used to document a food web. The principal problem is that webs described extensively include trophic links of highly uneven magnitude, with typically few strong/important links and a wealth of weak ones; with qualitative descriptors, the same weight is given to all trophic interactions. To overcome this problem, food webs should be described and analyzed quantitatively. Consequently, we propose here a suite of food-web descriptors, which are built on information-theory indices and take the magnitude of the trophic interactions into account. We define descriptors having a similar meaning as the classical qualitative indices.

For insect herbivores, resolution of this trade-off is thought to be strongly influenced by feeding ecology and mortality risks. In contrast, how these factors might affect the developmental strategies of third trophic level organisms, like parasitoid wasps, is less understood. To address this question, we compared the development of larval endoparasitoids in the families Ichneumonidae and Braconidae that parasitize larval stage herbivores in the order Lepidoptera. The campoplegine ichneumonid Venturia canescens parasitized concealed hosts and exhibited a developmental strategy that favored progeny size over development time. In contrast, the closely related ichneumonid Campoletis sonorensis parasitized exposed hosts and exhibited the opposite strategy of favoring rapid development time over size. The microgastrine braconid Microplitis croceipes attacks partially concealed hosts and showed evidence of a trade-off between maximizing body size and minimizing development times. These results suggested that parasitoids attacking apparent, foliar-feeding hosts may favor rapid development time over size while parasitoids that attack concealed hosts favor size over development time. A broader survey of the literature supported the trends found in our experimental studies. The braconids and ichneumonids examined in this study also exhibit distinct differences in larval feeding and pupation behavior.

I investigated how time constraints affect the growth strategies of pool frogs (Rana lessonae) in the presence and absence of caged (i.e., nonlethal) predators, and what the consequences are for their survival during the larval and the subsequent terrestrial life stage. In two outdoor experiments, I limited the available development time by delaying the hatching date, and by simulating pond drying. Tadpoles whose hatching date was experimentally delayed reduced their development and their activity less in the presence of predators than did control tadpoles. The survival consequences of caged predators was similar for early- and late-hatched tadpoles. Tadpoles exposed to falling water level increased their developmental rate compared to constant-water-level controls. In response to predators, however, tadpoles decreased activity and developmental rate, regardless of the water level treatment.

Time since gap formation showed spatial autocorrelation at spatial scales smaller than 5000 m2 (Moran's I coefficient). Point pattern analysis (Ripley's K function) showed that very recent treefalls (1990-1997) are spatially associated with previous treefalls (1978-1987) at scales of 1000-5000 m2. At the scale of individual treefalls (100-400 m2), species richness was uncorrelated with treefall regime, and shade-tolerant and light-demanding species were not discriminated in a multidimensional scaling ordination analysis. However, correlation between treefalls and species richness, and the discrimination of regeneration groups, increased abruptly at the scales of treefall aggregations. In agreement with previous studies, this study suggests that isolated treefalls have little effect on species composition and diversity, probably due to recruitment limitation. Instead, this study shows that at scales >1000 m2, treefall regime is a good predictor of species richness and composition of regeneration groups. This may be because treefall aggregations and gap expansion increase the probability of new nearby treefalls being colonized by light-demanding species.

This effect disappeared when phosphorus was added to the P-limited algae prior to feeding, indicating that mineral limitation can occur even at very low levels of food. Neonates born to mothers raised on either high- or low-P Scenedesmus were analyzed for body mass and lipid content as well as mass-specific phosphorus content to check for possible differential investment into neonates in different environments. Although mass-specific phosphorus content was higher in animals born from mothers grown on high-P algae, when fed low quantities of P-limited algae, growth rates of neonates born under low-P conditions were higher than those of animals born under high-P conditions. This can be explained by an increased body lipid content of low-P neonates, even though there were no differences in neonate body mass between treatments.

We performed two factorial field experiments to determine how increasing salinity and nutrient supply affected the relative strengths of top-down and bottom-up forces among the gall-making midge, Asphondylia borrichiae, its host plant Borrichia frutescens, and a suite of parasitoids. Salinity was increased by the addition of salt pellets, and nutrient supply was increased by the addition of fertilizer. In both experiments, parasitism pressure was decreased by trapping hymenopteran parasitoids with yellow sticky traps. In both experiments, bottom-up manipulations had significant effects on gall density. Elevated salinity levels decreased the number of galls per 200 Borrichia stems, and fertilization increased the number of galls. In the salt-stress experiment, increased salinity decreased gall parasitism, and in the fertilization experiment, fertilizer increased parasitism of galls, but the direct effects of these treatments on gall density outweighed the indirect effects mediated by parasitoids. Parasitoid-removal treatments resulted in only small (and not statistically significant) changes in gall parasitism in the salt-stress experiment, and there was no significant effect on gall density. In the fertilization experiment, parasitoid-removal treatments reduced parasitism of galls, and this resulted in an increase in gall density over time. Thus, bottom-up effects were strong and consistent in both experiments, but top-down effects appeared weaker and inconsistent. Stem morphology, which was altered by salt and fertilizer, also affected gall density and parasitism, and there was some evidence that the strength of top-down forces on gall density varied with stem type. The results of this study show that, in this system, top-down effects of parasitism are dependent upon the bottom-up effects of host plant quality and morphology resulting from abiotic heterogeneity.

Stable isotopes and OCs were also measured in the turbot (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and stable isotopes in the ringed seal (Phoca hispida) and harp seal (Pagophilus groenlandicus) to put the shark results in context. Values of δ15N suggest that the Greenland shark feeds at a similar trophic level as the turbot and ringed seal (about the fourth trophic level) and at a higher trophic level than harp seals, despite the presence of many turbot and a single ringed seal in the stomach contents of 14 sharks. Values of δ13C indicate that source of carbon in turbot and Greenland shark is of a more pelagic origin than in ringed and harp seals. High concentrations of biomagnifying OCs in the sharks compared with the turbot (concentration 10-100X lower) and ringed seals (3-10X lower) suggest that the sharks feed at a higher trophic level than implied by stable isotopes. High urea levels found in the tissues of sharks may influence δ15N values, resulting in an underestimate of shark trophic position, and requires additional study.

In the first experiment we created replicated seeps (continuously moist patches) 3 m and 15 m from streams. Desmognathus fuscus, a streamside species, began to increase in density at streamside seeps and to colonize distant seeps within 1.5 mo of their construction. Plethodon cinereus, a small terrestrial species, initially responded favorably to distant seeps but was displaced as seeps were colonized by streamside species. The D. fuscus colonists remained on distant plots with seeps 22 mo after water to seeps was turned off and the habitat had returned to pretreatment conditions. On streamside plots P. cinereus occurred at low densities initially and was quickly displaced by D. fuscus from portions of the plots near seeps. Gyrinophilus porphyriticus, a large streamside species, and Plethodon glutinosus, a large terrestrial species, were less abundant but exhibited responses that were similar to those of D. fuscus and P. cinereus, respectively. In the second experiment we created seeps in upland forests >30 m from the nearest stream or natural seep, more than twice as far from a source of colonists as the distant seeps in the first experiment. The creation of seeps was crossed with the addition of logs and rocks as cover objects in a replicated factorial design. Plethodon cinereus became more abundant and had greater mass adjusted for body size on plots with seeps than on control plots.

We tested six hypotheses about social and environmental conditions that might influence natal dispersal of males in the cooperatively breeding Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis). Further, we examined whether variation in dispersal behavior is heritable. Dispersing from the natal territory during the first year rather than remaining as a helper was associated with four factors. First, dispersing male fledglings were, on average, significantly lower in body mass than their philopatric siblings, indicating an influence of social dominance on dispersal. Second, individuals were more likely to disperse from territories with many male fledglings, independent of the number of adult male helpers per territory, suggesting that sibling (rather than helper-offspring) competition for future reproduction may be the underlying mechanism. Third, the probability of remaining as a helper rather than dispersing was positively associated with quality of the natal territory and with the number of high-quality territories close to the natal site. This suggests an influence of the benefits of philopatry, because many males that initially remain as helpers eventually become breeders on the natal territory or a neighboring territory. Finally, we found evidence that ecological constraints influence dispersal: the probability of dispersing was positively related to the availability of vacant territories in the wider neighborhood of the natal site. Natal dispersal behavior was not influenced by resource competition, measured as group size on the natal territory, or by local density, estimated as the number of active territories in the vicinity of the natal site. Based on comparisons of father-son and brother-brother dispersal behavior, we found no evidence for heritability of philopatric behavior. Dispersal of male fledgling Red-cockaded Woodpeckers can be viewed as conditional on social and ecological factors in the natal territory and in the immediate neighborhood.

We analyzed temporal and spatial variability in recruitment and compared recruitment limitations among species. Annual seed production in Quararibea and Tetragastris fluctuated widely, whereas Trichilia had more consistent seed production across years. Within species, trees were synchronized in seed production, and synchrony appeared partly influenced by El Niño climatic events. Seedling recruitment varied temporally and spatially. At the population scale, all species had greater recruitment in productive seed years, and individual trees had differing contributions to this temporal pattern. At the focal-tree scale, recruitment patterns differed among species. Quararibea and Tetragastris trees with higher average seed production recruited more seedlings in their local neighborhoods than did less fecund trees. In contrast, Trichilia seedling recruitment did not increase with seed crop size, suggesting negative density dependence. At the tree neighborhood scale, no species showed evidence of density dependence in first-year survival.

We tested whether grazing macrozoobenthos affects all periphytic components (generalist consumption), whether nutrient effects propagate through the community, and whether interactions between the different periphyton groups allow for indirect feedback mechanisms. The experiments were conducted during three different seasons in a mesoeutrophic lake in Sweden (Lake Erken) and at an adjacent coastal marine site (Väddö) of similar productivity, but with contrasting grazer fauna.

Further emphasis has been on the sensitivity of λ to absolute variation (sensitivities) and relative variation (elasticities) in vital rates, because λ can be related to the evolutionary fitness of a life history phenotype (r = lnλ). Furthermore, because density regulation can affect the expression and evolution of life history traits, which in turn can feed back on population dynamics, correctly incorporating the relationship between the two is critical to understanding the evolution and evolvability of life history strategies. Here we ask how life history variation affects projected population growth and evolutionary fitness dynamics in the long-term study system of the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata). There are striking differences in the life history traits of guppies that co-occur with two different assemblages of predators and so these populations are a model natural system for examining the fitness consequences of, and selective pressures on, traits that covary predictably. We found that populations experiencing high rates of predation had lower estimates of growth and fitness than did those experiencing low rates of predation (pooled r = 0.02 and 0.17, respectively). But when we incorporated density regulation in low predation sites, observed with field manipulations and modeled with simulations, this difference became negligible. Furthermore, for all populations irrespective of predators, growth rate was most sensitive to changes in neonatal growth and was contributed to maximally by early adult survival.

Recently, there has been an emerging recognition of the importance of benthic production and processes to whole-lake ecosystems. To examine the extent to which zoobenthos contribute to higher trophic level production in lakes, we synthesized diet data from 470 fish populations (15 species) and stable isotope data from 90 fish populations (11 species), all of which are common inhabitants of north-temperate lakes. Across all species considered, zoobenthos averaged 50% of total prey consumption. Indirect consumption of zoobenthos (i.e., feeding on zoobenthos-supported fishes) contributed another 15%, for a total of 65% reliance on benthic secondary production. Stable isotopes provided estimates of mean zoobenthivory ranging from 43% to 59%. For most fish species, consumption of zoobenthos was highly variable among populations. The overwhelming concern of ecologists with pelagic food chains and processes contrasts sharply with our finding that benthic secondary production plays a central role in supporting higher trophic level production. This extensive zoobenthivory can subsidize fish populations, leading to apparent competition and otherwise altering trophic dynamics and ecosystem processes in the pelagic zone.

Intra- and interspecific competition did occur and generally resulted in a decrease in survival rates, an increase in the duration of the larval period, and a decrease in size at metamorphosis. Water salinity also prolonged the larval period and interacted with intra- and interspecific density, intensifying its effects. Interspecific competition was asymmetric, since B. bufo was competitively superior to B. calamita, causing larger effects on B. calamita than those experienced by B. bufo. However, the three populations of B. calamita showed different competitive effects and responses when they were set to compete with B. bufo. The population sympatric to B. bufo had the stronger competitive effect and response, causing a strong impact on survival, growth, and developmental rate of B. bufo. The allopatric population inhabiting the brackish environment also had a marked effect on B. bufo survival, although only at high density. The other allopatric population only had a significant effect on the size at metamorphosis of B. bufo. The impact of B. bufo on B. calamita was greater for the allopatric populations than for the sympatric one. This pattern suggests that the nature and outcome of ecological interactions are a function of environmental conditions and population history.",30,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Abiotic factors | Amphibians | Bufo | Geographic mosaic model | Geographic variation | Interspecific competition | Intraspecific competition | Local adaptation,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,123,all,All Open Access,NA

We consider semimechanistic models, in which the model structure is derived from knowledge of the life cycle, but the rate equations are estimated nonparametrically from the time-series data. The method involves smoothing the population time series x(t) in order to estimate the gradient dx/dt, and then fitting rate equations using penalized regression splines. Computer-intensive methods are used to estimate and remove the biases that result from the data being discrete time samples with sampling errors from a continuous time process. Semimechanistic modeling makes it possible to test assumptions about the mechanisms behind population fluctuations without the results being confounded by possibly arbitrary choices of parametric forms for process-rate equations. To illustrate this application, we analyze time-series data on laboratory populations of blowflies Lucilia cuprina and Lucilia sericata. The models assume that the populations are limited by competition among adults affecting their current birth and death rates. The results correspond to the actual experimental conditions. For L. cuprina (where the model's structure is appropriate) a good fit can be obtained, while for L. sericata (where the model is inappropriate), the fitted model does not reproduce some major features of the observed cycles.

However, the factors that limit the distribution and abundance of rare species are seldom examined and are poorly understood. I tested several explanations of landscape-scale rarity in the New England cobble beach plant community, an assemblage of halophytic forbs associated with fringing beds of the marine intertidal grass Spartina alterniflora. Spartina reduces flow velocity and stabilizes the cobble substrate, thereby reducing the burial of seeds and seedlings of other species. Frequencies of the presence of forb species behind 387 sampled Spartina beds distributed along 120 km of shoreline in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, USA, ranged from 0.005 to 0.382. Both the whole forb assemblage and individual species were strongly nested with respect to patch size and species richness. Species that were rare on a landscape scale were generally only found behind the longest beds, and bed length was positively related to species diversity. Experimental seed additions to 40 beds ranging in length from 8 to 688 m indicated that intermediate-sized beds often occupied by common species are not habitable by three rare forbs. When present behind the longest beds, these rare species are always associated with a microhabitat characterized by a relatively fine-grained and highly stable substrate. A series of substrate manipulations combined with experimental seed additions indicated that the rare annuals Spergularia marina, Salicornia biglovii, and Atriplex arenaria are restricted to the longest Spartina beds because smaller beds lack suitable substrate. These experiments also suggest that seed supply, competitors, and herbivores are not the proximate causes of the absence of these species from smaller beds, although dispersal limitation may prevent the colonization of many larger habitable patches. The microhabitat required by the rare forbs appears to be generated by the deposition of fine-grained particles behind the center of the longest Spartina beds. Consequently, bed length is causally related to the distribution of populations at a landscape scale and to species richness and composition at the scale of a whole habitat patch.",21,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Cobble beach | Diversity | Facilitation | Halophytic forbs | Nestedness | Rarity | Species richness,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,125,all,All Open Access,NA

To test this hypothesis, we constructed mixed and monospecific plots of the two species. Over two years of study, we found that L. salicaria significantly reduced both pollinator visitation and seed set in L. alatum.

It also reacts with water vapor to form nitric and nitrous acids, which acidify precipitation and increase N deposition. Models currently used to predict soil NO fluxes are based on the assumption that NO flux is proportional to the gross rate of nitrification or N mineralization; however, this assumption has not been tested because of the difficulty in measuring gross N-cycling rates in situ. We measured soil NO fluxes, gross and net N-cycling rates, and a variety of other soil characteristics in the forest floor and intact soil cores at nine undisturbed forest and rangeland ecosystems of New Mexico, Utah, and Oregon, USA, to determine which soil variables were most closely related to soil NO flux. Soil NO fluxes ranged from a low of 0.02 ng N.m-2·s-1, prior to wetting in a western hemlock-sitka spruce forest on the Oregon coast, to a high of 6.74 ng N·m-2·s-1, one hour after soil wetting in a juniper woodland of central Oregon. In contrast to our expectations, neither gross nitrification nor gross mineralization was correlated with soil NO flux. Fluxes were positively correlated with net rates of mineralization and nitrification, soil NO3- concentrations, bulk density, and pH, and negatively correlated with gross rates of NO3- consumption in the forest floor, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil C:N, and soil water content. Principal-component analysis showed that NO flux after water addition (2 cm of water) had a strong negative correlation with microbial demand for N (as indicated by net mineralization, net nitrification, SOC, and C:N). Our results suggest that, even in well-drained soils, NO efflux is limited more by NO consumption than by NO production.

Offspring fitness is assumed to be the major factor influencing nest site selection because habitat characteristics and nest microenvironments affect offspring survival. However, two opposing factors drive maternal nest site selection: minimizing female mortality and maximizing offspring fitness. In Australia, introduced red foxes are the major predator of turtle nests, and they also destroy nesting females. Thus, females may trade off maximizing nest survival or offspring fitness to avoid predators. In this paper, I show that the risk of predation affects maternal nest site selection and has negative effects on reproductive success in a freshwater turtle. I also show that the mechanisms behind predator detection vary between native and introduced species. From 1996 to 2000, I observed female freshwater turtles, Emydura macquarii, nesting around four lagoons in southeastern Australia to determine nesting habitat characteristics. During 1997 and 1998, foxes were removed from two sites, and nest predation rates declined by >50%, but remained >85% in nonremoval sites. Foxes destroyed ∼3% of the female population only in high-risk areas. Female turtles nest away from shore to maximize offspring fitness when foxes are removed from an area. The dilemma in high-risk areas is that predation risk limits females from nesting in preferred areas away from shore, where nest predation is reduced. However, females may sacrifice some offspring by nesting in inappropriate substrate, where incubation conditions are not optimal, but nest predation is significantly reduced. Nesting turtles do not detect foxes by chemical recognition, but they have an innate avoidance response to the odor of a native predator.

Data from an eight-year mark-recapture study on free-ranging vipers suggest that potential costs of reproduction were high for these animals, in terms of survival as well as growth and energy storage. Females that reproduced experienced higher mortality rates than nonreproductive females and, hence, exhibited a tendency toward semelparity, grew less, and devoted most of their energy stores to reproduction. Both the depletion of body reserves and the low survival of reproductive females translated into significant costs (decrements of lifetime reproductive success [LRS]). However, the cessation of growth during pregnancy had no detectable effect on LRS. Most females produced only a single litter during their lifetimes. A female's ""costs"" in energy terms were not negatively correlated with her future reproductive output, probably because female vipers vary considerably in the rate at which they can accumulate energy. This notion is supported by the observations that (1) females with higher initial body reserves expended more energy during reproduction, and (2) females that accumulated energy more rapidly after parturition were more likely to survive and to breed again. This kind of variation among females masks any underlying trade-off between current reproductive effort and probable future reproductive success.

We hypothesized that such an extended phenology may be a flexible mechanism that enhances population persistence in variable Mediterranean environments, as fecundity in one part of the season could compensate for reproductive failure in another part of the season. We predicted that (1) fecundities throughout the year would significantly contribute to mean population growth rate λ, (2) negative covariances among fecundities in different periods of the year would reduce variance in population growth rate, and (3) extended flowering and fruiting would enhance long-term stochastic population growth rates. We used a periodic matrix model to describe the demography of a L. maritima population over five years, in which each year was divided into six periods of two months each. Population growth rates varied from a low of 0.25 to a high of 4.81 over the five years of study. Periodic elasticity analyses revealed that fecundities in the first two periods of the year, i.e., the autumn periods, were the major determinants of population growth in most of the years, rather than fecundities over the whole flowering and fruiting season. Variation in the autumn fecundities also made the largest contribution to the observed variance in λ. Hence, unlike earlier generalizations, highly variable parameters also had relatively high elasticities. As predicted, negative covariances appeared between the fecundities, but only between those of the two autumn periods. These negative covariances were interpreted as a flexible mechanism to tailor the onset of reproduction to the start of the autumn rains, thereby reducing the variance in λ. We used stochastic matrix models to investigate the effect of different reproductive strategies on stochastic population growth rate. We created hypothetical populations with either an even distribution of fecundity throughout the year or with concentrated flowering and fruiting in autumn or in spring. Stochastic population growth rates were high if a major part of the reproduction remained in autumn. A hypothetically even distribution of fecundities over the entire flowering season increased both the mean and the variance in λ, with little overall effect on stochastic population growth rate. All together, our results indicate that a reproductive failure of L. maritima in autumn cannot be compensated for by reproduction in winter and spring.

Elucidating the importance of resource availability should be made easier by the development of techniques that can measure the amount of resources that are accessible to a consumer, rather than simply the abundance of resources in the environment. In this study, I develop a behavioral assay for inferring the ratio of nutrients available to organisms in the field. The assay involves measuring the responses of foragers to nutrient solutions. These responses are used to determine the mean effective concentration, or ED50, of a nutrient, defined as the concentration that is rejected in 50% of trials. Because ED50 provides a measure of the quality of a depletable patch at which a consumer would quit foraging, it is analogous to the giving-up density (GUD), a common tool in ecological research. Here, I use ED50s to estimate the ratio of carbohydrates: protein available to ant colonies. Using supplementation experiments, I show that ED50s of sucrose and casein (a source of amino acids) reveal the net rates at which a colony expects to acquire each resource elsewhere in the environment. These results demonstrate that differences in ED50s will reveal differences in the availabilities of nutrients when other factors affecting the costs and benefits of foraging are controlled. To control these factors, I measured a colony's ED50s of sucrose and casein at the same time and location. Using this technique, I found that ratios of carbohydrate: protein availability differed significantly among 10 species of ants in south-eastern Arizona, USA. Ratios were highest for species that are known to collect liquids from extrafloral nectaries and phloem-feeding insects. Carbohydrate: protein ratios may be especially low for three granivorous species, Pogonomyrmex barbatus, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, and Aphaenogaster cockerelli, which accepted sucrose solutions but rejected even highly concentrated casein solutions. Because ratios of carbohydrate: protein availability differed substantially among species in the same habitat, the results of this study suggest that measures of resource abundance may poorly predict habitat quality for consumers.",59,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Ants | Arizona | Carbohydrates | ED 50 | Effective concentration | Giving-up density | Nutritional composition | Optimal foraging | Protein | Resource availability,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,137,NA,NA,NA

We manipulated the number of species of freshwater suspension feeders (net-spinning caddisflies) in laboratory stream mesocosms where communities were either subject to a periodic mortality or were left undisturbed. We hypothesized that disturbance would alter the direct effect of suspension-feeder species richness on the flux of their resource, particulate organic matter (POM), and alter the indirect effects of suspension-feeder species richness on algal productivity and biofilm respiration (via nutrient recycling). The direct effect of suspension-feeder species richness on POM flux did indeed change with disturbance regime. The flux of POM from the water column to stream bed was not influenced by species richness in the absence of disturbance, but increased as species richness was increased in disturbed streams. This apparently occurred because a high taxonomic evenness in disturbed streams minimized current ""shading"" (i.e., the blocking of flow from upstream to downstream neighbors) that, in turn, allowed diverse assemblages to capture a greater fraction of suspended resources. Disturbance also altered the indirect effect of suspension feeder species richness on algal productivity. In the absence of disturbance, increasing species richness led to dominance by a competitively superior suspension feeding taxon that had particularly low rates of nutrient excretion. Reduced nutrient availability, in turn, caused algal productivity to decline as a function of species richness. Periodic disturbances, however, prevented taxonomic dominance and eliminated this indirect effect of suspension feeder species richness on stream productivity. Our results suggest that disturbance can moderate relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning by (1) increasing the chance that diversity generates unique system properties (i.e., ""emergent"" properties), or (2) suppressing the probability of ecological processes being controlled by a single taxon (i.e., the ""selection-probability"" effect).",92,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Biodiversity | Emergent properties | Hydropsychid caddisflies | Lotic filter feeders | Niche complementarity | Selection probability and sampling effects | Species diversity,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,138,NA,NA,NA

We examined egg size (an index of offspring size) of an iteroparous, broadcast-spawning, freshwater fish - the walleye (Stizostedion vitreum) - from 34 populations across 26° of latitude in order to determine whether egg size varied with respect to environmental indices of juvenile habitat quality. Variation among populations (among environments) was compared to variation within populations (among females). Within populations, egg size generally increased with maternal size and age. Slopes of these relationships were much more variable among populations (CV > 100%) than interannually within populations (CV < 50%). Egg size vs. female size/age correlations were stronger in populations closer to the northern and southern limits of the walleye range. Egg size was also related to maternal growth history, but the effects of recent growth (previous year) were inconsistent. Egg size varied much less than fecundity among females of the same population. For a standard size/age of female, predicted egg size was more variable among populations (CV > 10%) than interannually within populations (CV < 5%), but only slightly more variable than among females within populations (mean CV = 8.5%). Nevertheless, among-population variability in egg size was related to environmental conditions. Mean egg size decreased with increasing latitude/decreasing mean annual temperature, contrary to our predictions.

However, convergence studies at the community level often involve only qualitative comparisons of the environment and may fail to identify which environmental variables drive community structure. We tested the hypothesis that the biological traits of fish communities on two continents (Europe and North America) are similarly related to environmental conditions. Specifically, from observations of individual fish made at the microhabitat scale (a few square meters) within French streams, we generated habitat preference models linking traits of fish species to local scale hydraulic conditions (Froude number), Using this information, we then predicted how hydraulics and geomorphology at the larger scale of stream reaches (several pool-riffle sequences) should quantitatively influence the trait composition of fish communities. Trait composition for fishes in stream reaches with low Froude number at low flow or high proportion of pools was predicted as nonbenthic, large, fecund, long-lived, nonstreamlined, and weak swimmers. We tested our predictions in contrasting stream reaches in France (n = 11) and Virginia, USA (n = 76), using analyses of covariance to quantify the relative influence of continent vs. physical habitat variables on fish traits. The reach-scale convergence analysis indicated that trait proportions in the communities differed between continents (up to 55% of the variance in each trait was explained by ""continent""), partly due to distinct evolutionary histories. However, within continents, trait proportions were comparably related to the hydraulic and geomorphic variables (up to 54% of the variance within continents explained). In particular, a synthetic measure of fish traits in reaches was well explained (50% of its variance) by the Froude number independently of the continent. The effect of physical variables did not differ across continents for most traits, confirming our predictions qualitatively and quantitatively. Therefore, despite phylogenetic and historical differences between continents, fish communities of France and Virginia exhibit convergence in biological traits related to hydraulics and geomorphology. This convergence reflects morphological and behavioral adaptations to physical stress in streams. This study supports the existence of a habitat template for ecological strategies. Some key quantitative variables that define this habitat template can be identified by characterizing how individual organisms use their physical environment, and by using dimensionless physical variables that reveal common energetic properties in different systems.

We used predictable variation in algal δ13C with water velocity, and measurements of consumer δ13C and δ15N to examine carbon flow and trophic structure in food webs of the South Fork Eel River in Northern California. Analyses of δ13C showed that the most abundant macroinvertebrate groups (collector-gatherers and scrapers) relied on algae from local sources within their riffle or shallow pool habitats. In contrast, filter-feeding invertebrates in riffles relied in part on algal production derived from upstream shallow pools. Riffle invertebrate predators also relied in part on consumers of pool-derived algal carbon. One abundant taxon drifting from shallow pools and riffles (baetid mayflies) relied on algal production derived from the habitats from which they dispersed. The trophic linkage from pool algae to riffle invertebrate predators was thus mediated through either predation on pool herbivores dispersing into riffles, or on filter feeders. Algal production in shallow pool habitats dominated the resource base of vertebrate predators in all habitats at the end of the summer. We could not distinguish between the trophic roles of riffle algae and terrestrial detritus, but both carbon sources appeared to play minor roles for vertebrate consumers. In shallow pools, small vertebrates, including three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), roach (Hesperoleucas symmetricus), and rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa), relied on invertebrate prey derived from local pool habitats. During the most productive summer period, growth of all size classes of steelhead and resident rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in all habitats (shallow pools, riffles, and deep unproductive pools) was largely derived from algal production in shallow pools. Preliminary data suggest that the strong role of shallow pool algae in riffle steelhead growth during summer periods was due to drift of pool invertebrates to riffles, rather than movement of riffle trout. Data for δ15N showed that resident rainbow trout (25-33 cm standard length) in deep pools preyed upon small size classes of juvenile steelhead that were most often found in riffles or shallow pools.

Few IBMs have been shown to reproduce realistic patterns of behavior by individual organisms. To test our IBM of stream salmonids and draw conclusions about foraging theory, we analyzed the IBM's ability to reproduce six patterns of habitat selection by real trout in simulations contrasting three alternative habitat-selection objectives: maximizing current growth rate, current survival probability, or ""expected maturity"" (EM). EM is the product of (1) predicted survival of starvation and other mortality risks over a future time horizon, and (2) the fraction of reproductive size attained over the time horizon. Minimizing the ratio of mortality risk to growth rate was not tested as a habitat-selection rule because it produces nonsensical results when any habitat yields negative growth rates. The IBM simulates habitat selection in response to spatial and temporal variation in mortality risks and food availability as fish compete for food. The model fish move each daily time step to maximize their habitat-selection objective with no other restrictions (e.g., territoriality) imposed. Simulations with habitat selected to maximize growth reproduced three of the six habitat-selection patterns; maximizing survival reproduced two patterns; and maximizing EM reproduced all six patterns. Two patterns (shifts in habitat with changes in temperature and food availability) were not reproduced by the objectives that consider only current growth and risk but were explained by the EM objective that considers how future starvation risk depends on current energy reserves and energy intake. In 75-d simulations, population-level survival and biomass accumulation were highest for fish moving to maximize EM. These results support the basic assumptions of state-based dynamic-modeling approaches to habitat selection. Our IBM appears successful because it avoids restrictive assumptions, incorporates competition for food, assumes salmonids make good habitat-selection decisions at a daily time step, and uses a habitat objective (EM) that provides reasonable trade-offs between growth and mortality risks.",180,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Foraging | Habitat selection | Individual-based model | Model testing | Modeling | Movement motivation | Rules for habitat selection | Salmonidae | State-based | Stream fish | Trout,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,144,NA,NA,NA

Indirect effects of subsidies may be either positive or negative depending on the behavior of the shared consumer. Here we document strong links between riverine insects, riparian lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis), and terrestrial invertebrates. We hypothesized that aquatic insects subsidize riparian lizard populations leading to higher growth rates of these lizards in near-river habitats, and that subsidies exert short-term positive effects on terrestrial resources as a result of diet shifts by lizards to aquatic insects. To test these hypotheses, we used 2 m high fences, or ""subsidy shields,"" to experimentally reduce aquatic insect flux to large (91 m2) enclosures of lizards. Subsidy shields reduced aquatic insect flux by 55-65%. Growth rates of lizards were 7 x higher in subsidized (no-shield) enclosures during the early summer but were not significantly different later in the summer, when ambient fluxes of aquatic insects dropped to 20% of their early season levels. Within the watershed, lizard growth rates (in mass) were positively correlated with the numerical abundance of aquatic insects. Thus, lizard growth rates tracked both seasonal and spatial availability of riverine insect subsidies during our, experiment. Subsidies also had indirect effects on the ground-dwelling, terrestrial prey of lizards. Declines of diurnal terrestrial invertebrates were significantly higher in shield than no-shield enclosures, and the most common ground spider (Arctosa sp. [Lycosidae]) disappeared completely from shield enclosures by the end of the experiment. Declines in terrestrial invertebrate abundance did not differ between no-shield enclosures and lizard exclosures.

One prediction of the multifaceted parental-investment hypothesis is that colonies with greater brood production will rear a greater proportion of their diploid offspring as reproductive females (gynes), rather than workers. This study shows the positive correlation between female-biased sex ratio and the production of brood by female-producing colonies was not the outcome of a trade-off in the production of workers vs. gynes. The main prediction of the constant-female hypothesis is that investment in gynes should be constant. We found extreme variation among colonies in the number of gynes produced. By contrast, all the predictions of the queen-replenishment hypothesis were supported. The queen-replenishment hypothesis predicts that colonies produce gynes only when queen number is so low that colony production of brood is reduced, or colony survival threatened. We found that, as predicted by this hypothesis, female-producing colonies had fewer queens and produced a lower biomass of brood than male-producing colonies. In contrast, male-producing colonies had lower production per queen, and were more likely to be limited by external resources. This suggests that queen number limits production in female-producing colonies.

Split lines provided a significantly better fit than straight lines in 32 of 42 cases and explained an average of 81.3% of the variation in trout abundance. The slopes of the first phase typically were not significantly different from zero and were shallower than predictions from either energetic or territorial allometry, whereas those of the second phase were steeper. This pattern strongly suggested that resource availability for brown trout was size-dependent in our study sites. Cohorts did not appear to be self-thinning initially, but resources (presumably pool habitat) seemed to become progressively more limiting as trout grew to lengths exceeding 14-15 cm.

Here, observations of coyote (Canis latrans) packs hunting deer are used to show that mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), which typically stand high on slopes and on rugged terrain increased both their risk of being encountered and attacked by coyotes by standing low rather than high on slopes. The risk incurred at certain heights was not fixed: a mule deer's risk of being approached by coyotes was also affected by the height of other mule deer groups present during the same hunt. White-tailed deer (O. virginianus), which typically use gentle terrain, were not similarly disadvantaged by remaining low on slopes or on flat terrain. When confronted by coyotes, mule deer moved to and up slopes, whereas white-tails moved down and away from slopes. Species differences in behavior were independent of starting position and were observed for animals in mixed-species groups. Unlike their response to coyotes, feeding preferences or competition did not lead mule deer to use rugged habitats: mule deer moved down and left slopes to feed, bringing them closer to white-tails. These results suggest that coyote predation contributes to the habitat segregation of white-tails and mule deer (1) by selective predation against mule deer but not white-tails in gentle habitats and (2) by eliciting differing antipredator behavior that increases their segregation. Unlike prey involved in other examples of predator-mediated resource partitioning, white-tails and mule deer are similar in size and morphology.

Regression of log-transformed data demonstrated that more variance in maximum dispersal distance could be explained by home range area (74%) than could be explained by body size (50%). The relationship between maximum dispersal distance and home range size was isometric (slope = 1) when the square root of home range area (i.e., linear dimension of home range) was used. Thus, maximum dispersal distance was related to home range size by a single constant of 40. A linear relationship remained between these two variables after the effects of body size were removed (F = 31.6, df = 1, 32, P = 3.2 × 10-6 R2 = 0.50). A similar isometric relationship with home range size was found for median dispersal distance (related by a multiple of 7).

The slope and intercept of this relationship were not different from those of the relationship between maximum dispersal distance and home range area. We suggest that the vagility of mammals affected both home range size and dispersal distance (or movement after translocation) independently of body size, such that these movements could be predicted by home range area better than by body size alone.

Growth yields in terms of C, N, and P were positively correlated to total P level. Total biomasses in terms of C and N, but not P, were also positively correlated to light level. The cell quotas of C were positively correlated with light, whereas cell quotas of P were negatively correlated with light. The resulting elemental ratios gave a quite consistent pattern, where high light caused significant reductions in both N:C and P:C ratios, as well as strong reductions in chlorophyll to carbon ratios. The increase in P:C ratio with increasing total P and decreasing light can be interpreted as an adaptive response to self-shading. In that case, our results indicate that light adaptation not only involves a cost in terms of increased chlorophyll synthesis, but also in terms of increased P demands. This provides new insight not only into the physiological regulation of C and P uptake in algae, but it could also explain deviations from the Redfield ratio. The growth of juvenile Daphnia magna fed S. capricornutum from the different light and phosphorus treatments was studied in a series of short-term assays (7 d) covering a gradient of food concentrations. The response of Daphnia growth rate along this quantity (0.5-5.0 mg C/L) and quality (0.5-12 μg atomic P-[mg atomic C]-1) gradient gave a close fit to a double hyperbola model. Changes in elemental ratios of the algae were reflected in the growth rate of Daphnia, such that up to 40% reduction in its growth rate could be attributed to increased C:P ratios.

(2) Are top-down and bottom-up forces of dual importance in limiting primary producers? (3) Do grazing fishes modulate the degree of resource limitation We obtained several lines of evidence suggesting that Andean stream algae are nitrogen limited. Addition of nitrogen in flow-through channels resulted in major increases in algal standing crop, whereas there were no measurable effects of phosphorus enrichment. Interestingly, the N2-fixing cyanobacteria Anabaena was one of the taxa that responded most dramatically to the addition of nitrogen. Moreover, nutrient uptake rates were significantly higher for inorganic nitrogen (NO3-N and NH4-N) compared to phosphorus (PO4-P). Nutrients and the presence of grazing fishes were manipulated simultaneously in a series of experiments by using nutrient-diffusing substrates in fish exclusions vs. open cages accessible to the natural fish assemblage. We observed strong effects of both nitrogen addition and consumers on algal standing crop, although consumer limitation was found to be of considerably greater magnitude than resource limitation in influencing algal biomass and composition. Finally, the degree of resource limitation varied as a consequence of grazing fishes. Experiments examining nutrient limitation in the presence and absence of fishes showed that the response to nitrogen enrichment was significantly greater on substrates accessible to natural fish assemblages compared to substrates where grazing fishes were excluded.

We examined whether this shade avoidance response varies among and within natural populations of A. thaliana, and whether it corresponds to variable selection regimes at shaded and unshaded field sites, by conducting a two-year reciprocal transplant study and a parallel greenhouse study that manipulated the presence and timing of shade. In the field, shading had limited or inconsistent impacts on survivorship across several phases of the growing season. The date of bolting was earlier at the shadier site compared to the less shady site, but in the greenhouse there was no significant shade-induced plasticity for this trait. In both studies, we detected directional selection gradients favoring earlier bolting in shade, but gradients favoring earlier bolting were as strong in nonshaded conditions. The number of rosette leaves at bolting (i.e., the developmental stage of flowering) was significantly reduced by shade in both studies. However, there was either no directional selection on this trait, or selection to flower with more rather than fewer leaves. Despite the contrast in habitats, there was limited differentiation between populations for survivorship, reproductive fitness, size-related or flowering time traits, and no differentiation for trait plasticities. Some traits were variable among families within populations. A trade-off between age and developmental stage may limit the response to selection for flowering time, possibly explaining limited local adaptation.

Such a constraint generates many different kinds of ecological relationships ranging from aspects of animal mineral nutrition to factors affecting consumer-driven nutrient recycling. Although previous studies have shown variation in zooplankton nutrient content within and between taxa, most stoichiometric studies assume that consumers are homeostatic in their elemental composition. In this paper, this assumption is reexamined as we describe the variability in the elemental content of the calanoid copepod Mixodiaptomus laciniatus Lilljeborg throughout its ontogeny (interstage variability) and for its specific developmental stages (intrastage variability). Mean copepod carbon content as dry mass increased significantly during ontogeny from 36.3% in nauplii to 51.5% in immature copepodites and 55.8% in adults. Mean phosphorus content decreased from 0.98% in nauplii to 0.87% in immature copepodites and 0.51% in adults. The copepod molar C:N:P ratio was 99:3:1 for nauplii, 165:13:1 for immature copepodites, and 234:25:1 for adults. These ontogenetic variations in stoichiometry within a single copepod species are comparable to the previously described range between taxa. Stoichiometric and physiological approaches are used as complementary tools to explain the two-part life history strategy of this copepod. First, the nauplii and early copepodite stages (CI-CIV) with high carbon demands adopt a growth strategy during which carbon sources are mainly allocated to increases in body size. The susceptibility of these copepodite stages to carbon limitation is reflected in the decline in the carbon content for a given stage (e.g., from 66% to 38% C in CII) and in the 40-fold decrease in neutral-to-polar lipid ratio toward the end of the ice-free season, suggesting a mobilization of food reserves toward growth. In contrast, copepodite stage CV and adults with less carbon demands for growth followed a survival-reproductive strategy, where the invariability in carbon content as dry mass (near 60%) and in neutral-to-polar lipid ratio through time indicates no accumulation of storage lipids, but instead an allocation of resources toward maintenance or reproduction. The basic assumption of predictions of stoichiometric models that elemental composition remains constant with time are not supported by changes in the intrastage carbon and nitrogen contents of Mixodiaptomus laciniatus. Thus, we suggest that the idea of strict homeostasis may be replaced with the concept of rheostasis, which allows the homeostatic regulatory mechanisms of an organism to adjust to a changing environment over time.",73,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Carbon | Homeostasis | Life history strategies | Lipid ratio | Nitrogen | Ontogeny | Phosphorus | Rheostasis | Stoichiometry | Zooplankton,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,158,NA,NA,NA

Predation is one factor that can have widespread effects on the mean trait value in a prey population because predators can impact prey traits through a number of processes. Predators can directly induce prey phenotypes through visual and chemical cues, predators can indirectly alter prey phenotypes by thinning the prey population (thereby reducing competition), and predators can cause selection on prey phenotypes through nonrandom killing. Ecologists are beginning to understand each of these three processes in isolation, but these processes act on prey phenotypes simultaneously, and we lack information on the relative importance of these processes in determining the final phenotype of prey. I used a system of gray treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor) and dragonfly predators (Anax longipes) to determine the separate and combined impacts of induction, thinning, and selection on the behavior, morphology, and growth of tadpoles reared in aquatic mesocosms. Using combinations of hand thinning, cues emitted from caged predators, and lethal predators, I demonstrated that the impact of lethal predators on growth was mediated primarily through thinning, the impact on morphology was primarily through induction, and the impact on behavior was affected similarly through thinning and induction. Surprisingly, while we know from numerous studies that the dragonflies kill tadpoles nonrandomly, selection did not have a significant impact on the final phenotypes of the tadpoles. This work appears to be the first study that identifies the relative magnitudes of the three predatory processes on a suite of prey phenotypes. The three processes can have opposing or supporting effects, the relative magnitudes of which likely differ among systems, illustrating why we often observe contradictory results when we examine the impact of lethal predators on prey phenotypes.

First, in the absence of elk, there is a positive relationship between burn severity and the regeneration of aspens via asexual reproduction. Specifically, aboveground biomass of aspen resprouts was 10 times greater at sites of high burn severity than in sites of intermediate burn severity, and there was virtually no aspen regeneration without fire. Second, elk selectively browsed aspen ramets in high-severity burn sites two times more intensely than aspen ramets in intermediate-severity burn sites, largely negating the enhanced regeneration that would have otherwise occurred, thus resulting in three times greater regeneration in intermediate burn sites than in high burn sites. Third, fire and elk browsing had opposing impacts on an arthropod community composed of 33 taxa from 11 orders and 21 families. Fire severity alone showed no effect on arthropod richness and abundance; however, intermediate-severity fire and moderate levels of elk browsing resulted in 30% greater richness and almost 40% greater abundance.

To test the interdependence of C and N cycles in forested streams, we continuously added DOC, as potassium acetate, to the stream draining Watershed six at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, for six weeks during summer 1999. For two months prior to and throughout the addition, we monitored streamwater NO3- and NH4+ concentrations throughout the 70-m upstream reference and the 70-m downstream treatment reaches. We also estimated uptake lengths and uptake rates of NO3- and NH4+ using back-to-back, short-term enrichments in both the treatment and reference reaches. The change in NO3- concentration during the NH4+ addition was used to estimate whole-stream nitrification. Once before the DOC addition and once during the DOC addition we measured denitrification rates and whole-stream respiration in both reaches. In the treatment reach, the increase in labile DOC caused nitrate concentrations to decrease from pretreatment concentrations during the DOC addition. Metabolism was higher in the treatment than in the reference reach during that addition, while metabolism had been similar in the two reaches before the DOC addition. Prior to that addition, uptake lengths for both NO3- and NH4+ were longer in the treatment reach than in the reference reach. During the DOC addition, the uptake lengths for both forms of nitrogen were much shorter in the treatment than in the reference reach. Contrary to expectations, the DOC enrichment did not lead to increased rates of denitrification. The principal effect of DOC enrichment was to stimulate bacterial growth, leading to high respiration and a corresponding increase in the assimilative demand for nitrogen.

We found that the species with higher synchronized flowering within a population had larger fluctuation of annual seed production at the population level. The coefficient of concordance of flowering and the coefficient of variation of annual seed production were continuously distributed among species, making it difficult to distinguish masting from nonmasting species. The annual seed production patterns of the 16 species were classified, by cluster analysis, into groups that synchronize their fluctuation of annual seed production. This analysis showed a highly synchronized annual seed production, not only among congeneric species, but also among species of different families. Although our results have some insufficiency of statistical significance, they did show that predator satiation, both in a population and a guild, effectively operated for many species to enhance seed survival at the pre-dispersal stage. They also showed that pollination efficiency was likely to be operating at the population level for half of the wind-pollinating species. However, generalist predator satiation at the postdispersal seed stage may not operate in a simple, detectable manner in this species-rich forest community. It is highly probable that there are combined effects of several factors: limited weather triggers for flowering, common flowering physiology among taxonomically related species, and the ecological advantages at the population and guild levels, may cause multiple species to have synchronized fluctuation patterns of seed production.",102,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Japan | Masting | Ogawa Forest Reserve | Pollination efficiency | Predator satiation | Seed production | Synchrony | Temperate deciduous forest,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,164,NA,NA,NA

Natural selection that stabilizes the resulting hybrid zones should rest in part on the adaptation to different breeding habitat of the pure taxa. While B. bombina lays its eggs in semipermanent ponds, B. variegata is a typical puddle breeder. Here, we investigate whether selection for rapid larval development in B. variegata has resulted in the loss of effective antipredator defenses, thus excluding this species from predator-rich ponds. We collected adults from four populations in Romania (two for each taxon) and reared the offspring from four crosses per population in the laboratory either in the presence or in the absence of caged odonate predators (Aeshna cyanea). In predation trials, we found no taxon difference in mortality rate among tadpoles that had been reared with predators. The resilience of B. variegata tadpoles may have been due to their remarkable phenotypic plasticity. In both taxa, predator presence led to the development of a higher tail fin, which has been shown to reduce predation rates in other amphibians. This response was much stronger in B. variegata than in B. bombina. Moreover, differences between the two B. variegata populations in terms of laboratory predation rates and levels of plasticity correlated with predator abundance at the collection sites so as to suggest local adaptation in predator defenses. Finally, delayed metamorphosis in the predator-induced morphs of both taxa implies a cost to the defense. Given the heterogeneity of temporary habitat in terms of desiccation rate and predator occurrence, the greater amount of phenotypic plasticity in B. variegata fits predictions of life history theory.

In 1962, Kuhn proposed that paradigms form within the dual contexts of empirical evidence and intellectual history. Facts potentially contradictory to a paradigm may not be recognized until they are observed repeatedly and incorporated as supportive evidence into a new theory. Support for this interpretation can be found in the history of a paradigm of predation in rocky intertidal communities. Hypotheses were developed in the contexts of innovative field experiments and historical arguments of competition theory. The resulting paradigm proposed that predators restrict populations of competitively dominant prey to refuges. Different types of refuge, or no refuge, prevail in different areas of the intertidal zone, accounting for patterns of prey distribution, the coexistence of natural enemies, and the local maintenance of diversity. An ensuing period of criticism made reference to potential contradictions. Rather than by predation alone, prey abundances are determined largely by an interplay of varying rates of predation and prey production. Furthermore, prey refuges are neither necessary nor sufficient to explain all observed instances of local coexistence of predators and prey. We present a model in which intertidal boundaries of prey are set by equilibria between predation and prey production. Predation and prey productivity vary with environmental gradients and with explicit spatial configurations of the prey. This synthesis relies on insights of the original paradigm, incorporates the contradictory observations, and depends on novel capabilities afforded by spatially explicit computer simulations. The resulting synthesis provides explanations for distinctive aspects of zonation, including abrupt prey boundaries in continuous gradients of predation, and converging upper and lower prey boundaries in gradients of decreasing wave exposure.",68,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Competition | Diversity | Mytilus | Niche | Paradigm | Pisaster | Predation | Refuge | Regulation | Rocky intertidal communities | Zonation,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,169,NA,NA,NA

Applied to 154 pairs of actual ecological time series, RIA done at the 5% level rejected the hypothesis of no association 20% of the time when both units were in fact undisturbed, and 30% of the time when one of the two units had received an intervention.

For example, population change is routinely estimated for many species from surveys such as the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), and the species are grouped and used in comparative analyses. We developed a hierarchical model for estimation of group attributes from a collection of estimates of population trend. The model uses information from predefined groups of species to provide a context and to supplement data for individual species; summaries of group attributes are improved by statistical methods that simultaneously analyze collections of trend estimates. The model is Bayesian; trends are treated as random variables rather than fixed parameters. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to fit the model. Standard assessments of population stability cannot distinguish magnitude of trend and statistical significance of trend estimates, but the hierarchical model allows us to legitimately describe the probability that a trend is within given bounds. Thus we define population stability in terms of the probability that the magnitude of population change for a species is less than or equal to a predefined threshold. We applied the model to estimates of trend for 399 species from the BBS to estimate the proportion of species with increasing populations and to identify species with unstable populations. Analyses are presented for the collection of all species and for 12 species groups commonly used in BBS summaries. Overall, we estimated that 49% of species in the BBS have positive trends and 33 species have unstable populations.

We study the population-dynamic consequences of size-dependent predation using a model of a size-structured, cannibalistic fish population with one shared, alternative resource. We assume that a prey can be captured by a predator if the ratio of prey length to predator length is within a specific range, referred to as the ""predation window."" We find that the lower limit of the predation window (δ) has a major impact on population dynamics, whereas the upper limit (ε) mainly affects population structure and individual life history. For large δ, cannibalism cannot decimate young-of-year (YOY) cohorts. Size-dependent competition then results in recruit-driven, single-cohort cycles. With low δ, cannibalism regulates recruitment, resulting in coexistence of many year classes. With intermediate δ, periods of regulation by cannibalism alternate with periods with severe competition. Occasional high densities of small individuals enable a few cannibals to reach giant sizes, producing a bimodal population size distribution. With small ε, all individuals remain small; the population is stunted. Large piscivores can exist only if induced dynamically in population fluctuations. Above a critical ε, large piscivores are present permanently, even in stable populations. The critical effect of ε relates to the ontogenetic niche shift from planktivory to piscivory. Observed population dynamics of Eurasian perch, yellow perch, and Arctic char, described in the literature, are discussed and, based on our modeling results, can be related to differences in the predation windows of these species.

In this study, the interplay between interspecific competition and abiotic factors is examined with respect to whether scrub habitats in southern California become invaded by the Argentine ant (Linepithema humile). Argentine ants penetrate further into and attain higher abundances in mesic scrub fragments than they do in xeric scrub fragments. Probably as a result, native ant richness is lower in small (<30 ha), mesic fragments than in either small, xeric fragments or in small plots in unfragmented areas. Compared to six species of native ants, Argentine ants ranked lowest in their ability to tolerate high temperatures in the laboratory with 100% of field-collected workers dying after 60 min of exposure to temperatures ≥46°C. Field data corroborate these results; mean temperatures at which colonies of Argentine ants attained maximum abundance at baits (34.0°C) and abandoned baits (41.6°C) were both lower than for the native ant Dorymyrmex insanus. Laboratory studies further revealed that low levels of soil moisture depress mean worker survival in experimental colonies of Argentine ants. In a factorial laboratory experiment that varied both physical conditions and interspecific competition, Argentine ants exhibited greater worker activity and survival under warm, moist conditions than under hot, dry conditions, whereas the presence of a competitor, Forelius mccooki, had no significant effect. Experimental colonies of F. mccooki, in contrast, were more active under hot, dry conditions than under warm, moist conditions and exhibited reduced activity in the presence of L. humile irrespective of physical conditions. Taken together, these experimental data demonstrate how the abiotic environment impinges on both colony-level activity and colony growth in the Argentine ant and provide a general explanation for the patterns observed at the community level. A key consequence of the condition-specific nature of the competitive asymmetry between Argentine ants and native ants is that community-level vulnerability to invasion appears to depend primarily on the suitability of the physical environment from the perspective of L. humile.",192,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Abiotic factors | Biological invasions | Competitive exclusion | Condition-specific competition | Habitat fragmentation | Interspecific competition | Linepithema humile,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,175,NA,NA,NA

This study focused on inducible defenses in the intertidal snail, Littorina obtusata, in response to the invasive green crab, Carcinus maenas, in the Gulf of Maine. We used widely separated (∼400 km) snail populations from northern Maine and Massachusetts because they differ in their extent of historical and present-day contact With C. maenas. Crabs are presently more abundant in the southern Gulf and have been there for twice as long (∼100 yr). We examined whether these geographic differences in contact history and abundance may contribute to geographic differences in risk cue sensitivity, the amount of induced defense, and the scaling of trade-offs accompanying the induced defense. Risk cues from both crabs and damaged conspecifics induced the greatest increases in snail shell thickness, whereas exposure to just crab cues induced intermediate levels of thickening. Interestingly, our results suggest that the effects of risk cues are additive and that geographic differentiation in cue sensitivity only occurs in response to crab cues. While northern snails showed greater shell thickness plasticity in response to crab cues, there was no geographic differentiation in sensitivity to cues from damaged conspecifics. We also found that the scaling of trade-offs in body size vs. shell thickness was similar for both regions. This result contrasts with theory because one would expect the more intense selection regime caused by increased crab predation in the southern Gulf to diminish the impact of trade-offs on southern snails. However, this result is consistent with the hypotheses that (1) trade-offs in body size are likely mediated by architectural constraints imposed by the shell and (2) circumventing these constraints via changes in Shell shape would likely result in a shell that is more vulnerable to crab predation. Analysis of aperture area and spire height for field populations revealed no geographic differentiation in aperture area, but taller spires in northern snails. Hence, more intense selection via crab predation in the southern Gulf may prevent changes in shell shape that reduce the impact of trade-offs.

It helped to galvanize the empirical field of comparative life-history and dominated thinking on the subject from the late 1960s through the 1970s. Large quantities of field data were collected that claimed to test predictions of the theory. By the early 1980s, sentiment about the theory had changed so completely that a proposal to test it or the use of it to interpret empirical results would likely be viewed as archaic and naïve. The theory was displaced by demographic models that concentrated on mortality patterns as the cause of life-history evolution. Although demographic models are known for their density-independent approach and focus on extrinsic mortality, these models can incorporate many ecological features captured by r- and K-selection, such as density-dependent population regulation, resource availability, and environmental fluctuations. We highlight the incorporation of these factors in recent theory, then show how they are manifest in our research on life-history evolution in Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Explanations of the repeatable suites of life-history differences across populations of guppies originate from demographic models of predator-driven age-specific mortality. Recently, careful examination of guppy demography and habitat has revealed that density-dependent regulation and resource availability may have influenced the evolution of guppy life histories. In the field, these factors covary with predation risk; however, they can be uncoupled experimentally, providing insight into how they may have synergistically driven guppy life-history evolution.

Regulation thus requires density-dependent negative feedback whereby the population has a propensity to increase when small and decrease when large. Ultimately, extinction occurs due to regulating mechanisms becoming weaker than various disruptive events and stochastic variation. Population regulation is one of the foundational concepts of ecology, yet this paradigm has often been challenged, during the first half of the 20th century when the concept was not clearly defined, and more recently by some who study demographically open populations. The history of ecology reveals that earlier manifestations of the concept focused mostly on competition as the mechanism of population regulation. Because competition is often not evident in nature, it was sometimes concluded that population regulation was therefore also absent. However, predation in the broadest sense can also cause density dependence. By the 1950s, the idea that demographic density dependence was essential (but not sufficient) for population regulation was well established, and since then, challenges to the general concept have been short lived. However, some now believe that metapopulations composed of demographically open local populations can persist without density dependence. In particular, some recent manifestations of the Recruitment Limitation Hypothesis all but preclude the possibility of regulation. The theory of locally open populations indicates that persistence always relies on direct demographic density dependence at some spatial and temporal scale, even in models reportedly demonstrating the contrary. There is also increasing empirical evidence, especially in marine, systems where competition for space is not self evident, that local density dependence is more pervasive than previously assumed and is often caused by predation. However, there are currently insufficient data to test unequivocally whether or not any persistent metapopulation is regulated. The challenge for more complete understanding of regulation of metapopulations lies in combined empirical and theoretical studies that bridge the gap between smaller scale field experiments and larger scale phenomena that can presently be explored solely by theory.",295,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,Closed populations | Density dependence | Metapopulations | Open populations | Population regulation | Recruitment limitation,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,182,NA,NA,NA

Pathogen load was almost three times greater in the average monoculture than in the average plot planted with 24 grassland plant species, an approximately natural diversity. Eleven individual diseases increased in severity (percentage of leaf area infected by a single disease) at lower plant species richness, and severity of only one disease was positively correlated with diversity. For 10 of the 11 diseases whose severity was negatively related to diversity, disease severity was positively correlated with host abundance, and in six of these cases, species diversity had no effect on disease severity after controlling for the effects of host abundance. These results suggest that increased abundances of individual host species at lower species diversity increased disease transmission and severity. In 1996 and 1997, similar results for a smaller number of diseases sampled were found in this experiment and another similar one. Although the effect of diversity on disease was highly significant, considerable variance in pathogen load remained among. plots of a given diversity level. Much of this residual variance was explained by community characteristics that were a function of the species composition of the communities (the identity of species present vs. those lost). Specifically, communities that lost less disease-prone species had higher pathogen loads; this effect explained more variance in pathogen load than did diversity. Also, communities that lost the species dominant at high diversity had higher pathogen loads, presumably because relaxed competition allowed greater increases in host abundances, but this effect was weak. Among plant species, disease proneness appeared to be determined more by regional than local processes, because it was better correlated with frequency of the plant species' populations across the region than with local abundance or frequency across the state. In total, our results support the hypothesis that decreased species diversity will increase foliar pathogen load if this increases host abundance and, therefore, disease transmission.

These conflicts include whether ecosystem or community ecology provides better insights into the workings of nature, the relative importance of biotic vs. abiotic factors in governing community composition and structure, the virtues of phenomenological vs. mechanistic research, the relationship between biodiversity and stability, the relative importance of taxonomic vs. functional diversity, and the relative strengths of observation vs. experimental approaches. Although the tone of the debate has been regrettable, its magnitude signifies the emergence of a new paradigm, one in a series of debates associated with the dialectic that has structured ecological inquiry over two millennia of Western science. This dialectic concerns the tension between those who seek to explain nature by studying its parts and those who seek to explain nature by studying whole-system behavior. Philosophers and historians argue that such a dialectic generates cycles in which a central tenet is challenged by an emerging paradigm, generating new theories and new data to test the emerging paradigm. The scientific community evaluates the accumulating evidence (and it is here that the debates arise), and if subscription to the emerging paradigm increases sufficiently, the emerging paradigm evolves into a new central tenet. Fractionation within the sciences exacerbates this cycle because subdisciplines often focus on either the parts or the whole. Such splintering can be traced to the abandonment of the holistic approach of Aristotelian science during the Scientific Revolution. While such holism may have lessened debate, some have argued that it stagnated Western science. The dialectic, the cycles of emerging paradigms it generates, and the debates that surround each emergence represent the vehicle by which ecology moves forward. Emerging paradigms force scientists to revisit central tenets, pitting old ideas against new theories and new data, and this revisiting is what generates the sense of déjà vu and the cycles of vigorous debate, but ultimately each cycle leads to synthesis and progress. The emerging paradigm that biodiversity governs ecosystem function is rapidly evolving. In the words of Thomas Kuhn, its controversial experiments have successfully articulated the paradigm. It has successfully challenged ecology's central tenet that biodiversity is primarily an epiphenomenon of ecosystem function secondarily structured by community processes. In its most extreme form, it claims that the reverse is true. Of course, neither the central tenet of ecology nor the emerging paradigm is correct in an absolute sense, but the dialectic that promoted the emergence of biodiversity and ecosystem function as a paradigm redirected ecology to focus on the feedback between ecosystem function and biodiversity rather than studying them independently. The final stage in the evolution of this emerging paradigm will be explicit tests of synthetic mechanisms that have been proposed. Familiarity with the ecological dialectic provides a framework by which ecologists can understand the origin and utility of paradigms in ecology, provides a proper context for the debate that surrounds paradigms as they emerge, promotes synthesis, and deters intellectual chauvinism that may inadvertently accompany specialization within ecology.",302,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Biodiversity | Community | Ecology | Ecosystem ecology | Ecosystem function | Paradigm,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,184,NA,NA,NA

In the first generation (low densities) all demographic rates were reduced by cadmium exposure, whereas in the second generation (high densities), survival of old larvae and pupae was higher in cadmium-exposed populations than in control populations.

Density dependence is inferred as skewness increases with increased density, and the average length decreases with increased density. The skewness, average length, and abundance of juvenile cod caught in the autumn are shown to be influenced by the meteorological conditions in the spring (i.e., during the larval period).

The increase in kill rates coincided with a decline in the condition of juvenile (but not adult) deer in late winter (mean marrow fat content in the femur 66% in October-January vs. 27% in February-March). Per capita kill rates decreased slightly (not significantly) with the increasing size of wolf hunting group. However, the amount of food acquired per wolf did not differ among groups containing 2-6 individuals, because larger packs killed bigger prey more often and small prey less frequently than did small packs. Wolf kill rates on wild boar were higher in spring-summer (0.242 ± 0.06 boar·(pack)-1·d-1), when piglets were present, than in autumn-winter (0.106 ± 0.04 boar·(pack)-1·d-1). Annually, wolves killed on average 72 red deer, 16 roe deer, and 31 wild boar over a 100-km2 area. Compared to prey densities, wolves were an important agent of mortality for red deer only, taking annually 12% of spring-summer (seasonally highest) numbers of deer, which was equivalent to 40% of deer annual increase due to breeding and 40% of their annual mortality. Compared to winter densities (3-6 deer/km2), percentage predation by wolves was inversely density dependent; thus wolves limited deer numbers but did not regulate prey population. By eliminating a substantial proportion of the annual production of the deer population, wolves hamper its growth and prolong the time until it reaches carrying capacity of the habitat. However, wolf predation alone is a poor predictor of deer population dynamics, because deer are also subject to lynx (Lynx lynx) predation and hunting harvest.",192,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Canis lupus | Capreolus capreolus | Cervus elaphus | Deer population | Density dependence of predation | European pristine forests | Hunting group size | Snow cover | Sus scrofa | Wolf kill rates,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,191,NA,NA,NA

It has been explained either by restricted dispersal, intraspecific spillover resulting from density inflation, benign and predictable climate, or by the ecological release that results from species impoverishment. The latter hypothesis has been frequently invoked to explain shifts and/or broadenings of elevational ranges on islands. In this paper, we compared the elevational distribution of 85 terrestrial breeding bird species on a Mediterranean island (Corsica) with their mainland counterparts in a control area of similar altitude, latitude, and climate (Eastern Pyrenees). We calculated specific altitudinal amplitudes in both areas from the upper and lower limits of the bird ranges in the breeding season. We then calculated Island/Mainland Amplitude Ratio (IMAR) for each species. The ratios we found showed an overall trend in favor of range compressions on Corsica, despite a lower number of species on the island than on the mainland. However the well-differentiated subspecies-level endemics are the ones more likely to expand their ranges on the island. Their frequency is highest in the middle of the elevational gradient, in the cool forests situated between 1400 m and 2000 m. The non-Mediterranean and non-alpine nature of endemism on Corsica, together with the niche broadening of the endemic forms, can be explained by taking into account Pleistocene glacial-interglacial cycles. The resulting up and down and back again shift of the bioclimatic belts tended, in turn, to eliminate the lower ranging and the higher ranging species from the elevational gradient. The belt that persisted throughout the cycles was the mid-altitude belt, where differentiation processes had sufficient time to lead to endemism. This mechanism also tended to broaden the species ranges, both by selecting among the colonizers those that already had wide ranges on the mainland and by exerting selective pressures on the residents in favor of the broadening of their ranges. More recently, human activities on the island have favored the immigration of undifferentiated species whose elevational ranges are still relatively low.",32,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,"Altitudinal zonation | Breeding birds | Corsica | Elevational gradient | Habitat-niche expansion | Islands, habitat broadening | Mediterranean | Pleistocene, climatic cycles | Pyrenees | Range expansion",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,192,NA,NA,NA

To describe these interrelationships, we study and test three patterns regarding species richness using species-area models. The first one is the widely accepted generalization that states that the number of species monotonically increases with sampling area. The second pattern predicts the decrease in species richness with the increase of species dominance in a given area. The third one predicts that spatial aggregation of individuals within species results in lower species richness in communities. These three generalizations were investigated by modeling and simulations. First, a random-placement species-area model was used to evaluate the effects of relative species abundances on species richness in a sampling area. Then, a nonrandom species-area model was derived which explicitly encompasses the spatial distributions of species; it served to evaluate the effects of heterogeneity in spatial distributions on species richness. Species-area models were numerically evaluated using parameters estimated from a tropical rain forest community, and simulations were conducted to support the numerical solutions. The three patterns regarding species diversity were consistently supported by the results. A discussion ensues, describing how the three patterns can be used to interpret and predict species diversity, and how they are supported by other diversity hypotheses. The three generalizations suggest that, if we want to understand species diversity, we should go and look for mechanisms that influence the abundances and spatial distributions of species. If a mechanism can make the species abundances more even, or their spatial distributions more regular, this factor likely contributes to species coexistence.",299,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Abundance | Aggregation | Community ecology | Dominance | Evenness | Random placement | Scale | Spatial distribution | Species diversity | Species richness | Species-abundance model | Species-area,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,193,NA,NA,NA

If slower growth reduces fitness, then organisms at higher latitudes may evolve compensatory responses for these climatic effects. Two such forms of local adaptation with increasing latitude are possible: (1) the capacity for growth may shift to a lower range of temperatures (i.e., temperature adaptation) or (2) maximum growth rate may evolve inversely with length of the growing season (i.e., countergradient variation). A third alternative is a mixed strategy involving both of the above. We hypothesized that the form of local adaptation may be affected by constraints that vary within vs. among species. We used common-environment experiments to compare reaction norms for growth in response to temperature among local populations of two contiguous, closely related fish species, the Atlantic silverside, Menidia menidia (L.), and the tidewater silverside, M. peninsulae (Goode and Bean), which together have a range spanning much of the North American Atlantic coast. The common-environment experiments revealed countergradient variation: maximum growth rate increased with latitude both within and among species. However, growth reaction norms of the northern species were shifted to a lower range of temperatures than those of the southern species, indicating adaptation to temperature at the interspecific level.

At the northern edge of the Great Plains, the amount of heterogeneity in soils reciprocally transplanted between prairie and aspen forest can change within a single growing season, suggesting that heterogeneity is strongly influenced by vegetation. Here we examine several mechanisms by which fine roots could influence soil resource heterogeneity. We measured the total length, spatial pattern, and turnover of fine roots in both prairie and forest using minirhizotrons installed horizontally 10 cm below the soil surface. The total length of fine roots in forest (0.7 cm/cm2) was significantly less than that in prairie (1.4 cm/cm2), which may contribute to more spatially variable resource uptake in forest. The coefficient of variation of root length was significantly higher in forest (92%) than in prairie (65%). Semivariograms showed that the scale of patchiness of root length was significantly greater in forest (8-12 cm) than in prairie (3-4 cm). Lastly, the rate of fine root turnover was significantly higher in forest (49%) than in prairie (20%). Turnover may contribute to spatial variability because a system with high rates of root turnover would appear to have high spatial variability at any given time. Root mortality was also significantly higher in forest than prairie. In summary, many aspects of root distributions and dynamics were consistent with relatively high heterogeneity in forest soil resources. The greater total root length in prairie may account for the significantly higher intensity of root competition in grasslands than forests and contribute to the exclusion of woody plants from prairies.

In view of this limitation, we employ here modifications to an existing turbulent-transport model to explore the mechanics of nearshore macroalgal spore dispersal and its relationship to coastal hydrodynamic conditions. Our modeling efforts focus on four example species of seaweed whose reproductive propagules span a wide range in sinking speed and height of release above the sea floor: the giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera, the erect fucoid Sargassum muticum, the small filamentous brown alga Ectocarpus siliculosus, and the flaccid red alga Sarcodiotheca gaudichaudii. Results indicate that both propagule sinking speed and release height can affect dispersal distance substantially, but that the influence of these biological parameters is modulated strongly by the intensity of turbulence as dictated by waves and currents. In rapid flows with larger waves, it is primarily fluid dynamic processes, in particular current velocities, that determine dispersal distance. Additional simulations suggest that patterns of spore dispersal are highly skewed, with most propagules encountering the sea floor within a few meters to hundreds of meters of their parents, but with a sizeable fraction of spores also dispersing as far as kilometers. Such model predictions imply a much greater potential for longer range dispersal than has typically been assumed, a finding with important implications for understanding the demographics of algal populations and for predicting levels of connectivity among them.",154,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Ectocarpus siliculosus | Eddy diffusivity | Flow | Macroalgae | Macrocystis pyrifera | Propagule | Release height | Sarcodiotheca gaudichaudii | Sargassum muticum | Sinking speed | Turbulence | Vertical mixing,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,198,NA,NA,NA

Here, we demonstrate high intra- and intergeneric synchrony in mast seeding by 17 species of New Zealand plants from four families across > 150 000 km2. The synchronous species vary ecologically (pollination and dispersal modes) and are geographically widely separated, so intergeneric synchrony seems unlikely to be adaptive per se.

Autoparasitoids are intraguild consumers that attack and kill both the immature stages of hemipteran hosts, such as whiteflies, and heterospecific and conspecific parasitoids. In population cages on cotton plants in the field in 1997 and 1998, we introduced whiteflies and then parasitoids in a replacement design with constant total numbers of parasitoids, as follows: (1) control (whiteflies only), (2) E. eremicus only, (3) E. sophia only, and (4) both E. eremicus and E. sophia. Destructive samples of plants were taken 2, 4, and 6 wk after wasp releases, and immature whitefly and wasp stages were censused. In 1997, there were no significant differences in whitefly densities among treatments. In 1998, the control treatment densities were significantly greater than parasitoid treatments, but there was no difference among the parasitoid treatments, indicating equivalent suppression of whitefly populations by the two parasitoid species. In both years, similar patterns in parasitoid dynamics were observed. Densities of E. eremicus were significantly higher in the absence of E. sophia. In contrast, E. sophia densities were unaffected by the presence of E. eremicus. The results suggest that interference by the autoparasitoid reduced primary parasitoid density, but with no concommitant disruption of host suppression. The results support theoretical predictions that no disruption should occur when both parasitoids are equally efficient and suggest that an autoparasitoid may be as efficient as a primary parasitoid in suppressing host densities.",27,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Bemisia argentifolii | Bemisia tabaci | Biological control | Encarsia sophia | Eretmocerus eremicus | Exotic species | Heteronomous hyperparasitoid | Interference competition | Interspecific competition | Intraguild predation | Population regulation | Sweetpotato whitefly,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,205,NA,NA,NA

However, current experimental evidence is predominantly based on greenhouse studies, and there is a paucity of data gained in natural plant communities growing under natural climatic conditions. We investigated the development of larvae of the satyrid butterfly Coenonympha pamphilus in seminatural calcareous grasslands that had been exposed to elevated CO2 for five growing seasons in the northwestern Swiss Jura mountains. Late second-instar larvae were grown until adult eclosion in cages containing a natural mixture of grassland plant species. Leaf nitrogen concentration of the grass species present decreased at elevated CO2, while nonstructural carbohydrates increased. Total polyphenolics were unaltered, but condensed tannins increased marginally significantly. Lipid concentration in freshly emerged butterflies of C. pamphilus increased, and females tended to have higher numbers of mature eggs in their ovaries at elevated CO2 than under ambient conditions. Development time, and larval and adult mass of C. pamphilus were not affected by CO2 enrichment. These findings contrast with previous greenhouse trials in which development time of C. pamphilus increased and larval masses decreased under elevated CO2, despite similar changes in plant quality. A power analysis indicated that effects on herbivores were not missed due to a lack of statistical power, but that effects were indeed absent in the field study. The absence of such effects could be explained by several mechanisms. In the field, insect growth was relieved from the N-limitation observed in the greenhouse because (1) animals were able to maintain optimal N:carbohydrate ratios in their diet by altering the proportions of different plant species they ingested, and (2) climatic conditions were harsher in the field. This may have limited animal growth to such an extent that even the reduced N concentrations in plant tissue grown under elevated CO2 did not limit growth any more. We therefore conclude that extrapolation of results on effects of elevated CO2 on plant - insect interactions from greenhouse experiments to natural situations should be interpreted with caution.",26,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Coenonympha pamphilus | Elevated CO 2 | Fecundity | Herbivory | Nonstructural carbohydrates | Plant - insect interaction | Satyridae,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,206,NA,NA,NA

Sedimentary evidence from small forest hollows is used here to reconstruct the pattern of stand-scale invasion by eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.) Carr.) at its current range limit in Wisconsin. Pollen records from lakes show a slowly increasing regional hemlock population over the past 2500 yr, as its range expanded from the east in response to cooler, wetter climate. In contrast, hemlock pollen in each of the forest hollows increased abruptly within the past 500 yr, demonstrating stand-scale dynamics at a time when regional changes were small. Moreover, this abrupt rise in hemlock is part of a two-phase sequence of local invasion. First, stands were initially colonized as much as 2000 yr ago, but the size of these local populations remained low for as long as 1800 yr. This pattern suggests that scattered, small populations grew beyond the continuous range limit of hemlock, which was tens of kilometers to the east. Second, these small hemlock populations expanded in size between 100 and 500 yr ago during a time of cooler, wetter climate, which was apparently limiting population growth.

While it details direct interactions between community members, it can also be used to quantify all indirect effects that occur in a community, and thereby to make predictions regarding population response to experimental treatments or natural disturbances. These predictions are essentially hypotheses of system behavior that can be rigorously evaluated. Use of the community matrix, however, has been hindered by indeterminacy and ambiguity in response predictions. In this study, we reveal a theoretical source of the problem that arises as a consequence of community structure. Using a qualitative analysis of the community matrix, we detail the complementary feedback cycles that contribute to the response of a population following a sustained or press perturbation. Complementary feedback is the sum of all direct and indirect effects that can contribute to a response. We develop a ""weighted-predictions matrix"" that assigns a probability scale to sign determinacy of predicted responses. This matrix is formed by the quotient of the net sum of complementary feedback cycles and the absolute number of complementary feedback cycles. A qualitative analysis of system structure provides a theoretical benchmark for understanding a spectrum of behavior in biological systems, and for framing and prioritizing management interventions for whole communities.

High and uniform taxonomic resolution was applied in a dietary analysis, by resolving the complete benthic community to species, including the meiofauna, protozoa, and algae. Meiofauna accounted for 70% of all species in the summary web and for 73% and 63% of those in the summer/autumn and spring webs, respectively. The web structure changed between summer/autumn and winter/spring, due to differences in species composition. Many stream invertebrates fed on meiofauna and organic matter. Addition of meiofauna to the Broadstone web increased the percentage of intermediate species. Seasonal webs contained between 54 (spring 1997) and 86 (autumn 1996) interactive taxa and 229-378 trophic links. Marked differences in web complexity were found between the summer/autumn and winter/spring periods. Meiofauna accounted for most of the links in the web with a high proportion of intermediate-intermediate links in summer and autumn (0.421-0.440) and also of intermediate-basal links during winter and spring (0.509-0.628). In general, the summary web showed that intermediate species and basal resources were numerically dominant components in this stream. Web connectance rose slightly between summer (0.052) and winter (0.061) and increased further in spring (0.079), coinciding with a reduction in species number. A high fraction of detritivores was combined with omnivorous predators, many of which supplemented their diets with organic matter and, depending on season, with algae and invertebrate eggs. In addition, a wide range of feeding modes was found among meiofaunal species. The diversity of the Broadstone community suggests that the impact of top predators tends to dissipate. A low proportion of top predators in the web was combined with a low mean number of prey items, other than detritus, in their guts (large predators, 1.08-1.26 prey/individual gut; small-sized tanypods, 2.15-2.32 prey/individual gut). Dietary similarity was highest in autumn and winter 1996, and observed feeding links of the most common predatory species showed low overlap in their diets. The web architecture of this stream is reticulate and complex, and the patterns observed in these seasonal webs differed from previous stream webs, resulting in low connectance, high linkage density, long food chains, and a high proportion of intermediate species and of intermediate-intermediate links.

Treatments were designed to mimic combinations of plant characteristics and predator densities that occur naturally across habitats in the field. There were complex interactive effects between plant resources and spider predation on the population growth of planthoppers. The degree that spiders suppressed planthoppers depended on both plant nutrition and vegetation complexity, an interaction that was demonstrated both in the field and laboratory. Laboratory results showed that spiders checked planthopper populations most effectively on poor-quality Spartina with an associated matrix of thatch, all characteristics of high-marsh meadow habitats. It was also this combination of plant resources in concert with spiders that promoted the smallest populations of planthoppers in our field experiment. Planthopper populations were most likely to escape the suppressing effects of predation on nutritious plants without thatch, a combination of factors associated with observed planthopper outbreaks in low-marsh habitats in the field. Thus, there is important spatial variation in the relative strength of forces with bottom-up factors dominating under low-marsh conditions and top-down forces increasing in strength at higher elevations on the marsh. Enhancing host-plant biomass and nutrition did not strengthen top-down effects on planthoppers, even though nitrogen-rich plants supported higher densities of wolf spiders and other invertebrate predators in the field. Rather, planthopper populations, particularly those of Prokelisia marginata, escaped predator restraint on high-quality plants, a result we attribute to its mobile life history, enhanced colonizing ability, and rapid growth rate. Thus, our results for Prokelisia planthoppers suggest that the life history strategy of a species is an important mediator of top-down and bottom-up impacts. In laboratory mesocosms, enhancing plant biomass and nutrition resulted in increased spider reproduction, a cascading effect associated with planthopper increases on high-quality plants. Although the adverse effects of spider predation on planthoppers cascaded down and fostered increased plant biomass in laboratory mesocosms, this result did not occur in the field where top-down effects attenuated. We attributed this outcome in part to the intraguild predation of other planthopper predators by wolf spiders. Overall, the general paradigm in this system is for bottom-up forces to dominate, and when predators do exert a significant suppressing effect on planthoppers, their impact is generally legislated by vegetation characteristics.",226,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Bottom-up vs. top-down impact | Habitat complexity | Intertidal wetlands | Intraguild predation | Multitrophic interactions | Phytophagous insect community | Plant nutrition | Planthopper | Prokelisia spp. | Spartina alterniflora | Trophic cascades | Vegetation structure,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,211,all,All Open Access,NA

Lakes with piscivorous fish are further distinguished by thermal stratification, which provides a refuge for zooplankton to avoid fish predation. We contrasted phytoplankton abundance in these three categories of lakes over six years, using both direct measures of concentration and a growth bioassay that measures phytoplankton from the perspective of a standard grazer (Daphnia). Contrary to expectations, phytoplankton abundance was largely unaffected by trophic structure or the presence of a deep-water refuge. However, grazer growth differed dramatically among the three categories of lakes. Consistent with trophic cascade, increased fish planktivory resulted in more phytoplankton food as measured from the grazer's perspective. This effect was independent of lake productivity or total abundance and size of phytoplankton. Instead, variation in food quality for grazers was associated with compositional differences in phytoplankton. These results indicate that persistent trophic cascades are more dramatic in the plankton than previously realized but primarily influence composition, rather than biomass.

One of the steps in an adaptive management process is to develop alternative models of system dynamics, models that are all reasonable in light of available data, but that differ substantially in their implications for optimal control of the resource. We explored how the form of the recruitment and survival functions in a general population model for ducks affected the patterns in the optimal harvest strategy, using a combination of analytical, numerical, and simulation techniques. We compared three relationships between recruitment and population density (linear, exponential, and hyperbolic) and three relationships between survival during the nonharvest season and population density (constant, logistic, and one related to the compensatory harvest mortality hypothesis). We found that the form of the component functions had a dramatic influence on the optimal harvest strategy and the ultimate equilibrium state of the system. For instance, while it is commonly assumed that a compensatory hypothesis leads to higher optimal harvest rates than an additive hypothesis, we found this to depend on the form of the recruitment function, in part because of differences in the optimal steady-state population density. This work has strong direct consequences for those developing alternative models to describe harvested systems, but it is relevant to a larger class of problems applying optimal control at the population level. Often, different functional forms will not be statistically distinguishable in the range of the data. Nevertheless, differences between the functions outside the range of the data can have an important impact on the optimal harvest strategy. Thus, development of alternative models by identifying a single functional form, then choosing different parameter combinations from extremes on,the likelihood profile may end up producing alternatives that do not differ as importantly as if different functional forms had been used.

The nutrient treatment increased the amount of insoluble sugars and reduced both the total carbon content in the alga and the physical toughness of the thallus. On the other hand, the treatment had no effect on the amount of total nitrogen or phlorotannins in the algal tissue. This implies that the clear increase in herbivore performance and fecundity may be due to quantitative changes in the carbohydrate metabolism rather than to the lower content of feeding deterrents in the tissue of F. vesiculosus. We suggest that eutrophication may potentially improve the quality of F. vesiculosus for herbivores. The reproductive success, growth, and food consumption of I. baltica increase on algae maintained in a nutrient-rich environment; this is likely to be reflected in herbivore density and grazing pressure. This in turn may have potential ecological consequences for the maintenance of viable F. vesiculosus belts, thereby contributing to the structure of littoral algal assemblages in marine ecosystems.",103,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Brown algae | Eutrophication | Fucus vesiculosus | Herbivore fecundity | Herbivory | Idotea baltica | Isopod growth | Isopods | Marine herbivore | Nutrients | Performance | Plant quality,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,218,NA,NA,NA

Understanding the dispersal behavior of parasites is fundamental to our appreciation of their virulence, epidemiology, and host specificity. Very few host-parasite systems, however, allow for studying how parasites optimize their transmission rates. Here, we investigated the dispersal behavior of a common ectoparasite of European passerine birds, the flea Ceratophyllus gallinae. This flea Primarily infests hole-nesting species and breeds during its host's breeding season. Once the host leaves the nest, flea larvae build cocoons, pupate, and remain dormant before initiating their host search. There is considerable variation in the time at which they hatch and disperse from the nest boxes. Some offspring disperse before the hosts choose their nest sites at the beginning of the next breeding period, while others wait until after that stage to disperse. By experimentally manipulating the density of fleas in the nests of their breeding hosts we were able to investigate density-dependent processes that would later affect the dispersal behavior of flea offspring. We found that the density of offspring in the nests was negatively correlated with the proportion of early-dispersing individuals and negatively affected the phenotypic quality of dispersers. Flea offspring of poor phenotypic quality in terms of body size dispersed earlier and had lower potential fecundity than bigger individuals. In a laboratory experiment, we found that the intensity of larval competition strongly affected offspring development, body size at maturity, and overwintering capacity. Thus, in order to maximize their chance of transmission, C. gallinae individuals adjust their dispersal behavior according to their phenotypic quality. In this species, dispersal in time may be explained by the carryover effects of variation in the amount of competition experienced at the larval stage.",25,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Avian ectoparasite | Best-of-a-bad job strategy | Body size | Ceratophyllus gallinae | Competition | Dispersal | Fecundity | Fleas | Parus caeruleus,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,219,NA,NA,NA

Here we present a first example of how demographic elasticity (proportional sensitivity) analysis can be used as a tool to generate more objective and specific estimates of the fitness value of different plant parts, based on the entire life cycle. These estimates were further used to generate testable predictions about intraplant variation in defenses of the brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum (knotted wrack). The predictions were clearly supported by the results from both analyses of chemical defense levels (phlorotannins) and bioassays (feeding preference experiments), which showed that reproductive tissues had the lowest defense level of the three examined tissue types, in contrast to previous assumptions.

Here we compare simple connectivity measures in their ability to predict colonization events in two large and good-quality empirical data sets. The nearest neighbor distance to an occupied patch is found to be an inferior measure. Buffer measures do much better, but their performance is found to be sensitive to the estimate of the buffer radius. For highly fragmented habitats, the best and most consistent performance is found for a measure that takes into account the size of the focal patch and the sizes of and distances to all potential source populations. When experimenting with reduced data sets, it was discovered that nearest neighbor measures fail to find a statistically significant effect of connectivity for a large range of data set sizes for which the more complex measures still detect a highly significant effect.

The baculovirus Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcNPV), which infects a number of lepidopteran species, has been modified to express an insect-selective toxin. This genetic modification increases the speed with which it kills its host. However, in addition to this intended feature of the modified virus, there may be other consequences for the host-pathogen interaction. We report a field experiment in which transmission patterns of the wild-type and the genetically modified baculovirus are measured within and between a model target (susceptible) and nontarget (less susceptible) lepidopteran species. Two foliar feeders were chosen: Trichoplusia ni, the cabbage looper, is highly susceptible to this pathogen, while Mamestra brassicae, the cabbage moth, is semipermissive. These two species are used as both the source and the recipients of infection for both virus types. A series of models are fitted to determine the probabilities of infection (given survival from other sources of mortality) over a 7-d period within contained field cages. Fitting these models to data illustrates that a substantial fraction of the population escapes infection, and it is the size of the pathogen-free refuge that varies between treatments. When infected individuals from the less susceptible species die, the yield of virus is greater than from susceptible hosts, yet this does not significantly alter the risk of transmission to other hosts. In contrast, the genetically modified baculovirus always results in a lower risk of infection in the field compared to the wild type. This is because the recombinant virus causes paralysis, and as a result, the cadaver may fall from the plant before death and virus release. Hence the number of cadavers remaining on the foliage has a greater influence on transmission than the yield of virus from those cadavers.",32,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Baculovirus | Genetic modification | Lepidoptera | Mamestra brassicae | Pathogen | Population dynamics | Recombinant | Refuge | Risk assessment | Transmission | Trichoplusia ni,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,224,NA,NA,NA

Data table Y contains the response variables (e.g., species data) while data table X contains the explanatory variables. RDA is an extension of multiple linear regression; it uses a linear model of relationship between the variables in X and Y. In CCA, the response variables are chi-square transformed as the initial step, but the relationship between the transformed response data and the explanatory variables in X is still assumed to be linear. There is no special reason why nature should linearly relate changes in species assemblages to changes in environmental variables. When modeling ecological processes, to assume linearity is unrealistic in most instances and is only done because more appropriate methods of analysis are not available. We propose two empirical methods of canonical analysis based on polynomial regression to do away with the assumption of linearity in modeling the relationships between the variables in X and Y. They are called polynomial RDA and polynomial CCA, respectively, and may be viewed as alternatives to classical linear RDA and CCA. Because the analysis uses nonlinear functions of the explanatory variables, new ways of representing these variables in biplot diagrams have been developed. The use of these methods is demonstrated on real data sets and using simulations. In the examples, the new techniques produced a noticeable increase in the amount of variation of Y accounted for by the model, compared to standard linear RDA and CCA.

Although the consequences of these mismatches for consumers have been studied extensively for zooplankton and terrestrial herbivores, the relationship between periphyton elemental composition and primary consumer performance has been rarely explored. We manipulated periphyton elemental composition by growing stream periphyton under all combinations (2 x 2 factorial) of low and high inorganic N and P and offered low and high quantities to Elimia livescens snails. Periphyton quantity, as measured by ash-free dry mass and total carbon, was kept the same among nutrient treatments within a level of food quantity. We measured Elimia growth as change in blotted wet mass and shell-free ashfree dry mass. Periphyton chemical composition was described by measurements of percentages of C, N, P, ash and chlorophyll a. At low periphyton quantity, Elimia growth on periphyton grown under high P was 40-66% higher than on periphyton grown under low P. Higher P content of the periphyton grown under high P is the most likely explanation for the increased growth of Elimia. At high food quantity, periphyton chemical composition had no effect on Elimia growth. Snails had increased growth when offered more periphyton of lower quality, but generally not when offered an increased quantity of high-quality periphyton. Although snails removed more periphyton when offered a higher quantity of food, snails did not actively compensate for the lower quality food by increasing removal rates when the same amount of each food type was offered. The elemental composition of Elimia was not affected by food quality or quantity, consistent with ecological stoichiometry theory. We suggest that dissolved P was the ultimate cause of differences in Elimia growth at low food quantity, mediated through changes in periphyton chemical composition.

Both issues were examined using age-structured models and simulations of reef fish population dynamics at the regional scale of closed metapopulations and the local scale of individual reefs. Local populations on individual reefs were assumed to be at once both partially open and partially closed. Two sets of models over both spatial scales are presented. One set examines density-independent dynamics. In the other set, mortality in the first year depends on the density of the settling cohort, and the density dependence is compensatory. The sensitivities of local population dynamics to the rates of self-recruitment and external larval supply were predicted. If external larval supply is regular and there is little self-recruitment, then a local population can appear to be regulated without conventional forms of density dependence. Elsewhere, this process has been termed ""recruitment regulation."" However, with increased self-recruitment a local population will grow without bound in the absence of regulatory density dependence. Metapopulation persistence requires a sufficiently strong linkage between stock and recruitment in some local population. In such a local population, individuals must contribute sufficiently many offspring to replace themselves locally in subsequent generations. Such a local population could either be partially closed or lie in a region of the metapopulation that is strongly interconnected. Metapopulation regulation requires that density dependence acts to curb population growth in local source populations but does not require that it acts in local sink populations. The density dependence need not be so strong as to prevent subsequent cohort sizes from correlating well with varying recruitment levels. Recruitment regulation alone cannot regulate a metapopulation. Two versions of the recruitment limitation hypothesis were examined. The first version states that varying recruitment levels are good predictors of subsequent population size; the second version states that postrecruitment demographic rates are density independent. The present models, along with a growing body of empirical data, support the first hypothesis but provide less support for the second one.

Because of their trophic position, parasites may have major direct and indirect effects on community structure. Because the magnitude of these effects is likely to depend on parasite density, this study was undertaken to explore temporal patterns in the density of parasites and the processes responsible for those patterns. Parasitism by Howardula nematodes was monitored in four species of mycophagous Drosophila (D. falleni, D. neotestacea, D. putrida, and D. recens) that were sampled monthly from 1984 through 1998 near Rochester, New York, USA. Adult flies were collected by sweep netting over naturally occurring mushrooms or commercial Agaricus bisporus mushrooms that had been set out as baits. These adults were then dissected to determine whether they were parasitized by Howardula nematodes. The prevalence of parasitism varied substantially among species, being greatest in D. neotestacea (23.0% infected) and least in D. recens (4.8%). Parasitism was greatest in the spring and fall, and least in midsummer. Prevalence of parasitism covaried significantly through time among the three principal host species, D. falleni, D. neotestacea, and D. putrida, in part because the different species often breed in the same individual mushrooms, the site where nematode transmission from adult flies to larvae occurs. The mean prevalence of parasitism across these three species at the end of the season (September) was significantly correlated with the total precipitation from May through August. The mean prevalence of parasitism in the spring collections was significantly correlated with the mean prevalence the previous fall, because flies overwinter as adults. Consequently, the mean prevalence of parasitism in spring was highly correlated with May through August precipitation the previous year.

Although no difference existed in the average number of fledglings produced from early and late nests, fledglings from early nests were more likely to be recruited as breeders in the local population. Pairs of yearling (SY) birds produced equal numbers of recruits per nest from early and late nests, whereas pairs of older (≤2-yr-old, ASY) birds produced more recruits from early nests.

The magnitude of predation varied greatly among our three focal species, even though they are ecologically similar (all are small gobies that inhabit the reef/sand interface). Within 24 h of settlement, predators apparently killed 92% of settled blackeye gobies, 26% of bridled gobies, and 6% of goldspot gobies. Within a week, predation had significantly reduced recruitment of all three species and was the main cause of death during this period. We also tested whether predation on new settlers affected spatial patterns of abundance at two scales. At small scales (areas separated by tens of meters) the distortion of settlement patterns increased as the magnitude of postsettlement predation increased. Blackeye gobies suffered intense, density-dependent, postsettlement predation that completely obscured spatial patterns of settlement and larval supply. Moderate, density-independent predation on bridled gobies only moderately distorted spatial patterns of settlement and larval supply. Low, density-independent predation on goldspot gobies did not greatly alter patterns of settlement of this species, but unlike the other two species, settlement of goldspot gobies was not correlated with larval supply at small scales.

I compared these predicted limiting temperatures to mean minimum temperatures at northern winter range boundaries determined from Christmas Bird Count data. Estimates derived from physiological parameters predicted minimum temperatures at range boundaries more accurately than did allometric equations. Phylogenetic analyses of independent contrasts under two branch length hypotheses corroborated that physiological parameters were superior to allometric equations as predictors of range boundary temperature. Thus using body mass as a surrogate for physiological data underestimates the association between physiological cold tolerance and northern range limits. However, this association could be explained by phenotypic acclimatization to different environments as well as by genetic differences among species; thus low values of the physiological temperature limit may be a result rather than a cause of northerly ranges. The distribution of predicted metabolic rates at northern range boundaries relative to BMR did not cluster at a clear upper boundary, so it is uncertain whether a constraint on maximum metabolic rate limits distribution of some species. Metabolic rate at the northern range boundary was a smaller multiple of BMR for insectivores than for non-insectivores, suggesting that food availability may limit winter ranges of insectivores, but analysis of independent contrasts did not verify this effect.

Shredder biomass was derived from numbers and length-mass relationships, bacterial numbers and biomass were determined by epifluorescence microscopy, and fungal biomass was measured as ergosterol. In addition, conidial production of aquatic hyphomycetes was determined. Leaves decomposed rapidly with exponential breakdown coefficients k of 0.035 d-1 (alder) and 0.027 d-1 (willow). Leaves were also quickly colonized within the first 4 wk of decomposition, when shredder biomass reached 263 and 141 mg dry mass/litter bag, respectively.

Fertilization has previously shown that Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove) fringe trees (5-6 m tall) growing along the shoreline are N limited; dwarf trees (≤1.5 m tall) in the forest interior are P limited; and transition trees (2-4 m tall) are co-limited by both N and P. Growth patterns paralleled a landward decrease in soil flushing by tides and an increase in bioavailable N, but P availability remained consistently low across the gradient. Stable isotopic composition was measured in R. mangle leaves to aid in explaining this nutrient switching pattern and growth variation. Along control transects, leaf δ15N decreased from +0.10‰ (fringe) to -5.38‰ (dwarf). The δ15N of N-fertilized trees also varied spatially, but the values were consistently more negative (by ∼3‰) compared to control trees. Spatial variation in δ15N values disappeared when the trees were fertilized with P, and values averaged +0.12‰, similar to that in control fringe trees. Neither variation in source inputs nor microbial fractionation could fully account for the observed patterns in δ15N. The results instead suggest that the lower δ15N values in transition and dwarf control trees were due to plant fractionation as a consequence of slower growth and lower N demand. P fertilization increased N demand and decreased fractionation. Although leaf δ13C was unaffected by fertilization, values increased from fringe (-28.6‰) to transition (-27.9‰) to dwarf (-26.4‰) zones, indicating spatial variation in environmental stresses affecting stomatal conductance or carboxylation. The results thus suggest an interaction of external supply, internal demand, and plant ability to acquire nutrients under different hydro-edaphic conditions that vary across this tree-height gradient.

Intensive flowering and seed production occur only once in several years, often synchronized over a long distance. In a previous paper, we showed that the limitation of fruit production by the outcross pollen availability can bring about synchronized reproduction of trees in a constant environment, assuming that pollen availability depends on the mean flowering intensity of the trees. However, pollen exchange normally occurs within a distance much shorter than the extent of the whole forest. We studied a coupled map lattice, in which each tree engages in the chaotic dynamics of energy reserve level, but different trees are coupled by pollen exchange with neighbors. We first derived a relation between two statistics of spatial covariance (dynamic spatial covariance and snapshot spatial covariance). A strong synchronization of tree reproduction can develop over the whole forest that may be orders of magnitude larger than the distance of direct pollen exchange between trees. The fluctuation is close to a cycle with a period of two years. The model of local coupling always generates non-uniform spatial patterns, but the enhanced spatial covariance caused by the spatial heterogeneity is restricted to a short range, only a few times larger than the spatial range of direct interaction. When pollen exchange occurs beyond the nearest neighbors, the local spatial pattern becomes proportionally larger, but the condition for synchronization of the whole forest and its magnitude are the same as for the case with the nearest neighbor pollen exchange. When a fraction of the seeds are sired by globally dispersed pollen and the rest are sired by local pollen, long-range synchronization can occur for a wide-parameter region, and trees may engage in a fluctuation with a masting interval longer than two years.

Model predictions were tested against field observations conducted during six periods of 1998: two periods in the winter, one in the spring, and three in the summer. During most of the year, foraging characteristics and plant attributes suggested that intake rate of bison should be limited by ingestion time over short periods of time, and by digestive constraints over long periods of time. Diet predictions varied across temporal scales for four of the six sampling periods. Selecting Agropyron spp., rather than Carex atherodes, during these periods would result in an increase of daily energy intake by as much as 15 565 kJ (i.e., 7.4% of daily gains) but would necessitate a longer daily foraging time. We observed, instead, that bison preferred C. atherodes to Agropyron spp., suggesting that patterns of diet selection by bison were more consistent with maximization of short-term than of long-term energy intake.

Surveys reveal that gradients formed by canopy cover can act as a selective sieve for the distribution of amphibian larvae among ponds. In eastern North America, many species, including spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer), are usually absent from ponds where forest canopies have closed over the pond basin. Relatively fewer species, including wood frogs (Rana sylvatica), are commonly present in both closed and open canopy ponds. Long-term observations reveal that canopy development is associated with extinction of spring peeper populations and persistence of wood frog populations. We evaluated performance of spring peeper and wood frog larvae in a set of experiments designed to assess three predictions: (1) that conditions in closed canopy ponds (e.g., lower temperature) are associated with depressed growth rates, (2) that the impact of canopy cover will be more severe on an open canopy specialist vs. a canopy generalist species, and (3) that abiotic differences between closed and open canopy ponds may provide a sufficient explanation for performance patterns. In support of the first prediction, a field transplant experiment showed that both species grew slower in closed vs. open canopy ponds. We found some support for the second prediction during two separate experiments. During the field experiment, the impact of canopy on spring peeper growth was similar to the effect on wood frogs. However, in a common garden experiment (in which physical conditions tended to coverge), spring peepers raised on substrates and water from closed canopy ponds grew substantially slower than conspecifics in the presence of water and substrate from open canopy ponds. By contrast, wood frogs grew faster in the closed canopy treatment. Finally, while recognizing that abiotic variation appears to play an important role in performance across the canopy gradient, we rejected the third hypothesis. We found that a biotic manipulation (food addition) partially mitigated depressed growth rates in closed canopy ponds.

Ordered habitat selection occurs when territories or nests provided with extra food are chosen by individuals of higher quality that may be able to initiate breeding early, regardless of food supply (Habitat Selection Hypothesis). To test these two hypotheses, we performed an experiment using the Lesser Kestrel (Falco naumanni).

We provided extra food to all nests in two colonies (all-fed colonies) and to no nests in three colonies (all-unfed colonies).

European green crabs (Carcinus maenas), once common in rocky intertidal habitats of southern New England, have recently declined in abundance coincident with the invasion of the Asian shore crab (Hemigrapsus sanguineus). Over a four-year period in the late 1990s we documented a significant (40-90%) decline in green crab abundance and a sharp (10-fold) increase in H, sanguineus at three sites in southern New England. Small, newly recruited green crabs had a significant risk of predation when paired with larger H. sanguineus in the laboratory, and recruitment of 0-yr C. maenas was reduced by H. sanguineus as well as by larger conspecifics in field-deployed cages (via predation and cannibalism, respectively). In contrast, recruitment of 0-yr H. sanguineus was not affected by larger individuals of either crab species during the same experiments. The differential susceptibility of C. maenas and H. sanguineus recruits to predation and cannibalism likely contributed to the observed decrease in C. maenas abundance and the almost exponential increase in H. sanguineus abundance during the period of study. While the Asian shore crab is primarily restricted to rocky intertidal habitats, C. maenas is found intertidally, subtidally, and in a range of substrate types in New England. Thus, the apparent replacement of C. maenas by H. sanguineus in rocky intertidal habitats of southern New England may not ameliorate the economic and ecological impacts attributed to green crab populations in other habitats of this region. For example, field experiments indicate that predation pressure on a native bivalve species (Mytilus edulis) has not necessarily decreased with the declines of C. maenas. While H. sanguineus has weaker per capita effects than C. maenas, its densities greatly exceed those of C. maenas at present and its population-level effects are likely comparable to the past effects of C. maenas.

From 1996 to 1998, P. virginiana fruit crop and seed traits were measured for plants sampled in moist riparian or dry slope habitats in western Montana. The consequences of variation in P. virginiana location, seed size, and seed number for seed dispersal were estimated from 1996 to 1999 by collecting seeds in seed traps. In all years, P. virginiana produced larger crops of smaller seeds, in riparian than in slope habitats. Reproductive biomass was lower for plants on moisture-limited slopes than for similarly sized plants in riparian habitats. However, P. virginiana on slopes increased seed size rather than seed number in a year with relatively high levels of precipitation, suggesting that large offspring size may play a more important role than seed number in this environment. Environmental variation in P. virginiana reproductive traits may contribute to differences in seed dispersal patterns. Frugivores removed greater numbers of seeds from plants with large fruit crops and preferentially consumed relatively small seeds within sites (particularly in slope habitats). In riparian habitats, seed deposition by frugivores was greater away from rather than under P. virginiana canopies. In contrast, seed deposition on slopes was greatest under canopies.

In the old field, removal of vegetation significantly decreased seedling establishment of Oenocarpus bataua, Socrathea exorrhiza, and Aspidosperma discolor (suggesting facilitation in these late successional species) but had no effect on Inga edulis (a mid successional species). In contrast, neighboring vegetation inhibited the growth of all sown species: removal significantly increased biomass. In the forest site, removal of forest vegetation had no effect on establishment but significantly increased seedling mass, suggesting inhibition. Plant litter removal significantly decreased seedling establishment of all species in the old field, and of S. exorrhiza and I. edulis in the forest, suggesting positive effects. A significant interaction between plant litter and vegetation removal for O. bataua and S. exorrhiza in the old field showed that litter may also contribute to facilitation. Seedling mass of the three late-successional species was consistently not enhanced by P and K addition. In I. edulis, however, mass increased 2.5 times after P and K addition when vegetation was removed but did not vary in intact old-field vegetation. Seedling establishment in the old field was significantly higher in S. exorrhiza and A. discolor compared to the forest, while plant biomass in S. exorrhiza, A. discolor, and I. edulis was significantly higher. Neither plant litter nor P and K addition could account for these differences. We conclude that facilitation and competition may operate during the early stages of forest succession in Amazonia, that plant litter contributes to the facilitation process, and that soil P and K do not influence the inhibition process, suggesting that light competition may be important.

We describe experiments to test whether inoculum potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities varies spatially within a broadleaf temperate forest, and also whether there is variability in the effectiveness of AM fungal communities in enhancing seedling growth. Inoculum potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in a temperate broad-leaved forest did not vary significantly among sites. Inoculum potential, measured as the extent to which the roots of red maple seedlings that had been germinated on sterile sand and then transplanted into the forest, were colonized by AM fungi, was similar in floodplain and higher elevation sites. It was as similar under ectomycorrhizal oaks as it was under red maples and other AM tree species. It was also similar among sites with deciduous understory shrubs with arbuscular mycorrhizae (spicebush, Lindera benzoin) and those with evergreen vegetation with ericoid mycorrhizae (mountain laurel, Kalmia latifolia). Where spicebush was the dominant understory shrub, inoculum potential was greater under gaps in the canopy than within the understory. Survivorship of transplanted red maple seedlings varied significantly over sites but was not strongly correlated with measures of inoculum potential. In a greenhouse growth experiment, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities obtained from tree roots from the forest had different effects on plant growth. Seedlings inoculated with roots of red maple had twice the leaf area after 10 wk of growth compared to the AM community obtained from roots of southern red oaks.

However, methodological limitations linked to spatial and temporal constraints have prevented studies of natal dispersal in long-lived birds. Moreover, the consequences of natal dispersal have mainly been related to the first breeding attempt rather than to lifetime reproductive success. We studied the causes and fitness consequences of natal dispersal in a population of Black Kites at Doñana National Park (southern Spain). From 1986 to 1995 we marked 2929 nestlings with plastic numbered bands. We annually monitored marked birds in breeding territories, their breeding success, and the survival of nonbreeding birds. Additionally, we searched for marked birds in broad areas of the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. Median natal dispersal distance was 4.8 km (N = 285), with males more often dispersing shorter distances and females dispersing at all distance categories equally. Density of conspecifics negatively affected dispersal distances of both males and females. In addition, single and first-hatched males born in areas with high breeding density dispersed shorter distances. Dispersal distances tended to be correlated between siblings, possibly a result of sharing similar environmental conditions. We did not find evidence that dispersal was an active mechanism aimed to prevent close inbreeding. Patterns of dispersal in this population are probably driven by intraspecific competition. Males that dispersed shorter distances showed higher lifetime reproductive success (LRS). LRS did not differ among females dispersing different distances, but females that dispersed farther mated with more experienced males. These sex differences in dispersal patterns and their consequences may be explained by the inequality between sexes in breeding roles in this species. Familiarity with the natal area could be important for males, which defend territories and resources, while females may increase their fitness through mate choice and breeding dispersal. High levels of philopatry in Doñana National Park may be a result of a surplus of food resources and the effects of conspecific attraction in densely populated areas. However, the degree of philopatry may vary between populations and with time, subject to differences in ecological pressures.",126,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Black Kites | Dispersal distances | Fitness | Inbreeding avoidance | Intraspecific competition | Milvus migrans | Natal dispersal | Spain,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,248,NA,NA,NA

Responses to variation in characteristics of fire regimes may be a function of plant physiological status or fire intensity. Although these hypotheses have been explored for trees in southeastern longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) savannas, responses of other life forms and stages have not been studied. We examined effects of fire season and frequency, geography, habitat, and underground organ morphology on resprouting of shrubs. In 1994, we located replicated sites, each containing two habitats, upslope savannas and downslope seepages, in Louisiana and Florida. Each site, which contained quadrats located along transects within a 30 x 60 m plot, was burned either during the dormant or growing season and then reburned similarly two years later. Maximum fire temperatures were measured, and densities of shrub stems were censused in quadrats before and after fires. Shrubs collectively resprouted more following dormant than growing-season fires, regardless of habitat or geographic region. After repeated dormant-season fires, collective densities in seepages of both regions and densities of root-crown-bearing shrubs in Florida seepages were greater than those initially and after repeated growing-season fires. Shrub responses were generally unrelated to fire temperatures, supporting the hypothesis that resprouting of shrubs may be more dependent on their physiological status at the time of fires. There was, nonetheless, an inverse relationship between collective and root-crown-bearing shrub densities following repeated fires and maximum fire temperatures in Florida seepages. Anthropogenic dormant-season fires over many decades may have resulted in increases in shrub densities in longleaf pine savannas, especially seepages. Repeated growing-season fires, however, neither increased nor reduced densities of established shrubs.

For Carolina Chickadees, White-breasted Nuthatches, and Downy Woodpeckers, the probability of survival was related to site, with survival being highest in large woodlots, low in small woodlots, and either intermediate or lower in riparian woodlands. The presence of supplemental food had a positive influence on survivorship. Survivorship of the Tufted Titmouse was lower in years with heavy snow cover. There was some evidence for an age difference in apparent survival, with adult birds having higher survival rates. Overall, however, these age-specific estimates had large variances or the differences disappeared when models were averaged, except in the chickadee, where young birds appeared to survive less well in forested river corridors. This last result was quite likely due, at least in part, to age-specific dispersal, suggesting that river corridors function as important dispersal routes for young, transient birds of permanent-resident species.

Four questions were explored. Is there a relationship between the spatial distribution of C. granulata and the spatial distribution of rooted macrophytes or distance from the marsh edge? How important is plant cover for the establishment and survival of crabs in the high marsh? Does plant cover affect critical physical variables for crab establishment? How important are environmental conditions for the survival of crabs in the high marsh? Surveys of the marsh surface showed that: (1) there was a strong relationship between the presence of plant cover and the spatial distribution of Chasmagnathus granulata in the high marsh, and (2) both mean crab size and burrow density decreased from the marsh edge to high-marsh levels. By shading the substrate, live plants and experimental plant mimics were found to be equally efficient at buffering high temperature, dehydration, and soil hardness in the high marsh. Experimental amelioration of these harsh physical conditions led to higher crab densities. Crab burrows also buffered harsh environmental conditions, diminishing surface air temperature from ∼46°C to 23°C. Finally, tethering experiments showed that stressful heating in the high marsh is lethal for crabs, and that plant cover is crucial for the establishment and long-term success of crabs in the high marsh. No predation was observed in tethering experiments.

Within the watershed, they selected activity areas close to streams and rivers with moderate forest cover and little open water. The difference between selection at these two scales suggests that wood turtles select forest edges to balance thermoregulatory and feeding needs.

I altered seed size, density, distance from adult canopies, habitat, degree of protection from seedling predators, and the amount of soil moisture.

In both riparian and slope habitats, large seeds were more likely to be depredated than small seeds. However, seed and seedling depredation were more intense in riparian habitats. In slope habitats, seedling establishment was greatest under fruit tree canopies, where seed deposition by frugivores was most likely. In this habitat, large seeds produced seedlings with higher growth rates, and desiccation, rather than depredation, was the predominant cause of seedling mortality. In slope habitats, seedlings from small seeds experienced reduced survival when I did not provide supplemental water.

We hypothesized that ecophysiological performance would covary with plant development, which would reflect soil hydrological characteristics. Among three sites on alluvial fan deposits of different geological ages (Young Alluvial, <4000 yr BP; Intermediate Alluvial, ∼12 000 yr BP; Old Alluvial, ∼40 000 yr BP), total canopy volume of Larrea (cubic meters per 100 m2 ground area) was highest on the Young Alluvial site, in close agreement with soil modeling results showing that these coarse-textured, weakly developed soils permit deeper water infiltration. In older, stronger developed soils, infiltration and persistence of soil water was sharply reduced, which was reflected by lower individual Larrea plant volumes. However, during peak spring conditions, ψpd and Anet were highest in Larrea at the Intermediate Alluvial site (-4.2 ± 0.32 MPa and 3.2 ± 0.91 μmol·m-2·s-1), where soils had substantial surface and subsurface horizons, and at the Pavement site, where soils had strong surface layers but little subsurface development.

During summer drought ψpd and Anet remained high in Intermediate Alluvial plants, but were extremely low in Pavement site Larrea (-8.17 MPa and -0.04 μmol·m-2·s-1, respectively), due to curtailed infiltration of summer precipitation. These findings suggest that Larrea growing in older soils experience greater mortality and reduced growth but are not subject to strong intra-specific competition resulting from the persistence of large individuals apparent in younger, coarser textured soils. In contrast to Larrea, density of Ambrosia increased with soil horizon development, but smaller plant sizes resulted in similar canopy volume per area, and identical ψpd and Anet across all soils where it occurred, suggesting greater plasticity to the transmittal of precipitation.

Diverse methods were used, including canopy fogging, Malaise traps, Berlese samples, Winkler samples, baiting, and manual search. Workers of 437 ant species were encountered. The abundance distribution was clearly lognormal, and the distribution emerged from a veil line with each doubling of sampling effort. Three richness estimates were calculated: the area under the fitted lognormal distribution, the asymptote of the Michaelis-Menten equation fit to the species accumulation curve, and the Incidence-based Coverage Estimator (ICE). The performance of the estimators was evaluated with sample-based rarefaction plots. The inventory was nearly complete because the species accumulation curve approached an asymptote, the richness estimates were very close to the observed species richness, and the uniques and duplicates curves were both declining. None of the richness estimators was stable in sample-base rarefaction plots, but regions of stability of estimators occurred. The explanation of rarity is one key to understanding why richness estimates fail. Fifty-one species (12% of the total) were still uniques (known from only one sample) at the end of the inventory. The rarity of 20 of these species was explained by ""edge effects"": ""methodological edge species"" (possibly abundant at the site but difficult to sample because of their microhabitat), and ""geographic edge species,"" known to be common in habitats or regions outside of La Selva.

We designed a field experiment involving manipulation of whole streams to determine whether these changes were caused by the presence of brook trout, and specifically, whether they could be triggered by trout chemical cues. In 1999 and 2000, we introduced water from containers with brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) into five naturally fishless streams, and fishless stream water into five adjacent control streams, to determine whether these cues alone could induce the mayfly life history traits we have observed in natural trout streams. As in previous small-scale experiments, the size at which mayflies matured declined significantly in streams with added trout chemicals but did not change in streams with fishless water only. Thus, life history traits similar to those observed in the field were induced within the natural variability inherent in streams.

We present one of the first models to predict the consequences of adaptive behavior for population size in a specific natural system. Larvae of the mosquito Culiseta longiareolata (Diptera: Culicidae) develop in freshwater pools. They are vulnerable to predation by the backswimmer Notonecta maculata (Hemiptera: Heteroptera), and to intraspecific competition. Adult female C. longiareolata usually avoid ovipositing in pools that contain N. maculata. This is presumably an adaptive response that increases individual fitness, but it is also likely to affect the size of the population. We take a novel approach to understanding the relationship between adaptive behavior and population dynamics in C. longiareolata. We use a nonlinear stage-structured population model to predict the evolutionarily stable oviposition strategy and its consequences for the size of the C. longiareolata population. Our model predicts that female C. longiareolata should always avoid ovipositing in pools with N. maculata. Such avoidance will increase the equilibrium size of the C. longiareolata population, relative to a population in which oviposition is indiscriminate with respect to N. maculata. The qualitative effect on population size is the same even if, as observed, C. longiareolata occasionally oviposit in pools containing N. maculata.

This paradoxical outcome was caused by a decoupling of producer carbon fixation and nutrient uptake under high light that reduced food quality for herbivores. At low nutrient supplies, shading increased nutrient contents relative to carbon within algal food, outweighing effects of decreased primary production. Thus, light/nutrient balance affects the degree of mismatch between primary producers and herbivores in nature, which in turn influences mass-transfer efficiencies along food chains.

In this paper, I develop and discuss methods for generating an isotopic baseline and evaluate the assumptions required to estimate the trophic position of consumers using stable isotopes in multiple ecosystem studies. I test the ability of two primary consumers, surface-grazing snails and filter-feeding mussels, to capture the spatial and temporal variation at the base of aquatic food webs. I find that snails reflect the isotopic signature of the base of the littoral food web, mussels reflect the isotopic signature of the pelagic food web, and together they provide a good isotopic baseline for estimating trophic position of secondary or higher trophic level consumers in lake ecosystems. Then, using data from 25 north temperate lakes, I evaluate how δ15N and δ13C of the base of aquatic food webs varies both among lakes and between the littoral and pelagic food webs within lakes. Using data from the literature, I show that the mean trophic fractionation of δ15N is 3.4‰ (1 SD = 1‰) and of δ13C is 0.4‰ (1 SD = 1.3‰), and that both, even though variable, are widely applicable. A sensitivity analysis reveals that estimates of trophic position are very sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of δ15N, moderately sensitive to different methods for generating an isotopic baseline, and not sensitive to assumptions about the trophic fractionation of δ13C when δ13C is used to estimate the proportion of nitrogen in a consumer derived from two sources. Finally, I compare my recommendations for generating an isotopic baseline to an alternative model proposed by M. J. Vander Zanden and J. B. Rasmussen.

We report findings from such experiments assessing competitive interactions among three species of parasitoids (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) of the silverleaf whitefly Bemisia argentifolii Bellows & Perring (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae), a pestiferous species of worldwide importance. The parasitoids used in the study (Encarsia pergandiella Howard, Eretmocerus mundus Mercet, and Encarsia formosa Gahan) encompass the range of life histories found within Aphelinidae, and they exhibit a high degree of niche overlap. The objectives of our studies were (1) to investigate the occurrence of interspecific competition among the whitefly parasitoids, (2) to quantify shifts in resource utilization patterns as influenced by experimental manipulations of the parasitoid assemblage, and (3) to assess the impact of interspecific competition on the ability of the parasitoids to suppress their host populations. Field cages enclosing cotton plants were inoculated with whitefly by releasing adults at either a high or a low rate followed by releases of all possible combinations of the parasitoid species (including a no-parasitoid release control). The treatments were replicated three and four times each in 1996 and 1997. The presence of interspecific competitors reduced population growth rates of E. formosa and E. pergandiella but not the population growth rate of E. mundus. The spatial distribution of parasitism by E. pergandiella along the vertical axis of cotton plants differed in the multiple species treatments compared to the single species treatments. Changes in parasitoid activity in the presence of competitors may reduce potentially adverse effects of competition and promote species coexistence. Only releases of E. formosa together with E. pergandiella resulted in lower levels of host mortality than would be expected based on observed mortality by individual species.

Antagonistic interactions among predators, such as intraguild predation, can diminish the collective impact of natural enemies on prey population size. However, structurally complex vegetation may moderate such interactions by providing a refuge for predators, thereby enhancing prey suppression. Specifically, we examined the combined impact of two salt-marsh-inhabiting invertebrate predators, the mirid Tytthus vagus and the wolf spider Pardosa littoralis, on suppression of their shared prey, the planthopper Prokelisia dolus, in simple (thatch-free) and complex (thatch-rich) vegetation. In structurally simple habitats in the laboratory, the predators interacted antagonistically, due to the intraguild predation of mirids by spiders, and predation pressure on the planthopper population was relaxed. However, structurally complex habitats dampened this antagonistic interaction by providing a refuge for mirids from spider predation, thereby increasing the combined effectiveness of these predators in suppressing planthopper populations. Consistent with our laboratory results, we found enhanced co-occurrence of these predators in complex habitats in the field, where mirids are apparently at lower risk from spider predation and outbreaks of planthoppers are less likely. In contrast, in simple habitats, mirids were relatively less abundant, a finding consistent with the expectation of increased intraguild predation from spiders. Therefore, in this salt marsh system, complex vegetation diminished the occurrence of intraguild predation between mirids and spiders and increased overall enemy impact on their shared herbivore prey, demonstrating for the first time that plants can mediate enemy effects on insect herbivores by influencing predator-predator interactions.",304,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Antagonistic predator-predator interactions | Functional response | Indirect bottom-up effects | Intraguild predation | Pardosa littoratis | Predator-prey interaction | Prokelisia dolus | Refuge | Spartina | Top-down impact | Tytthus-vagus,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,263,NA,NA,NA

There were four replicates of most treatments and 14 replicates of the four extreme treatments (lowest and highest disturbance and nitrogen). After 5-6 yr, species richness varied quadratically and significantly with disturbance in plots receiving no nitrogen or the lowest level of added nitrogen. Richness increased over time at intermediate disturbance as annuals colonized plots otherwise dominated by perennials. The number of growth forms also varied quadratically with richness, whereas the number of species belonging to each growth form did not, suggesting that high richness was due to coexistence of species with different life histories. The strongest quadratic variation in species richness was associated with significant quadratic variation in colonization with increasing disturbance, and no significant variation in extirpation, suggesting that increased richness at intermediate disturbance was attributable to colonization at the middle of the disturbance gradient, and not to extirpation at either end of the gradient. Richness decreased with increasing nitrogen at all levels of disturbance. Colonization also decreased and extirpation increased with increasing nitrogen availability, suggesting that decreases in richness with increasing nitrogen reflect accelerated extirpation, and not colonization of nitrogen-poor soils. Simultaneous competition experiments showed colonizations in disturbed plots to be related to reduced root competition, and extirpations in fertilized plots to be related to increased shoot competition. Surprisingly, untreated control plots had higher rates of colonization, extirpation, and species turnover than disturbed or fertilized plots. Turnover in control plots was caused mostly by uncommon species, and control plots were always dominated by the perennial grass Schizachyrium scoparium. In contrast, the dominant species of the extreme environmental treatments varied over time in spite of their low levels of richness.

We collected data on female mule deer and their habitats at five diverse study sites that spanned the length of California, USA. Sizes of home ranges (95% adaptive-kernel analysis) for 80 adult female mule deer varied markedly among individual deer (39-2878 ha) and among the five study sites (range of means for each study site, 49-1138 ha). We measured landscape metrics within varying radii (250, 500, 1000, and 2000 m) from the center of the home range for each deer. Landscape metrics such as edge density, mean shape index, and double-log fractal dimension were inversely correlated with the size of loge-transformed home ranges in deer across all spatial scales. Mean nearest neighbor and contagion index were positively correlated with home-range size across all scales. Significant responses of other metrics such as mean patch size, patch size coefficient of variation, mean edge contrast index, and patch richness density were scale dependent; that is, evident at some spatial scales but not others. We explicitly tested the role of spatial heterogeneity in determining home-range size in female mule deer using a multiple-regression model at the 2000-m scale, which included patch richness density, mean nearest neighbor, mean shape index, and mean edge contrast index. That model explained 57% of the variation in home-range size of mule deer. Models at successively smaller spatial scales explained progressively less of the variation in sizes of deer home ranges. Although home-range size in mule deer was expected to vary with an array of landscape and other variables such as season, reproductive status, and availability of food and water, we explained much of the variation in home-range size with metrics related specifically to heterogeneity of habitats. That outcome highlights the potential importance of spatial heterogeneity in determining the distribution of large herbivores. Such landscape metrics largely have been ignored in attempting to understand the dynamics of home ranges of animals. Better correspondence between landscape heterogeneity and home-range size at larger spatial scales further indicated that mule deer likely made decisions about habitat selection at scales larger than their home ranges. That result has implications for models of habitat choice that rely on home-range size as the appropriate scale for analyses. Moreover, our results indicated that habitat heterogeneity was more important than single landscape measures, such as the amount of habitat edge, in determining home-range size. That outcome has consequences for paradigms used to manage habitats for large herbivores.

Previously we have documented the sensitivity of local richness in these assemblages to a number of regional factors including the size of the regional species pool. Here we focus on the local scale used to determine the local-regional richness relationship. We examine the sensitivity of local richness to regional richness and to two environmental variables (depth and habitat type) across a range of locality sizes. In general, local richness is sensitive to the environmental variables regardless of locality size. In contrast, it is relatively insensitive to regional richness in very small 1-m2 quadrats but highly sensitive when sampled with 10-m line transects. Thus our analysis suggests a spatial threshold somewhere below 10 m for the detection of regional enrichment in coral assemblages. There are four biological mechanisms that may allow regional effects to be expressed at this spatial resolution: (1) disturbance and slow recovery toward competitive equilibrium, (2) heterogeneous biological interactions involving aggregated resources, neighborhood competition, or nonrandom dispersal among local neighborhoods, (3) spatially variable predation by specialists, and (4) probabilistic recruitment coupled with equal competitive ability.

In the Great Plains of the United States, soil organic matter declines from the northern part of the region to the south, suggesting greater decomposition rates in areas with warmer temperatures. Our study used a regional data set of aboveground net primary production, soil organic carbon, soil texture, and climate to evaluate the environmental controls over areal patterns in decomposition rates, (k; expressed as grams per year per gram of initial mass), throughout the U.S. Great Plains. We conducted multiple regression analyses of steady-state k with respect to mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and percentage soil clay content to examine both the combined and individual effects of these independent variables on regional decomposition rates. Our results indicated that precipitation contributes more than either temperature or soil texture to areal patterns of decomposition rates in the U.S. Great Plains, explaining >30% of the areal variability in k. Decomposition rates increased with increasing precipitation and with decreasing soil clay content. Temperature explained <8% of the regional variability in k. Ancillary analyses that related temperature and aboveground net primary production in the region indicated that plant productivity declines with increasing temperatures. This suggests that the reduction in soil organic matter to the south in the U.S. Great Plains may be due to reduced plant inputs rather than to increases in decomposition rates. The response of decomposition to temperature is probably constrained by moisture in this water-limited region. Therefore, changes in decomposition rates resulting from temperature dynamics are likely to be minimal unless they are accompanied by sufficient changes in precipitation.",116,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,Aboveground net primary production | Areal patterns | Carbon dynamics | Decomposition | Grasslands | Great Plains (USA) | Precipitation | Regional scale | Soil organic matter | Soil texture | Temperature,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,273,NA,NA,NA

If phytoplankton is dominated by sinking algae, the primary causes of biomass limitation shift with increasing mixing depth from sinking loss limitation to nutrient limitation to light limitation. Consequently, algal biomass in the mixed layer (expressed per volume or area) and sedimented nutrients are unimodally related to mixing depth, whereas dissolved inorganic and total water column nutrients show the inverse pattern. Compared to closed systems, the maximum in the biomass concentration-mixing depth relationship occurs at much shallower depths in open systems without recycling of sedimented nutrients (such as mixed surface layers on top of stratified water columns). With increased algal sinking velocity, algal biomass decreases, and light penetration and dissolved nutrients both increase, whereas sedimented and total water column nutrients may increase or decrease. Increased abiotic turbidity reduces light penetration, algal biomass, and sedimented nutrients but increases dissolved and total water column nutrients. Finally, with nutrient enrichment, algal biomass and all nutrient compartments increase, whereas light penetration decreases.

While there is extensive evidence that physical habitat heterogeneity affects the structure of biotic communities (i.e., organismal abundance, distribution, diversity, etc.), ecologists know little about how variability in physical conditions within habitats regulates ecological processes that are important for the functioning of an ecosystem. We performed a field experiment to assess the effects of geomorphic heterogeneity (i.e., variation in substrate size) on rates of benthic productivity and respiration at the scale of whole riffle habitats in a stream ecosystem. While holding median sizes constant, we manipulated variation in the size of stream bed sediments in replicate riffles to create two treatments representing increased and decreased levels of physical habitat heterogeneity relative to natural conditions in the stream. Physical habitat heterogeneity had an immediate and significant impact on the primary productivity of stream algae and on the respiration of the benthic biofilm. The rates of both ecological processes were elevated in the high-heterogeneity riffles, probably as a result of quantified alterations to near-bed flow velocity and turbulence intensity.

Intra- and interspecific variation in female fertilization success was investigated in the sea urchins Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, S. franciscanus, and S. droebachiensis. Male and female urchins of each species were induced to spawn within 25-m2 plots. The percentage of eggs fertilized, along with six covariates (male density, male-female distance, number of males, surge velocity, advection, and water depth), was measured for each spawning event. S. purpuratus had the highest levels of fertilization (94%), followed by S. franciscanus (64%) and S. droebachiensis (23%). The species with the highest densities, most males, and closest neighbors had the highest levels of fertilization. Depth and surge were not significant factors, but advection was associated with fertilization negatively in S. purpuratus and positively in S. droebachiensis. This interaction is probably caused by the higher degree of clumping in S. purpuratus than in S. droebachiensis. An analysis of covariance indicates that the rank order of least-squares means of percentage fertilization for these three species is the opposite of that for the uncorrected species means. S. droebachiensis performs best and S. purpuratus performs worst, when conditions are held equal. These differences in performance can best be explained by gamete traits. Additional experiments determined (1) that the 25-m2 plot size is the appropriate scale for investigation of patterns of fertilization in S. franciscanus, the species with the largest contiguous populations; (2) that S. purpuratus, the species commonly found in the intertidal and subtidal zones, had similarly high levels of fertilization in the two locations; and (3) that fertilization success in the experimental plots was similar to that during natural spawning events. These results are consistent with density-dependent selection on gamete traits. Gametes of the species that naturally occurs at the lowest population density and has the lowest natural fertilization rates have attributes that cause them to perform the best of the three under conditions of sperm limitation, and those of the species that occurs at the highest densities and has the highest levels of natural fertilization perform most efficiently under conditions of sperm competition.

From 1997 to 1999, we investigated the effect of food availability and tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier) predation risk on bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) habitat use and group size in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Food availability was measured by fish trapping, while predation risk was assessed by shark catch rates, acoustic tracks, and Crittercam deployments. Dolphin habitat use was determined using belt transects. The biomass of dolphin prey did not vary seasonally and was significantly greater in shallow habitats than in deeper ones. Tiger sharks were virtually absent during cold months of 1997 and 1998, abundant in warm months of all years, and found at an intermediate density during cold months of 1999. When present, shark density was highest in shallow habitats. Decreased echolocation efficiency in very shallow water and poor visual detection of tiger sharks (camouflaged over seagrass) probably further enhance the riskiness of such habitats, and the relative riskiness of shallow habitats is supported by the observation that dolphins select deep waters in which to rest. The observed dolphin group sizes were consistent with a food-safety trade-off. Groups were larger in more dangerous shallow habitats and larger during resting than during foraging. Foraging dolphins matched the distribution of their food when sharks were absent. However, during warm months, the distribution of foraging dolphins significantly deviated from that of their food, with fewer dolphins foraging in the productive (but dangerous) shallow habitats than expected on the basis of food alone. When shark density was intermediate, habitat use by foraging dolphins was more similar to the high-shark-density seasons than periods of low shark density. These results suggest that foraging dolphin distributions reflect a trade-off between predation risk and food availability. Because the distribution and abundance of tiger sharks are influenced by species other than dolphins, the distribution of the tiger sharks' primary prey may indirectly influence dolphin habitat use, suggesting that it is important to consider the community context in studies of habitat use.",395,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Alternative prey | Behavior | Bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) | Group size | Habitat use | Indirect effects | Predation risk | Predator-prey interactions | Prey availability | Seagrass ecosystems | Tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier),20308,undefined,0,FALSE,277,NA,NA,NA

In turn, recruitment may play a vital role in determining patterns of adult abundance and community structure, from local to biogeographic scales. We examined spatial variation in recruitment by corals at a regional scale, along 3300 km of the tropical and subtropical coast of eastern Australia (10°-31°S). We used two complementary approaches: (1) a meta-analysis of 21 different studies undertaken over a 16-yr period, each of which was generally conducted at a single reef, and (2) a large-scale sampling effort in which recruitment was measured in two years on 33 reefs arrayed along the length of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). Our goal is to compare the emergent large-scale picture derived from many small-scale studies with patterns revealed by shorter-term regional sampling. The two approaches show very similar large-scale patterns. Recruitment by spawning corals (mainly acroporids) was highest in the central GBR and declined steadily with increasing latitude by up to more than 20-fold. A smaller decline occurred on the northern GBR between Australian and Papua New Guinea. Recruitment by brooding corals (mostly pocilloporids) was greatest in the northern GBR and also declined to the south. The latitudinal decline in brooders was three- to fivefold, i.e., not as great as for spawners. Consequently, the proportion of brooded recruits increased to the south, and they generally exceeded spawners on the southern GBR and on isolated subtropical reefs at higher latitudes. Our meta-analysis shows that fully half of the variation in the ratio of spawners to brooders is attributable to one of 11 variables that we extracted from the published studies: The month when the recruitment panels were deployed. This result suggests that the intensity and timing of spawning have a crucial impact on large-scale patterns of recruitment. Elsewhere, we tested this hypothesis in the field, and confirmed that regional variation in recruitment by spawning acroporid corals was driven by spatial and temporal variation in the extent of mass spawning.

We explored the same relationships through time, considering the natural variations of ANPP and climate for 11 yr. Based on NOAA/AVHRR satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, we evaluated the effects of climate on annual and seasonal ANPP across regional gradients of precipitation (100-500 mm/yr) and temperature (-1°-9°C of annual mean). We studied ANPP climatic controls through time at four sites using NDVI and meteorological data. We used annual NDVI integral as a surrogate of annual ANPP. Annual NDVI integral increased linearly along regional gradients of precipitation, and its annual variability decreased exponentially. Annual NDVI integral was, in most cases, unrelated to precipitation through time. We described the seasonality of ANPP using four variables derived from seasonal NDVI curves: The dates of growing season start and end, the date of maximum NDVI, and the length of the growing season. The growing season started later toward the cold extreme of the regional temperature gradients and, within a given site through time, during the coldest years. The dates of maximum NDVI and end of the growing season occurred later toward the humid or cold extremes of the regional gradients, whereas the length of the growing season was positively affected by precipitation and temperature along these gradients. These variables were not associated with climate through time. The response of the start of the growing season to temperature was greater in time, following the natural climatic fluctuations, than in space, accompanying regional temperature gradients. This difference probably resulted because the time required for shifts in community composition and plant adaptation is longer than one year. Climatic determinants of ANPP shifted from precipitation alone to precipitation plus temperature when the temporal scale of analysis changed from annual to seasonal. Our results indicate the feasibility of forecasting forage availability a few months prior to the beginning of the growing season, but not during the whole year.

In 1997 and 1998, we created gradients of mixing depth by enclosing the 100-μm-filtered phytoplankton community of a phosphorus-deficient lake in cylindrical plastic bags of varying depth (1.5-15 m) which were continuously mixed. To mimic different levels of background turbidity, we surrounded the transparent enclosure walls with a layer of opaque white (1997) or black (1998) plastic. The expe riments were run for 4 wk (1997) and 6 wk (1998). The results supported two key assumptions of the model: specific production and specific sedimentation losses both decreased with increasing mixing depth. At all mixing depths, fast-sinking diatoms dominated the communities. In accordance with model predictions, algal biomass concentration and standing stock (summed over the mixed layer) showed a unimodal relationship to mixing depth when background turbidity was high (1998). When background turbidity was lower (1997), only the ascending limbs of the corresponding relationships were found, which supports the prediction that the mixing depth at which biomass peaks (i.e., becomes predominantly limited by light) increases with decreasing background turbidity. Also in accordance with predictions, light intensity at the bottom of the mixed layer decreased with increasing mixing depth and with increasing background turbidity. Finally, the data supported only the ascending limbs of the predicted inverse unimodal relationships among mixing depth and dissolved inorganic and total water column phosphorus. The absence of descending limbs in these relationships at low mixing depths was probably due to deviations of the experimental systems from two model assumptions. First, the remineralization rate of sedimented phosphorus may have been too slow to equilibrate with sedimentation losses over the experimental periods. Second, biomass yield per unit nutrient (the ratio of seston carbon to phosphorus) was not constant, but decreased with increasing mixing depth.

We calculated 14 indices of diversity (species richness [three], evenness [four], dominance [three], and diversity [four]) from species abundance distributions for 32 intensively sampled local sites between 42.25°N and 24.12°S latitude. The species richness of each corresponding regional pool was estimated from published range maps. In general, the gradient of local species richness was less steep than the corresponding gradient of regional species richness; beta diversity in the tropics is greater than that for temperate communities. All aspects of diversity at the local scale did not vary with latitude in the same manner. The latitudinal gradient in species diversity of local communities was primarily a consequence of the corresponding gradient in species richness. Local richness increased and became more variable with decreasing latitude. In contrast, species evenness did not vary in a systematic fashion with latitude. Although the absolute number of rare species in communities increased faster with latitude than did that of common species, both abundance classes proportionately increased with latitude in equivalent ways throughout the New World. In general, latitudinal variation at the community level was detected in diversity indices that were insensitive to the abundance of species. The dramatic increase in species richness at broad scales of resolution toward the tropics (gamma diversity) was as much a consequence of increased richness at the local level (alpha diversity) as it was a consequence of the latitudinal increase in species turnover among communities (beta diversity).

In deciduous forests, historically undisturbed stands had significantly higher rates of net N mineralization and net nitrification than previously disturbed stands, but these differences were not clearly reflected in patterns of stand-level canopy chemistry. Although soil C:N ratios also differed between disturbed and undisturbed stands, a relationship between soil C:N ratios and canopy lignin:N ratios did not vary with either forest type or disturbance, suggesting that this trend is more consistent across diverse conditions. Relationships between foliar chemistry and N cycling within individual species revealed interesting differences between species and functional groups. For four out of five deciduous species, foliar N increased with increasing net N mineralization, indicating that species were responsive to changes in N availability and suggesting a positive feedback between foliar chemistry and soil N status. These patterns led to significant differences in foliar N between disturbance treatments for some species, but at the stand level, these differences were masked by successional changes in species composition. Among coniferous species, foliar N showed no variation across wide N-cycling gradients, suggesting a fundamentally different plant-soil interaction. We also examined the potential for extending observed field relationships to the regional level using a high-quality data set of high spectral resolution remote sensing, obtained from NASA's AVIRIS instrument (Airborne Visible and InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer). Cloud-free AVIRIS data from 56 scenes covering the White Mountain National Forest were calibrated to canopy lignin:N ratios and were applied to prediction of C:N ratios in soils. Validation at 10 independent plots showed good prediction accuracy but suggested some overprediction at the low end of the range. Preliminary regional estimates of soil C:N ratios indicate that 63% of the region's land area falls below a value of 22. This value is significant because our field data identified this as a critical threshold for the onset of nitrification. Below C:N = 22, we expect increasing but variable rates of nitrification, depending on other factors such as disturbance or species composition.",268,Journal,re,Review,100,6,6,"AVIRIS | C:N ratio | Canopy chemistry | Disturbance | Foliar nitrogen | Land use history | Nitrification | Nitrogen mineralization | Plant-soil relations | Regional variation | Remote sensing | Succession | White Mountains, New Hampshire (USA)",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,284,NA,NA,NA

This amplifies a fundamental dilemma that plants are thought to face: allocate limited resources to grow fast enough to compete, or invest these resources in secondary metabolites to maintain defense. We studied costs associated with genetic and environmental variation in secondary metabolite production of Brassica rapa in the presence and absence of the generalist competitor Lolium perenne. We used experimental quantitative genetics (artificial selection) to manipulate genetic variation, and herbivore-induction treatments to produce environmental variation in myrosinase and glucosinolate concentrations and resistance. Glucosinolates, and their byproducts after breakdown by myrosinase, are known to affect herbivory on plants in the Brassicaceae family. Defense costs were significant in the absence of competitors, but in contrast to theoretical predictions, costs of constitutive defense (measured as growth rates) were not detectable and the cost of induced defense remained the same in the competitive environment. To understand what factors made constitutive defense costs not detectable under competition we conducted several experiments to assess the effects of limited resources and allelopathy on costs and benefits of the defense chemicals. None of the experiments involving nutrient supply and weak competition supported the hypothesis that the lack of defense costs in competitive environments was due to limited resources. Instead, the breakdown products of the glucosinolate-myrosinase reaction appeared to function as allelopathic agents, which may benefit B. rapa plants in competition, thereby reducing net costs of chemical defense. We found that: (1) the effects of exogenous glucosinolates on Lolium root length depended on the presence of myrosinase. (2) In the absence of nutrients, Lolium root lengths were shorter when seeds germinated with B. rapa. (3) Genetic increases in glucosinolate concentration negatively affected Lolium seedling growth only when there were simultaneous genetic increases in myrosinase concentration. Activated carbon treatments designed to neutralize allelopathic effects and restore costs in the competitive environments were, however, not statistically significant.

Flash floods cause high mortality in the juvenile aquatic stage of desert stream insects, but these ecological effects may be mitigated by the evolution of life-history strategies that allow the terrestrial adult stage to avoid floods. Life-history theory predicts that, to balance trade-offs between juvenile growth and mortality risk from floods, (1) most individuals should emerge before the peak of the flood season, (2) optimal body size at emergence should decline as flood probability increases, and (3) a second decline in body size at emergence should occur as the reproductive season ends. These predictions were tested with data on body mass at and timing of emergence of the caddisfly Phylloicus aeneus measured in three montane Chihuahuan Desert (Arizona, USA) streams over two years. P. aeneus that had not reached the adult stage were eliminated from site-years that experienced flash floods, suggesting that timing of emergence is an important fitness component. On average 86% of emergence occurred before the long-term (∼100 yr) mean arrival date of the first seasonal flood, supporting prediction 1. The presence of two consecutive declines in body mass at emergence in most site-years was congruent with predictions 2 and 3. To test whether the two declines were associated with increasing flood probability and end of the reproductive season, respectively, maximum-likelihood methods were used to compare five body-size models: a null model that contains no parameters related to flood regime or reproductive season, a seasonal model that incorporates a reproductive time constraint, and three disturbance models that incorporate both reproductive time constraints and flood dynamics. The disturbance models outperformed the other models, suggesting that at least some of the body-mass pattern was influenced by flood dynamics. The timing of the first flood of the season was the most important determinant of observed emergence patterns. Overall, this study demonstrates that aquatic insects can compensate for flash floods by using state-dependent emergence strategies that are synchronized with long-term flood dynamics.",88,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Akaike's information criterion | Body size | Chihuahuan Desert (USA) stream insects | Disturbance | Flash flooding | Life-history evolution | Maximum likelihood | Model evaluation | Phenotypic plasticity | Phylloicus aeneus | State-dependent strategy,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,288,NA,NA,NA

Despite this, there have been few experimental studies that directly examine these interactions. Two morphologically similar perennial grass species in the genus Cortaderia are currently invasive pests in California, but their patterns of invasion differ. In this study I experimentally compared the performance of the two species across four vegetation types in central California. I examined how the different invasive patterns of the species result from differential responses to environmental factors that vary over relatively small spatial and temporal scales. Cortaderia selloana had consistently higher seed germination than C. jubata, but germination rates interacted significantly with soil disturbance and habitat type, and these interactions varied between experimental years. When mammalian herbivores were excluded, the principal cause of transplant mortality was physiological stress, and C. selloana transplants had greater survivorship than C. jubata transplants in all habitats except maritime chaparral. In the presence of mammalian herbivores, however, herbivory became the dominant source of transplant mortality, and the survivorship of both species was indistinguishable in all habitats. At the seasonal wetland site, patterns of transplant survivorship varied significantly between years, probably as a result of increased competition for water during the second experimental year. Transplants of the two species did not differ significantly in growth except at the seasonal wetland site where C. selloana transplants added significantly more leaf area than C. jubata transplants. These results indicate that the relative invasive potential of C. selloana and C. jubata is strongly moderated by the presence of generalist herbivores. The influence of herbivory is in turn dependent on the community type. In addition, plant competitors can modify the invasive success of the two species, but the effect of competitors varies with seasonal differences in resource supply. Although important mechanisms that influence the invasion process can be identified, the complex invasion dynamics exhibited by these morphologically similar species across relatively small spatial and temporal scales suggest that overly broad invasion rules will be of little practical utility in the regional management of invasive species.",77,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Chaparral | Cortaderia jubata | Cortaderia selloana | Herbivory | Invasion | Invasion resistance | Mediterranean ecosystem | Pampas grass,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,289,NA,NA,NA

Moreover, a number of recent attempts to assess the effects of scale on the relationship have concluded that the latitudinal pattern is scale-invariant. Nonetheless, the power of those approaches is predicated on precise knowledge of the forms of the latitudinal gradient, the area relationship, and their interaction. We used a model developed by J. Pastor, A. Downing, and H. E. Erickson for assessing the effects of scale on the productivity-diversity gradient to avoid such complications. More specifically, for 253 sets of nested quadrats (1000-25 000 km2) located throughout the New World, we parameterized the power function and determined whether those parameters varied in a systematic fashion with latitude. Significant latitude-induced monotonic variation in the rate of species accumulation with area (z parameter) documented scale-sensitivity for both bats and marsupials, with z decreasing toward tropical latitudes. Variation in the intercept parameter (C) reflected the latitudinal gradient in richness after adjustment for the latitude-specific effects of area. Both bats and marsupials exhibited strong gradients of richness, with modal values in the tropics. Mechanisms affecting species richness, or the size of ranges and the juxtapositioning of their boundaries, may initiate scale-sensitivity in many systems. A number of mechanistic or phenomenological models (environmental, geometric constraint, and Rapoport-rescue hypotheses) thought to produce the latitudinal gradient also enhance the likelihood of scale-sensitivity. Consequently, investigations of other macroecological gradients of richness (e.g., elevation, depth, and productivity) that should be affected by such factors are probably also scale-sensitive.",95,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Areography | Bats | Biodiversity | Geographical ecology | Latitudinal gradients | Macroecology | Marsupials | North America | Rapoport's rule | Scale-sensitivity | South America,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,290,all,All Open Access,NA

In mark-recapture studies, however, many fish initially marked are often never recaptured. As well, turnover rates of individuals in the home section (where fish were originally marked) can be high when marked fish moving out are rapidly replaced by unmarked ones. Recent challenges to the RMP have been based on the inference that high turnover indicates high mobility. However, when the home section is small many individuals may leave (high turnover) but not move far away (low displacement). I present two models for the frequency distribution of displacement distances: One represents populations as homogeneous ensembles with a single mobility parameter; the second represents populations as a mixture of stationary and mobile individuals. Both readily distinguish the turnover and displacement components of movement and show that high turnover rate is compatible with low displacement. The models were then fit to dispersal curves for six species of stream salmonids in 27 populations. Empirical estimates of turnover rate were high (median: 0.53), variable among populations (range: 0.15-0.78), but unrelated to displacement distance. Median displacement was <100 m for 24 populations and was typically <50 m. The proportion of mobile individuals was low in most populations (median: 19%) and exceeded 50% in only five of the populations. Brook trout, a species central to studies critical of the RMP, appeared to be exceptionally mobile relative to other salmonids. The compatibility of high turnover rates with short displacement distances and the finding that median displacement was usually limited support the notion that restricted movement is the norm in populations of stream salmonids during nonmigratory periods. However, the finding of considerable intra- and interspecific heterogeneity in the extent of movement underscores the potential importance of the mobile component to population processes. By providing an analytical framework that yields quantitative measures of different components of movement and allows for standardized comparisons, these models can bring needed rigor to analysis and design in movement studies.",243,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,"Animal movement | Dispersal behavior | Displacement distance | Intrapopulation variation | Mark-recapture | Models, exponential | Restricted-movement paradigm (RMP) | Salmonid fish | Stream habitats | Turnover rate",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,291,NA,NA,NA

Chaoborus flavicans is found primarily in lakes inhabited by fish, whereas Chaoborus crystallinus is found exclusively in small ponds without fish. Chaoborus flavicans has evolved an adaptive response to predatory fish. In the presence of fish chemicals it can migrate vertically in the water column and can thus avoid predation. Chaoborus flavicans can therefore coexist with fish. Chaoborus crystallinus avoids oviposition into water bodies that are inhabited by fish and hence lives only in small fish-free ponds. These differences lead to several testable hypotheses: (1) The extinction risk of local populations of C. crystallinus is higher than that for C. flavicans. (2) C. crystallinus has a higher dispersal probability than C. flavicans. (3) The spatial population structure of each species differ. The results from a 3-yr population survey verified the first hypothesis that the extinction risk for C. crystallinus is higher than for C. flavicans. Field and laboratory experiments confirmed the second hypothesis. The results showed that, although C. flavicans disperses faster, the probability that C. crystallinus individuals disperse farther than 1 km is almost an order of magnitude higher compared to C. flavicans. The comparison of the spatial population structure of the two species shows that Chaoborus live in two different population structures that are subject to different metapopulation processes. Chaoborus crystallinus exists in a Levins-metapopulation, while C. flavicans exhibits a mainland-island population structure; these findings confirmed the third hypothesis.

In a West Virginia site, slavemaker nests were smaller than in New York and Vermont sites. Additional data from West Virginia showed that the slavemaker is strongly constrained by its hosts there, but we found little impact of the parasite on its hosts. By contrast, in the New York site, we found strong evidence that the majority host was affected by the slavemaker: host nests showed important life history shifts between neighborhoods containing slavemakers vs. those that were parasite-free. Furthermore, the slavemaker was able to subjugate large host nests there and had large slave pools. In a third site in Vermont, parasite and host demography reflected their interaction weakly. We discovered a second slavemaking species there, and both parasites were preferentially found in areas of high host density. However, we uncovered no demographic or spatial evidence that slavemakers affected their hosts in Vermont. Likewise, we found no evidence in any site of demographic responses by the minority hosts to the presence of slavemakers.

We investigated nest-site selection and its consequences in the snapping turtle, Chelydra serpentina, in northwestern Illinois. We evaluated nest-site selection at both the microhabitat and habitat patch levels. Turtles selected nest sites with shorter vegetation, more open sand, and fewer cacti than random locations. These microhabitat characteristics described sandy patches where both nest density and success were higher compared to grassy patches in 1999. We subsequently investigated nest-site selection within two discrete subdivisions of the study area that varied in the degree of human disturbance to determine if nesting behavior, nest success, or nest temperatures were affected. The tendency to nest in sandy patches was much stronger at the natural site due to habitat modifications at the residential site that have blurred the distinction between sandy and grassy patches. Additionally, the residential site had a high density of nests within 5 m of houses and a fence (both areas with disturbed habitat similar to sandy patches), compared to the overall density. Thus, nest success associated with sandy patches may be compromised at the residential site; an ecological trap may result in lower nest success in areas with preferred microhabitat characteristics. Despite a similar basis for nest-site selection in terms of microhabitat characteristics at both sites, nest temperatures were correlated with microhabitat characteristics used to select nest sites only at the natural site. Nest temperatures at the residential site were instead correlated only with the percentage overstory vegetation cover and therefore averaged 2°C lower than at the natural site, a temperature difference that influenced offspring sex. The higher percentage overstory vegetation cover at the residential site was due to human alterations of the habitat, and may serve to extend the ecological trap biasing the sex ratio of this population.

We analyzed the numbers of slugs and beetles in an arable field over a 5-yr period, during the main activity period of the beetles from June to September. The field contained 25 plots comprising five replicates of five cultural treatments. An index of the nutritional status of the 8497 beetles collected was obtained by weighing the crop of each beetle (a measure of total prey availability per predator). There was a strong relationship between the crop mass of the beetles and slug numbers in the soil, indicating that slugs were a major part of the diet of the beetles. The change in the beetle population from year to year was strongly related to both slug numbers in the soil and the crop mass of the beetles. This indicated that the slugs influenced the nutritional status, and hence the reproductive success, of the beetles. The predators had a significant effect on slug population growth between years but not between months within years. The temporal effect of these processes was a between-year coupling of beetle and slug population dynamics, buffered by feeding on other prey. The relationship appears to be similar to that between mammalian predators and limited numbers of prey species in the subarctic, where one prey species forms a substantial proportion of the total available food resources.

Paired control and P fertilized plots were established at four replicate early successional alder stands and four later successional poplar (Populus balsamifera) stands (dense alder understories with mature poplar overstories) and N2 fixation was estimated with an acetylene reduction assay. In alder stands, P fertilization increased total nodule dry biomass and increased total ecosystem N inputs, but it had little effect on nitrogenase activity per unit nodule dry mass (specific acetylene reduction activity, ARA). Specific ARA increased only in late July when soil temperature and ARA were at their maximum values. In contrast, fertilization had no effect on these measures in poplar stands where reduced soil moisture may have superseded limitation by P. We detected no differences in specific ARA, total nodule biomass, or N inputs, between alder and poplar stands but all of these measures were highly variable. Leaf area of the alder canopy emerged as the best predictor of ecosystem inputs of fixed N among control plots. Alders resorbed high amounts of P but little N (consistent with low P availability and a high P demand and a high N availability in alder), and P fertilization reduced P resorption but had no effect on N resorption. The timing of N2 fixation and N resorption indicate that late-season increases in leaf N, following a midseason reduction in leaf N, were driven by N2 fixation in excess of plant N demands as nodules continued fixing N while alder leaves senesced.

For strong negative frequency dependence, stable bands result when the scale of interaction exceeds the scale of dispersal, and bands with two-point cycles result when the scale of dispersal exceeds the scale of interaction. However, for weaker interactions occurring over intermediate scales, only random patterns result. Thus, our results call into question the utility of inferring any ecological interaction from only the spatial distributions of the putatively interacting species.

However, 15 yr after the eruption, lupine effects remained localized because high rates of population growth in newly founded patches (λ = 11.2, 1981-1985) were short lived (λ = 1.51, 1991-1995), despite widespread habitat availability. To investigate this paradox, I examined 60 colonizing lupine patches, ranging from low-density patches at the edge of the expanding lupine population, to high-density patches in the population core, including 41 patches created in 1992. Survival, reproduction, and herbivory (for a subset of plants and years) were measured on -12 000 plants for up to 5 yr (1991-1995). Stem-boring, leaf-mining, and seed-eating lepidopterans and anthomyiid flies, feeding in edge patches and in low-density margins of core patches, strongly affected edge patch demography, but not that of central core areas. For example, in 1994-1995, 77% of edge plants were afflicted by tortricid stem borers vs. 24% in the core, and from 1993-1995 gelechiid leafminers infested 68% of plants in the youngest edge patches, vs. only 8% at the core. Associated adult mortality was 88%, compared to -30% when absent. Seed predators consumed 36% (range 4-92%, 1991-1995) of seeds in both core and edge patches, with seed loss negatively correlated with seedling number the following year. In contrast to edge patches, resource-dependent seedling mortality appears to govern short-term dynamics in high-density core areas. In conclusion, edge region herbivore effects can account for the observed 7.5-fold difference in λ between patches founded 10 yr apart. Locally, increased lupine mortality creates access to high-quality sites, facilitating succession, but at larger spatial scales diminished population growth is likely to retard facilitation and succession.",70,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,"Colonization | Demography | Facilitation | Herbivory | Invasion | Legume | Lepidoptera | Lupinus | Mount St. Helens (Washington, USA) | Primary succession | Seed predation",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,298,NA,NA,NA

For amphipods in the Hyalella azteca species complex, divergence in body size appears to be driven by adaptation to disparate regimes of size-biased mortality experienced in different habitat types. Here I ask how size and size-related traits influence competitive ability of large-bodied and small-bodied species. I examined competitive ability in both species using a factorial experiment in which the performance of each species was assessed in all combinations of the presence and absence of the heterospecific amphipod species crossed with the presence and absence of a snail species. Results demonstrated that the large and small Hyalella species differ substantially in competitive ability, with the large species being the superior general competitor. The competitive effect of the large species on the small species was substantial and caused significant reductions in abundance, body size, and fecundity of the small species. In contrast, performance of the large species was not affected significantly by presence of the small species. This competitive asymmetry was also seen in competitive interactions with snails. The small species appears to ""trade off"" competitive ability in order to survive in habitats with predatory fish, whereas the large species, which is able to obtain a size refuge from predation, has traits that confer strong competitive ability. Because of habitat differences in the cost-benefit structure of the trade-off, however, competition-mediated natural selection may be more intense in the large species than in the small species, a condition that may enhance evolutionary divergence in body size.",64,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Activity level | Adaptation | Amphipod | Body size | Competition | Competitive ability vs. antipredator adaptation | Fecundity | Foraging rate | Hyalella azteca | Physella virgata | Predation | Snail | Trade-off,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,300,NA,NA,NA

A primary prediction of this hypothesis is that the strength of competition for pollination, mediated by variation in plant abundance, should directly influence the strength of selection on floral traits. To test this prediction, I examined the relationships between multiple components of plant abundance and pollination, reproductive success, and phenotypic selection via female fitness on four floral traits in artificial and natural populations of the hummingbird-pollinated Ipomopsis aggregata. In the artificial arrays, I manipulated the absolute density and interspersion of neighboring I. aggregata and a competitor for pollination (Castilleja linariaefolia). I also measured natural variation in the absolute and relative density of these two species within a 2.5-m radius of focal I. aggregata plants in three natural populations. The strength of competition for pollination in the I. aggregata-C, linariaefolia system was only weakly influenced by local plant abundance. Both the absolute density and interspersion of plants in the arrays significantly influenced at least one component of I. aggregata's pollination and reproductive success, but the effects were not consistent across these components. For example, the treatment groups that received more conspecific pollen were not the same ones that set more seeds/fruit. Within the natural populations, variation in relative and absolute plant density influenced two components of I. aggregata's pollination and reproductive success, but only in one to two populations per component. As would be expected from these inconsistent effects of plant abundance on pollination and reproduction, the strength of selection on floral traits of I. aggregata in both the arrays and natural populations was also only weakly dependent on abundance. Previous studies have indicated (1) that self-incompatible species such as I. aggregata should experience strong, abundance-dependent effects on pollination, and (2) that variation in plant abundance at a local scale should have a stronger effect on pollination than variation at a larger spatial scale. In contrast, my results suggest that the effect of plant abundance on pollination cannot be easily predicted from simple diagnostic traits such as breeding system or spatial scale.",29,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Castilleja linariaefolia | Competition | Density | Floral traits | Ipomopsis aggregata | Natural selection | Phenotypic selection | Pollination,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,302,NA,NA,NA

Although salticid eggs are laid after diguetid eggs are produced, their eggs are larger than those of diguetids, develop much more rapidly, and invariably emerge before the first diguetid spiderlings hatch. Salticid spiderlings also emerge at a significantly larger size than diguetid spiderlings. Thus, the salticid spiderlings have both timing and size advantages over the diguetid hatchlings. In addition, salticid spiderlings prey on resident diguetid juveniles and thereby significantly reduce the host's fitness. We document experimentally that one defense against this parasitism is the mother's presence after her egg sacs are deposited. Other possible diguetid defenses include high fecundity and asynchronous hatching of egg sacs.

The instability creates a hiatus or ""hole"" in abundance along habitat isodars (graphs of density assuming ideal habitat selection).

The results show that, on average, climatic variables are better predictors of tick distributions than vegetation-related variables. Given also that most tick distributions are not limited by those of their host species, it can be inferred that the primary factor preventing the expansion of tick species ranges is the direct effect of climate. Minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and rainfall are of similar predictive ability; when considered together, their predictive ability increases substantially.

Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has been implicated in the decline of ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) sporocarp diversity. We previously characterized the pattern of decreased sporocarp species richness over an anthropogenic N deposition gradient in Alaska (USA). To determine whether this change in sporocarp community structure was paralleled below ground, we used molecular and morphological techniques to characterize the ectomycorrhizal community of white spruce (Picea glauca) over this gradient. We then related patterns of richness and relative abundance of taxa to various N-affected environmental parameters. Species richness of EMF declined dramatically with increasing N inputs. Over 30 taxa were identified at the low-N sites, compared with nine at the high-N sites. Low-N site dominants (Piloderma spp., Amphinema byssoides, Cortinarius spp., and various dark-mantled Tomentella spp.) disappeared completely at the high-N sites, where they were replaced by Lactarius theiogalus, Paxillus involutus, Tylospora fibrillosa, Tomentella sublilacina, Thelephora terrestris, and an unidentified species. Lactarius theiogalus accounted for 44-68% of the root tips at the high-N sites, compared with 7-20% of tips at the low-N sites. Organic horizon mineral N and foliar nutrient ratios (N:P, P:AI) were excellent predictors of taxonomic richness (r2 > 0.93). Organic horizon NO3 - availability was the best predictor of abundance of many taxa. These patterns suggest that long-term N deposition can lead to decline in EMF species richness, and dramatic changes in EMF community structure. The consequences of these changes for plant nutrition and ecosystem function depend on how EMF community function changes as community structure changes. We speculate that as N inputs increase, the EMF community shifts from taxa specialized for N uptake under low-N conditions (e.g., Cortinarius, Piloderma), toward taxa specialized for high overall nutrient availability (e.g., Tomentella sublilacina, Thelephora terrestris) and finally toward taxa specialized for P uptake under high-N, low-P, acidified conditions (e.g., Paxillus involutus, Lactarius theiogalus).",464,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Acidification | Alaska | Ectomycorrhizal fungi | Foliar nutrients | Mineralization | Nitrification | Nitrogen deposition | PCR | RFLP | Sequence analysis | Soil nitrogen | Species richness,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,306,NA,NA,NA

Our study tested hypotheses that detrital biomass and microbial immobilization of N function as larger N sinks and correspond to greater N retention in old-growth compared to maturing second-growth forests. Aboveground living and detrital biomass pools were greater in old-growth compared to second-growth forest, a difference due largely to coarse woody debris (CWD). The total amount of N in detrital pools was significantly greater in old-growth than second-growth forests.

In situ net N mineralization ranged widely among individual stands and did not differ between old- and second-growth forests. Nitrogen (organic + inorganic) leaching did not differ significantly between old-growth and second-growth forests, and was substantially lower than wet deposition inputs. Nitrate leaching losses were significantly related to soil NO3- pools, litterfall N flux, and fine root biomass across both old- and second-growth forest stands.

For many forests of the eastern United States, herbivory by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) also can be intense and impose severe restrictions on seedling demography. The concurrent effects of these ""bottom-up"" and ""top-down"" factors were examined in a riparian forest on the Patuxent Research Refuge, Maryland, USA. Random permanent-plot surveys found that two microhabitat factors, soil moisture and leaf litter, were correlated with seedling spatial distributions. These correlations suggest that microhabitat variability promotes seedling diversity. Microhabitat effects due to codominant American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera) canopies had limited impacts on seedling demography but were consistent with the random surveys. In contrast, experimental results show that browsing had distinct demographic effects on seedling populations and strong collective impacts at the community level. Although not completely overriding the importance of microhabitat effects, browsing may be viewed as a consistent and spatially ubiquitous top-down constraint on seedling populations. Four distinctive relationships between seedling density and species-specific browsing intensity were apparent: density-independence, density-dependence, avoidance, and opportunism. These species-specific relationships are related to browsing preference, palatability, and life-history traits of the tree species. In contrast, at the community level browsing on woody species is strictly density dependent and emerges as a consequence of cumulative species-specific patterns. Because of complementary species-specific browsing patterns and variation among cohorts of each species, browsing impacts at the community level were more clearly defined. These impacts included a 39% increase in annual seedling mortality rate, a 42% reduction in seedling recruitment, a 28% reduction in basal-diameter increment, and a 35% reduction in the rate of population increase. White-tailed deer browsing in this forest has the potential to decrease seedling diversity by impacting species differentially, offsetting the diversifying impact of microhabitat variation, and suppressing total seedling density. Nonetheless, browsing may not alter the trajectory of forest succession from that expected based on life-history characteristics of the two dominant species because: (1) American beech is shade tolerant and only slightly impacted by browsing, (2) codominant yellow-poplar is shade intolerant and a preferred browse species, and (3) the primary understory species (spicebush [Lindera benzoin] and ironwood [Carpinus caroliniana]), although heavily browsed, are not suppressed by browsing.

If primates and hornbills consume the same fruit species, they may be redundant in their roles as seed dispersers, and the loss of one of these taxa may be compensated for by the other. To examine resource use by tropical frugivores, we quantified the feeding habits of two hornbill species, Ceratogymna atrata and C. cylindricus, and five primate species, Colobus guereza, Lophocebus albigena, Cercopithecus pogonias, C. cephus, and C. nictitans, in the lowland rainforest of south-central Cameroon. Based on over 2200 feeding observations recorded between January and December 1998, we characterized the diets and estimated dietary overlap among frugivore species. Previous studies have calculated dietary overlap by counting the number of diet species that two animals share, often leading to inflated estimates of overlap. Our method incorporated the proportional use of diet species and fruit availability into randomization procedures, allowing a clearer assessment of the actual degree of overlap. This added complexity of analysis revealed that, although the diets of a hornbill and a primate species may have as many as 36 plant species in common, actual dietary overlap is low. These results suggested that there are distinct hornbill and primate feeding assemblages, with primates consuming a greater diversity of plant species and higher levels of nonfruit items like leaves and seeds. Using Correspondence Analysis, we also identified two primate assemblages, separated largely by degree of frugivory and folivory. In addition, we found that hornbills feed at significantly higher strata in the forest canopy and eat fruits of different colors than primates. Averaged across the year, overlap between groups (hornbill-primate) was significantly lower than combined within-group overlap (primate-primate and hornbill-hornbill), showing that primates and hornbills have dissimilar diets and are not redundant as seed dispersers.

We use an individual-based simulation model to determine what factors can lead to changes in the variability in size among individuals through time, with attention paid to those factors that increase variability. A pattern of increasing size variability over time (i.e., growth depensation) has been documented in a variety of taxa. Size-dependent growth has generally been advanced as the explanation for its occurrence. We evaluated the independent and interactive effects of size-dependent growth factors, positive temporal correlates in growth (termed ""growth autocorrelation""), and environmental stochasticity in generating growth depensation. In contrast to expectation, our results indicate that size-dependent growth is not the major contributor to changing variability patterns. Instead, our simulations indicate that growth autocorrelation is often the major determinant causing growth depensation. Data collected from the kelp Alaria nana and the whelk Nucella canaliculata showed evidence for positive correlations in growth (independent of size), while the tidepool sculpin Oligocottus maculosus does not. The changes in size variability in these three species (increasing size variability through time in A. nana only) were consistent with model predictions. Our results emphasize a need to disentangle size-related processes from other correlates of growth in field populations and to document how these phenomena are affected by environmental stressors and intraspecific interactions.",93,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Alaria nana | Cohort model | Growth autocorrelation | Growth depensation | Individual-based model | Nucella canaliculata | Oligocottus maculosus | Population modeling | Size variability | Stochasticity,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,311,NA,NA,NA

It offers the potential for detecting both different types and scales of patterns in a single map. Two types of errors occur in maps of individual plants. Data management errors, caused by transcription errors or other mishandling, are large errors and apply to small numbers of plants. Measurement errors, caused by the mapping techniques and equipment, are small errors that apply to all plants. Simulation of known spatial patterns combined with increasing levels of both types of error showed that: (1) data management errors cause the spatial patterns identified by the statistical function K̂(d) to become less significant but do not cause a shift in scale of the identified patterns; and (2) measurement errors caused the spatial patterns identified by K̂(d) to become less significant and to shift to larger scales. The effects of measurement errors are inversely proportional to the scale of interaction between plants on the map. Detection of inhibition between points is more sensitive to measurement error than detection of clustering; detection of small clusters is more sensitive than detection of large clusters; and measurement error tends to cause an overestimation of clumping size. For patterns with inhibition, estimating minimum establishment distance is more sensitive to error than the maximum distance at which inhibition affects survival probability. Two examples of tree spatial distributions from the Wind River Canopy Crane Research Facility stem map data set were analyzed using the K̂(d) function. Clusters of Thuja plicata were detected and were much larger than levels of mapping error identified in the data. Significant inhibition occurs between large (dbh ≥20 cm) trees of all species at a scale much greater than the level of mapping error. However, the minimum distance of significant inhibition (i.e., the distance within which neighbors are never found) was on the order of the mapping error. Accurate identification of inhibition may not be possible using K̂(d).",28,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Aggregation | Clumping | Data quality | Error analysis | Inhibition | K(d) | Point processes | Regularity | Spatial pattern | Spatial statistics | Stem map | Thuja plicata,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,312,NA,NA,NA

Here we address the question of whether predator-prey interactions can induce nonuniform distributions. We study how diffusion affects the stability of predator-prey coexistence equilibria and show a new difference between ratio- and prey-dependent models. Recently, Peter Abrams and Lev Ginzburg reviewed the controversial issue of what kind of function better describes the rate of prey consumption by an average predator, the so-called ""predator functional response."" Here, we focus on reaction-diffusion predator-prey models with and without predator dependence in the functional response. We show that classical prey-dependent models cannot give rise to spatial structures through diffusion-driven instabilities; however, predator-dependent models with the same degree of complexity can. The origin of predator dependence in the rate of prey consumption is the mutual interference between predators. Therefore, we show that this mechanism can generate patchiness in a homogeneous environment under certain conditions of trophic interaction and predator-prey relative diffusion.",166,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Analysis | Beddington's functional response | Functional response | Linear stability | Mutual interference effects | Patchiness in a homogeneous environment | Predator-prey models | Predators | Prey dependence vs. ratio dependence | Ratio-dependent | Reaction-diffusion models | Turing patterns,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,313,all,All Open Access,NA

However, the empirical evidence for the existence of such trade-offs is conflicting, suggesting that significant fitness costs of defense arise in some circumstances but not in others. A meta-analysis of 70 studies assessing the relationship between measures of plant defense and growth or reproduction has been conducted to examine the relative importance of several potential sources of variation in the fitness costs of defense. The magnitude of fitness costs varied depending on whether they were measured at the level of phenotype or genotype. The mean magnitude of among-genotype correlations (AGCs) between defense and fitness measures (r = -0.30) was higher than that of among-phenotype correlations (APCs; r = -0.15). Moreover, AGCs tended to be more negative when defense was assessed as the inverse of herbivore densities or damage rather than in terms of single specific chemical or structural traits. The magnitude of APCs was greatly influenced by environmental variation; phenotypic costs were lowest under controlled experimental conditions and highest in studies that minimized genetic variation among plants. In addition, the magnitude and sign of APCs varied depending on nutrient availability and the type of defensive compound. APCs were negative at high levels of nutrient availability and for defenses associated with alkaloids and phenolics but tended to be positive at low levels of nutrient availability and for defenses associated with terpenoids. In contrast, the magnitude of fitness costs was not significantly affected by the presence of herbivores, type of plant, type of defense (constitutive, mechanical, or induced), concentrations of defensive compounds, or measure of plant fitness. The above patterns of variation in the magnitude of correlations between defense and fitness measures are inconsistent with the notion that fitness costs are incurred through, diversion of common limited resources from growth and reproduction to defense (allocation costs). Instead, the prevalence of significant negative correlations under uncontrolled environmental conditions and their persistence in the presence of herbivores both imply that fitness costs of defense may often arise through interactions between plants and their abiotic and biotic environment (competitors, pollinators, different types of herbivores, their natural enemies, and various types of abiotic stresses). Because the above aspects have usually been excluded in studies aiming at detecting internal allocation trade-offs, the failure to detect costs in some cases may be a consequence of the experimental design. Future studies should examine the relative importance of opportunity and ecological types of costs by manipulating various aspects of plant environment.",310,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Allocation costs | Antiherbivore defense | Ecological costs | Meta-analysis | Opportunity costs | Trade-off,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,314,NA,NA,NA
