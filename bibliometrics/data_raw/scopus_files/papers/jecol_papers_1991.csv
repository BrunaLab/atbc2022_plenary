A brackish marsh, dominated by Spartina patens, moved only 3 cm in response to 40 cm of vertical water movement. The freshwater marsh floated throughout the year, provided ambient water levels were high enough, and mat movement followed water-level movement directly. The intermediate marsh exhibited seasonal buoyancy. In summer and early autumn, this marsh responded to water-level oscillations directly. It was the least buoyant in late winter. The shallow substrate of the two fresher marshes, which could respond directly to water levels, contained almost no mineral sediment (9% by dry weight at the fresh site and 17% at the intermediate), whereas the brackish marsh, which showed only small fluctuations relative to water movement, contained almost 50% mineral sediment by weight. The fresh marsh had the most fibric substrate in the upper 30 cm; the organic substrate material became progressively more decomposed with proximity to the Gulf of Mexico and with depth. -from Authors",46,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA,NA

The effect of the dwarf shrubs was interpreted as a result of above-ground shelter because shoot height, as well as number of shoots, also increased when plywood shelters were erected on the windward side of C. bigelowii. The effects of this above-ground shelter on shoot growth could result from increased snow cover, protection against strong desiccating winds early in the growing season, and a warmer micro-climate. An alternative explanation for the increased growth of C. bigelowii near other species is that their patchy distributions may be related to localized increased soil nutrient status. When fertilizer was added to C. bigelowii, there were significant increases in shoot height and number. The benefits to C. bigelowii when growing close to other species may be a combination of shelter effects and a patchy distribution of nutrients. -from Authors",165,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,4,NA,NA,NA

In dry habitats, Tetraplodon produced more gametophytes than Splachnum and often eliminated them; the reverse was true in wet habitats. Congeneric species had relatively symmetrical competitive abilities in the field and did not eliminate each other from droppings. While the influence of habitat on relative competitive ability may potentially explain the infrequency of co-occurrence of species of different genera on droppings, the relatively symmetrical competitive abilities of congeneric species suggests that their long-term regional coexistence probably results from mechanisms that operate at larger spatial scales, such as large-scale fluctuations in the abundance and distribution of droppings in space and time, differential spore dispersal and the independent aggregation of spores of different species on droppings.

Intraspecific competition among D. dacrydioides trees appeared to be intense. Mean radial growth rate (MGR) was significantly negatively correlated with the number of conspecific neighbours, and patterns of non-random mortality resulted in a shift in spatial pattern from a significantly clumped to a significantly regular distribution. Intraspecific competition among D. cupressinum was less intense. D. cupressinum had a low rate of mortality, predominantly random spatial patterns of mortality, and a weak correlation between MGR and the number of conspecific neighbours. Differences in the relative importance of intraspecific competition in affecting survival and growth of the two species was attributed to differences in the distribution and availability of suitable establishment sites. D. dacrydioides preferentially established on abundant level or slightly elevated sites, and in patches reached densities where resources were limiting. The number and distribution of D. cupressinum were determined primarily by the availability of suitable elevated establishment sites that were scattered throughout the stand.

Early reproduction reduced growth relative to vegetative plants, while late reproduction had no effect on growth in the long term and enhanced growth in the short term.

The reduced growth of plants reproducing at an early age was due to a decrease in leaf area ratio, and the enhanced growth of older plants to a temporary increase. Specific leaf area in older plants increased with reproduction, temporarily over-compensating for the decrease in leaf allocation. There was a temporary increase in unit leaf rate in plants reproducing at a young age but not in plants reproducing at a late age. Changes in specific leaf area were the result of a switch in leaf morphology between vegetative and reproductive plants. Vegetative plants produced leaves with petioles which increased in length with age. This morphology minimized shelf-shading in the vegetative rosettes. Leaves produced after reproduction had short petioles and, consequently, a higher specific leaf area.

Competition at common plant mass was more intense in stands grown at low nutrient levels, but because thinning proceeded fastest in the stands grown at high nutrient supply, competition at a common time was most intense in these stands. The mechanism underlying intensified competition (irrespective of rate of development) is possibly the extent of overlap of resource depletion zones to achieve given plant mass. If this overlap increases at lower resource levels to achieve a given plant mass, competition will intensify at the lower resource levels, but the rate at which overlap develops at each resource level will determine the intensity of competition when stands are compared in time. Plants from stands grown at lower nutrient levels tended to have less radial extension of the canopy for a given height, and to be shorter and have less radial extension for a given shoot weight. Thus they packed their shoot weight into a smaller canopy volume plant-1 than plants at high nutrient levels. If canopy packing had determined the relative positions of thinning lines, populations grown at low nutrient levels would have followed higher thinning lines than those at high levels. Biomass packing measured at the population level showed the reverse trend, ie it was lower in the stands at low nutrient levels. This occurred because of the wider spacing between plants in these stands than in the high-resource stands at a given biomass level. Canopy interactions between plants grown at low nutrient levels were less than in plants grown at high nutrient levels. Thus the major determinant of plant spacing in the stands at low nutrient levels was below rather than above ground. Plants at the two lower nutrient levels grew relatively more root (weight and length) than those at the high nutrient level. Just under half of this root growth occurred in the top 16% of the soil volume. Root densities achieved were so high that conditions for mutual overlap of depletion zones for mobile nutrients were present. This is taken as evidence that increased overlap of nutrient uptake zones occurred at lower nutrient levels in order for plants to achieve a given mass. -from Authors",54,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,17,NA,NA,NA

Shrub and community seed banks showed no significant increments over 3 yr. After a fire, seed banks were depleted by more than half. Removal of seeds by ants and rodents from the soil surface was relatively rapid. Almost all seed had been removed from open deposits by the sixth day of cafeteria experiments. Removal rates by ants of elaiosome-bearing (myrmecochorous) seeds was not significantly different from non-myrmecochorous species; neither were the intact seeds of a myrmecochorous species removed faster than the seeds from which the elaiosome had been removed. Seeds are thus removed by ants as much for granivory as for myrmecochory. Seed burials showed that seed bank losses due to decay and germination varied widely amongst species and with seed age, with losses ranging from 12-93%. There were large differences in seed-bank sizes between the six species which could be attributed to their life-history attributes such as seed production, dispersal mode and germination requirements.

Rotation periods ranged from 69 yr for >10% canopy removal to 3734 yr for >70% canopy removal. Stands were classified into eight structural types, ranging from even-aged sapling stands to steady-state stands, which reflect the state of recovery from recent disturbances.

Quasi-even-aged stands resulting from catastrophic disturbance occupied 9.2% of the landscape, and steady-state stands about 3.6%. The low frequency of steady-state stands on the landscape appears to be determined primarily by the high frequency of disturbances removing part of the canopy, rather than the interval between catastrophes.

Departure of wild geese in early August may be necessary if swards are to recover from the effects of defoliation. During the summer of 1987, forage quality (N content) and NAPP together were highest in plots grazed on three occasions at intervals of 12 days - the treatment closest to the foraging pattern of wild birds. In July of the following summer shoot N content did not differ among the exclosed plots, irrespective of the treatment in 1987, and all values were lower than that for shoots from adjacent swards which were grazed and fertilized by wild geese. NAPP and the nutritional quality of forage are dependent on faecal input, number and timing of the grazing events and the phenology of plant growth. -from Authors",62,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,37,NA,NA,NA

For sufficiently large R, this allocation function was linear. The morphological parameters of the model were modified as a function of patch quality (resource availability). In accordance with characteristic responses of foraging clonal plants, spacer length was decreased and branching intensity increased with increasing patch quality. Simulations show that resource allocation to spacers will be low both at extremely low and at extremely high levels of patch quality, but higher at intermediate qualities.

Most of this difference is due to effects on the growth, survival and reproduction of the smallest two size classes, which are the most important to population growth in both populations. The stable size distributions and reproductive values are similar in the two populations. Both deterministic and stochastic analyses reveal a critical frequency of fire (c0.85) below which this species is unable to maintain itself. This apparent reliance on fire frequency suggests that the spread and evolution of this species had been closely related to human occupation of neotropical savannas. -from Authors",112,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,57,all,All Open Access,NA

Calluna vulgaris gradually declines and is replaced by Vaccinium myrtillus as the birch canopy closes. This is subsequently replaced by Deschampsia flexuosa and then Agrostis capillaris as the woodland matures and the canopy opens out. Growth of Calluna was greatly reduced in shaded plots and nutrient addition had no significant compensatory effect. Empetrum nigrum showed similar growth responses. Vaccinium myrtillus and D. flexuosa also grew less well in reduced light but D. flexuosa responded positively to nutrient addition.

Phenotypic differences in leaf length and number of leaves were demonstrated among the subpopulations. Seedlings of the young subpopulation initially had longer leaves, a difference lost within 4 wk indicating that the difference was probably of maternal or historical origin. The young subpopulation consistently maintained a greater number of leaves across environments and through time, however. These differences indicate that genetic change occurred in the population under natural conditions within c200 yr. Consistent differences in response to environment and density were also found. The old subpopulation did not show as great a response to increasing temperature as the young subpopulation. Also, biomass of the old subpopulation was unaffected by an increase in density, whereas the young subpopulation showed less growth at increased density. The origin of these differences are probably due to evolutionary change within the extant, seed-producing population rather than genetic change occurring within the seed bank.
