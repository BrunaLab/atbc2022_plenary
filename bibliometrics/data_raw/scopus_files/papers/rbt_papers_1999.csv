Two subspecies: C. istlana istlana, from the Ixtla river in the state of Morelos, Mexico, and C. istlana fusca, from the Huámito river near the town of La Huacana, in the state of Michoacán, were named half a century ago on the basis of meristic characters. In this work, the karyotype of the species was established by conventional and G-banding cytogenetic procedures and a comparative analysis of karyotypes from the two populations, previously proposed as subspecies, was performed. Ten females were collected in the Amacuzac river, and nine specimens (two females), were collected in the Huámito river. Based on the count of 264 mitotic fields of the former and 203 of the latter, the modal number of 2n=48 was established in every sample and considered as the diploid number of both populations. The karyotype analysis was based on ten karyotypes prepared from Morelos and eight from Michoacán, which included three from females and five from mate. The chromosome formula thus established was of 8sm+40stt. The G-banding pattern was similar in both populations and the comparison of the mean lengths of the chromosome pairs did not reveal statistically significant differences between both populations. The presence of a practically identical karyotype does not support the subspecific division. The morphometric analyses made by other authors, which detected overlapping in the characters that were proposed as distinctive of the two subspecies, agree with the results of this study: not enough divergence has been found to substantiate the subdivision of C. istlanum. The lack of population divergence might have been brought about by an abated geographic isolation caused by gene flow among contiguous populations along their continuous distribution in the Balsas Basin regions, by the relatively small divergence time since their distribution in these regions, and/or, less probably, by a recent historical replacement of one population by the other.

Presumably, forest transformation increases open and border-type vegetation, characterized by drier conditions than those prevailing deeper in the forest. If so, mesic epiphytes should be especially affected. We investigated the role of water availability during the growth of a population of the wide-ranging mesic C3 phytotelm bromeliad Tillandsia guatemalensis. Chiapas experiences a pronounced dry season from November to April when average monthly precipitation falls below 30 mm. T. guatemalensis observed in situ released seeds during this interval and high germination rates occurred about seven weeks after the rainy weather returned (over 93%, an observation confirmed in the laboratory). Many of the tiny seedlings disappeared before they could anchor to the substrate, probably flushed off by torrential rains. Over half of the seedlings comprising a naturally established population died during the dry season. High seedling mortality was also deduced from the size-class structure of natural populations. Seedling mortality on bark taken from the tree base up to a height of 1.3 m of bigger trees is similar on two species of oak compared to two species of pine. These barks also possessed high water retaining capacity. Oak bark derived from higher up the tree, however, absorbed a larger amount of water per surface area and liberated water during a longer period of time than the bark of Pinus tecunumanii taken from similar locations on the host tree. Additionally, the water retaining capacity of the bark of larger trees was generally greater. We suggest that such differences in water retaining capacity explain, at least in part, why epiphytes favor oaks, the lower parts of pine trees, and larger (older) trees. After the development of the phytotelm growth form, mortality in a natural population falls.

For that purpose it is necessary to use alternative techniques to complement the morphological studies traditionally made. One of the techniques that responds to that need is isozyme electrophoresis. The isozymes are biochemical markers of importance in the study of genetic variability in plants of economic importance, because they are the primary products of genetic expression. This work is an electrophoretic analysis on gels of polyacrilamide to study phenetic relations using twelve isozymes on four races and an spontaneous hybrid of peach palm. The biological material used came from the germplasm bank from Los Diamantes Experimental Station, Guápiles-Costa Rica. Four races and a hybrid were selected from that collection. They represented different procedences with morphological differences as well as having particular geographical distribution patterns; they were: Tembé-Chapare (Bolivia-Bo), Pará -Belem (Brasil-Bra), Utilis Guápiles (Costa Rica-CR), Tuira-Darién (Panamá-Pa) and Yurimaguas (Perú-Pe). Five trees of each race and the Yurimaguas hybrid were studied. Different tissues were tried: leaf, adventitious roots, spines, masculine flowers and ripe fruits. An standard native and discontinued method was established on a polyacrilamide matrix for the analysis of twelve isozymes: (PRX, EST, ACP, DIA, G6PDH, ME, MDH, GOT, ADH, PGI, PGM and SOD). The amount of tissue used was 1. 5 g, with 20 min clarification time at 15000 gravity value and a temperature of 4°°C. The protocol proposed by Baaziz & Saaidi (1988) was followed with a modification of concentration of the phosphate buffer solution from 0,005 M to 0. 1M with a 50 to 200 volts gradient. The root, flower and spine tissue were difficult to homogenize because of their high fiber content. The fruit has too much oil and starch, which distort the banding. For those reasons they were discarted. The leaves were selected because they are easy to homogenize and are available all year round. The standardized electrophoretic method allowed the effective use of ten of the twelve isozymes in the leaf tissue. Those ten isozymes showed phenetic polymorphism and are considered useful polymorphic markers for genetic and phenetic diversity studies in Bactris gasipaes. A discriminant marker for the Utilis-Guápiles race was found with the PRX isozyme, which shows an additional locus only in material from that procedence. The conglomerate statistical analysis showed that the races and hybrid studies can be placed in three groups: one is formed by Pará and Tembé, the second one by Utilis and Tuira, and the hybrid Yurimaguas is a class by itself and although it seems a bit closer to Utilis-Tuira, it is suspected that has its origin from unknown parents. These results fit previous morphological interpretations. A genetic analysis was not made because of the small sample size, but methodological procedures were established for future research projects using larger populations to study peach palm isozyme electrophoretic diversity.",7,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Bactris gasipaes | Biodiversity | Electrophoresis | Isozyme | Peach palm | Pejibaye | Polymorphism,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,42,NA

We successfully reared 247 lepidopteran species (32 families), 61 % of which occurred at low density (fewer than four times). The frequency of plants with caterpillars increased sharply at the beginning of the dry season, in mid-April, and remained high until mid-July and then declined sharply, reaching its lowest point in the early-wet season (October). Some caterpillar species are present on food plants throughout the year, whereas others are highly seasonal, occurring only in the wet season. The duration of the pupal stage and its variance increased at the end of the wet season. Possible explanations for the low caterpillar density at the beginning of the rainy season include accumulated water stress in the late-dry season, leaf defenses, delay of adult emergence, and predator and parasitoid activities.

The species is distributed in México on a coastal section of about 200 km, from Nayarit (20° N) to Colima (19° N), and in the Revillagigedo Islands (18° N); P. lobata does not occur in the Gulf of California (23° to 30° N), or at coral communities placed from 17° N to 15° N. Its disjunct distribution can be explained considering the Revillagigedos as larval emiter to the mainland, using the Northequatorial Countercurrent as dispersal mechanism. Comparing coral communities where P. lobata is found, it was more abundant in the Revillagigedos than at the mainland. However, predator damage seems to be greater in Nayarit-Jalisco-Colima than in the oceanic islands, possibly because corallivore fishes were less abundant in the latter.

We calculated density (expressed as a number of organisms per 100m3), frequency of occurrence and Importance Value (as the sum of relative density and frequency) for each species and species richness for each sampling station. A dendrogram of sampling stations was constructed using the Morisita's similarity index and the unweighted pair-group method that uses arithmetic means. Twelve species were recorded. The highest species richness was found at sampling stations located near the continental slope, whereas only one or two species were recorded at the Campeche Sound. Flaccisagitta enflata was the most abundant and widely distributed species in the study area; Sagitta tenuis was the second most abundant species and it ocurred in 79% of the sampling stations. Krohnitta pacifica and Flaccisagitta lyra were the least frequent species. The highest density of quetognaths (>5 000 organisms/100m3) was recorded at some stations located at the Campeche Sound; values from 1 000 to 5 000 orgs./100m3 were recorded in the Western part of the Yucatan Peninsula.
