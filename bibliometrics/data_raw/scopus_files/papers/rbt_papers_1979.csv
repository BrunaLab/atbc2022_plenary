The virus could not be isolated in any of the vaginal secretions. Neutralizing antibody activity to herpes virus types 1 and 2 was found in sera from sixteen subjects. An antibody II/I index equal to or larger than 87, indicative of infection with Herpes simplex type 2 was found in fifty per cent of the population studied, a second segment was composed by the subjects with indices below 87. Evaluation of antibody activity to Herpes simplex type 2 revealed that: a) only a small percentage of the women lacked detectable antibody activity to the virus; b) there is a significant difference (p < 0.005) between the mean number of years of sexual experience among the two population segments; and c) there is a positive correlation (p < 0.05) between II/I index values and age among the women of the population segment with a II/I index equal to or larger than 87.",2,233038,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,1
