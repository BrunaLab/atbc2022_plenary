In 8 groups only HBsAg in serum was tested, in another group: tissular HBsAg, and in two of those groups: serum HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc. Mean HBsAg prevalence in groups similar to general population was 0.64%; 5% in cirrhotics; HBV prevalence in haemophiliacs was 18.87% by testing serum for HBsAg and anti-HBs; serum HBsAg prevalence in Viral Chronic Active Hepatitis was 43.24%; and Hepatocellular Cancer (HCC) group had a prevalence for HBV of 13.04% when only tissular HBsAg was tested, and 54.29% when serum HBsAg, anti-HBs and anti-HBc were tested in all patients. Costa Rica has a low HBV markers prevalence only similar to what is found in industrial developed countries.",0,2093953,Journal,re,Review,100,7,7,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,1

Combination of any of these seeds with the drug was able to increase the survival time and cure some tachyzoite infected mice. The effect was produced either by peeled or complete seeds and more significant results were obtained when Sd7.5 and 10(3) tachyzoite inoculum was used in the model. Some Toxoplasma oocyst infected mice were cured with the seeds alone (75% for watermelon, 37,5 or 50% for cantaloupe.

Twenty six tribes (18%) did not show the Di-a antigen and 20 tribes (77%) were of the Chibcha linguistic Phyla. In the past, the Di-a absence has been related to several ecological factors such as climate and the presence of clines. I advance an alternative explanation regarding the loss of the Di-a allele in the Chibcha genetic divergence which occurred 6000-7000 years ago, as a consequence of random processes and not of natural selection. It is postulated that the Di-a allele is absent in this Amerindian groups only, and that the presence of the antigen in four tribes (Boruca, Ica, Kuna and Sumo) is due to gene flow across neighboring groups of different languages which carry the Di-a antigen.",4,2101462,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,3

Numbness in arms, face and legs occurred 30 to 45 minutes after ingestion of the large clam Spondylus calcifer. Paralysis of legs and respiratory symptoms followed, often persisting for one week. Large amounts of the dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense were found in the intestine of the mollusk. A toxin was detected in crude or filtered and heated macerates of intestine, muscle, mantle and hepatopancreas of S. calcifer, and to a lesser extent Tagelus sp., by injection of its crude or diluted extracts in white mice. The effects in mice consisted in paralysis and asphyxia generally leading to death in less than 5 minutes, compatible with saxitoxin. Mice were killed by the toxin in macerates diluted 1:100 to 1:1000. No toxin was detected in Anadara tuberculosa (Bivalvia) or in peneids. Prevention rests on intersectoral actions between state and private sectors in charge of fishing, distribution and marketing of shellfish, as well as on education of the population at large.",19,2093952,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,8
