That resistance was age-dependent since survival time of 1- or 5-day-old rats inoculated with 10(4) or 10(6) tachyzoites was lower as compared with those 10 or 15 days old. Organisms kept in contact with a lysate of white rat complete peritoneal exudate showed reduced capacity to infect mice. Peritoneal exudate of 5-day-old rats showed a stronger effect than that of 1, 2, 3, or 4 day-infected animals. After 10 days the anti-toxoplasma effect diminished and it almost disappeared after 15 days of infection. Apparently age and macrophage activity are very important factors in the natural adaptability of the white rat to Toxoplasma gondii.",15,7344007,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,1

Ten male albino mice were sacrificed, and the duodenum, ileum and lung excised and fixed immediately, at 20, 40, 60 and 120 minutes post mortem. The intestinal villi and microvilli tended to flatten and to lose rigidity of cellular architecture. Alveolal epithelial cells showed the beginning of edema.

These changes on the clear cells were as follows: accumulation of electron dense bodies of irregular forms distributed between luminal and basal zones of clear cells, presence of large vacuoles of low electron density and a loss of stereocilia; flattening of luminal border and emission of projections toward the lumen. Spermatozoid population was low within the lumen and is accompanied by large amounts of detritic material. Most of the gametes were destroyed. A variety of abnormal forms of spermatids were observed in advanced maturation stage.",1,7344005,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,3

The sex ratio is 91, which is evidence of a greater number of females. Forty percent of the couples come from Panama, but the filial generation (98%) was born in Limoncito. Emigration is very low. The selective potential is relatively high (0.94), with the mortality component predominating. Endogamy and the inbreeding coefficient have high values and polyginy is common. The effective and reproductive size of the population is small. Evolutionary implications of the results are discussed.",5,7339715,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,4
