In addition to monogamy and reciprocal exploitation the author recognizes 2 major categories of reciprocity, 'obligate' and 'opportunistic'. Obligate reciprocity occurs in populations in which an individual must have one or more allies to have much chance of obtaining breeding status and reproductive success. For example, in the cooperatively breeding green woodhoopoe Phoeniculus purpureus only 5 pairs without any helpers have been recorded, out of about 120 flock-yr of observations; ie allies are normally a requisite for obtaining and retaining breeding status. Opportunistic reciprocity occurs in three kinds of situations: certain cooperative breeding systems, mate procurement via aiding a widowed bird near its offspring, and cooperative polyandry. The benefit/cost ratio is potentially advantageous to the initial donator of aid. Kinship ties, particularly those of parents and offspring, probably have been important evolutionary precursors of the reciprocity between unrelated individuals that occurs in some cooperatove breeding systems. Once social units composed of several (related) birds predominate in a population, any lone individual is placed at a great competitive disadvantage. Under these circumstances, with high and unpredictable turnover of individuals, cooperation and reciprocity between unrelated birds may evolve. -from Author",40,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,30,NA,NA

Data on mating success alone explained most of the variation in hatchling production among males; however, data on mating success, clutch size, and hatching success of embryos were necessary to explain an equivalent amount of variation in hatchling production among females. Males achieve most of their RS only in the latter years of life; females accumulate RS during each year of adult life. As a result, the number of progeny sired by the most successful male during his lifetime may be similar to that produced by the most successful female during her lifetime. In addition, adult survivorship plays a major role in determining variation in lifetime RS and tends to dampen the effect of sexual differences in variability in fecundity at each age. Furthermore, the similarity in age-specific survivorship schedules of male and female bullfrogs (except for the latter years of life) tends to equalize variation in lifetime RS between the sexes. -from Author",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,37,NA,NA

As variance in prey encounter rate increases, the time over which the forager estimates prey encounter rate will have a strong effect on the ability of the forager to maximize the net rate of energy intake. Foragers that forage on patchily distributed prey should use a shorter amount of time to estimate prey density than foragers that prey on evenly dispersed prey.

Such behavior should be highly advantageous if, on average, the disruptor can decrease his age of 1st reproduction or to obtain more copulations.

A close approximation to a sinusoidal variation in stirring paddle rotation speed (0-60 RPM) was used as a forcing function on the microcosms.

A linear response of these ecosystem components would be indicated if a single periodicity of 0.1 cycles/day were observed in their time-series data. These responses were tested for this periodicity using variance spectral and periodic regression analyses. When tested against the responses of control microcosms receiving constant turbulence inputs, the microcosms receiving the sinusoidal input exhibited statistically significant responses at a number of frequencies, none of which was the 0.1 cycle/day input. Similarly treated microcosms whose structural complexity was reduced by removal of their benthic components showed a less complex frequency response, but still significantly different from the forcing frequency.

The rate of phenotypic evolution of well-established parthenogens may often approach or even exceed that under obligate bisexuality. The consequences of periodic sex are also examined. By exploiting hidden genetic variance released by sex, cyclical parthenogenesis periodically allows much higher rates of phenotypic evolution that can ever be attained under obligate bisexuality. In the long run, rates of phenotypic evolution are approximately independent of the frequency of sex for populations that have attained their equilibrium levels of genetic variance. Cyclical parthenogenesis is rare not because of any inherent disadvantages, but because of the extremely stringent requirements necessary for the transition to and maintenance of such a complex life cycle.

Given the assumption that niche requirements generally overlap broadly in plants, coexistence may be permitted because there are numerous possible permutations and combinations of biological attributes in plants which are roughly equivalent in the overall competitive power which they confer. In selection for competitive combining ability, these attribute complexes are continually adjusted in an ongoing process of coevolution in which local neighborhoods are constantly engaged in a fine-tuning process that alters the way members respond to one another. Consequently, natural selection ultimately maintains a balance of overall relative competitive abilities between 2 species for essentially the same contested resources.

When an altruism coding allele is rare (ie at its emergence) within the family the frequency of the altruism coding genotype necessarily declines; it is only by differential production of reproductives between families that kin selection can act to increase the frequency of this genotype in the population. Thus kin selection acts on a partitioned population: families with altruists disperse more offspring than families without altruists. This has implications for current theories on the evolution of eusociality, especially with respect to the role of population viscosity. In an environment with limited resources, population viscosity, by preventing offspring dispersal, creates a population structure where, locally, the proportion of altuism coded genetypes is declining. If the population is at carrying capacity, and if survivorship is unrelated to altruisitc genotype, over generations fewer of this genotype survive to reproduce. In effect, continual population viscosity disrupts kin selection. This suggests that theories which invoke population viscosity to provide high values of r are wanting. In particular, contrary to the polygynous family hypothesis, kin selection in the presence of population viscosity cannot yield evolutionarily stable semisociality. Rather, effective kin selection requires parental mediation to form temporary groups of related conspecifics. Explanations invoking kin selection must ultimately focus on the parent. -Author",26,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,81,NA,NA

Since such adaptations also increase the risk of inbreeding a greater incidence of dioecism is predicted in aquatic environments. These predictions are supported by data compiled on the aquatic spores of a variety of unrelated angiosperms, pteridophytes, bryophytes, and fungi. Nearly all aquatic spores have either extremely large long axes relative to nonaquatic spores, or are transported in search vehicles with large long axes. Many spores are equipped with flotation devices, and many of the taxa are dioecious. These trends are best explained as convergent evolution towards an efficient search vehicle.-from Author",56,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,94,NA,NA

Such a situation should lead to more variance in the distribution of intraclutch sex ratios than predicted by the binomial model of independent sex determination. A large sample of goslings does show a sex-ratio distribution which closely fits the binomial, thus refuting the theoretical argument. Pleiotopic effects of sex-skew mutations may place a selective disadvantage on such mutations or possibly such mutations are, for one reason or another, impossible.-from Authors",26,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,95,NA,NA
