The distribution of flukes among deer occurred as a negative binomial with the mean dispersion parameter, k, equal to 0.17 and the range from 0.10-1.11 within local areas. Patterns of genetic distance in flukes were not concordant with those of the definitive host nor were they related to geographic distance between sample locations. Spatial genetic differentiation among flukes reflected the tendency for individual hosts to harbor multiple individuals from a limited number of parasite clones.

Two hypotheses were tested: 1) that copulation would be selected for in running-water habitats because of disruption of pheromonal communication; 2) that copulation would be selected for in swimming mites because females are less likely to contact spermatophores deposited on a substrate. Independent evolutions of copulation among running-water mites were not more frequent than expected by chance but there were more evolutions of copulation than expected among swimming mites. Endoparasitism, secondary loss of swimming hairs, production of spermatophore fields, courtship, and benthivorous habits may explain why some mites copulated but do not swim, while others swim but do not copulate. -from Author",17,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,68

Wolves possessing coyote-derived genotypes are confined to a contiguous geographic region in Minnesota, Ontario, and Quebec; frequency of coyote-type mtDNA in these wolf populations is high (>50%).

Neglected eggs have a 31% probability of dying, but eggs cared for by both parents, by a single parent, or even by an unrelated individual have a 95% probability of developing. In pairs prevented from caring for eggs, intruders succeeded in substituting one of the partners significantly more frequently than in pairs allowed to care for eggs. Thus, the main adaptive value of biparental care would be to guarantee a partner for egg reciprocation. Protandrous males are inefficient brooders, and biparental care becomes fully established only when individuals are able to reciprocate egg exchange, ie they have reached the simultaneously hermaphroditic stage. -Author",31,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,101
