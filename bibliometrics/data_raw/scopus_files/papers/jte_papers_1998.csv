This ecological niche assignment was tested in the mature stage of its life cycle after it achieves a position in the upper canopy. Mortality, survivorship and crown growth rates over the 18-y period 1976-1994 were measured using co-registered repeat airborne stereophotographic coverage of a representative forest stand in northeast Queensland, Australia, where T. ciliata had the fourth highest relative importance in a population of 46 co-occurring canopy tree species. The airborne re-inventory was conducted in a 3.6-ha sample area and limited to only canopy trees. The results were compared with a ground-based inventory of both canopy and subcanopy trees ≥10 cm dbh in a 0.5-ha permanent plot. Over the period 1976-1994, there was no mortality and no evidence of decline among T. ciliata conspecifics having crown areas >60 m2 and trunk diameters >30 cm. In the 3.6-ha airborne sample area, more than 85% of T. ciliata survivors experienced positive crown growth, in contrast to only 57% of the other co-occurring canopy trees. Toona ciliata's crown growth rates were highest in the 60-80-m2 crown size class. Upon reaching an upper canopy position, T. ciliata not only persisted as a dominant canopy tree species, but it also achieved some of the largest crown areas (> 100 m2). Toona ciliata mortality in the ground-based plot involved mainly subcanopy trees of 10-30 cm dbh that had not yet assumed a canopy position and were not detectable in the aerial stereopairs. Both the crown and dbh growth rates of T. ciliata indicate enhanced vigour in the later stage of its life cycle. Its long-term survivorship and growth patterns are indicative of a persistent canopy tree species that fits the niche of a long-lived, shade-intolerant pioneer.

The method is illustrated using data collected in the northeastern forests of Gabon during an earlier project. These forests are sparsely populated and there are few roads. The density of Cercopithecus nictitans increases with distance from the nearest road. A geographic information system (GIS) divided the forest into bands of increasing distance from the nearest road. The number of monkeys in each band is the product of the monkey density in that band and the area of the band. Summing across bands gives the population estimate; the standard error can be estimated by bootstrapping. The optimum sample size can be estimated by simulation. Combining estimates of the density gradient with a GIS is a cost-effective method of censusing primates in extensive forests.,17,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Census | Forest | Gabon | Gradient | Methods | Monkeys,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,8,NA,NA,NA

A 2 x 2 factorial experiment was undertaken in two consecutive years which included control of herbivores with contact and systemic insecticides and addition of phosphorus. Phosphorus application in the second year increased the number of inflorescences and flowers by 200%, and the initiation of fruits by 400%. No response was observed for the number of mature fruits. Herbivore control and the addition of phosphorus increased seed weight by 22% in the first year, but could not be measured in the second year. Hand-pollination experiments increased the fruit set by 58% in the first year and by 75% in the second. Observations on visits to the flowers showed a six-fold difference between years in rates of pollinator visits. Parasitism of flower buds was 18% in the first year and 33% in the second. Several of the differences between years probably resulted from lesser and desynchronized flowering, due to heavy unseasonal rains in the second year. The differences in floral visitation and predation of floral buds were reflected in open fruit production: 16% in the first year and 6% in the second. All the factors investigated have important effects on the fecundity of I. wolcottiana.

The hard-seed for grit hypothesis proposes a mutualistic relationship in which large, terrestrial birds swallow the exceptionally hard mimetic seeds as grit for grinding the softer seeds on which they feed. They defecate, dispersing the seeds, and abrade the seed surface, enhancing germination. Any fruit mimicry is incidental.

Change in proportion of the most abundant species (≤1 cm dbh) over the last 15 y indicated a decrease in short-lived pioneer species and an increase in pioneers that can persist in the mature forest.

Large differences in buttress formation were documented within a single family and even within the same genus. Previous studies have suggested that buttresses are mechanical adaptations to counter asymmetric loads experienced during brief critical phases in a tree's development and these persist after the need for a mechanical support has disappeared. As a tree grows from the understorey, up to the canopy, or emerges from the canopy, the potential number of occasions that a tree will experience directional stress increases. Many canopy level trees will probably have been in the vicinity of a treefall gap during their development, while emergent trees may experience gap exposure in addition to wind stresses associated with canopy emergence. Therefore, it is predicted that understorey trees should have fewer and less developed buttresses (after correcting for overall tree size) than canopy trees, which should have fewer and less developed buttresses than emergent trees. Detailed measurements of buttresses from 194 trees of eight species support this prediction. There was no evidence that trees thought to have experienced directional stress associated with selective logging almost 30 y ago had increased the number or size of existing buttresses.

This was done at two levels of scale. Firstly, on a 20 m x 250 m forest transect intersecting four canopy gaps, it was investigated how patterns of recruitment, growth and survival of seedlings of Cecropia obtusa, Dicorynia guianensis and Pourouma bicolor differed between canopy gaps and closed forest. Secondly, for one large natural canopy gap, performance of seedling cohorts established before ('pre-gap' cohorts) and after ('post-gap' cohorts) gap formation was studied in relation to environmental heterogeneity. The direct site factor (DSF) was used as an indicator of light availability in the gap zone. Cecropia specialised in large gaps, and also in specific sites within the large gap: seedling performance was increased by light, and by dead wood. Pourouma mainly germinated under closed forest conditions, where it can survive for a long period until a canopy gap is formed nearby. Pourouma seedlings adjusted well to the new gap environment but they did not specialise in specific places within the gap. Seedling location of Pourouma seedlings was mainly determined by accidental positioning before gap formation. Dicorynia was able to germinate both in gaps and under closed forest conditions.

This study examined three aspects of gap-phase regeneration in selectively logged lowland swamp forest of northeast Costa Rica. First, logging gaps were censused immediately after extraction to determine the density of advanced regeneration. Stem density and basal area of residual trees ≤10 cm dbh in logging gaps was >85% lower than undisturbed forest, and all trees in gaps had sustained structural damage. The common canopy species Pentaclethra macroloba (Fabaceae) was the most abundant species in gaps whereas the timber tree Carapa nicaraguensis (Meliaceae) was absent from all censused gaps. This suggests that canopy replacement, particularly by Carapa, will depend on trees < 10 cm dbh or by seed input into logging gaps. Second, the diversity of the understorey was compared with 6-y old single-tree and multiple-tree logging gaps. Multiple-tree logging gaps were the most diverse, but dominated by two ruderal species; however many shade-tolerant species were present in those gaps. This indicates that controlled selective logging can result in a localized shift in species composition, but that logging gaps should return to pre-logging composition with time under a carefully implemented, controlled harvesting regime. Finally, this study found a significant effect of a fringing Carapa tree on logging gap seedling density. Thus, seed arrival into gaps is a barrier to logging gap regeneration, particularly for a large-seeded tree species.

These rates, particularly for N and P, are among the lowest recorded for tropical forests. There were no consistent between-site differences in total nutrient accessions in small litterfall. In terms of the contribution of litterfall to the accessions of nutrients to the forest floor, this suggests that the logged sites have recovered from the effects of selective harvesting within 25 y. Nutrient accessions at each site were distinctly seasonal, with maximum accessions occurring in the late dry season to late in the wet season. Leaf-fall accounted for the largest proportion of nutrient accessions over the study period, although at certain times accessions in both reproductive material and wood were significant.

However, many post-dispersal events can have a profound influence on the survival of dispersed seeds. By incorporating seeds in the dung that dung beetles process for consumption and oviposition, dung beetles could enhance seed survival if they remove seeds from areas of high predation risk and place them in locations that avoid subsequent predation and that are suitable for germination. The role of dung beetles in seed survival was investigated over 15 mo in Kibale National Park, Uganda. Depths of seeds buried by beetles, levels of predation on buried and unburied seeds, and germination success of seeds buried to different depths were examined. Results suggest that by burying seeds dung beetles increase the probability that seeds will escape predation and germinate. Of seeds placed in dungpiles, 69% remained at the surface, while 25% were buried from 1-3 cm in depth. Larger seeds were buried more shallowly than smaller seeds. Buried seeds were less likely to be removed by predators than seeds at the surface. Germination of seeds buried at 1- and 3-cm depths was significantly higher than seeds buried at 10 cm. For the species tested, many seeds were buried by dung beetles between 1 and 3 cm and at this depth there was a high probability of escaping predators and germinating.

Five species generally inhabit low- to mid-elevations, one at mid- and lower montane elevations, and one exclusively at lower montane elevations. Temperature, rainfall and cloudiness varied with elevation. For each site seedlings were grown in pots under partial shade conditions using similar soils and evermoist conditions. All growth measures showed differences among elevation sites, among species and in the interaction between species and elevation sites. Performances of species collectively showed (i) decline in height and leaf number with increase in elevation, (ii) higher dry mass at low- and mid-elevation sites compared to that at high-elevation and (iii) a higher mass of single leaves at the mid-elevation site than at the high-elevation site. Rank order of species changed across elevations for both height and dry mass. Dry mass declined with elevation in four of the seven species studied. S. gardneri, the only exclusively lower montane species, increased dry mass with elevation. Height declined with elevation for six of the species with only S. gardneri showing no change. Changes with elevation in the rank order of species for total leaf number and mass of single leaves were small. However, total leaf number and masses of single leaves differed among species and among elevations. S. megistophylla and S. disticha had a few leaves with high individual masses, while S. gardneri, S. affinis and S. trapezifolia had many leaves with less mass per individual leaf. One group of species showed relatively little change in leaf number per seedling and large changes in mass of single leaves. The other group varied more in leaf number but mass of individual leaves remained constant. Growth allocation to leaf production versus individual leaf size appears related to the successional division of Shorea section Doona.

Stochastic simulations from the Markov point process models are then used to fit spatial interaction models. The results show that spatial patterns can be related to particular dynamic processes which depend on both exogenous and endogenous factors: on steep slopes disturbed by many treefalls, spatial pattern displays large clusters which can be interpreted as within-gap regeneration stages of various ages, while in areas undisturbed over a long period, interactions between young trees and adults give rise to spatial patterns consistent with substitution dynamic processes implying standing mortality rather than treefalls.

Further, large trees modify their environment by accumulating litter between the buttresses to the point of ensuring sufficient topographic elevation to keep a volume of soil regularly emerged. Consequently the nodules were concentrated in a small circle (5 m in diameter) around the oldest trees. A few nodules (5%) survived under the water table, provided that healthy root hairs were present, and this kept the rate of nodulation constant over a vertical gradient (0.9 nodule g-1 root DW).

Lizards varied in size, activity (diurnal versus nocturnal), microhabitats used, exposure to various conditions of light availability, prey types, and prey sizes. Overlaps in microhabitat occurrence varied from 0 (no overlap) to 1.0 (total overlap) whereas overlaps in prey types varied from 0.005 to 0.607. Microhabitat overlaps were higher overall than dietary overlaps. Pseudocommunity analyses on microhabitat data indicate that the community is not randomly assembled and that two distinct guilds exist, a leaf-litter guild and an arboreal guild, each with four species. Similar analyses on diet data revealed no apparent guild structure at the first rank (nearest neighbour). Lizard diets did not differ from a random assortment based on prey type. At lower levels, tim assemblage was structured with respect to food. Variation in prey use among lizard species was tied more closely to the effect of lizard body size on prey size (lizards ate different-sized prey items). Although exploitative competition among species may maintain structure within this assemblage it does not necessarily cause the observed differences. Several species are nearly identical ecologically to sister taxa in other environments and within different lizard assemblages suggesting that composition of the local assemblage limits the species that can enter the assemblage. Finally, lack of structure at the lowest (most similar) neighbour ranks may reflect the impact of a transitional habitat on stability of species interactions at the local level.",64,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Amazon | Brazil | Diets | Ecology | Lizards | Microhabitat | Neotropics | Niche | Rain forest,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,50,NA,NA,NA

The time devoted to feeding upon some species was recorded in relation to total foraging time (feeding + searching). Capybaras spent similar times feeding on reeds (Eleocharis interstincta; Cyperaceae) and Paratheria prostrata (Poaceae) patches during the dry' season though plant quality was different. During the rainy season, reeds were almost ignored by the animals which fed mainly on Hymenachne amplexicaulis, a grass with a significantly higher content of energy and protein. Capybaras fed for longer time during the dry season but more selectively during the rainy season.

Habitat heterogeneity was significantly higher in the mixed open forest/ecotone area than in the adjacent rain forest. There was a large change in the structure of the small mammal assemblage coincident with the vegetation discontinuity. Although the species richness of small mammals was relatively constant across the gradient, the evenness and diversity of the assemblage declined across the transition from open forest into rain forest and biomass increased, largely due to the high abundance of Rattus fuscipes in the rain forest. The results suggest that the species richness of the small mammal assemblage was not determined by the spatial heterogeneity of the vegetation structure. The species composition of the rain forest is probably related to the historical biogeography of the area whereas the species richness of the wet sclerophyll forest is probably due to a mass-area effect from the adjacent large areas of rain forest and dry sclerophyll forest. However, the evenness, and therefore the diversity of the assemblage, was strongly affected by habitat heterogeneity.",27,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,NA,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,52,all,All Open Access,NA

Yet, few studies have quantified total biomass of plant communities in this ecosystem, particularly the belowground component; a C pool of potential global significance. Total biomass (aboveground and belowground), and the quantity of biomass consumed by fires were measured in four plant communities comprising a vegetation gradient from pure grassland (campo limpo) to a woodland with a closed canopy of tall shrubs and scattered trees (cerrado denso) near Brasilia, DF, Brazil. Total aboveground biomass (TAGB) increased along this gradient from 5.5 Mg ha-1 in campo limpo to 29.4 Mg ha-1 in cerrado denso. Vegetation structure varied among communities; trees were nonexistent in campo limpo, but were at a density of 1000 ha-1 and a biomass of 12.9 Mg ha-1 in cerrado denso. Fires consumed 92 and 84% of the TAGB in campo limpo (pure grassland) and campo sujo (savanna), respectively. In cerrado aberto and cerrado denso, trees and tall shrubs were little affected by fire. Combustion factors of the TAGB in these communities was 54 and 33%, respectively. The total biomass consumed by fire ranged from 5.0 Mg ha-1 in campo limpo to 13.5 Mg ha-1 in cerrado aberto. Compared to other widespread Brazilian ecosystems (tropical dry forest and evergreen forest), the Cerrado has a lower aboveground biomass. The TAGB of cerrado denso is <9% of that of Amazonian tropical evergreen forest. The total quantity of biomass consumed by fire, and hence emissions to the atmosphere is lower in intact Cerrado communities compared to fires in slashed tropical forest. Total belowground biomass (TBGB) increased from 16.3 Mg ha-1 in campo limpo, to 30.1 Mg ha-1 in campo sujo, to 46.5 Mg ha-1 in cerrado aberto, and to 52.9 Mg ha-1 in cerrado denso. This quantity of belowground biomass is similar to, or exceeds that reported for many tropical dry and moist forests. More than 80% of the TBGB occurred in the upper 30 cm of the soil, except for cerrado denso (71%) where a greater proportion of tree roots were present at deeper levels. Root:shoot ratios were very high in all sites ranging from 2.9 in cerrado denso to 7.7 in campo sujo. Total ecosystem plant biomass (the total aboveground biomass and TBGB combined) ranged from 21.9 Mg ha-1 in campo limpo to 77.9 Mg ha-1 in cerrado denso.
