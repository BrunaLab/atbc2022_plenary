In this study, through the use of three highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, we analyze the relationships between length of tail ornaments of male barn swallows and proportion of nestlings fathered in own broods, number of offspring fathered in broods of other pairs, and total number of offspring fathered, using both a correlational and an experimental approach. Consistent with our predictions, we show that males with either naturally long or experimentally elongated tails have higher paternity (proportion of biological offspring in own broods), and they produce more biological offspring during the whole breeding season than males with naturally short or experimentally shortened tails. Males with naturally long tails also had more offspring in extrapair broods than short-tailed males, but the effect of tail manipulation on the number of offspring fathered in extrapair broods, although being in the predicted direction, was not statistically significant. Cuckolded males that did not fertilize extrapair females had smaller postmanipulation tail length than cuckolders. We conclude that there is a causal, positive relationship between male tail length and paternity. Since female barn swallows have extensive control over copulation partners and heritability of tail length is high, this study shows that female choice is a component of selection for larger male ornaments. Benefits from extrapair fertilizations to females may arise because they acquire ""good"" genes for sexual attractiveness or high viability for their offspring.

Driving X chromosomes were found in all populations whenever a good sample size was available. Their frequency may reach up to 60%.

The highest frequencies of driving X chromosomes were observed in islands, while populations from East and Central Africa (the supposed center of origin of the species) showed the highest level of resistance.

In each of two to three consecutive generations, all lines were scored for fecundity, egg-to-pupa and pupa-to-adult viabilities, both in the standard laboratory culture medium (ST) and in three harsh media differing from the former by a single factor: higher temperature (HT), higher NaCl concentration (HSC), or a much reduced concentration of nutrients (D). Relative to the standard medium, productivity (fecundity X viability) decreased by 25% (HT), 66% (HSC), and 80% (D). In each medium, mutational variances of those traits and mutational covariances between all possible pairs were calculated from the between-line divergence (codivergence). Mutational correlations between character states in different media were also obtained.

For all traits, mutational heritabilities ranged from 1.41 x 10-4 to 11.24 x 10-4, and did not increase with intensified environmental harshness. Mutational correlations between character states in different media were usually not large (average absolute value 0.31), reflecting a high degree of environmental specificity of the mutations involved.

Thirteen variable positions defined 18 haplotypes with a maximum sequence divergence of 0.8%. Haplotype (h = 0.28-0.77) and nucleotide (π = 0.058-0.17%) diversities within populations were low, and decreased with increasing latitude (h:r(s) = -0.81; π: r(s) = -0.89). The distribution of pairwise nucleotide differences fit better with expectations of a 'sudden expansion' than of an 'equilibrium' model, and the estimates of long term effective population sizes were considerably lower than current census estimates, especially in northern European samples. Selection is an unlikely cause of observed patterns because the distribution of variability conformed to expectations of neutral infinite alleles model and haplotype diversity across populations was positively correlated with heterozygosity (H(E)) in nuclear genes (r(s) = 0.74, P < 0.05). Hence, a recent bottleneck, followed by serial bottlenecking during the process of post-Pleistocene recolonization of northern Europe, together with recent population expansion provide a plausible explanation for the low genetic diversity in the north. Genetic distances among populations showed a clear pattern of isolation-by-distance, and 14% of the haplotypic variation was among populations, the rest being distributed among individuals within populations. In accordance with allozyme and morphological data, a hierarchical analysis of nucleotide diversity recognized southern European populations as distinct from northern European ones.

In two cases (Mukai et al. 1972; Ohnishi 1977), mutations were allowed to accumulate in copies of chromosome II protected from natural selection and re-combination. In the other one (Fernandez and Lopez-Fanjul 1996), they accumulated in inbred lines derived from an isogenic stock. In contrast with currently accepted hypotheses, we consistently estimated low (about 0.01) genomic viability mutation rates, λ, and a small kurtosis of the distribution of mutational effects on viability (a) in the three datasets. Minimum-distance estimates of the per-generation mean viability change due to mutation (λE[a]) were also obtained. These were very similar for both chromosomal datasets, their absolute values being about five times smaller than estimates obtained from the observed change in mean viability during the mutation process. It must be noted that, in both experiments, viability was measured relative to the Cy chromosome of a Cy/Pm stock. Thus, an unnoticed viability increase in this Cy chromosome may have resulted in overestimation of the mean viability reduction in the lines. In parallel, minimum-distance estimation of λE(a) from inbred lines data (where the selective pressure during the accumulation process was larger) was even somewhat smaller, in absolute value, and very close to the estimate obtained by comparing the mean viability of the lines with that of the control isogenic line.

Essentially two different mechanisms may maintain steep genetic clines. Either selection acts against hybrids that are unfit over the entire zone due to their mixed genetic origin (endogenous selection), or hybrids and parental types attain different fitness values in different parts of the cline (exogenous selection). Survival rate estimates of hybrids and parental forms in different regions of the cline may be used to distinguish between these models to assess how the cline is maintained. We used reciprocal transplants to test the relative survival rates of two parental ecotypes and their hybrids over microscale hybrid zones in the direct-developing marine snail Littorina saxatilis (Olivi) on the rocky shores of Galicia, Spain. One of the parental forms occupies upper and the other lower shores, and the hybrids are found at various proportions (1-38%) along with both parental forms in a midshore zone a few meters wide. The survival rate over one month was 39-52% of the native ecotype on upper shores, but only 2-8% for the lower-shore ecotype. In contrast, only 4-8% of the upper-shore ecotype but 53% of large (> 6 mm) and 8% of small (3-6 mm) native lower-shore ecotype survived in the lower shores. In the midshores, both the two parental ecotypes and the hybrids survived about equally well. Thus there is a considerable advantage for the native ecotypes in the upper and lower shores, while in the hybrid zone none of the morphs, hybrids included, are favored. This indicates that the dimorphism of L. saxatilis is maintained by steep cross-shore selection gradients, thus supporting the selection-gradient model of hybrid zones. We performed field and laboratory experiments that suggest physical factors and predation as important selective agents. Earlier studies indicate assortative mating between the two ecotypes in the midshore. This is unexpected in a hybrid zone maintained by selection gradients, and it seems as if the reproductive barrier compresses the hybrid zone considerably.",144,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,9,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb05107.x,Differential selection | Hybrid zone | Reciprocal transplants | Reinforcement | Selection-gradient model | Tension-zone model | Viability estimates,NA,NA,NA,NA

Some empirical work supports the general premise of this prediction because phenotypes induced by a particular environment sometimes perform better than other phenotypes when tested in that environment. We have extended these results by estimating the targets of selection in Pseudacris triseriata tadpoles in environments without predators and with larval Anax dragonflies. Tadpoles displayed significant behavioral and morphological plasticity when reared in the presence and absence of nonlethal dragonflies for 32 days in cattle tanks. We measured selection in the absence of free predators by regressing growth and survival in the tanks against activity and several measures of tail and body shape. We measured selection in the presence of predators by exposing groups of 10 tadpoles to Anax in overnight predation trials and regressing the average phenotype of survivors against the number of tadpoles killed. Selection in the two environments acted in opposite directions on both tail and body shape, although the affected fitness components were different. In the presence of Anax, tadpoles with shallow and narrow body, deep tail fin, and wide tail muscle survived best. In the absence of free predators, tadpoles with narrow tail muscle grew significantly faster, and those with shallow tail fin and deep body grew somewhat faster. Activity was unrelated to survival or growth in either environment. Developmental plasticity in tail shape closely paralleled selection, because tail fin depth increased after long-term exposure to Anax and tail muscle width tended to increase. In contrast, there was no plasticity in body shape in spite of strong selection for decreasing body depth. Thus, when confronted with a dragonfly predator, P. triseriata tadpoles adjusted their tail shape (but not body shape) almost exactly in the direction of selection imposed by Anax. These results suggest that phenotypic plasticity in some morphological traits, such as tail depth and tail muscle width, has evolved under intermittent selection by dragonflies. Other traits that undergo selection by dragonflies, such as body morphology, appear developmentally rigid, perhaps because of historically strong opposing selection in nature or other constraints.",187,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,11,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb05119.x,Antipredator behavior | Inducible defense | Phenotypic plasticity | Predation | Pseudacris triseriata | Selection | Trade-off,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

The local dynamics in each patch are given by difference equations, which, together with the rate of dispersal between the patches, determine the ecological dynamics of the metapopulation. We assume that phenotypes are given by their dispersal rate. The evolutionary dynamics in phenotype space are determined by invasion exponents, which describe whether a mutant can invade a given resident population. If the resident metapopulation is at a stable equilibrium, then selection on dispersal rates is neutral if the population sizes in the two patches are the same, while selection drives dispersal rates to zero if the local abundances are different. With non-equilibrium metapopulation dynamics, non-zero dispersal rates can be maintained by selection. In this case, and if the patches are ecologically identical, dispersal rates always evolve to values which induce synchronized metapopulation dynamics. If the patches are ecologically different, evolutionary branching into two coexisting dispersal phenotypes can be observed. Such branching can happen repeatedly, leading to polymorphisms with more than two phenotypes. If there is a cost to dispersal, evolutionary cycling in phenotype space can occur due to the dependence of selection pressures on the ecological attractor of the resident population, or because phenotypic branching alternates with the extinction of one of the branches.

This hypothesis is based upon previous work in this laboratory, which has shown that each subspecies apparently has its own allele and that these alleles have a 25-fold excess of nonsynonymous/synonymous base substitutions compared to an average protein under purifying selection. We provide direct evidence for ABP-assortative mate selection in a laboratory setting: Mus musculus domesticus and M. m. musculus female mice recognize and discriminate between the territories of male mice that essentially differ solely in their Abpa genotype and, when the males are present, the female prefers to mate with the one of her own ABP type.

It is likely that the animals apply the protein to their pelts by licking and that it is then deposited in their surroundings. We suggest that females of the two subspecies are able to discriminate between males of those subspecies on the basis of this protein molecule.

I examined the causes of geographic variation in and evolutionary history of number of trunk vertebrae in slender salamanders, Batrachoseps (Caudata: Plethodontidae). Number of trunk vertebrae varies at many taxonomic levels within Batrachoseps. Parallel clines in number occur along an environmental gradient in three lineages in the Coast Ranges of California. These parallel clines may signal either adaptation or a shared phenotypically plastic response to the environmental gradient. By raising eggs from 10 populations representing four species of Batrachoseps, I demonstrated that number of trunk vertebrae can be altered by the developmental temperature; however, the degree of plasticity is insufficient to account for geographic variation. Thus, the geographic variation results largely from genetic variation. Number of trunk vertebrae covaries with body size and shape in diverse vertebrate taxa, including Batrachoseps. I hypothesize that selection for different degrees of elongation, possibly related to fossoriality, has led to the extensive evolution of number of trunk vertebrae in Batrachoseps. Analysis of intrapopulational variation revealed sexual dimorphism in both body shape and number of trunk vertebrae, but no correlation between these variables in either sex. Females are more elongate than males, a pattern that has been attributed to fecundity selection in other taxa.

In the cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea, male-male competition and female mate choice are mediated by a multicomponent male-produced sex pheromone. In this study, I examine variation in this pheromone. First I measure differences among males in both individual pheromone compounds and the overall composition of the pheromone. Principal component analysis is used to quantify and describe pheromone composition. Next, I explore some of the causes and consequences of this variation by examining the pheromone of males with different social experiences. Compared to subordinate males, dominant males have significantly less variable quantities of the individual pheromone compounds and are significantly less variable in the composition of their pheromone. Because of an association between status and mating success, male-male competition can result in stabilizing sexual selection on the sex pheromone. Finally, I test the hypothesis that the pheromone compounds evolve in a manner consistent with their function. As predicted for morphologically integrated characters, the patterns of phenotypic, genetic, and environmental correlations among my measures of pheromone compounds and composition match functional patterns suggested by this study and the developmental patterns demonstrated in my previous studies.

Mean expected heterozygosity, H(e), based on 24 loci in 16 enzyme systems, was 0.093 for 10 sampled populations, which is within the range reported for conifers. However, estimates varied more than twofold among populations and H(e) was closely related to the logarithm of the number of mature trees in the population (r(He,N) = 0.93). Diversity among populations, F(ST), was 24.8% of the total diversity, which is higher than that observed in almost all conifer species studied. Nei's genetic distance, D, was not related to geographic distance between populations, and D was 0.033, which is higher than estimates for most wide-ranging species.

The results illustrate how a combination of paleontological observation and molecular markers can be used to illuminate recent evolutionary events. Multilocus estimates of outcrossing for two small populations were zero (complete selfing) and 0.153, respectively, which are in striking contrast to the near complete outcrossing observed in most conifers.

The goal of this study was to determine if the genetic load for these traits in M. guttatus could be purged in a program of enforced selfing. These characters should have been under much stronger selection in our artificial breeding program than previously reported characters such as biomass and total flower production because, for example, plants unable to produce viable pollen could not contribute to future generations. Purging of genetic load was investigated at the level of both the population and the individual maternal line within two populations of M. guttatus. Mean ovule number, pollen number, and pollen viability declined significantly as plants became more inbred. The mean performance of outcross progeny generated from crosses between pairs of maternal inbred lines always exceeded that of self progeny and was fairly constant for each trait through all five generations. The consistent performance of outcross progeny and the universally negative relationships between performance and degree of inbreeding are interpreted as evidence for the weakness of selection relative to the quick fixation of deleterious alleles due to drift during the inbreeding process. The selective removal (purging) of deleterious alleles from our population would have been revealed by an increase in performance of outcross progeny or an attenuation of the effects of increasing homozygosity. The relationships between the mean of each of these traits and the expected inbreeding coefficient were linear, but one population displayed a significant negative curvilinear relationship between the log of male fertility (a function of pollen number and viability) and the inbreeding coefficient. The generally linear form of the responses to inbreeding were taken as evidence consistent with an additive model of gene action, but the negative curvilinear relationship between male fertility and the inbreeding coefficient suggested reinforcing epistasis. Within both populations there was significant genetic variation among maternal lineages for the response to inbreeding in all traits.

If the life expectancy of a parasite is short, it is expected to evolve a higher rate of host exploitation and therefore higher virulence because the penalty to the parasite for killing the host is reduced. We tested this hypothesis by keeping for 14 months the horizontally transmitted microsporidian parasite Glugoides intestinalis in monoclonal host cultures (Daphnia magna) under conditions of high and low host background mortality. High host mortality, and thus parasite mortality, was achieved by replacing weekly 70-80% of all hosts in a culture with uninfected hosts from stock cultures (Replacement lines). In the low-mortality treatment no replacement took place. Contrary to our expectation, parasites from the Replacement lines evolved a lower within-host growth rate and virulence than parasites from the Nonreplacement lines. Across lines we found a strong positive correlation between within-host growth rate and virulence. We did further experiments to answer the question why our data did not support the predictions. Sporophorous vesicles (SVs, spore clusters) were smaller in doubly infected than in singly infected host-gut cells, indicating that competition within cells bears costs for the parasite. Due to our experimental protocol, the average life span of infections had been much higher in the Nonreplacement lines. Since the number of parasites inside a host increases with the time since infection, long-lasting infections led to high frequencies of multiply infected host-gut cells. Therefore, we speculated that within-cell competition was more severe in the Nonreplacement lines and may have led to selection for accelerated within-host growth. SVs in the Nonreplacement lines were indeed significantly larger.

Much of the predictive power of quantitative genetics depends on the breeder's control over the context in which phenotype and mating are being expressed. In the natural world, these contexts are often difficult to describe, let alone control. We are left, therefore, with a poor understanding of the limits of quantitative genetics in natural populations. One of the crucial contextual elements for assessing breeding value is the genetic background in which an individual's genes are being assessed. When interacting genes are polymorphic within a population, the degree of mating among relatives can influence the correlations among mates and the predictions of a response to selection. Population structure can strongly influence the degree to which dominance and epistasis influences additive genetic variance and heritability. The extent of inbreeding can also influence heritabilities through its effect on the environmental component of phenotypic variance. The applicability of standard quantitative genetic breeding designs to the measurement of heritabilities in natural populations therefore depends in part on: (1) the mating system of the population; and (2) the importance of gene interactions in determining phenotypic variation. We tested for an effect of mating structure on the partitioning of phenotypic variance and heritability by comparing two breeding designs in a common environment. Both breeding designs used 139 pollen parents taken from mapped locations in a population of Plantago lanceolata L., and crossed to 280 seed parents from the same population. One design was random-mating, the second was biased toward near-neighbor matings to an extent determined by field measure of pollen-mediated gene flow distances. The offspring were grown randomly mixed in a common garden. Nine traits were measured: central corm diameter, number of leaves, area of the most recently fully expanded leaf, density of hairs (cm-2) on the leaves, dry weight per unit leaf area, photosynthetic capacity, transpiration rates, water use efficiency, and reproductive dry weight. Heritabilities and variance components from the two designs were compared using randomization tests. None of the variance components or the heritabilities differed significantly between breeding designs at the 0.05 level. The test could distinguish differences between the heritabilities measured in the two breeding designs as small as 0.11, on average. Thus, for the degree of inbreeding normally exhibited in P. lanceolata there is insufficient gene interaction present within populations to influence the partitioning of variance between additive and nonadditive components or to influence heritability estimates to a meaningful extent. We suggest that for Plantago other sources of variation in heritability estimates, such as maternal effects and genotype X environment interactions, are more important influences than the interaction between inbreeding and gene interactions, and standard heritability estimate based on random breeding is as accurate as one taking the natural mating structure into account.",17,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,24,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb05101.x,Additive genetic variance | Gas exchange | Heritability | Mating system | Population structure | Quantitative genetics,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

The results presented here suggest that the r- and K-populations (density-dependent selectin regimes) have differentiated from each other with respect to the following life-history traits: egg-to-adult viability at high larval density (K > r), preadult developmental time (r > K), body weight (r > K), late fecundity (K > r), total realized fecundity (r > K), and longevity of males (r > K). It was also found that the following traits responded in statistically significant manner in populations subjected to different age-specific selection regimes: egg-to-adult viability (O > Y), body weight (O > Y), early fecundity (Y > O), late fecundity (O > Y), and longevity of females and males (O > Y). Although several life-history traits (viability, body weight, late fecundity) responded in similar manner to both density-dependent and age-specific selection regimes, it appears that underlying genetic and physiological mechanisms responsible for differentiation of the r/K and Y/O population are different.

When changes between discrete character states are rare, the maximum-likelihood results are similar to parsimony estimates. In this case the accuracy of estimates is often high, with the exception of some nodes deep in the tree. If change is frequent then reconstructions are highly uncertain, especially of distant ancestors. Ancestor states for continuous traits are typically highly uncertain. We conclude that measures of uncertainty are useful and should always be provided, despite simplistic assumptions about the probabilistic models that underlie them.

Such traits can be understood using the threshold model of quantitative genetics that posits a continuously distributed underlying trait, called the liability, and a threshold of response, individuals above the threshold displaying one morph and individuals below the threshold displaying the alternate morph. For many threshold traits the liability probably consists of a hormone or a suite of hormones. Previous experiments have implicated juvenile hormone esterase (JHE), a degratory enzyme of juvenile hormone, as a physiological determinant of wing dimorphism in the crickets Gryllus rubens and G. firmus. The present study uses a half-sib experiment to measure the heritability of JHE in the last nymphal stadium of G. firmus and its genetic correlation with fecundity, a trait that is itself genetically correlated with wing morph. The phenotypic and genetic parameters are consistent with the hypothesis that JHE is a significant component of the liability. Comparison of sire and dam estimates suggest that nonadditive effects may be important. Two models have been proposed to account for the fitness differences between morphs: the dichotomy model, which assumes that each morph can be characterized by a particular suite of traits, and the continuous model, which assumes that the associated fitness traits are correlated with the liability rather than the morphs themselves. The latter model predicts that the fitness differences will not be constant but change with the morph frequencies.

Hybrid inviability is assumed to be caused by epistatic interactions between background loci. We examine the spread of an introduced preference allele for a previously unpreferred male trait that characterizes one of the populations.

This expanded Price Equation provides an exact description of total evolutionary change under all conditions, and for all systems of inheritance and selection. The model is first used for a new proof of Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection.

One source of such genetic variation are deleterious mutations with habitat-specific fitness effects. I use deterministic two-locus and multilocus models to show that the presence of such mutations in the gene pool results in indirect selection favoring habitat fidelity or habitat preference over acceptance of both suitable habitats.

When an individual predator's consumption increases at a decreasing rate with prey availability, prey adaptation via either of these mechanisms may produce sustained cycles in both species' population densities and in the prey's mean trait value. Sufficiently rapid adaptive change (e.g., behavioral adaptation or evolution of traits with a large additive genetic variance), or sufficiently low predator birth and death rates will produce sustained cycles or chaos, even when the predator-prey dynamics with fixed prey capture rates would have been stable. Adaptive dynamics can also stabilize a system that would exhibit limit cycles if traits were fixed at their equilibrium values.

But empirical evidence for such trade-offs is scant, which has called into question the likelihood of nonallopatric speciation. Here, we report on the second in a series of studies testing for host-related selection on pupal life-history characteristics of apple- (Malus pumila L.) and hawthorn- (Crataegus mollis L. spp.) infesting races of the Tephritid fruit fly, Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh). In particular, we examine the effects of winter length on the genetics of these flies. We have previously found that the earlier fruiting phenology of apple trees exposes apple-fly pupae to longer periods of warm weather preceding winter than hawthorn-fly pupae. Because R. pomonella has a facultative diapause, we hypothesized that this selects for pupae with more recalcitrant pupal diapauses (or slower metabolic/development rates) in the apple-fly race. A study in which we experimentally manipulated the length of the prewintering period for hawthorn-origin pupae supported this prediction. If the period preceding winter is important for apple- and hawthorn-fly pupae, then so too should be the length (duration) of winter; the rationale for this prediction is that 'fast developing' pupae that break diapause too early will deplete their energy reserves and disproportionately die during long winters. To test this possibility, we chilled apple- and hawthorn-origin pupae collected from a field site near Grant, Michigan, in a refrigerator at 4°C for time periods ranging from one week to two years. Our a priori expectation was that longer periods of cold storage would select against allozyme markers that were associated with faster rates of development in our earlier study. Since these electromorphs are typically found at higher frequencies in hawthorn flies, extending the overwintering period should favor 'apple-fly alleles' in both races. The results from this 'overwinter' experiment supported the diapause hypothesis. The anticipated genetic response was observed in both apple and hawthorn races, as allele frequencies became significantly more 'apple-fly-like' in eclosing adults surviving longer chilling periods. This indicates that it is the combination of environmental conditions before and during winter that selects on the host races. Many tests for trade-offs fail to adequately consider the interplay between insect development, host plant phenology, and local climatic conditions.

We estimated the level of genetic divergence between lake and stream fish in Misty Lake and tested hypotheses of single versus multiple origins of the pairs by assaying mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) restriction site variation in samples from the three lake systems.

Comparable forms (lake or stream) in the different lakes did not cluster together in terms of mtDNA nucleotide divergence, suggesting that the pairs have had independent origins.

Many of the species are geographically restricted; all of the species are found in allopatry. Observed patterns of morphological variation and biogeographic evidence suggest that species diversification in this lineage may have occurred recently, perhaps in response to Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. To address questions about the spatial and temporal dynamics of Nesticus speciation, while accounting for potential phylogenetic difficulties, I have gathered nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences for a sample of individuals from 81 populations representing 28 Nesticus species. Analyses of these data indicate that considerable genetic divergence exists within and among currently recognized morphological species. Consistent with relatively deep species divergences, most of which likely predate the Pleistocene, is a prevailing pattern of phylogenetic concordance between taxonomic species and monophyletic gene tree lineages. The few deviations from monophyly detected can be tentatively attributed to a peripatric mode of speciation. Although species limits as inferred by the molecular data are generally concordant with patterns of morphological continuity and discontinuity in genitalia, there is evidence to suggest that cryptic phylogenetic lineages exist within some morphologically continuous units.

Hierarchical decomposition of common principal component (CPC) analyses applied to each clade in the phylogeny rejects the hypothesis that common principal component structure is shared in clades more inclusive than subspecies. Most subspecies also lack a common covariance structure as described by the CPC model.

Few significant differences existed between the white and giant rabbits, but several differences were found between the white and dwarf breeds. Similarly, comparisons of adult morphology showed that white and giant rabbits are the same shape, while dwarf rabbits have shorter and broader snouts than white rabbits. The variation in size among breeds appeared to be due to differences in the length of time spent growing at rates near the maximum growth rate. While no one parameter of this model quantifies this pattern, differences in duration of maximum growth rate can be seen in the first derivative of the growth trajectory. Small changes in the model's parameters that measure rate and timing of growth have large morphological consequences, indicating that heterochronic changes are important sources of variation.",52,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,49,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb02406.x,Craniofacial growth | growth | heterochrony | ontogenetic variation,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We show that epistasis is indicated by greater variance among families of haploid progeny derived from individual diploids than among clonally replicated haploid sibs from the same sporophyte.

Here we demonstrate local adaptation in two subspecies of the California native annual Gilia capitata using standard reciprocal transplant techniques in two sites (coastal and inland) over three consecutive years. Subspecies performance in each site was measured in four ways: probability of seedling emergence, early vegetative size (length of longest leaf), probability of flowering, and total number of inflorescences produced per plant. Analysis of three of the four variables demonstrated local adaptation through site-by-subspecies interactions in which natives outperformed immigrants. The disparity between natives and immigrants in their probability of emergence and probability of flowering was greater at the coastal site than at the inland site. Treated in isolation, these two fitness components suggest that migration from the coast to the inland site may be less restricted by selection than migration in the opposite direction. Two measurements of individual size (leaf length and number of inflorescences), suggest (though not strongly) that immigrants may be subject to weaker selection at the coastal site than at the inland site. A standard cohort life table is used to compare replacement rates (R0)) for each subspecies at each site. Comparisons of R0s suggest that immigrants are under a severe demographic disadvantage at the coastal site, but only a small disadvantage at the inland site.

Its current distribution is centered in two geographic areas, situated about 150 km apart, in south-central California. We sequenced a 293 base-pair fragment at the 5' end of the control region in 95 giant kangaroo rats from nine localities to examine the genetic structure of extant populations. We determine that mutations in this section of the control region follow a negative binominal distribution, rather than a Poisson. However, the distance between haplotypes is small enough that the difference between a tree that corrects for the non-Poisson distribution of mutations and one that does not, is minimal. This implies that the use of methods that assume a Poisson distribution of mutations, such as those based on coalescent theory, are justified. We find that the correlation between levels of genetic diversity and estimated census size is poor. This suggests that population sizes have fluctuated over time or that populations have not been isolated from one another, or both. We also examine the hierarchical structure of populations and find that the southern populations are not genetically subdivided but that there is significant subdivision between northern and southern populations and between some northern subpopulations. The phylogeographic relationship between northern and southern populations can primarily be attributed to isolation by distance, although the time since divergence between them appears to be less than the age of either. To examine the phylogeographic relationships in more detail we construct a minimum spanning tree based on Tamura-Nei gamma-corrected distances and superimpose on it the geographic position of haplotypes. This reveals that there is more genetic distance between some northern haplotypes than between any northern and southern haplotypes, despite the geographic distance separating north from south and the larger size of the southern population. It also reveals that one northern population, in the Panoche Valley, contains old allelic lineages and shares ancestral polymorphism with several other populations. It also shows that two, small, geographically remote populations contain a surprising amount of genetic diversity, but that different population/geographic processes have affected the structure of that diversity. We estimate the average migration rate among all populations to be 7.5 per generation, and conclude that a disproportionate number of migration events involve gene flow with one northern population, the Panoche Valley. We find evidence for the hypothesis that there has been an increase in population size in the remaining populations in the north and suggest that the Panoche Valley could play a role in these expansions. Finally we discuss the probability that the genetic structure of the southern populations has been affected by fluctuations in size.

When presented with males of the same size from different populations, females preferred native over foreign males in some but not all population combinations. These results cannot be explained by a bias for higher size-specific rates of courtship displays that is shared by all females. Males preferred larger over smaller females; larger males exhibited stronger preferences, and preference for the larger female also increased as the disparity in size between the two object females increased. We found no evidence that males preferred native over foreign females when encountered singly or in size-matched combinations. These results indicate that discrimination among populations arises because females exercise divergent directional preferences for size-specific trait values that are associated with differences among males in these values.

Wild irises grew at all four sites, but differed in genotypic composition among sites.

At all other sites, F1 rhizomes grew significantly more than all other classes except for L hexagona at the L hexagons hybrid site.

These results are inconsistent with all three models of hybrid zone structure. They suggest that once rhizomes become established, hybrids can reproduce by clonal growth as successfully as parents in all habitats, and can outperform them in some habitats.

Temperature is implicated as an important selective agent because long-term laboratory culture of Drosophila leads to the evolution of larger body size at lower temperatures. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that, in Drosophila melanogaster, larger size is favored at lower temperatures in part because of selection on adult females. We used replicated lines of D. melanogaster artificially selected for increased and decreased wing area with constant cell area. The resulting size differences between the selected lines were due solely to differences in cell number, and thereby were similar to the cellular basis of clinal variation in body size in nature. We examined life-history traits of adult females at 18 and 25°C. Rearing for two generations at the two temperatures did not affect the extent of the size differences between lines from the different selection regimes. There was a strong interaction between temperature and size selection for both survival and lifetime reproductive success, with larger females living significantly longer and producing more offspring over their lifetime only when reared and tested in the colder environment. There was also an increase in average daily progeny production in large-line females relative to the control and small lines again, only in the colder environment. Thus, the females from the large selection lines were relatively fitter at the colder temperature. At both experimental temperatures, especially the lower one, the small- line females rescheduled their progeny production to later ages.

In studies of inbreeding depression in two greenhouse environments, families of hermaphrodites exhibited significant inbreeding depression (δ = 0.60), based on a multiplicative fitness function using seeds per capsule, germination, survival, and the inflorescence biomass of progeny. Differences between inbred and outcrossed progeny were smallest at the early stage of seeds per capsule and more pronounced at the later stages of survival and inflorescence production. These results are consistent with inbreeding depression caused by many mutations of small effect. Using allozyme analyses, the inbreeding coefficient of adult plants in the field was not significantly different from zero, implying that δ in nature may be equal to one. The single locus estimate of the outcrossing rate for hermaphrodites was 0.50 based on progeny that survived to flowering; corrected for the disproportionate loss before flowering of progeny from selfing, the adjusted outcrossing rate at the zygote stage was 0.32, suggesting that considerable selfing occurs in hermaphrodites. Females were totally outcrossed. When females and hermaphrodites were compared for reproductive output in the field, females produced over twice as many seeds per plant as hermaphrodites, primarily because females had far more capsules per inflorescence than hermaphrodites. Females had greater mass per seed than hermaphrodites in the field, either because of greater provisioning or reduced inbreeding depression. There was no significant differential mortality with respect to sex over a seven year period. The higher number of seeds per plant of females, combined with substantial inbreeding depression and relatively high selfing rates for hermaphrodites, are probably responsible for the maintenance of females in this population. The predicted frequency of females based on data for seed production, the adjusted selfing rate, and inbreeding depression is 42%, remarkably close to the observed frequency of 39%.

Using morphological differences between sympatric species as evidence that competition promotes divergence (e.g., character displacement), has, in particular, drawn harsh criticism because morphological differences may have evolved during allopatry. In contrast to species, alternative phenotypes within a species have a common phylogenetic history, so differences between phenotypes are likely to result from ecological conditions experienced in sympatry. Using cannibal and typical larval phenotypes of the Arizona tiger salamander, Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum, we tested two predictions of the hypothesis that resource competition promotes morphological divergence: (1) larval phenotypes should reduce competition by using different resources; and (2) the advantage to developing the alternative, cannibal phenotype should be highest when competition among typical larvae is most intense. We used field surveys and a field experiment to test these predictions. The two larval phenotypes used different resources, especially when competition was intense.

We conclude that while phases I and II of Wright's theory (the movement of populations from one 'adaptive peak' to another via drift and selection) can occur under some conditions, genetic drift is often unnecessary for movement between peaks. Phase III of the shifting balance, in which adaptations spread from particular populations to the entire species, faces two major theoretical obstacles: (1) unlike adaptations favored by simple directional selection, adaptations whose fixation requires some genetic drift are often prevented from spreading by barriers to gene flow; and (2) it is difficult to assemble complex adaptations whose constituent parts arise via peak shifts in different demes. Our review of the data from nature shows that although there is some evidence for individual phases of the shifting balance process, there are few empirical observations explained better by Wright's three-phase mechanism than by simple mass selection. Similarly, artificial selection experiments fail to show that selection in subdivided populations produces greater response than does mass selection in large populations. The complexity of the shifting balance process and the difficulty of establishing that adaptive valleys have been crossed by genetic drift make it impossible to test Wright's claim that adaptations commonly originate by this process.

Tetraploids showed less inbreeding depression than diploids at all life history stages, and these differences were significant for seed-set and cumulative fitness, but not for germination, survival, or plant dry mass at nine weeks. This result suggests that the genetic basis of inbreeding depression may differ among life stages. The primary selfing rate of the tetraploid population was r = 0.43, which is nearly identical to that of a diploid population (r = 0.45), indicating that differences in inbreeding depression between diploids and tetraploids are probably not due to differences in the mating system.

However, these studies have not addressed several genetic issues, which can in principle have a substantial influence on the risk of extinction. These include the presence of synergistic epistasis, which can reduce the rate of mutation accumulation by progressively magnifying the selective effects of mutations, and the occurrence of beneficial mutations, which can offset the effects of previous deleterious mutations. In stochastic simulations of small populations (effective sizes on the order of 100 or less), we show that both synergistic epistasis and the rate of beneficial mutation must be unrealistically high to substantially reduce the risk of extinction due to random fixation of deleterious mutations. However, in analytical calculations based on diffusion theory, we show that in large, outcrossing populations (effective sizes greater than a few hundred), very low levels of beneficial mutation are sufficient to prevent mutational decay. Further simulation results indicate that in populations small enough to be highly vulnerable to mutational decay, variance in deleterious mutational effects reduces the risk of extinction, assuming that the mean deleterious mutational effect is on the order of a few percent or less. We also examine the magnitude of outcrossing that is necessary to liberate a predominantly selfing population from the threat of long-term mutational deterioration. The critical amount of outcrossing appears to be greater than is common in near-obligately selfing plant species, supporting the contention that such species are generally doomed to extinction via random drift of new mutations. Our results support the hypothesis that a long-term effective population size in the neighborhood of a few hundred individuals defines an approximate threshold, below which outcrossing populations are vulnerable to extinction via fixation of deleterious mutations, and above which immunity is acquired.",113,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,89,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb01459.x,Effective population size | Epistasis | Extinction | Genetic drift | Mutation | Outcrossing | Selfing,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

The variability was analyzed using four polymorphic microsatellite loci. A very large number of alleles (up to 55) was found at the level of the whole study. Observed heterozygote deficiencies within populations are consistent with very high selfing rates, generally above 0.80, in all populations. These should depress the variability within populations, because of low effective size, genetic hitchhiking, and background selection, whatever the model of mutation assumed. However, that some populations exhibit much more variability than others suggests that historical demographic processes (e.g., population size variation, bottlenecks, or founding events) may play a significant role. A hierarchical analysis of the distribution of the variability across populations indicates a strong pattern of isolation by distance, whatever the geographical scale considered.

These parasites, which have been termed adelphoparasites in the botanical literature, and more recently, agastoparasites in the insect literature, may evolve monophyletically from one host and radiate secondarily to other hosts or, these parasites may arise polyphyletically, each arising from its own host. In this study we compare the internal transcribed spacer regions of the nuclear ribosomal repeats of species and formae specialis (host races) included in the red algal parasite genus Asterocolax with its hosts, which all belong to the Phycodrys group of the Delesseriaceae and with closely related nonhost taxa of the Delesseriaceae. These analyses reveal that species of Asterocolax have evolved polyphyletically. Asterocolax erythroglossi from the North Atlantic host Erythroglossum laciniatum appears to have evolved from its host, whereas taxa included in the north Pacific species Asterocolax gardneri have had two independent origins. Asterocolax gardneri from the host Polyneura latissima probably arose directly from this host. In contrast, all other A. gardneri fortune specialis appear to have originated from either Phycodrys setchellii or P. isabelliae and radiated secondarily onto other closely related taxa of the Phycodrys group, including Nienburgia andersoniana and Aniso-cladella pacifica. Gamete crossing experiments confirm that A. gardneri from each host is genetically isolated from both its host, and from other A. gardneri and their hosts. Cross-infection experiments reveal that A. gardneri develops normally only on its natural host, although some abberrant growth may occur on alternate hosts. The ability of red algal parasites to radiate secondarily to other red algal taxa, where they may become isolated genetically and speciate, suggests that this process of speciation is not a 'genetic dead end' but one that may give rise to related clusters of parasite species.",34,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,91,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb03954.x,Adelphoparasites | Asterocolax | Delesseriaceae | Host-parasite interactions | Internal transcribed spacers | Rhodophyta | Sympatric speciation,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

It is shown that although there are slight shifts in the sequence of development within the somatic tissues of the head, the primary difference between marsupial and placental mammals involves the timing and rate of differentiation of structures of the central nervous system (CNS) relative to a specific subset of structures of the cranial skeleton and musculature. In eutherians, CNS morphogenesis is well underway before the somatic tissues of the head begin differentiation. In metatherians, CNS development is delayed considerably and certain elements of the skeletal and muscular systems are advanced. It is concluded that the developmental differences between marsupial and placental mammals are best explained by the interaction of several processes including neurogenesis as a potential rate-limiting step, the developmental requirements of somatic elements, and the extremely short period of organogenesis of marsupial mammals.

The genotypes observed in these samples document that cuckoldry by males did not occur; males often receive eggs from multiple females during the course of a pregnancy (six males had one mate each, 13 had two mates, and three had three mates); embryos from different females are segregated spatially within a male's brood pouch; and a female's clutch of eggs often is divided among more than one male. Thus, the genetic mating system of the dusky pipefish is best described as polygynandrous.

The relative importance of these barriers has been the focus of a long-standing debate between vicariance and dispersal schools in biogeography. Comparisons of a 500 bp fragment of the mitochondrial (mt) DNA control region reveal strong geographic structuring of mtDNA lineages but shallow divergence both within and between regional populations. Regional populations are related to one another in a stepping-stone pattern, the apparent result of a series of Pleistocene dispersal events around the continental margins of the Indian-Pacific Basin. These mtDNA data, combined with an electrophoretic survey of variability at 34 nuclear loci (Grant and Leslie 1996), indicate that the five regional forms of Sardinops (considered separate taxa by most authorities) probably diverged within 500,000 years BP, a much shorter timeframe than predicted by vicariance models based on plate tectonics. High mtDNA haplotype diversity, coupled with an excess of rare alleles in the protein electrophoretic dataset, may indicate exponential growth from a small ancestral population. The mtDNA and allozyme data are concordant with climate records and fossil evidence in portraying regional populations as recent, unstable, and ephemeral.

In this study, we take advantage of geographic variation in the dispersal strategies of two wing-dimorphic planthopper species, Prokelisia marginata and P. dolus, to examine for the first time whether levels of gene flow among populations are correlated with intraspecific variation in dispersal ability. We found that in both of these coastal salt marsh-inhabiting species, population-genetic subdivision, as assessed using allozyme electrophoresis, parallels geographic variation in the proportion of flight-capable adults (macropters) in a population; in regions where levels of macroptery are high, population genetic subdivision is less than in regions where levels of macroptery are low. We found no evidence that geographic variation in dispersal capability influences the degree to which gene flow declines with distance in either species. Thus, both species provided evidence that intraspecific variation in dispersal strategies influences the genetic structure of populations, and that this effect is manifested in population-genetic structure at the scale of large, coastal regions, rather than in genetic isolation by distance within a region. This conclusion was supported by interspecific comparisons revealing that: (1) population-genetic structure (G(ST)) of the two Prokelisia species correlated negatively with the mean proportion of flight-capable adults within a region; and (2) there was no evidence that the degree of isolation by distance increased with decreasing dispersal capability. Populations of the relatively sedentary P. dolus clustered by geographic region (using Nei's distances), but this was not the case for the more mobile P. marginata. Furthermore, gene flow among the two major regions we surveyed (Atlantic and Gulf Coasts) has been substantial in P. marginata, but relatively less in P. dolus. The results for P. marginata suggest that differences in the dispersal strategies of Atlantic and Gulf Coast populations occur despite extensive gene flow. We argue that gene flow is biased from Atlantic to Gulf Coast populations, indicating that selection favoring a reduction in flight capability must be intense along the Gulf. Together, the results of this study provide the first rigorous evidence of a negative relationship within a species: between dispersal ability and the genetic structure of populations.

We measured ovariole number, and competitive fitness and its components, for 48 homozygous chromosome 3 substitution lines in a standard inbred background; and body size in a sample of 15 chromosome 3 substitution lines.

Estimates of quantitative genetic parameters for body size (H2 = 0.191, CV(G) = 2.15, and CV(R) = 3.87) are similar to those previously reported for this trait. Although the isogenic chromosome 3 substitution lines varied significantly for components of fitness, there was no significant linear or quadratic association of ovariole number and body size with fitness.

Measurements of the fecundity of these two types of fly showed that the size change had no effect on lifetime fecundity, regardless of the adult test temperature. Thus the phenotypic plasticity breaks the usual positive correlation between body size and fecundity. However, at a given temperature, early fecundity (defined as productivity for days 5 through 12 after eclosion at 25°C and days 7 through 17 at 18°C) was highest when the rearing and test temperatures were the same. The early fecundity advantage due to rearing at the test temperature was 25% at 18°C and 16% at 25°C, a result consistent with the overall phenotypic response to temperature being adaptive. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that the temperature treatments resulted in a trade-off between early fecundity and longevity, a trade-off that parallels the known genetic correlation. Another parallel is that both the temperature-induced and genetic effects are independent of total fecundity. By contrast, within the temperature treatments, the phenotypic correlation between early fecundity and longevity was positive, illustrating the danger of assuming that phenotypic and genetic correlations are similar, or even of the same sign.",89,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,99,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb01476.x,Adaptive plasticity | Body size | Drosophila melanogaster | Fecundity | Longevity | Phenotypic correlation | Temperature,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

When species have high dispersal potential and few barriers to gene flow, allopatric divergence is slow. Nevertheless, many marine species are of recent origin, even in taxa with high dispersal potential. To understand the relationship between genetic structure and recent species formation in high dispersal taxa, we examined population genetic structure among four species of sea urchins in the tropical Indo-West Pacific that have speciated within the past one to three million years. Despite high potential for gene flow, mtDNA sequence variation among 200 individuals of four species in the urchin genus Echinometra shows a signal of strong geographic effects. These effects include (1) substantial population heterogeneity; (2) lower genetic variation in peripheral populations; and (3) isolation by distance. These geographic patterns are especially strong across scales of 5000-10,000 km, and are weaker over scales of 2500-5000 km. As a result, strong geographic patterns would not have been readily visible except over the wide expanse of the tropical Pacific. Surface currents in the Pacific do not explain patterns of gene flow any better than do patterns of simple spatial proximity. Finally, populations of each species tend to group into large mtDNA regions with similar mtDNA haplotypes, but these regional boundaries are not concordant in different species. These results show that all four species have accumulated mtDNA differences over similar spatial and temporal scales but that the precise geographic pattern of genetic differentiation varies for each species.

Tests apparently showing that symmetry decreases as individual condition decreases have bolstered the view that FA plays a significant role in the evolution of sexual signals. However, a closer inspection of several examples of bilateral variation as a function of trait size (a correlate of condition) suggests a different pattern of variation. Rather than FA, these traits suggest a pattern of size-dependent antisymmetry (a bimodal frequency distribution of R - L). We introduce some quantitative methods to test for condition- or size-dependent FA. Our analyses reject pure FA for four of the five published datasets involving signals (the fifth is equivocal), but confirm the presence of size-dependent FA in one nonsignaling trait. In the studies not conforming to FA, the data appear to fit more closely a pattern of antisymmetry in individuals with smaller signaling traits. Our results thus suggest that current discussions and conclusions about the role of FA in the evolution of signaling systems should be reconsidered. More specifically, we note that condition-dependent antisymmetry offers a more reliable indicator than condition-dependent FA. We caution, however that additional work will be needed to determine whether the pattern is general and not an artifact. Our method of analysis could usefully be applied to studies of other continuous factors expected to be correlated with asymmetries, including heterozygosity, inbreeding, and environmental stress.

Viviparity appears to have evolved twice in this group: once in S. goldmani, included in a clade formed by a northern group consisting of S. scalaris, S. chaneyi, and S. goldmani, and one more time in S. bicanthalis, included in the southern group formed by S. bicanthalis and S. aeneus. An oviparous population of S. bicanthalis nested within that viviparous clade, indicates that reversal from viviparity to oviparity may be possible. Degree of sequence divergence among several S. bicanthalis individuals pertaining to a population in which both parity modes occur, was no larger between oviparous and viviparous lizards than among viviparous lizards. This suggests that this population is a single species, and it may represent a transition from oviparity to viviparity or vice-versa.",55,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,103,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb03973.x,Lizard | MtDNA | Phylogeny | Sceloporus | Viviparity,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

I examined these populations for local adaptive responses in terms of oviposition behavior, growth, and chemical defense, on both P. lanceolata and K. elatine. In addition, I examined the genetic architecture underlying these traits using a full-sib quantitative genetic analysis. I found that a significant majority of females prefer the host plant species found at their collection sites in oviposition tests, but that there is no evidence that they are locally adapted in growth performance, as measured by fifth-instar and pupal weights and development times. Neither are there correlations between oviposition preferences of females and the growth performance or levels of chemical defense of their offspring. The two populations studied do, however, show specialization in terms of the levels of chemical defense they sequester from their host plants. I argue that these results indicate that natural enemies are the normal barriers to host range expansion in this oligophagous herbivore because a breakdown in those barriers results in genetic changes that enhance resistance to predation. This is despite the fact that adaptive responses in physiology are unlikely to be limited by a lack of genetic variability; the genetic architecture among traits would be conducive to specialization in growth performance; and there are costs to chemical defense in this species.

Different color morphs exist in different regions of the Great Barrier Reef, and morphs from northern and southern regions are genetically distinct. In the Hydrographers Passage area, which is a large break through the reef matrix in the central Great Barrier Reef that may have acted as a bottleneck on the migration of these animals during sea level rise, three morphs recognized from other regions were found on neighboring reefs. The transition between them is abrupt with three loci (AAT-2*, GPI-1*, and PGM*) showing allelic frequency patterns close to fixation between opposite alleles within a few kilometers. On two reefs (Hyde, Bebe), a pair of morphs was found to coexist and exhibited a habitat partitioning pattern with each morph restricted to one side on the reef and steep transitions in between. Outside these transition zones, phenotypes and genotypes matched those on surrounding reefs without coexistence and were little changed from reefs several hundred kilometers away. An electrophoretic survey across one transition zone on Hyde Reef showed steep genetic gradients along one kilometer of reef slope. Significant linkage disequilibria in samples collected in Hyde Reef as a result of dispersal of parental combinations of alleles into the center or because parental combinations of alleles confer greater fitness, allowed us to estimate the dispersal rate (189 m/generation) and the selection pressure on the marker loci (0.411). Finally, we investigated models that could lead to such a steep transition in genotypic and phenotypic combinations. Both contact zones on each side of Hyde Reef were associated with geomorphological discontinuities in the reef structure. We suggest that assortative mating may be a proximal mechanism for maintaining isolated each color morph, which could be reinforced by selective predation against hybrids outside the zone of their formation (i.e., the frequency-dependent selection model of Mallet and Barton (1989).

Since it has been suggested that swimming velocity increases with sperm length, earlier studies proposed longer (and therefore faster) sperm are advantageous under conditions of intense sperm competition. Nonetheless, previous work has been equivocal, perhaps because the intensity of sperm competition was measured indirectly. DNA profiling now provides a more direct measure of the number of offspring sired by extrapair males, and thus a more direct method of assessing the potential for sperm competition. Using a sample of 21 species of passerine birds for which DNA profiling data were available, we found a positive relation between sperm length and the degree of extrapair paternity. A path analysis, however, revealed that this relationship arises only indirectly through the positive relationship between the rate of extrapair paternity and length of sperm storage tubules (SSTs) in the female. As sperm length is correlated positively with SST length, an increase in the intensity of sperm competition leads to an increase in sperm length only through its effect on SST length. Why females vary SST length with the intensity of sperm competition is not clear, but one possibility is that it increases female control over how sperm are used in fertilization. Males, in turn, may respond on an evolutionary time scale to changes in SST size by increasing sperm length to prevent displacement from rival sperm. Previous theoretical analyses predicting that sperm size should decrease as sperm competition becomes more intense were not supported by our findings. We suggest that future models of sperm-size evolution consider not only the role of sperm competition, but also how female control and manipulation of ejaculates after insemination selects for different sperm morphologies.",185,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,111,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb03674.x,Fertilization | Passerine birds | Sperm competition | Sperm size | Sperm storage tubule,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

In species distributed over a broad latitudinal range, geographical variation in morphological and life-history traits may reflect very different relations between genotypic and environmental effects on these traits. Patterns of selection among latitudinally separated sites may minimize phenotypic differences in life-history traits but promote phenotypic differences in form. Thus, for example, latitudinal variation in temperature often leads to genetically based metabolic differences that minimize differences in growth rate among populations at different latitudes (countergradient variation). However, variation in habitat experienced by the same populations may promote genetically based differences in shell form (cogradient variation). Few attempts have been made to assess simultaneously such mosaic effects of natural selection on the genetic basis of variation in both morphological and life-history traits among geographically separated populations. I quantified the extent to which widely separated populations of the rocky shore marine gastropod Bembicium vittatum exhibited genetic differences in shell shape, shell pattern, and growth rate. Bembicium vittatum occurs naturally at only three widely separated locations on the Western Australian coast. Individuals were transplanted from all three locations to a latitudinally intermediate site, where they were released in different pairwise combinations and allowed to reproduce. F1 offspring from crosses between same- or different-source parents were identified using allozyme markers. When grown in a common environment, offspring from same-source parents exhibited similar differences in shell shape and pattern, but dramatic differences in growth rates, compared to native populations. Genetic variation therefore exists for all three traits. Growth rates in the common environment were positively correlated with latitude of the source population, confirming the existence of countergradient variation for growth associated with metabolic compensation. In addition, for both shell shape and growth rate, hybrids exhibited phenotypes roughly midway between the same-source parents, suggesting that genetic differences have a large additive component. In contrast, when one parent had pigmented spots, the offspring also had spots, suggesting a strong dominance component to the genetic basis of shell pattern. Genetic differences therefore yield different morphological phenotypes but similar life-history phenotypes, among latitudinally distant populations, and confirm a pattern of mosaic evolution in B. vittatum.",73,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,112,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb03661.x,Countergradient variation | Habitat | Latitude | Metabolic compensation | Pattern | Plasticity | Shape,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) populations in the Galapagos exhibit 10-fold differences in body mass between island populations. There is also strong sexual size dimorphism, with males being about twice as heavy as females. To understand the evolutionary processes shaping body size in marine iguanas, we analyzed the selection differentials on body size in two island populations (max. male mass 900 g in Genovesa, 3500 g in Santa Fe). Factors that usually confound any evolutionary analysis of body sizes-predation, interspecific food competition, reproductive role division-are ruled out for marine iguanas. We show that, above hatchlings, mortality rates increased with body size in both sexes to the same extent. This effect was independent of individual age. The largest animals (males) of each island were the first to die once environmental conditions deteriorated (e.g., during El Ninos). This sex-biased mortality was the result of sexual size dimorphism, but at the same time caused sexual size dimorphism to fluctuate. Mortality differed between seasons (selection differentials as low as - 1.4) and acted on different absolute body sizes between islands. Both males and females did not cease growth when an optimal body size for survival was reached, as demonstrated by the fact that individual adult body size phenotypically increased in each population under favorable environmental conditions beyond naturally selected limits. But why did marine iguanas grow 'too large' for survival? Due to lek mating, sexual selection constantly favored large body size in males (selection differentials up to +0.77). Females only need to reach a body size sufficient to produce surviving offspring. Thereafter, large body size of females was less favored by fertility selection than large size in males. Resulting from these different selection pressures on male and female size, sexual size dimorphism was mechanistically caused by the fact that females matured at an earlier age and size than males, whereafter they constantly allocated resources into eggs, which slowed growth. The observed allometric increase in sexual size dimorphism is explained by the fact that the difference between these selective processes becomes larger as energy abundance in the environment increases. Because body size is generally highly heritable, these selective processes are expected to lead to genetic differences in body size between islands.

The change in pattern of selection reveals that natural enemies imposed selection favoring increased glucosinolate concentration and increased triohome density, and thus, supports one of the major assumptions of the coevolution hypothesis.

If epistasis is synergistic, the main function of sex may he to facilitate selection against deleterious mutations. We use strains of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger with variable combinations of marker mutations that have been obtained by isolating segregants from a diploid between a wild-type strain and a related strain carrying a marker mutation on each of its eight chromosomes. The marker mutations include five auxotrophic and two resistance mutations. As a measure of fitness the mycelium growth rate on supplemented medium has been used. The results suggest that the marker mutations have independent effects on fitness, and hence they do not support the deterministic mutation hypothesis of the evolution of sex.

However, due to an isolation bias caused by the fact that not all possible strains with many mutations could be isolated, the results may be relatively biased towards an antagonistic relationship between mutation number and log fitness.",99,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,120,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb01473.x,Aspergillus | Evolution of sex | Synergistic epistasis,NA,NA,NA,NA

Developmental speed and larval survival,Chippindale A.K.,Evolution,00143820,51,5,1536-1551,1997-01-01,October 1997,"Developmental time is a trait of great relevance to fitness in all organisms. In holometabolous species that occupy ephemeral habitat, like Drosophila melanogaster, the impact of developmental time upon fitness is further exaggerated. We explored the trade-offs surrounding developmental time by selecting 10 independent populations from two distantly related selection treatments (CB1-5 and CO1-5) for faster development. After 125 generations, the resulting accelerated populations (ACB1-5 and ACO1-5) displayed net selection responses for development time of -33.4 hours (or 15%) for ACB and -38.6 hours (or 17%) for ACO. Since most of the change in egg-to-adult developmental time was accounted for by changes in larval duration, the 'accelerated' larvae were estimated to develop 25-30% faster than their control/ancestor populations. The responses of ACB and ACO lines were remarkably parallel, despite being founded from populations evolved independently for more than 300 generations. On average, these 'A' populations developed from egg to adult in less than eight days and produced fertile eggs less than 24 hours after emerging. Accelerated populations showed no change in larval feeding rate, but a reduction in pupation height, the latter being a trait relating to larval energetic expenditure in wandering prior to pupation. This experiment demonstrates the existence of a negative evolutionary correlation between preadult developmental time and viability, as accelerated populations experienced a severe cost in preadult survivorship. In the final assay generation, viability of accelerated treatments had declined by more than 10%, on average. A diallel cross demonstrated that the loss of viability in the ACO lines was not due in inbreeding depression. These results suggest the existence of a rapid development syndrome, in which the fitness benefits of fast development are balanced by fitness costs resulting from reduced preadult survivorship, marginal larval storage of metabolites, and reduced adult size.",123,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,122,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb01477.x,Development | Developmental time | Drosophila | Life-history evolution | Selection | Trade-offs | Viability,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Eurosta solidaginis induces galls on two species of goldenrod, Solidago altissima and S. gigantea. The host-associated populations have been hypothesized to be host races that originated in sympatry (Craig et al. 1993). We found evidence for disruptive selection for host use, which is a critical assumption of sympatric speciation models. Each host race had higher survival rates on their host plant than on the alternative host. F1 and backcross hybrids also had lower survival rates than the pure host-race flies on their host plant. Since assortative mating occurs due to host-plant preference (Craig et al. 1993) this would select for divergence in host preference. Low hybrid survival could have been due to strong genetic incompatibilities of the populations or due to host adaptation by each population. Strong genetic incompatibilities would result in poor survival on all host plants, while host adaptation could result in low overall survival with high hybrid survival on some host plants with particularly 'benign' environments. High survival of F1, F2, and backcross hybrids on some plant genotypes in some years supported the host adaptation hypothesis. F1 flies mated and oviposited normally and produced viable F2 and backcross hybrids indicating gene flow is possible between the host races. A few flies developed and emerged on the alternative host plant. This demonstrates that genes necessary to utilize the alternative host exist in both host races. This could have facilitated the origin of one of the populations via a host shift from the ancestral host. The inheritance of survival ability appears to be an autosomal trait.

A VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) genetic 'finger printing' marker was used to infer relatedness among mapped plants in two populations. Band sharing within and between populations estimated F1(ST), an approximate measure of F(ST). Regression models were used to analyze the relationship between band sharing and spatial separation in tidal elevation and horizontal distance, as well as the relationship of fecundity differences with band sharing and spatial distance. Populations differed in band size frequency distributions and mean number of bands per profile and, therefore, likely differed in effective population size. F'(ST) was estimated at 0.0678 and was significantly greater than F'(ST) among randomly constructed subpopulations. Band sharing decreased 0.13% per meter in one population but showed no significant relation to distance in the other. In the population with significant IBD band sharing increased with increasingly different tidal elevation, contrary to an adaptive hypothesis, possibly due to directional gene flow or drift. Deme sizes were approximately 25 meters and greater than 100 meters, spanning larger areas than the entire environmental gradient. Fecundity differences were not associated with spatial parameters or band sharing. Unequal potential maternal fecundity measured as variance in number of seeds per maternal family was a significant source of genetic sampling variance. The VNTR marker employed is capable of detecting adaptation as identity by descent in ecological time and is an appropriate method for estimating the net evolutionary fate of polygenic traits.

Direct and indirect genetic effects of social interactions,Moore A.J.,Evolution,00143820,51,5,1352-1362,1997-01-01,October 1997,"Interacting phenotypes are traits whose expression is affected by interactions with conspecifics. Commonly-studied interacting phenotypes include aggression, courtship, and communication. More extreme examples of interacting phenotypes-traits that exist exclusively as a product of interactions-include social dominance, intraspecific competitive ability, and mating systems. We adopt a quantitative genetic approach to assess genetic influences on interacting phenotypes. We partition genetic and environmental effects so that traits in conspecifics that influence the expression of interacting phenotypes are a component of the environment. When the trait having the effect is heritable, the environmental influence arising from the interaction has a genetic basis and can be incorporated as an indirect genetic effect. However, because it has a genetic basis, this environmental component can evolve. Therefore, to consider the evolution of interacting phenotypes we simultaneously consider changes in the direct genetic contributions to a trait (as a standard quantitative genetic approach would evaluate) as well as changes in the environmental (indirect genetic) contribution to the phenotype. We then explore the ramifications of this model of inheritance on the evolution of interacting phenotypes. The relative rate of evolution in interacting phenotypes can be quite different from that predicted by a standard quantitative genetic analysis. Phenotypic evolution is greatly enhanced or inhibited depending on the nature of the direct and indirect genetic effects. Further, unlike most models of phenotypic evolution, a lack of variation in direct genetic effects does not preclude evolution if there is genetic variance in the indirect genetic contributions.

Interspecific variation is treated as variation in the position of adaptive optima.

Tests of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium revealed significant deficiencies of heterozygotes in all samples, indicating some form of reproductive isolation. Mitochondrial DNAs of each species were not equally represented in F1 hybrids; however, this bias was eliminated when the two largest samples were excluded from the analysis. Backcross hybrids exhibited biased mtDNA introgression, as samples from Lake Erie (eastern) and Lake Michigan (western) drainages showed significant excesses of mtDNAs from L. chrysocephalus and L. cornutus, respectively, relative to frequencies of diagnostic allozyme markers. The extent and direction of allozyme and mtDNA introgression was quantified by calculating isolation index values from morphologically 'pure' individuals of each species from each locality. Analysis of variance of these measures identified limited introgression of allozyme variants with no geographic pattern, but significant differences in direction of mtDNA introgression between drainages (i.e., postglacial dispersal route). Association between patterns of mtDNA introgression and dispersal route across the latitudinal width of the contact zone is best explained by genetic divergence during past isolation of ancestral populations from these drainages.

In this study, we present a methodology for testing such a hypothesis using ancestral character state reconstruction and simulation. Furthermore, we suggest how to investigate the robustness of the hypothesis test by varying the reconstruction methods or simulation parameters. As a case study, we tested a hypothesis of character displacement in body size of Caribbean Artelis lizards. We compared squared-change, weighted squared-change, and linear parsimony reconstruction methods, gradual Brownian motion and speciational models of evolution, and several resolution methods for linear parsimony. We used ancestor reconstruction methods to infer the amount of body size evolution, and tested whether evolutionary change in body size was greater on branches of the phylogenetic tree in which a transition from occupying a single-species island to a two-species island occurred. Simulations were used to generate null distributions of reconstructed body size change. The hypothesis of character displacement was tested using Wilcoxon Rank-Sums. When tested against simulated null distributions, all of the reconstruction methods resulted in more significant P-values than when standard statistical tables were used. These results confirm that P-values for tests using ancestor reconstruction methods should be assessed via simulation rather than from standard statistical tables.

His simulations demonstrated that different combinations of pleiotropic effects could lead to the same genetic correlation value, yet, as long as the population size and correlation value were large enough, result in significantly different variance of correlated responses after 10 generations of selection. We extended those results using Alan Roberston's 'reparameterization' of selection processes in finite populations. As for direct selection response, a satisfactory description of the correlated response and its variability can be expressed in terms of Nih, t/N, and NL, where N is the effective population size, i is the selection intensity in standard units, h2 is the heritability of the selected and correlated traits, t is the number of generations, and L is the length of the chromosome in map units. For a given number of loci, there exits an Nih threshold under which differences between pleiotropic systems will not be detected. For values of Nih above this threshold, the higher Nih is the smaller t/N needs to be for significant differences in correlated responses between pleiotropic systems to be observed. A large number of loci or tight linkage increases the unpredictability of the correlated response, but if Nih is large enough, it does not absolutely prevent significant differences between pleiotropic systems to occur. On the other hand, a small initial allele frequency of the favorable allele would tend to cancel the differences between pleiotropic systems, even for large values of Nih and t/N. Finally, epistasis decreases the overall variability of the correlated response, but generally preserves the difference between pleiotropic systems.

Hence, each clone expresses only a fraction of the total niche-use variation observed in the sexual population, which may lead to selection for ecological specialization and coexistence of clones. A generalized form of the FNV model suggests that the same is true for life-history (as well as other) traits that have important fitness consequences, but do not relate directly to niche use. We refer to the general form of the model as the Frozen Phenotypic Variation (FPV) model. A mixed population of sexual and parthenogenetic snails (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) in a New Zealand lake allowed us to examine the phenotypic variation expressed by coexisting clones in two benthic habitats, and to compare that variation to the sexual population. Three clones were found primarily in an aquatic macrophyte zone composed of Isoetes kirkii (1.5-3.0 m deep), and three additional clones were found in a deeper macrophyte zone composed of Elodea canadensis (4.0-6.0 m deep). These clones showed significant variation between habitats, which mirrored that observed in the sexual population. Specifically, clones and sexuals from the deeper habitat matured at a larger size and had larger broods. There was also significant among-clone variation within habitats; and as expected under the FPV model, the within-clone coefficients of variation for size at maturity were low in both habitats when compared to the sexual population. In addition, we found four clones that were common in both macrophyte zones. The reaction norms of these clones were flat across habitats, suggesting little phenotypic plasticity for morphology or life-history traits. Flat reaction norms, high among-clone variation, and low coefficients of variation (relative to the sexual population) are in accordance with the FPV model for the origin of clonal lineages. We also measured the prevalence of infection by trematode larvae to determine whether clones are inherently more or less infectable, or whether they are freezing phenotypic variation for resistance from the sexual population. We did this in the deep habitats of the lake where recycling of the parasite by the vertebrate host is unlikely, thereby reducing the complications raised by frequency-dependent responses of parasites to host genotypes. We found no indication that clones are either more or less infectable than the resident sexual population. Taken together, our results suggest that phenotypic variation for both life-history traits and resistance to parasites is frozen by clones from the local sexual population.",68,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,139,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb03959.x,Between-habitat variation | Brood size | Clonal animals | Coexistence of clones | Frozen Niche-Variation model | Norms of reaction | Obesity index | Phenotypic variation | Potamopyrgus antipodarum,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Mechanisms maintaining genetic variability within populations,Elena S.F.,Evolution,00143820,51,4,1058-1067,1997-01-01,August 1997,"Six replicate populations of the bacterium Escherichia coli were propagated for more than 10,000 generations in a defined environment. We sought to quantify the variation among clones within these populations with respect to their relative fitness, and to evaluate the roles of three distinct population genetic processes in maintaining this variation. On average, a pair of clones from the same population differed from one another in their relative fitness by approximately 4%. This within-population variation was small compared with the average fitness gain relative to the common ancestor, but it was statistically significant. According to one hypothesis. The variation in fitness is transient and reflects the ongoing substitution of beneficial alleles. We used Fisher's fundamental theorem to compare the observed rate of each population's change in mean fitness with the extent of variation for fitness within that population, but we failed to discern any correspondence between these quantities. A second hypothesis supposes that the variation in fitness is maintained by recurrent deleterious mutations that give rise to a mutation-selection balance. To test this hypothesis, we made use of the fact that two of the six replicate populations had evolved mutator phenotypes, which gave them a genomic mutation rate approximately 100-fold higher than that of the other populations. There was a marginally significant correlation between a population's mutation rate and the extent of its within-population variance for fitness, but this correlation was driven by only one population (whereas two of the populations had elevated mutation rates). Under a third hypothesis, this variation is maintained by frequency-dependent selection, whereby genotypes have an advantage when they are rare relative to when they are common. In all six populations, clones were more fit, on average, when they were rare than when they were common, although the magnitude of the advantage when rare was usually small (~1% in five populations and ~45% in the other). These three hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, but frequency-dependent selection appears to be the primary force maintaining the fitness variation within these experimental populations.",59,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,140,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb03953.x,Experimental evolution | Fisher's fundamental theorem | Frequency-dependent selection | Mutation-selection balance | Relative fitness | Within-population variation,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

This holds for the hemiclonal hybridogenetic frog Rana esculenta: it is widespread in Europe and commonly is found in disturbed habitats such as gravel pits. We hypothesize that its widespread occurrence may either be the result of natural selection for a single hemiclone acting as a broadly adapted 'general-purpose' genotype, or of interclonal selection, which maintains multiple hemiclones that each are relatively narrowly adapted and perform differently across environments, that is, the Frozen Niche Variation model. We tested these competing hypotheses using 1000-L outdoor artificial ponds to rear tadpoles of the parental species (Rana lessonae [LL] and Rana ridibunda [RR]) alone, and each of three hemiclones of Rana esculenta (GUT1, GUT2, GUT3) alone, and in mixed hemiclonal populations from hatching to metamorphosis. Tadpoles of three coexisting hemiclones from a single natural population (near Gutighausen, Switzerland) were reared in both two- and three-way mixtures in equal total numbers at high and low density. For each species and hemiclone, the proportion of tadpoles metamorphosing decreased as the density of tadpoles increased, with the three hemiclones spanning the range of values exhibited by the two parental species. LL and GUT1 tadpoles produced the highest proportion of metamorphs, whereas tadpoles of RR produced the fewest metamorphs at both densities. GUT1 tadpoles also produced the largest metamorphs at low density, GUT2 and GUT3 tadpoles produced smaller metamorphs than did GUT1 tadpoles at the low density, but the three hemiclones did not differ from each other at high density. The parental species (LL and RR) were intermediate in metamorphic size to the hemiclones at low density, but all genotypes converged on a similar size at high density. Length of the larval period also was affected by density, but its effect was dependent on genotype. GUT1 tadpoles had the shortest larval period at the low density, but larval period was longer and not different between GUT1, GUT3, and LL at high density. RR tadpoles had the longest larval period at both densities. The most dramatic results were that three genotypes (GUT1, GUT2, and RR) maintained rank order and increased days to metamorphosis from low to high density, whereas two genotypes (GUT3 and LL) changed rank order and decreased days to metamorphosis from low to high density. Mixtures of hemiclones in two- and three-way combinations facilitated the proportion of tadpoles metamorphosing for GUT1 and GUT2 at both densities, but only at the low density for GUT3 tadpoles. Results from this experiment are incompatible with the General-Purpose Genotype model as a global explanation of hybrid abundance in these frogs. Alternatively, the Frozen Niche Variation prediction of general performance superiority of mixtures relative to single clone populations is strongly supported. The data confirm that fitness advantages of hemiclones change, depending on the environment, such that in temporally and spatially heterogeneous habitats like ponds, frequency-dependent selection among hemiclones may promote co-existence in hemiclonal assemblages. Yet, differential dispersal or colonization ability and historical factors affecting hemiclone distribution may also be important in shaping patterns of clonal coexistence.",85,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,141,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb03972.x,Amphibian | Clonal | Competition | Frozen Niche Variation model | General-purpose genotype | Growth | Hybridogenesis | Metamorphosis | Rana esculenta,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Two Aedes aegypti populations, refractory and susceptible to Plasmodium gallinaceum, were previously selected from the Moyo-In-Dry strain (MOYO) through inbreeding (F = 0.5). Reproductive success and survivorship of the two populations were compared, and the influence of the parasite on mosquito fitness also was evaluated. Fitness components studied include fecundity, adult survivorship and egg-to-adult developmental time, blood-meal size, and adult body size. The refractory population has a significantly shorter egg-to-adult developmental time and a smaller body size, takes a smaller blood meal, and subsequently lays fewer eggs than the susceptible population. The mean longevity of the refractory population is significantly shorter than the susceptible population. Exposure to the parasite exhibited little effect on the survivorship and fecundity of either population. Several factors may contribute to the lower fitness of the refractory population, including founder effect, inbreeding depression, the effect of other uncharacterized genes linked to genes conferring refractoriness, and pleiotropic effects associated with these genes.

Gehyra oceanica, based on protein variation, consists of two natural groups in the Pacific, a northern (Micronesian) form and a southern (Melanesian and Polynesian) form. The northern form has very similar gene frequencies across its range in Micronesia. The southern form has its greatest allelic diversity in the southcentral Pacific. F-statistics for G. oceanica in the south fall within the range of values in the literature for mainland Australian species of Gehyra that are not human commensals and for other island lizards that have been considered as natural dispersers.

The rate of natural inbreeding and the influences of behavioral mechanisms that serve to promote or minimize inbreeding (e.g., philopatry vs. dispersal) are poorly understood. We studied inbreeding and social structuring of a population of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) to assess the influence of dispersal and mating behavior on patterns of genetic variation. We examined 15 years of data on prairie dogs, including survival and reproduction, social behavior, pedigrees, and allozyme alleles. Pedigrees revealed mean inbreeding coefficients (F) of 1-2%. A breeding-group model that incorporated details of prairie dog behavior and demography was used to estimate values of fixation indices (F-statistics). Model predictions were consistent with the minimization of inbreeding within breeding groups ('coteries.' asymptotic F(IL) = -0.18) and random mating within the subpopulation ('colony,' asymptotic F(1S) = 0.00). Estimates from pedigrees (mean F(1L) = -0.23, mean F(IS) = 0.00) and allozyme data (mean F(IL) = -0.21, mean F(1S) = -0.01) were consistent with predictions of the model. The breeding-group model, pedigrees, and allozyme data showed remarkably congruent results, and indicated strong genetic structuring within the colony (F(IS) = 0.16, 0.19, and 0.17, respectively). We concluded that although inbreeding occurred in the colony, the rate of inbreeding was strongly minimized at the level of breeding groups, but not at the subpopulation level. The behavioral mechanisms most important to the minimization of inbreeding appeared to be patterns of male-biased dispersal of both subadults and adults, associated with strong philopatry of females.

The little genetic data available to date has supported this view in that little or no significant regional differentiation of populations has been found over large geographical distances. However, recent data from giant clams has demonstrated not only significant regional differentiation of populations, but routes of gene flow that run perpendicular to the main present-day ocean currents. Extensive surveys of genetic variation at eight polymorphic loci in 19 populations of the giant clam Tridacna maxima, sampled throughout the West and Central Pacific, confirmed that the patterns of variation seen so far in T. gigas were not unique to that species, and may reflect a fundamental genetic structuring of shallow-water marine taxa. Populations of T. maxima within highly connected reef systems like the Great Barrier Reef were panmictic (average F(ST) < 0.003), but highly significant genetic differences between reef groups on different archipelagos (average F(ST) = 0.084) and between West and Central Pacific regions (average F(ST) = 0.156) were found. Inferred gene flow was high (N(c)m usually > 5) between the Philippines and the Great Barrier Reef, between the Philippines and Melanesia (the Solomon Islands and Fiji), and between the Philippines and the Central Pacific island groups (Marshall Islands, Kiribati, Tuvalu and Cook Islands). Gene flow was low between these three sets of island chains (N(c)m < 2). These routes of gene flow are perpendicular to present-day ocean currents. It is suggested that the spatial patterns of gene frequencies reflect past episodes of dispersal at times of lower sea levels which have not been erased by subsequent dispersal by present-day circulation. The patterns are consistent with extensive dispersal of marine species in the Pacific, and with traditional views of dispersal from the Indo-Malay region. However, they demonstrate that dispersal along present-day ocean surface currents cannot be assumed, that other mechanisms may operate today or that major dispersal events are intermittent (perhaps separated by several thousands of years), and that the nature and timing of dispersal of Pacific marine species is more complex than has been thought.",141,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,147,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb03660.x,Gene flow | Giant clams | Indo-Pacific biogeography | Marine species evolution | Population genetics | Tridacna maxima,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Alternatively, it is possible that these faunal assemblages predate the glaciations or that recent dispersals may have been more important than vicariance in determining faunal compositions. We examined the relationships among mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes within five clades of highland fishes, each with a distribution suggestive of a Pleistocene vicariance event. Darters of the subgenera Litocara and Odontopholis have distributions and mtDNA relationships that are consistent with the Pleistocene integration and burial of the Teays-Mahomet valley, a major drainage of the early Pleistocene.

It can increase genetic diversity, create novel gene combinations, and transfer adaptations from one population to another. This study addresses the roles of frequency-dependent selection and mating system in gene exchange between two subspecies of Gilia capitata (Polemoniaceae). Long-distance migrants are likely to be rare in new habitats, and the importance of immigrant frequency to fitness, gene exchange, and ultimately introgression, has not been explored. To test for the importance of frequency in migration, a field experiment was conducted in which artificial populations (arrays) composed of different mixtures of the two subspecies were placed in the home habitats of both. Female function (seed production) and a portion of male function (hybridization rate) were compared for the two subspecies to assess the potential for gene exchange and introgression between them. Individual fitness (through both hybridization and seed production) for the inland subspecies varied with its frequency as an immigrant at the coastal site. Rare immigrants produced fewer seeds and fathered fewer hybrid offspring. In contrast, both forms of reproductive function were frequency independent for the coastal subspecies when it was an immigrant at the inland site. Seed production was high and insensitive to frequency, and immigrants from the coast never successfully fertilized the inland subspecies' seeds. To control for the effects of frequency-dependent pollinator behavior in the field, hand crosses were performed in the greenhouse using a range of pollen mixtures. The greenhouse experiment demonstrated that cross-fertilization is possible in only one direction, that cross-pollination in the other direction is only partially successful, and that pollen from the coastal subspecies has a strong negative effect on seed production by the inland subspecies. Experimental pollen supplementation in the field verified both the unilateral incompatibility and the negative effect of coastal pollen on inland plant seed production observed in the greenhouse. Contrasts between field array and greenhouse results suggest that pollinator behavior and other ecological factors act to exaggerate reproductive barriers between the two subspecies.

Therefore the hypothesis that pollinator behavior results in a preference for rare color morphs of deceptive species was tested experimentally, Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) foraged in the laboratory on arrays of artificial flowers with different corolla color morphs. Morphs were varied in frequency, and bumblebee preferences were recorded on arrays where morphs did and did not contain sucrose solution rewards. Bumblebees preferred the must common color morph when flowers contained sucrose solution rewards, but overvisited rare morphs when sampling flowers that contained no rewards. Bumblebees also tended to move between unlike color morphs when these were unrewarding, suggesting that a probabilistic sampling strategy was adopted. Thus experiments demonstrated that pollinator behavior could result in a selective advantage for rare color morphs of plant species that are pollinated by deception without mimicry, which would induce negative frequency-dependent selection on corolla color.

However, since morphological distinction can be derived postglacially as well as in extended isolation, such evidence is ambiguous. To examine this question, we did a phylogenetic analysis of cytochrome b sequences (719 bp) of black bear (Ursus americanus), one of the distinctive endemics of Haida Gwaii, and compared these with conspecifics from across North America, focusing primarily on the northwestern coast. We found that the Haida Gwaii bear are indistinguishable from coastal bear of British Columbia and Vancouver Island, but are highly distinct from continental bear.

Allozyme markers were used to determine the siring success of large versus small plants in 14 arrays of plants, each array containing five large and five small plants. The inflorescence size of small plants was held constant both within and among arrays; the size of large plants was held constant within an array but was varied among arrays. Large plants sired more than half the seeds in 12 of the 14 arrays, and significantly more than half in six of these 12. However, in eight of the arrays, large plants sired significantly fewer seeds than expected on the basis of their size advantage. Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between relative size and relative siring success in comparisons among arrays. A maximum-likelihood model estimated that 28% of seeds were sired by imported pollen, with 95% confidence limits of 13% and 50%. Within these limits, high import rates tended to mask the relative success of large plants in several arrays.

Three cases were investigated: (1) without any limits to plasticity; (2) without genetic variation for plasticity; and (3) with a fitness cost for phenotypically plastic reactions.

Here I test for congruence between a phylogenetic reconstruction and a widely accepted scenario based on independent lines of evidence. I used Livezey's (1991) phylogeny to reconstruct ancestral states of plumage dichromatism in dabbling ducks (Anatini). Character state mapping reconstructs monochromatic ancestors for the genus Anas as well as most of its main clades. This reconstruction differs strongly from the widely accepted scenario of speciation and plumage evolution in the group (e.g., Delacour and Mayr 1945; Sibley 1957). This incongruence may occur because two standard assumptions of character state reconstruction are probably not met in this case. Violating either of these two assumptions would be a source of error sufficient to create misleading reconstructions. The first assumption that probably does not apply to ducks is that terminal taxa, in this case species, are monophyletic. Many of the widespread dichromatic species of ducks may be paraphyletic and ancestral to isolated monochromatic species. Three lines of evidence support this scenario: population-level phylogenies, biogeography, and vestigial plumage patterns. The second assumption that probably does not apply to duck plumage color is that gains and losses of character states are equally likely. Four lines of evidence suggest that dichromatic plumage might be lost more easily than gained: weak female preferences for bright male plumage, biases toward the loss of sexually dichromatic characters, biases toward the loss of complex characters, and repeated loss of dichromatism in other groups of birds. These seven lines of evidence support the accepted scenario that widespread dichromatic species repeatedly budded off isolated monochromatic species. Drift and genetic biases probably caused the easy loss of dichromatism in ducks and other birds during peripatric speciation. In order to recover the accepted scenario using Livezey's tree, losses of dichromatism must be five times more likely than gains. The results of this study caution against the uncritical use of unordered parsimony as the sole criterion for inferring ancestral states. Detailed population-level sampling is needed and altered transformation weighing may be warranted in ducks and in many other groups and character types with similar attributes.",172,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,160,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb01486.x,Anas | Ancestral state reconstruction | Character evolution | Character mapping | Paraphyletic species | Phylogeny | Sexual dichromatism,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Because juvenile traits are typically subject to maternal effects and often have low heritabilities, adaptive responses to natural selection on these traits may seem unlikely. To determine the potential for evolutionary response to selection on juvenile traits of Nemophila menziesii (Hydrophyllaceae), we conducted two quantitative genetic studies. A reciprocal factorial cross, involving 16 parents and 1960 progeny, demonstrated a significant maternal component of variance in seed mass and additive genetic component of variance in germination time. This experiment also suggested that interaction between parents, though small, provides highly significant contributions to the variance of both traits. Such a parental interaction could arise by diverse mechanisms, including dependence of nuclear gene expression on cytoplasmic genotype, but the design of this experiment could not distinguish this from other possible causes, such as effects on progeny phenotype of interaction between the environmental conditions of both parents. The second experiment, spanning three generations with over 11,000 observations, was designed for investigation of the additive genetic variance in maternal effect, assessment of paternal effects, as well as further partitioning of the parental interaction identified in the reciprocal factorial experiment. It yielded no consistent evidence of paternal effects on seed mass, nor of parental interactions. Our inference of such interaction effects from the first experiment was evidently an artifact of failing to account for the substantial variance among fruits within crosses. The maternal effect was found to have a large additive genetic component, accounting for at least 20% of the variation in individual seed mass. This result suggests that there is appreciable potential for response to selection on seed mass through evolution of the maternal effect.

We sampled these allozymes in a 28-population transect north of Genoa in Italy, through the hybrid zone where these taxa meet. We used the numerical techniques developed for hybrid zone analysis to study the patterns of genetic differentiation and their underlying evolutionary causes. The hybrid zone is characterized by a very short and steep central region, flanked by broad tails of introgression extended up to 100 km in either direction. From mean two-locus disequilibium of D = 0.148 (maximum-likelihood two-unit support limits 0.139-0.153), and after accounting for minor differences in the center locations of the single-locus clines, which act to bias the dispersal estimate, we estimated a dispersal rate of σ = 4.4 (3.7-5.5) km/gen(1/2). The effective selection needed to maintain the steep central portion is strong, 0.47 ≤ s* ≤ 0.64, when combined over potential intrinsic (genetic background) and extrinsic (ecological) sources of selection. The clines in allozyme loci showed variation that was significantly different between the most divergent shapes, and the differences are attributable to different degrees of introgression on the edusa side of the zone. The average selection acting on individual allozyme loci was high at s(e) ≃ 1.5%, but because of the narrowness of the central region of the cline, we suspect that this estimate is somewhat biased by selection on loci closely linked to the allozyme markers. A common question for taxa that show fixed allozyme differences in parapatry is whether or not they are genetically isolated. A fairly general measure of genetic isolation across hybrid zones is the time, T, that it takes a neutral allele to cross the hybrid zone and recombine into the opposite genetic background, given by T = (β/σ)2, where β is the barrier strength of the hybrid zone. Genetic isolation in the Pontia zone is weak, with T ≃ 25 generations for most allozyme markers.

Using the sea urchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma which has 400 μm eggs and nonfeeding larvae, we removed an acellular, lipid-rich component from the blastula equivalent to ca. 40% of the egg volume and ca. 50% of the organic mass. Experimentally manipulated, reduced-lipid larvae survived well, developed in the usual time (3.5 d), and high percentages of the original numbers metamorphosed into anatomically normal juveniles.

Sex allocation theory predicts that combined sexes are favored in sedentary and sessile organisms because localized gamete dispersal and local mate competition (LMC) among gametes promote decelerating fitness 'gain curves' that relate male investment to reproductive success. Under this LMC model, males fertilize all locally available eggs at low sperm output, additional output leads to proportionally fewer fertilizations, and combined sexes with female-biased sex allocation are favored. Decelerating male gain curves have been found in hermaphroditic flowering plants, but the present paper reports the first analysis in an animal. The colonial hermaphroditic bryozoan Celleporella hyalina forms unisexual male and female zooids that can be counted to estimate absolute and relative gender allocations. I placed 'sperm donor' colonies-each with different numbers of male zooids, and each homozygous for diagnostic allozyme alleles-among target maternal colonies on field mating arrays, and estimated donor fertilization success by scoring allozyme markers in target-colony progeny. Fertilization success increased with numbers of donor male zooids, but linear and not decelerating curves fit the data best. Mean sex allocation was not female biased, consistent with nondecelerating male gain. Sperm donors, moreover, did not monopolize matings as expected under high LMC, but rather shared paternity with rival colonies. Hence localized water-borne gamete dispersal alone may not yield decelerating male gain and favor the maintenance of hermaphroditism; relaxed sperm competition in low density populations might also be required. In free-spawning marine organisms, males cannot control access to fertilizations, intense sperm competition may be commonplace, and high male sex allocation may be selected to enhance siring success under competition.",28,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,167,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb02394.x,Bryozoan | fertilization success | hermaphroditism | male reproductive success | sex allocation | sperm competition,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

In this study, I used an insect-plant system to test the hypothesis that heterogeneous environments maintain more genetic variation in fitness components in a novel environment than do uniform environments. To manipulate recent ecological history, replicate populations of the dipteran leafminer Liriomyza trifolii were maintained for 20 generations in one of three treatments: a heterogeneous environment that contained five species of host plant, and two uniform environments that contained either a susceptible chrysanthemum or tomato. The hypothesis that greater genetic variance for survivorship and developmental time on a new host plant (a leafminer-resistant chrysanthemum) would be maintained in the heterogeneous treatment relative to the uniform environments was then tested with a sib-analysis and a natural selection experiment. Populations from the heterogeneous host plant treatment had no greater genetic variance in either larval survivorship or developmental time on the new host than did populations from either of the other treatments. Moreover, the rate of adaptation to the new host did not differ between the ecological history treatments, although the populations from the uniform chrysanthemum treatment had higher mean survivorship throughout the selection experiment.

Among this group of populations, it appears that resistance to urea is correlated with longevity, but not development time. Ten populations kept at extreme larval densities for many generations also show responses to urea: those kept at high larval densities appear to be most resistant to urea. However, these populations show no differences in adult longevity. An additional five populations were selected directly for urea resistance by adding this compound to the larval food environment. Again, there was a strong response to this artificial selection, with urea resistance increasing dramatically, but these populations showed no response in adult longevity or resistance to crowding when compared to five control populations. There is clearly no simple relationship between longevity and larval urea resistance.

A delayed period of population growth reduces the size of the newly founded populations for one or several generations. Whether this increases differentiation among local populations depends on the actual pattern of migration. With a constant migration rate, fewer migrants move into small populations than into large, thus providing ample opportunity for drift to act within a population. A prolonged period of population growth thus makes the conditions for enhanced differentiation between local populations less restrictive and also inflates the actual levels of differentiation. The effect depends on the relative magnitudes of k(c), the effective number of colonizers and k, the actual number of colonizers. When there is a constant number of migrants into a population per generation, migration into small populations is increased. This increase of migration in small populations counteracts the effects of genetic drift due to small population size.

All of the species studied to date produce planktonic sexual propagules capable of dispersing long distances; despite local genotypic disequilibria, populations are often panmictic over large geographic areas. The population structure paradigm these species represent may not be typical of the majority of clonal invertebrate groups, however, which are believed to produce highly philopatric sexual propagules. I used allozyme variation to examine the population structure of the temperate soft coral, Alcyonium rudyi, a typical clonal species whose sexually produced larvae and asexually produced ramets both have very low dispersal capabilities. Like other clonal plants and invertebrates, the local population dynamics of A. rudyi are dominated by asexual reproduction, and recruitment of new sexually produced genets occurs infrequently. As expected from its philopatric larval stage, estimates of genetic differentiation among populations of A. rudyi were highly significant at all spatial scales examined (mean θ = 0.300 among 20 populations spanning a 1100-km range), suggesting that genetic exchange seldom occurs among populations separated by as little as a few hundred meters. Mapping of multilocus allozyme genotypes within a dense aggregation of A. rudyi ramets confirmed that dispersal of asexual propagules is also very limited: members of the same genet usually remain within < 50 cm of one another on the same rock surface. Unlike most previously studied clonal invertebrates, populations of A. rudyi do not appear to be dominated by a few widespread genets: estimates of genotypic diversity (G(o)) within 20 geographically distinct populations did not differ from expectations for outcrossing, sexual populations. Despite theoretical suggestions that philopatric dispersal combined with typically small effective population sizes should promote inbreeding in clonal species, inbreeding does not appear to contribute significantly to the population structure of A. rudyi. Genet genotype frequencies conformed to Hardy-Weinberg expectations in all populations, and inbreeding coefficients (f) were close to zero. In general, the population structure of A. rudyi did not differ significantly from that observed among outcrossing sexual species with philopatric larval dispersal. Age estimates suggest, however, that genets of A. rudyi live for many decades.

Phenotypic acclimation and its evolution in Escherichia coli,Bennett A.F.,Evolution,00143820,51,1,36-44,1997-01-01,February 1997,"Acclimation refers to reversible, nongenetic changes in phenotype that are induced by specific environmental conditions. Acclimation is generally assumed to improve function in the environment that induces it (the beneficial acclimation hypothesis). In this study, we experimentally tested this assumption by measuring relative fitness of the bacterium Escherichia coli acclimated to different thermal environments. The beneficial acclimation hypothesis predicts that bacteria acclimated to the temperature of competition should have greater fitness than do bacteria acclimated to any other temperature. The benefit predicted by the hypothesis was found in only seven of 12 comparisons; in the other comparisons. either no statistically demonstrable benefit was observed or a detrimental effect of acclimation was demonstrated. For example, in a lineage evolutionarily adapted to 37°C, bacteria acclimated to 37°C have a higher fitness at 32°C than do bacteria acclimated to 32°C, a result exactly contrary to prediction; acclimation to 27°C or 40°C prior to competition at those temperatures confers no benefit over 37°C acclimated forms. Consequently, the beneficial acclimation hypothesis must be rejected as a general prediction of the inevitable result of phenotypic adjustments associated with new environments. However, the hypothesis is supported in many instances when the acclimation and competition temperatures coincide with the historical temperature at which the bacterial populations have evolved. For example, when the evolutionary temperature of the population was 37°C, bacteria acclimated to 37°C had superior fitness at 37°C to those acclimated to 32°C; similarly, bacteria evolutionarily adapted to 32°C had a higher fitness during competition at 32°C than they did when acclimated to 37°C. The more surprising results are that when the bacteria are acclimated to their historical evolutionary temperature, they are frequently competitively superior even at other temperatures. For example, bacteria that have evolved at either 20°C or 32°C and are acclimated to their respective evolutionary temperatures have a greater fitness at 37°C than when they are acclimated to 37°C. Thus, acclimation to evolutionary temperature may, as a correlated consequence, enhance performance not only in the evolutionary environment, but also in a variety of other thermal environments.",69,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,173,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb02386.x,Acclimation | adaptation | bacteria | beneficial acclimation hypothesis | Escherichia coli | fitness | phenotypic plasticity | temperature,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

As a result, peripheral populations experience persistent directional selection. Second, response to local selection pressures can cause rapid and substantial evolution when a peripheral population is isolated from gene flow. The amount of evolutionary change depends on gene flow, selection, the ecological gradient, and the trait's heritability.

Through a Fisherian runaway process, female preferences and male traits can become associated in linkage disequilibrium, leading to patterns of assortative mating. Dispersing males, whose rate of movement is dependent on mating success, carry female preference genes with them, and displaced males thereby produce daughters with preference genes for their respective traits in locally higher than average frequencies. The reduced diffusion of the more preferred males permits the success of other male types in adjacent areas. Thus, mating-success dependent diffusion, when coupled with the rapid divergence in phenotypes possible under the Fisher process, can lead to the coexistence of two female preferences and two male traits in sympatry.

Our primary goal was to determine whether purging of deleterious recessive alleles occurs uniformly between populations and among families, and thus gain insights into the mode of gene action (dominance, overdominance, and/or epistasis) governing the expression of inbreeding depression at both the population and family levels across the life cycle. Inbreeding depression was detected across the five-generation breeding program in both populations for germination success, total flower production and adult aboveground biomass. No inbreeding depression was detected for date of first flowering. The serial breeding program minimized selection and may have allowed the random fixation of deleterious recessive alleles. Thus, at the population level this experiment is consistent with (1) dominance with weak selection on partially deleterious recessive alleles; (2) random fixation of deleterious alleles; and (3) overdominance because we observed a steady state of performance following inbreeding and outcrossing in these two populations of M. guttatus. At the family level, however, significantly different maternal line responses (maternal line x pollination treatment and maternal line x pollination treatment x generation) provide a mechanism for the invasion of a selfing variant into the population through any maternal line exhibiting purging of its genetic load. These family level differences in inbreeding depression across the five generations suggest that dominance rather than overdominance underlies the expression of inbreeding depression.

One way to identify the potential role played by natural selection is to compare patterns of spatial genetic structure between different life cycle stages and among microenvironments. We examined patterns of spatial structure in a population of the snow buttercup (Ranunculus adoneus), using both adult plants and newly emerged seedlings. The study population spans a steep environmental gradient caused by gradual melting of snow within a permanent snowbed. Early-melting sites are characterized by denser vegetation, more fertile soils, and a longer growing season than late-melting sites tens of meters away. The flowering time of R. adoneus is controlled entirely by time of snowmelt, so the contiguous population is phenologically substructured into a series of successively flowering cohorts, reducing the opportunity for direct pollen transfer between early- and late-melting sites. For four highly polymorphic enzyme loci in this tetraploid species, there was subtle, but statistically significant, genetic differentiation between early, middle, and late-melting cohorts; adults usually showed greater differentiation among snowmelt zones than did seedlings. At two loci in adults and one locus in seedlings, homozygotes were more common than predicted at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, even when assuming maximum levels of double reduction during meiosis. This pattern suggests the occurrence of self-fertilization and/or population substructure. To determine how spatial isolation and phenological separation each contribute to genetic substructure, we used bivariate regression models to predict the numbers of allele differences between randomly paired individuals as a function of meters separation in space and days separation in flowering time. For newly emerged seedlings, we found that spatial separation was positively associated with genetic difference, but that the additional contribution of phenological separation to genetic difference was not significant. This implies that seeds and/or pollen move effectively across the snowmelt gradient, despite differences in flowering time. As was true for seedlings, spatial separation between paired adults contributed to greater genetic difference, but for a given spatial separation, the genetic difference between adult plants was reduced by phenological separation.

The traits measured were development time, egg-to-adult viability, egg hatch, productivity, fecundity, and the number of functional overioles. Individuals of the first strain were bi-infected by two Wolbachia variants, wHa and wNo. The second strain was infected by ωHa, the third one by wNo. The Wolbachia studied here cause cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), a high embryonic mortality (70% to > 90%) when an infected male is crossed with an uninfected female. Three generations after antibiotic treatment, we observed in all strains a significant drop in productivity in the cured stocks. This drop was not due to antibiotic toxicity and was associated with the loss of the Wolbachia. However the effect had disappeared in two of the three strains five generations after treatment, and could not be found in the third strain in a third measurement carried out 14 generations after treatment. The temporary nature of the productivity difference indicates that Wolbachia do not enhance productivity in infected strains. On the other hand, in all traits measured, our results show the absence of any negative effects of the Wolbachia on their host. This could be explained when considering Wolbachia evolution, as maternally transmitted parasites bear a strong selective pressure not to harm their female host. However, CI would allow the bacteria to be maintained even when harming the female. The apparent absence of deleterious effects caused by these Wolbachia might result from a trade-off, where a relatively low bacteria density would advantage the Wolbachia by suppressing any deleterious effects on the female host, at the cost of a weaker maternal transmission rate of the infection.",68,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,180,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1997.tb02399.x,Cytoplasmic incompatibility | Drosophila simulans | endosymbiosis | fitness | Wolbachia,NA,NA,NA,NA

A field trial containing randomized single tree plots of self, outcross, and naturally open-pollinated (OP) progenies of 13 parents from two natural populations was surveyed over 15 yr. Inbreeding depression in survival at 15 years was 67% for selfs, one of the highest levels reported for a tree species, and differed little between populations. OP progenies were intermediate and the difference in fitness among the three cross types indicated that at planting, 59% were derived from outcrossing. However, with selection against the inbred progenies, this increased to 83% by 15 yr of age. Most selection against selfs occurred after four years, coincident with canopy closure and the apparent onset of intense competition. Almost twice the amount of phenotypic variability occurred among self-progenies than occurred among outcrosses with OPs again intermediate. Phenotypic variation was much greater within OP families than among families. Mortality removed the smaller trees, reducing inbreeding depression and variation both among and within OP families. In contrast, inbreeding depression and variation within OP families increased during stand development. These processes redistributed variation from among to within OP families, resulting in little overall change in phenotypic variance. Under intense competition in naturally regenerating forests, selfs are unlikely to survive to reproductive maturity. Although there was no additive variation among parents in the survival of their outcross progenies, the survival of both OP and self-progenies differed markedly among parents. However, variation in parental fitness under natural open-pollination was unrelated to estimates of fitness under outcrossing or selling. Because parents each contributed the same number of offspring in this experiment, variation in OP fitness may instead reflect differences in outcrossing rate among families.

Each local P. substriatus population has a relatively short expected persistence time, but persistence of the species occurs due to a balance between frequent local extinctions and recolonizations. This nonequilibrium population structure can have profound effects on how the genetic variation is structured between and within populations. Theoretical models have stated that the genetic differentiation among local populations will be enhanced relative to an island model at equilibrium if the number of colonizers is less than approximately twice the number of migrants among local populations. To study these effects, a set of 50 local P. substriatus populations were surveyed over a four-year period to record any naturally occurring extinctions and recolonizations. The per population colonization and extinction rate were 0.237 and 0.275, respectively. Mark-recapture techniques were used to estimate a number of demographic parameters: local population size (N = 11.1), migration rate (m = 0.366), number of colonizers (k = 4.0), and the probability of common origin of colonizers (φ = 0.5). The theoretically predicted level of differentiation among local populations (measured as Wright's F(ST) was 0.070. Genetic data obtained from an electrophoretic survey of seven polymorphic loci gave an estimated degree of differentiation of 0.077.

In a robustness analysis of this topology, we found general support for this tree over alternative topologies representing minimum evolution hypotheses that imply large body size is retained from large iguanine ancestors. The most parsimonious reconstruction of body size evolution implies a change from large to small size after the Sauromalus ancestor diverged from Iguana, and one reversal back to large size within Sauromalus. The large size increase in the gigantic clade contrasts with evolutionary stasis of small body size (for an iguanine) in mainland populations.

In most species, maximal values of frequency bandwidth were found to decrease with increasing trill rates. Further, trills with low trill rates exhibited wide variance in frequency bandwidth, and trills with high trill rates exhibited only narrow frequency bandwidths.

Young raised under poor feeding conditions attained smaller body size (tarsus length) than their full-sibs raised under good feeding conditions. Parent-offspring regressions revealed lower heritability (h2) of body size under poor than under good feeding conditions. Hence, as the same set of parents were used in the estimation of h2 in both environments, this suggests environment-dependent change in additive genetic component of variance (V(A)), or that the genetic correlation between parental and poor offspring environment was less than that between parental and good offspring environment. However, full-sib analyses failed to find evidence for genotype-environment interactions, although the power of these tests might have been low. Full-sib heritabilities in both environments tended to be higher than estimates from parent-offspring regressions, indicating that prehatching or early posthatching common environment/maternal effects might have inflated full-sib estimates of V(A). The effect of sibling competition on estimates of V(A) was probably small as the nestling size-hierarchy at day 2 posthatch was not generally correlated with size-hierarchy at fledging. Furthermore, there was no correlation between maternal body condition during the incubation and final size of offspring, indicating that direct maternal effects related to nutritional status were small. A review of earlier quantitative genetic studies of body size variation in birds revealed that in eight of nine cases, heritability of body size was lower in poor than in good environmental conditions. The main implication of this relationship will be a decreased evolutionary response to selection under poor environmental conditions.

Assessed under near-optimal conditions, the genetic divergence of fitness (r(e)) between ancestral and derived populations, but not between two derived populations or between two ancestral populations, has involved both allelic (dominance) and genic (epistatic) interactions. The role of dominance and epistasis in the divergence of r(e) among populations affects its component traits in a pattern that is unique to each cross. Patterns of genetic differentiation among populations of W. smithii provide evidence for a topographically complex 'adaptive landscape' as envisioned by Wright in his 'shifting balance' theory of evolution. Although we cannot definitively rule out the role of deterministic evolution in the divergence of populations on this landscape, ecological inference and genetic data are more consistent with a stochastic than a deterministic process. At high, limiting larval density, hybrid vigor is enhanced and the influence of epistasis disappears.

In this study, through the use of three highly polymorphic microsatellite markers, we analyze the relationships between length of tail ornaments of male barn swallows and proportion of nestlings fathered in own broods, number of offspring fathered in broods of other pairs, and total number of offspring fathered, using both a correlational and an experimental approach. Consistent with our predictions, we show that males with either naturally long or experimentally elongated tails have higher paternity (proportion of biological offspring in own broods), and they produce more biological offspring during the whole breeding season than males with naturally short or experimentally shortened tails. Males with naturally long tails also had more offspring in extrapair broods than short-tailed males, but the effect of tail manipulation on the number of offspring fathered in extrapair broods, although being in the predicted direction, was not statistically significant. Cuckolded males that did not fertilize extrapair females had smaller postmanipulation tail length than cuckolders.

It has been suggested that this genetically based behavior may involve an energetic cost, which precludes natural selection in a density-regulated population to simultaneously maximize food acquisition and food conversion into biomass. If true, this stands against some basic predictions of the general theory of density dependent natural selection. Here we investigate the evolutionary consequences of density-dependent natural selection on growth rate and body size in D. melanogaster. The CU populations showed a higher growth rate during the posteritical period of larval life than UU populations, but the sustained differences in weight did not translate into the adult stage. The simplest explanation for these findings (that natural selection in a crowded larval environment favors a faster food acquisition for the individual to attain the same final body size in a shorter period of time) was tested and rejected by looking at the larva-to-adult development times. Larvae of CU populations starved for different periods of time develop into comparatively smaller adults, suggesting that food seeking behavior in a food depleted environment carries a higher cost to these larvae than to their UU counterparts.

However, recent studies suggest that microhabitat-specific variation may contribute to the total differentiation. To appreciate the relative contributions of geographic variation and habitat-specific variation, we sampled 42 subpopulations of the intertidal snail Littorina saxatilis from three different micro-habitats (boulders, low and high rocky intertidal) on five small islands within a distance of 15 km. We used a modified orthogonal version of Nei's gene diversity analysis with a modified analysis of variance (ANOVA) that estimated the significance of habitat and geographic separation and the interaction between them. Between subpopulation differentiation (G(ST)) was usually in the range of 5% to 10% but was exceptionally high in one locus (Aat; 53%).

This is analogous to the idea that antagonistic coevolution between hosts and their parasites maintains sexual reproduction in host populations. Strongyloides ratti is a parasitic nematode of rats. It can have a direct life cycle, with clonal larvae of the wholly parthenogenetic parasites becoming infective, or an indirect life cycle, with clonal larvae developing into free-living dioecious adults. These free-living adults produce infective larvae by conventional meiosis and syngamy. The occurrence of the sexual cycle is determined by both environmental and genetic factors. By experimentally manipulating host immune status using hypothymic mutants, corticosteroids, whole-body γ-irradiation and previous exposure to S. ratti, we show that larvae from hosts that have acquired immune protection are more likely to develop into sexual adults.

Where these traits are selected by pollinators for enhanced elaboration, they should evolve toward the equilibrium between selection for further elaboration and selection against this through reduced fecundity or vitality. Here we show that pollinator-borne fungal diseases of plants may be a factor influencing the position of this equilibrium. Populations of the rock pink, Dianthus silvester often contain individuals infected with the anther smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum (= Ustilago violacea). In a naturally infected population in the Alps of eastern Switzerland we investigated how intrapopulation variation in flower size and nectar rewards influenced spore deposition and how floral traits varied with disease status. We found that spore deposition increased with increasing petal size, suggesting that large-flowered plants were at a greater risk of disease. Spore deposition was also higher for plants growing in patches with many or a high proportion of diseased neighbors. Multiple regression analyses showed that petal size or nectar reward influenced spore deposition when the effects of neighborhood disease abundance were controlled statistically. In sequential analyses, after removing the effects of disease density or frequency and plant gender, petal length explained significant variation in spore deposition. Diseased plants had reduced female reproductive organs, but calyx size was intermediate between that of healthy perfect and female flowers of this gynodioecious-gynomonoecious species, and diseased plants bore flowers with the largest petals. This may reflect a symptom of this disease or the cause, if larger-flowered plants are more likely to become infected.

On the other hand, genetic variance in traits related to fitness could fie retained through polygenic mutation, spatially varying selection, genotype-environment interaction, or antagonistic pleiotropy.

Here I estimated additive genetic variance in life-history characters of a monocarpic herb, Ipomopsis aggregata, that lives for up to a decade. Experimental crosses yielded 229 full-sibships nested within 32 paternal half-sibships. More than 5000 offspring were planted as seeds into natural field sites and were followed in most cases through their entire life cycle. Survival showed substantial additive genetic variance (genetic coefficient of variation ≃ 54%). Small differences at seedling emergence were magnified over time, such that the genetic variability in survival was only detectable by tracking the success of offspring for several years starting from seed. In contrast to survival, reproductive traits such as flower number, seeds per flower, and age at flowering showed little or no genetic variability. Despite relatively high levels of additive genetic variation for some life-history characters, high environmental variance in survival resulted in very low heritabilities (0-9%) for all of these characters. Maternal effects were evident in seed mass and remained strong throughout the lengthy vegetative period. No negative genetic correlations between major components of female fitness were detected.

If inbreeding depression is caused by deleterious recessive alleles, families with characters that promote self-pollination should show lower levels of inbreeding depression than families with characters that promote outcrossing. The converse is expected if inbreeding depression is due to overdominant allelic interactions. Whether these associations between mating-system and viability loci evolve will have important consequences for mating-system evolution. The evolution of selling within the genus Mimulus is associated with a reduction in stigma-anther separation (i.e., a loss of herkogamy) and high autogamous seed set. In this study we compared families from two M. guttatus populations that differed genetically in their degree of stigma-anther separation. In one of these populations we also compared families that differed genetically in the degree to which they autogamously set seed in a pollinator-free greenhouse. Dams often differed significantly in levels of inbreeding depression for aboveground biomass and flower production, but variation in inbreeding depression was never explained by herkogamy class or autogamy class. Several factors might account for why families with traits associated with selfing did not show lower inbreeding depression, and these are discussed.

After three generations, the low N(e) treatment had significantly lower germination and survival rates than did the high N(e) treatment. These lower germination and survival rates led to decreased mean fitness in the low N(e) populations: estimated mean fitness in the low N(e) populations was only 21% of the estimated mean fitness in the high N(e) populations. This inbreeding depression led to a reduction in population survival: at the conclusion of the experiment, 75% of the high N(E) populations were still extant, whereas only 31% of the low N(e) populations had survived.

Depending on the causes of phenotypic variation, one speaks either of genetic or environmental canalization. Genetic canalization describes insensitivity of a character to mutations, and the insensitivity to environmental factors is called environmental canalization. Genetic canalization is of interest because it influences the availability of heritable phenotypic variation to natural selection, and is thus potentially important in determining the pattern of phenotypic evolution. In this paper a number of population genetic models are considered of a quantitative character under stabilizing selection. The main purpose of this study is to define the population genetic conditions and constraints for the evolution of canalization. Environmental canalization is modeled as genotype specific environmental variance. It is shown that stabilizing selection favors genes that decrease environmental variance of quantitative characters. However, the theoretical limit of zero environmental variance has never been observed. Of the many ways to explain this fact, two are addressed by our model. It is shown that a 'canalization limit' is reached if canalizing effects of mutations are correlated with direct effects on the same character. This canalization limit is predicted to be independent of the strength of stabilizing selection, which is inconsistent with recent experimental data (Sterns et al. 1995). The second model assumes that the canalizing genes have deleterious pleiotropic effects. If these deleterious effects are of the same magnitude as all the other mutations affecting fitness very strong stabilizing selection is required to allow the evolution of environmental canalization. Genetic canalization is modeled as an influence on the average effect of mutations at a locus of other genes. It is found that the selection for genetic canalization critically depends on the amount of genetic variation present in the population. The more genetic variation, the stronger the selection for canalizing effects. All factors that increase genetic variation favor the evolution of genetic canalization (large population size, high mutation rate, large number of genes). If genetic variation is maintained by mutation-selection balance, strong stabilizing selection can inhibit the evolution of genetic canalization. Strong stabilizing selection eliminates genetic variation to a level where selection for canalization does not work anymore. It is predicted that the most important characters (in terms of fitness) are not necessarily the most canalized ones, if they are under very strong stabilizing selection (k > 0.2V(e)). The rate of decrease of mutational variance V(m) is found to be less than 10% of the initial V(m). From this result it is concluded that characters with typical mutational variances of about 10-3 V(e) are in a metastable state where further evolution of genetic canalization is too slow to be of importance at a microevolutionary time scale.

Inflation behavior is found in all members of the puffer sister taxa Tetraodontidae and Diodontidae. However, most other tetraodontiform fishes exhibit two functionally similar behaviors. All taxa exhibit a 'coughing' behavior and, with the exception of the sister-group to all other tetraodontiforms, represented by the Triacanthidae, all lineages 'blow' strong jets of water out of their mouth to excavate prey. Functional specializations associated with the three behaviors were identified from anatomical analyses and electromyographic recordings of muscle activity in representatives of the major lineages of the order. The phylogenetic distribution of the three buccal compression behaviors and their functional bases indicates the following: (1) the evolution of inflation behavior involved major structural modifications of the head that function in a novel mechanism that links depression of the floor of the mouth to posterior expansion of the buccal cavity; (2) the contraction patterns of four key head muscles used in the three behaviors are generally similar both across behaviors and taxa: (3) however, the distribution of the two significant modifications of muscle activity are consistent with the hypothesis that the three behaviors represent a transformation series from coughing to water blowing to inflation. The motor pattern for water blowing is a slightly modified version of that seen in coughing, and the inflation motor pattern retains the blowing specialization and adds a single additional modification. The convergent evolution of a poorly developed inflation behavior in at least one genus of filefish provides evidence that tetraodontiform fishes are predisposed to the evolution of this unusual defensive behavior.
