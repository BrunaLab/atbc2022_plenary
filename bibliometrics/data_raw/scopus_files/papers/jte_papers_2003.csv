The passage of Hurricane Georges over the island of Puerto Rico provided a unique opportunity to study the post-hurricane recovery of Heliconia caribaea, a large understorey herb. Five weeks after Georges, the types of vegetative damage, mortality and recovery were recorded and their relationship with plant size was established. The relationship between recovery strategy and leaf or stem damage severity was also determined. The abundance of H. caribaea seedlings in sites with severe or little forest canopy damage was recorded to determine the effects of canopy cover on seedling establishment. Most individuals showed severe leaf and stem damage. This was not related to plant size. Mortality was low and caused by fallen trees. Recovery was not associated with severity of leaf damage but more individuals with no signs of regeneration appeared among plants that had severe stem damage. Seedling abundance was higher in areas with severe canopy damage relative to those with closed canopy suggesting that hurricanes may benefit H. caribaea by creating suitable habitats for seedling establishment.

Given scarce resources and the scale of the challenge there is a need to maximize the efficiency of both sampling strategies and sampling units, yet there is little information on the relative efficiency of different approaches to floristic assessment in tropical forests. This paper is the first attempt to address this gap. We repeatedly sampled forests in two regions of Amazonia using the two most widely used plotbased protocols of floristic sampling, and compared their performance in terms of the quantity of floristic knowledge and ecological insight gained scaled to the field effort required. Specifically, the methods are assessed first in terms of the number of person-days required to complete each sample ('effort'), secondly by the total gain in the quantity of floristic information that each unit of effort provides ('crude inventory efficiency'), and thirdly in terms of the floristic information gained as a proportion of the target species pool ('proportional inventory efficiency'). Finally, we compare the methods in terms of their efficiency in identifying different ecological patterns within the data ('ecological efficiency') while controlling for effort. There are large and consistent differences in the performance of the two methods.

At both scales, frogs reduced aerial invertebrates and leaf herbivory, but had no effect on litter invertebrates. At the smaller scale, frogs increased foliage production rates, measured as the number of new leaves and new leaf area produced, by 80% and decomposition rates by 20%. The influence of E. coqui on increasing primary productivity and decomposition rates at the smaller scale appeared to be a result of elimination and excretion rather than of controlling prey.

Balionycteris maculata roosted in cavities and formed small harem groups that consisted of one adult male accompanied by up to nine adult females and their dependent young. Both male and female bats foraged locally, within approximately 1 km of their roost sites. However, in contrast to females, which remained away from the roost site throughout the night, both harem and solitary adult males divided their nightly activity between foraging and returning to their roost sites. Individual females were also found roosting sequentially with up to three different males. Hence, these results suggest that B. maculata has a resource-defence polygynous mating system, in which the roost cavity may represent a critical and defendable resource by which males recruit and gain improved reproductive access to females. Roost cavities occupied by B. maculata were found within a number of different forest structures, including ant nests, termite nests and the root masses of epiphytes. The consistent shape and position of the cavities, along with a single observation of cavity enlargement, provide the first evidence of roost-cavity excavation, by a megachiropteran bat, within the nests of social insects.

Of 393 adults (diameter at breast height (dbh) > 30 cm) in a 52-ha area, 143 (36.4%) individuals fruited. A second-order spatial analysis, based on Ripley's K-function, revealed that fruiting trees were significantly (P < 0.05) aggregated with respect to the total population over distances of 15-115 m. Thus, the spatial distribution of fruiting trees was more aggregated than expected from the adult tree distribution, which itself was aggregated within the study plot. Logistic regression analysis showed that fruiting trees had a significantly greater dbh and were surrounded by more conspecific adults per ha than non-fruiting individuals. Moreover, fruiting trees were found at higher elevations, on steeper slopes, and on sandy rather than clayey soils. In contrast, annual diameter growth, adult density over areas < 1 ha, and slope convexity did not significantly affect fruiting probability. The ratio of seedling (20 cm ≤ h < 60 cm) and sapling (60 cm ≤ h < 300 cm) density to adult density was higher in sites at higher elevations, on steeper slopes, and on sandy soils than that for lower elevations, flat slopes and clayey soils. This suggests that the aggregation of fruiting trees occurred not only at the time of the study, but that it had occurred repeatedly in the past, at the high-elevation, steep-sloped, sandy sites.

Extreme climatic events such as this one are expected to influence tree population structure and community dynamics through differential effects on growth and mortality. The demographics of seedlings of seven shade-tolerant tree species, including two dipterocarps, during this severe drought were contrasted with baseline demographic data from two earlier census intervals, one of which included a slight drought, and one of which included no drought. Hemispherical photographs were used to document an opening of the canopy that resulted from the dieback and mortality of large trees during the severe 1998 drought. Seedlings that experienced an increase in canopy openness were less likely to die than other seedlings. Rates of mortality and height loss were significantly increased in association with drought. The overall mortality rates during the severe drought and slight drought census intervals were 8.2% y-1 and 7.3% y-1 respectively, compared with 4.9% y-1 for the non-drought census interval.

Termite diversity surveys were carried out at three mainland forest sites, and 10 islands of varying size, in an area of lowland tropical forest that had been flooded 4 y earlier, during the creation of the Petit Saut hydroelectric project in French Guiana. The 'ghost forest' of dead emergent trees in the flooded zone was also studied for its influence on island termite assemblages. Results suggested that the effects of forest fragmentation upon the total assemblage, and upon soil-feeders in particular, were subordinate to the influence of forest understorey palm density, and the closely associated gradients of soil humus depth and soil pH. Moreover, gradients for these three variables were uncorrelated with forest fragmentation and probably reflected spatial environmental heterogeneity pre-dating inundation events. Nevertheless, factors associated with forest fragmentation appeared to have had a significant effect on changes in termite species composition across the study site, primarily in structuring the wood- and leaf-litter-feeder assemblage. Effects upon the latter were not apparently a result of influx of species from the ghost forest. Purely spatial variation also influenced β-diversity changes in species composition across the site. In conclusion, the effects of forest fragmentation upon termites appear to have been relatively mild compared with other faunal groups, 4 y after flooding. Nevertheless, we predict that the effects of fragmentation on termite assemblages will ultimately be negative. This study also points to the importance of Amazonian understorey palms in structuring a tropical forest termite assemblage.",84,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Diversity | French Guiana | Palms | Similarity | Spatial autocorrelation | Tropical forest fragmentation,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,18,NA,NA

The study's objective was to assess how variation in nutrient availability affects leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and herbivory. Our study included an area of young forest (10 y old), with phosphorus-poor soils, and an area of old forest (∼60 y old), in which soil P was comparatively less limiting. The foliage of representative species of each site was studied, including Acacia gaumeri, Leucaena leucocephala and Lysiloma latisiliquum at the young forest site, and A. gaumeri, Bursera simaruba and Pithecellobium dulce at the old forest. Four independent plots (12 x 12 m) at each forest were either left intact (controls) or fertilized with N, with P, or with N plus P for three consecutive years. Relaxation of nutrient limitations at the young forest resulted in an increase in leaf phosphorus and herbivory in all species. In contrast, N and P fertilization at the old forest site did not consistently affect leaf nutrient concentration and leaf damage. In this site the main response to fertilization was an increase in leaf nitrogen only in B. simaruba and an increase in herbivory in A. gaumeri; leaf phosphorus was unaffected by soil fertilization. Overall, we observed that, subsequent to nutrient addition, leaf phosphorus concentration and herbivory in the leguminous species increased at the young site; leaf nitrogen concentration in the non-leguminous species increased at the old site while herbivory only increased in A. gaumeri, following a pattern similar to that observed in the young site. We conclude that the regulatory mechanisms of leaf quality and damage by herbivores will vary, depending on the details of the site's nutrient limitations and the identity of species.",58,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Leaf nutrients | Limestone | Nitrogen | Phosphorus | Soil nutrient limitation,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,19,NA,NA

Non-dispersed seeds suffered high mortality (84%) and low germination (3%). Elephants were reliable at visiting fruiting trees (46%), ingesting available seeds (55%) and dispersing the fruit crop (26%). Compared with unpassed seeds, seeds passed through an elephant's gut had improved germination (54.9% vs. 2.9%) and reduced time to germination (82 vs. 132 d). Given predation rates under parent trees, elephant gut passage is expected to improve absolute germination by 66%. When this change in germination is divided by germination of unpassed seeds, elephant gut passage is expect to improve relative germination by as much as 4000%. Although post-dispersal predation occurred in dung containing B. wilsoniana seeds, dispersed seedlings were abundant. Compared with seedlings under parent trees, dispersed seedlings had greater survival and height. Dispersed seedlings survived in a diversity of environments, thrived under high-light conditions, and were negligibly affected by postdispersal density. Although elephants are not essential for B. wilsoniana germination, their actions greatly increase seedling establishment and move a large proportion of seeds.

Fertilization effects on biomass accumulation, relative growth rate and tissue nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were examined for seedlings grown under relatively high light. Higher light conditions in gaps are expected as human disturbance expands in tropical landscapes. Two questions were asked: (1) Does nutrient addition enhance growth or result in nutrient accumulation in the tissues of tropical tree seedlings grown in pots under high light? (2) Are these responses conditional on their adaptations to light availability, seed mass or growth form? Most of the species (73% of light-demanding and 60% of shade-tolerant) demonstrated a positive growth response to fertilization. The magnitude of the response of light-demanding species was more than twice that of shade-tolerant species. A higher proportion of shade-tolerant species accumulated nutrients in their tissues (up to 95% for P), but over half the light-demanding species did so as well. For both types of species, a higher percentage accumulated P than N. Responses in growth and in P accumulation were negatively correlated with seed mass. Shrubs responded more than trees in biomass accumulation, but there was a trend toward greater response by trees in relative growth rate and N and P accumulation. The results suggest that variation in nutrient availability could affect the structure of tropical forests regenerating from large-scale disturbance. In fertile sites, competitive exclusion may occur within the light-demanding species, resulting in a decline in local tree diversity. Depending on the effects of human disturbance on nutrient availability, loss of tree diversity at a local scale may compound diversity loss due to habitat destruction at the landscape scale.",76,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Growth | Human disturbance | Light-demanding | Nitrogen | Phosphorus | Seed size | Shade-tolerant,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,37,NA,NA

Leaf litter depth was also recorded at the base of all trees in the unburnt forest. Using logistic regression models, tree mortality was best explained by the burn height, although dbh and the presence of buttresses were also important. Buttressed trees were associated with deeper leaf litter accumulation at their bases and higher char heights than trees without buttresses. Moreover, trees surviving the fire had signifcantly thicker bark than living trees in unburnt forest plots, indicating that thin-barked trees are more prone to selective mortality induced by heat stress. Latex did not appear to have had any significant effects on mortality, though resins were less abundant amongst the live trees in the burnt forest than in the unburnt controls.

Gastropod community structure was correlated with redox potential of water at depth, topographical height, surface water pH and leaf litter. Crab community structure and species number were positively correlated with tree and seedling community structure and diversity, suggesting that the mangrove vegetation is important to the crab fauna as a habitat and food supply. Molluscan abundance was positively correlated with sapling diversity and negatively correlated with the numbers of mangrove associates and tree species.

Understorey plots were compared with 0.8% shadehouses, and single-treefall gaps were compared with 10% shadehouses.

Specific leaf area (SLA) values in the shadehouses provided a good approximation of SLA in the forest for species in both light treatments. In contrast, biomass allocation and leaf area ratios were only comparable for forest and shadehouse seedlings grown in the high-light treatment. Furthermore, seedlings grown in shadehouses differed significantly from forest-grown seedlings in terms of their root morphology.

To examine the relationship between distribution and growth in tropical rain forest, seasonal and annual changes in tree diameter of two tree species with contrasting distribution patterns, Celtis mildbraedii and Strombosia glaucescens, were monitored across topographic gradients in moist semi-deciduous and moist evergreen forest in Ghana over 2 years, 1997-9. Concurrent measurements were made of soil water availability, and during 1997/8, of rainfall, nutrient availability and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The two sites received similar, low, total rainfall during 1997/8, but soil water availability in the dry season at the evergreen site exceeded that at the semi-deciduous forest site. Soil water availability was higher during 1998/9 at both sites. During 1997/8, PAR was similar at the two sites. The evergreen site had soils of lower pH, available P, Mg, Ca and K concentrations than the semi-deciduous forest site. Water availability and the sand content of the soil increased and concentrations of total N and C decreased, from summit to valley positions at both sites. Celtis mildbraedii had significantly faster growth rates than S. glaucescens, and growth of both species was greater at the semi-deciduous than the evergreen forest site during the wet year (1998/9) but not during the dry year (1997/8). Celtis mildbraedii in semi-deciduous forest grew less in valley than summit and slope positions. We conclude that in the absence of a severe dry season, growth is higher in semi-deciduous than evergreen forest, and is related to the higher soil fertility in more seasonal forest. The patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that concentrations of available P and/or cations in the soil limit growth in evergreen forest, while concentrations of N in valley soils limit growth of C. mildbraedii in semi-deciduous forest. There was no evidence that variation in PAR influenced growth rates in these forests.

Similarly, the January soil samples had higher C mineralization than October soil samples (55 and 34 μg C g-1 d-1, respectively). These results suggest that the quality of C is strongly affected by the seasonality of rains, which in turn influences microbial activity.

In 1997-98, there was a severe El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) drought, and annual surveys over a 4-y period showed that abundance of R. makuta was greatly reduced during the drought, but that populations quickly recovered after it. Monthly surveys over a 12-mo period of typical rainfall showed that high rainfall in the month preceding surveys significantly reduced butterfly abundance. Butterfly abundance and distribution did not differ between selectively logged and unlogged areas in either monthly or annual surveys and there was no difference between selectively logged and unlogged areas in the pattern of post-drought recovery. These results indicate that the abundance of R. makuta was significantly reduced both after high rainfall and during severe drought, but that these impacts were short-lived and were not affected by habitat disturbance. ENSO droughts on Borneo naturally often lead to widespread forest fires and thus impacts of ENSO events for butterflies are more likely to be due to indirect effects of habitat loss, rather than direct effects of drought on butterfly population dynamics.",30,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Climate change | Drought | ENSO | Habitat disturbance | Lepidoptera | Ragadia makuta | Satyrinae,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,73,all,All Open Access

The 14C dating turned out to be an effective method for estimating ages of long-lived trees, such as E. zwageri, in the aseasonal tropics because the estimated error was small compared with estimated age. We found that E. zwageri can live more than 1000 y and that the growth rate of this species was very slow, with a mean radial growth rate of 0.058 cm y-1. The life span was much greater and the growth rate was much slower than those observed or estimated for trees of Dipterocarpaceae, the dominant family in this tropical forest.
