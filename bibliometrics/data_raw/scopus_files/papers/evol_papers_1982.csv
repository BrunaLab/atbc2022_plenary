Larvae transform at the water surface into the winged adult just before sunrise during each day of this period. Adults mate, oviposit, and die in less than 1 hr. Adults are preyed on by both aerial (birds, bats, dragonflies) and aquatic (whirligig beetles) predators. The number of D. americana adults that emerge each day can vary by several orders of magnitude. The percentage of adults that succumb to predators, aerial and/or aquatic, on a given day is inversely related to the total number of adults available as prey each day. This inverse relationship supports a predatory satiation hypothesis concerning the adaptive significance of reproductive synchrony in this species. Thus, an individual adult D. americana maximizes its chance for successful reproduction by emerging synchronously with other members of its own cohort. Adult emergence data on other mayfly species show that similar reproductive synchrony is widespread among mayflies. An alternative hypothesis concerning reproductive synchrony is that the adaptive significance lies mainly with increasing the probability of each sex finding a mate during the brief adult stage. This hypothesis is tested by comparing the degree of adult reproductive synchrony of 3 parthenogenetic species with the synchrony of bisexual species. Reproductive synchrony among parthenogenetic mayflies is equal to or greater than synchrony of bisexual species.-from Authors",116,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,2,all,All Open Access

Non-dormant acorns that are buried undamaged produce a seedling taproot engorged with food reserves; because of this, if a squirrel subsequently removes the acorn in winter, the seedling is still capable of growth the following spring. Squirrels do not kill the growing point of acorns of red oaks Q. rubra, which are dormant-seeded, before caching them. The squirrels' behavior is interpreted as a countertactic evolved to deal with autumn-germinating acorns. Autumn germination may be a tactic evolved as an 'escape' from post-dispersal predation by squirrels.

There was no corresponding increase in shell thickness despite the fact that thickness and the incidence of repair are correlated positively.

Genetic variance in both traits is assumed to be maintained within local populations by polygenic mutation and recombination. Three types of polygamous mating systems are analyzed. Sexual isolation and character divergence can originate rapidly over a wide geographic range, driven by genetic instability of the mating system in local populations. During this process, clines forming around a sharp ecological boundary are always monotonic. Even in the absence of genetic instability, the evolution of female mating preferences can greatly amplify large-scale geographic variation in male secondary sexual characters and produce widespread sexual isolation with no geographic discontinuity. These conclusions contrast with the popular conception that premating isolation is selected initially only in the contact zone between races to avoid deleterious hybridization, later spreading slowly if at all to other regions.-from Author",241,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,24,NA,NA
