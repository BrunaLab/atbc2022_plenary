Some of the plants represent new host plants for these species. The outbreaks appeared to be based on the flush of new foliage that developed in the Luquillo Mountains after the passage of the hurricane. The end of the S. eridania outbreak was concurrent with the consumption of its preferred host plants and to an apparent increment in parasitism by ichneumonids (Hymenoptera). Parasitism by tachinids (Diptera) may have contributed to the reduction in abundance of other Lepidoptera species that were temporarily very abundant.

A detailed study was carried out in the region of Cuiaba, state of Mato Grosso on a particular campo de murundus (area of 5.065 ha) lying in a sedimentary depression where the earthmounds are true islands during the annual floods, allowing the colonization both by cerrado plants and by termites. The mounds were mapped and measured for their size and shape. Mounds diameters ranged from 0.2 to 22.0m and heights ranged from 0.1 to 1.1m. The 445 smaller mounds (< 0.8m diameter) were found to have a clumped distribution, occupying 0.1% of the area. They are actually small termite nests built by Armitermes euamignathus. The 80 larger mounds (> 0.8m diameter) were uniformly distributed, occupying 6.3% of the area. These mounds are colonized by Cornitermes snyderi and Cornitermes bequaerti which build big termite nests on the summit of the mounds. Soil analyses indicated a close similarity between the campo and the surrounding cerrado whose soils had coarser texture and were poor in nutrients. Soils of the earthmounds and termite nests showed finer texture, lower pH and higher amounts of mineral nutrients. It is suggested here that this particular type of campo de murundus is formed mainly from the localized activity of nest-building by termites, followed by nest degradation, during many generations of termite colonies. © 1992, Cambridge University Press.

Sixty-eight ant species were recorded, of which 26 were exclusively found in the native vegetation and 16 were confined to the rehabilitated plots. Ant species richness built up most rapidly in areas rehabilitated with mixed mata species and least rapidly in areas with Eucalyptus. Younger rehabilitated plots appeared to be developing a campo-type ant community, although evidence indicates that more mata ant species will colonise once tree canopy closure takes place. Rate of ant return in Australia is positively correlated with the quantity and distribution of rainfall - the rates in the current study concur with those from humid sub-tropical climatic zones within Australia, suggesting that similar constraints to the succession may be operating. If found to be the case, this would have practical implications for planning and evaluating the success of rehabilitation. © 1992, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.",NA,NA

Nectar-feeding by both primates was observed between late April and May, during which a peak in the floristic activity of M. fistulifera was recorded, in terms of both the number of trees flowering and the number of flowers available on each tree. Phenological records indicate, by contrast, that edible fruit was relatively scarce during this period, the early dry season at the study site. On the days when nectar was consumed, it accounted for 25% of records of plant feeding for B. arachnoides and 29%) for C. flaviceps, although the former species was observed nectar feeding over a much longer period. The evidence indicates that M. fistulifera is a valuable, but not essential resource for both primates at a time of year when edible fruit is relatively difficult to obtain. M. fistulifera, in turn, can be seen as an opportunistic plant whose floral characteristics permit pollination by a wide range of volant and non-volant vertebrates, including primates. © 1992, Cambridge University Press.

During the first year, some seedlings and juveniles of Aspidosperma fendleri were collected and the number of rootlets, the primary root length and the shoot: root ratio were determined. Both species show periodicity in growth but their relative growth rate differs between species. For Aspidosperma fendleri, the highest relative growth rate (0.313 y-1) was found for individuals grown under greenhouse conditions followed by individuals growing in an old forest gap (0.143y-1) and finally individuals under the forest canopy (0.137 y-1). For Richeria grandis, the relative growth rate under the forest canopy was 0.261 y-1. Leaf production for Aspidosperma fendleri in the forest (natural conditions) was 4.39 total mean leaf number for five years and 5.46 total mean leaf number under greenhouse conditions. For Richeria grandis it was 5.34 mean leaf production for four years. The root: shoot ratio for Aspidosperma fendleri was constant during the observation year. Aspidosperma fendleri showed a lower number of rootlets than did Richeria grandis. There was an inverse relationship between growth and survival during the dry season. During this period, mortality was higher and the highest mortality occurred during the first year when the total relative growth rate was highest. Slow growth is evident in both species. This mechanism may represent an adaptive advantage to remain dormant until there is an opening in the forest canopy. Since the seeds of Aspidosperma fendleri and Richeria grandis are highly vulnerable to predators and pathogens, slow growth as seedlings and juveniles allows them to survive, and contributes to regeneration in cloud forest. © 1992, Cambridge University Press.

This paper describes estimates of canopy openness and associated light availability in the understorey of a north-east Australian rain forest before and immediately after a tropical cyclone. On the basis of 20 hemispherical (fisheye) canopy photographs it was shown that direct, diffuse and total site factors increased significantly as a result of the shght-to-moderate canopy disturbance caused by the cyclone. In the understorey, median total site factors ranged from 2.5-3.4% before the cyclone and from 6.0-8.6% after the cyclone, representing a 2- to 3-fold increase in potential light availability. Following the cyclone, mean relative gap frequencies increased substantially at all altitudes but particularly at canopy positions more than 70° above the horizon. Cyclone-induced canopy disturbance not only reduced the complexity of the understorey light regime but may have also increased the seasonal variability of light within the understorey of the forest during the interval of canopy recovery. The implications of these results for the ecophysiology of understorey tree seedlings and saplings at several temporal scales are discussed. © 1992, Cambridge University Press.

There is partitioning of habitats among the three species in Liberia: Nile crocodiles in mangrove swamps and river mouths (brackish water); slender-snouted crocodiles in rivers through rain forest (freshwater); and dwarf crocodiles in small streams through rain forest (freshwater), some entering the adjacent river. Dwarf crocodiles utilize burrows in the stream banks. Nowhere are crocodiles abundant, and there is an apparent absence of adults. Although 40% of Liberia is forested, deforestation is occurring rapidly by foreign timber companies and slash-and-burn agriculture practised by the largely rural population. Hunting with firearms, although illegal, is widespread, both for subsistence and commercially, without concern for depletion. Mangrove ecosystems near human population centres are being destroyed.

Experimental seedling stations placed out under parent trees and away from parent trees indicated no significant effect of dispersal on seedling survival.

Activity also occurred on moist, relatively cool and cloudy days, particularly in Alloporus uncinatas which was much larger than the other species. The onset and duration of surface activity varied between species. Observations of feeding behaviour suggested that millipedes in semi arid savannas did not subsist exclusively on tree leaf litter but appeared to select a range of food types.

A key component of the life-form classification is the morphology of leaf blades, with five major patterns recognized: elongate and inrolled, elongate and conduplicate, elongate and flat with an attenuate base, short and broad with an amplexicaule base, and short and broad with a pseudopetiole. The distribution and relative abundance of three major photosynthetic categories were compared with life-form and habitat preference. Photosynthetic type of individual species was identified based on leaf anatomy. C4(XyMS —) species predominated in cerradao, cerrado, campo rupestre, valley-side campos, and seasonally inundated savanna, as well as on granite outcrops. C4(XyMS +) species were relatively rare in all habitats, but were significantly more abundant in the xeric micro-environments of granite outcrops. C3 species predominated in semideciduous forest and increased in relative abundance in wetland habitats. Caespitose annuals and bunch grass species were predominantly C4 type, while arboreal and liana species were uniformly C3 type. Grasses classified as decumbent or shrub-like were predominantly C3 type, while rhizomatous, stoloniferous, and forb-like grasses were a mixture of C3 and C4 type. The intent of the study was to group morphological characteristics objectively in order to derive a life-form classification specific for the Gramineae. Comparisons of the relative abundance of the various life-forms in a broad range of habitat types provide a descriptive assessment of the adaptive value of these characteristics. © 1992, Cambridge University Press.

As these areas are normally liable to seasonal water-logging, the earthmounds are true habitat islands capable of bearing woody plants typical of the cerrado, which are normally very intolerant of root inundation. The vegetation of an area of murundus field at Cuiaba, in the State of Mato Grosso, Central Brazil, was surveyed for the purpose of evaluating the island-effect on the plant community growing on the mounds/islands. Two main aspects were considered:the influence of the size of the mound and the differences between the types of cerrado occurring on the mounds and on the areas surrounding the murundus field. Most plant species occurring on the mounds were also present in the flora of the surrounding cerrado. However, only a fraction of these species was able to colonize the mounds successfully. The number of species on the mounds was found to be significantly correlated with mound area. Species-area relationships were better described with the power model S — C(A/) than with the exponential model S — C T z (logA) (fitted with linear regression). The mound size also had a strong influence on the spatial distribution of the species on the surface of the mounds. The species were organized in an increasing number of concentric topographic belts corresponding to a gradient of soil depth above the flooding level. © 1992, Cambridge University Press.

It is sympatric with the abundant Long-tailed Finch Poephila acuticauda which nests frequently in tree hollows. The aim of this study was to define the characteristics of nest sites and breeding areas of Gouldian and Long-tailed Finches to determine whether nest hollows were in short supply, and where finches fed relative to their nest sites. The Gouldian Finch chose hollows with smaller, more northerly entrances than Long-tailed, or randomly chosen hollows, nested deeper down the hollow and on steeper hill-slopes. Both species preferred single to multi-trunked trees of larger diameter than trees with randomly chosen hollows. Discriminant analysis classified 22-25% of the randomly chosen hollows and 28-38% of Long-tailed nesting hollows as Gouldian hollows. Gouldian Finches were more specific in their choice of nest sites than Long-tailed Finches. The vegetation at the two sites differed floristically, but within each site there was no floristic distinction between feeding or breeding sites or sites chosen at random. Gouldian Finches chose feeding habitat where trees were more spaced, on less rocky, barer ground than around breeding sites. On the basis of the criteria measured, there was no shortage of suitable hollows available to the Gouldian Finch for nesting. The overlap between feeding and breeding sites indicates the importance of managing breeding habitat for conservation. © 1992, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.",NA,NA

The antiion Myrmeleon frontalis has only become established on Anak Krakatau within the last five years, despite having been present on the other Krakatau Islands for at least 50 years. The appearance of the antiions on Anak Krakatau seems to have coincided with the construction of a shelter hut in 1986 which provides a suitable under-floor habitat of dry dusty soil for the larvae to construct their pits. From the hut site they have extended into sub-optimal locations around the bases of clumps of wild sugarcane, Saccharum spontaneum,, on the adjacent lower slopes of the outer cone ash fields. The soil around the Saccharum clumps is variable. Fine deposits are suitable for antlion larvae, more gravelly soils are not. The antlion larvae inhabiting the Saccharum clumps are disturbed by rain which destroys their pits. These two habitats, the hut and Saccharum sites, are the only places on the island that are occupied by the antlion larvae. They have quite different micro-climates so that the two populations are out of synchrony with each other. © 1992, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.",NA,NA

An inventory of the woody flora and ecological study of 12 forest areas in the Tana River National Primate Reserve (TRNPR) describe the composition and structure of this riverine forest ecosystem and identify patterns of regional and local diversity. Only 175 species in 49 families are recorded in the woody flora, but the geographic affinities of 98 species are from four major floristic regions in Africa: Zanzibar-Inhambane (31%), Somalia-Masai (16%), Guinea-Congolian (12%), and Zambezian (1%). Ten species are rare and/or disjunct. Forests have a disturbed physiognomy characterized by a low mean height (14.4 m), high species importance attributable to a few trees, low density (409 ha-1) and coverage (23.1 m2ha-1) of trees > 10cm dbh, and an abundance of palms and lianes. Changes along the river in sediment deposition and hydrology explain the high diversity of landforms and corresponding forest types in the TRNPR vicinity, but the absence of trees which are most important near Bura, Acacia elatior, and near Wema, Barringtonia racemosa, suggests that the regional diversity of the ecosystem is inadequately protected. Preservation of key resources, such as the endangered primates, should be coupled with protection of the forest heterogeneity that characterizes this dynamic landscape. © 1992, Cambridge University Press.

A factor analysis was used to compare the floristic similarity of stands situated in semideciduous forest, cerradao, cerrado, campo rupestre, valley-side campo, pantanal complex or on granite outcrops. Individual grass species usually had a preferred habitat and occurred with decreasing abundance in stands judged to be transitional by physiognomic, edaphic, and floristic criteria. Stands situated in cerrado vegetation were most similar to one another in grass species composition. Cerradao was transitional to semideciduous forest and cerrado but certain grasses were characteristic of this vegetation type. The floristic composition of the single campo rupestre locality was somewhat similar to cerrado; however, several of the more abundant grass species of this vegetation type did not occur in any nearby cerrado stand. Granite outcrops had a distinct grass flora and showed little similarity to other vegetation types. In savanna wetland communities, grass species distribution was influenced by water regime. Differences between stands on valley-side campo corresponded to topographic position on a gradient of increasing water surplus. Seasonally humid/dry stands on valley-side campo and pantanal complexes had a high degree of similarity. Stands lower on the catenary sequence of pantanal complexes and valley-side campos were increasingly dissimilar, a result of the different edaphic conditions of the seasonally flooded soils of pantanal complexes when compared with the permamently saturated (but never flooded) soils of valley-side campos. Pantanal complexes had the richest grass flora of all vegetation types because their microtopographic variability creates numerous micro-habitats with distinct water regimes, each supporting different grass species. © 1992, Cambridge University Press.
