We investigated the role of these ferns in supporting invertebrate populations in the primary lowland dipterocarp forest of Danum Valley, Sabah, Malaysia.

Seven hectares of forest were surveyed: the canopy had a mean density of 30 large ferns/ha and 20 intermediate ferns/ha. Six large and five intermediate ferns were removed from the crowns of Parashorea tomentella (Dipterocarpaceae) at heights between 39 and 52 m. The largest ferns had fresh weights of ca 200 kg. The mean animal abundance in large and intermediate ferns was 41,000 and 8000, respectively. Termites and ants represented at least 90 percent of the abundance in these ferns. Of the 11 ferns, 4 contained a nest of Hospitalitermes rufus (Nasutitermitinae), while another contained a nest of an undescribed species of Hospitalitermes. An additional 56 small ferns were removed from the low canopy (2-6 m above the forest floor), of which only 1 contained a termite nest (Nasutitermes neoparvus). These results suggest that Bird's Nest Ferns contain ca 0.5 million termites/ha and contribute almost one ton (dry mass) of suspended soil and plant material/ha. Five of the trees containing large ferns were fogged immediately before the removal of the ferns. From these samples we were able to estimate the total number of animals in each tree crown. When each estimate was added to the abundance in each fern, the results suggested that a single large fern may contain from 7 to 93 percent of the total number of invertebrates in the crown.

The physical setting of these communities varies from very dry to wet climates, and from ridgetops, slopes, to plateaus. Consequently, vegetation communities have variable species composition. The questions addressed were: (1) What are the patterns of species composition among limestone vegetation types based on a parsimony analysis of species assemblages (PASA) and how congruent are they with geography, climate, topography, and vegetation physiognomy? and (2) How do PASA patterns compare to floristic patterns obtained with a classification (UPGMA) and an ordination (NMS)? The main distinction of floristic categories was between communities of humid and dry climates, followed by a finer separation of communities congruent with topography; vegetation physiognomy corresponded with both. PASA, UPGMA, and NMS produced highly coincident floristic groups; however, affinities among groups were different. Advantages of PASA over UPGMA and NMS are that PASA produces groupings strictly based on the shared species and provides different measures of support for floristic groups. The three techniques indicated that the humid and dry limestone areas of Puerto Rico had floristically divergent dry-type vegetation, even when they were structurally and physiognomically convergent. Also, floristic affinities of dry communities in Puerto Rico were stronger with dry communities on other islands than to more humid communities on the same island; thus, humidity regime is stronger than geography in promoting floristic links among limestone vegetation communities of the Caribbean. Almost every conclusion obtained from UPGMA and NMS was also taken from PASA, and so all three techniques are compatible.

Differences among the responses of Eleotris to models depended on whether or not the fish was hidden or exposed on substrates. More retreats in response to models occurred when Eleotris were exposed on substrates than when fish were hidden. There were no significant differences in the response of E. sandwicensis to models when fish were exposed on substrates. In contrast, responses of E. sandwicensis to the models were not random for fish that were hidden, indicating that Eleotris discriminated among the models. The basis for discrimination among models was most likely visual. Although Eleotris are typically secretive, their presence on exposed substrates at this study site may be attributed to the lack of benthivorous fishes and few avian predators.

We used a handheld laser range finder to estimate tree crown height, diameter, and depth in a lowland tropical forest in the eastern Amazon, Brazil, for a sampling of 300 trees stratified by diameter at breast height (DBH). We found significant relationships between DBH and both tree height and crown diameter derived from the laser measurements. We also quantified changes in crown shape between tree height classes, finding a significant but weak positive trend between crown depth and width. We then compared the field-based measurements of crown diameter and area to estimates derived manually from panchromatic 0.8 m spatial resolution IKONOS satellite imagery. Median crown diameter derived from satellite observations was 78 percent greater than that derived from field-based laser measurements. The statistical distribution of crown diameters from IKONOS was biased toward larger trees, probably due to merging of smaller tree crowns, underestimation of understory trees, and overestimation of individual crown dimensions. The median crown area derived from IKONOS was 65 percent higher than the value modeled from field-based measurements. We conclude that manual interpretation of IKONOS satellite data did not accurately estimate distributions of tree crown dimensions in a tall tropical forest of eastern Amazonia.

Comparatively, an effect of forest area on the percentage of seeds lost was observed in 1996 and an effect of treatment on the percentage of seeds eaten was seen in 1995. The mode of seed caching suggested that spiny rats were the main seed remover. Results of this study suggest that greater seedling recruitment may occur when large fruit crop and high howler dispersal co-occur with a lower impact of rodents (i.e., when rodents are saturated by abundant and diversified fruit resources such as in 1995).

In this paper we present results of a yearlong study of a bat-flower community in cloud forests on the western slopes of the Ecuadoran Andes. Of eight plant-visiting bat species caught, only Anoura caudifera and A. geoffroyi were carrying pollen. These species of Anoura supplement their diets with insects.

Because the forest has high soil and foliar Mg concentrations, and Mg is known to be toxic to plant growth at high concentrations, this study tested the hypothesis that dominance by Peltogyne is related to Mg leaf litter amounts and decomposition. We predicted that decomposition of Peltogyne leaves would differ from that of other species, and that their decomposition would result in a pulse of Mg release. Three plots (50 x 50 m) were established in each of three forest types: Peltogyne-rich forest (PRF; dominated by P. gracilipes), Peltogyne-poor forest (PPF), and forest without Peltogyne (FWP). Three leaf litter decomposition experiments tested if decomposition of mixed leaf litter in coarse- mesh (CM) litterbags differed among forests (experiment 1); whether or not decomposition and nutrient release of Ecclinusa guianensis, Lueheopsis duckeana, and Peltogyne in CM litterbags differed among forests and species (experiment 2); and using fine-mesh (FM) litterbags, investigated the differences in the influence of faunal activity on Ecclinusa and Peltogyne decomposition (experiment 3). Decomposition was independent of the presence and dominance of Peltogyne, since decomposition rates in both PRF and FWP were in general lower than in PPF. These differences appeared to be related to faunal activity. The decomposition of Peltogyne leaves was lower than that of the other species tested and was more affected by microbial and physical action. It is possible that the monodominance of Peltogyne is related to its deciduousness and faster decomposition in the dry season, which coincides with a large leaf fall. Magnesium was lost quickly from the Peltogyne leaves and the resultant pulses of Mg into the soil during the heavy rains at the beginning of the wet season may be deleterious for other species that are not adapted to high solution Mg concentrations.

To describe how disturbances affect insect communities, we addressed two questions: Do insect communities return to a pre-hurricane composition? And how do insect communities change during succession? To answer these questions, we studied insect communities in a chronosequence of two abandoned pastures (5 yr and 32 yr) and a mature forest (>80 yr) that were recently disturbed by two hurricanes (Hurricane Hugo, 1989; Hurricane Georges, 1998). Although insect abundance and richness fluctuated during the study, all sites returned to pre-hurricane (Hurricane Georges) abundance and richness in less than one year. All trophic categories present before Hurricane Georges were present after the hurricane, but richness within categories fluctuated greatly. Insect richness did not increase during succession; the 5 yr site had the highest richness, the >80 yr site had an intermediate richness, and the 32 yr site the lowest. Nevertheless, the species composition of the two forested sites was different in comparison to the 5 yr site.

In this study, I assessed the effects of dung presence and dung/seed densities on seed predation by rodents and secondary dispersal by dung beedes. In particular, I compared seed fates in dumped defecation patterns, as those produced by howler monkeys, with seed fates in scattered defecation patterns, as those produced by other frugivores. I also determined the prevalence of red howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus) as seed dispersers at the plant community level in Central Amazonia by determining the number of species they dispersed in a 25-month period.

The same number of seeds was buried by dung beetles, in clumped versus scattered defecation patterns, but more seeds were buried when they were inside large dung-piles versus small piles. Seed density had no effect on rodent or dung beede behavior.

There is convincing evidence that these ""hitchhikers"" can protect the leaf carriers from attack by phorid (Diptera: Phoridae) parasitoids, but we consider the possibility of other functions for the hitchhiking behavior. It has been hypothesized that the hitchhikers (1) feed on leaf sap from the edges of the cut leaves; (2) ride back to the nest to save energy; (3) get caught on the fragments as they are cut, and hitchhike because they cannot (or will not) get off; and (4) begin the process of preparing the leaf to enter the fungal gardens in the nest, perhaps by removing microbial contaminants. We observed hitchhikers of Atta cephalotes in 14 nests at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. There was no difference in the proportion of leaf carriers with hitchhikers between day and night. Because the nests we observed were largely nocturnal, more than 90 percent of the hitchhiking occurred at night. The phorid parasitoids are usually considered to be diurnal, so the preponderance of nocturnal hitchhiking suggests other functions in addition to parasitoid defense. Hitchhikers spent more time in the defensive head-up posture during the day, but spent more time in the head-down posture at night. The head-down posture may indicate cleaning or other leaf preparation. The hitchhikers were never observed feeding on sap. Hitchhikers frequently got onto and off of the fragments, and so they were not ""marooned."" Few hitchhikers rode all the way back to the nest and were often moving on the leaf fragment; these observations make the energy conservation hypothesis less likely, although we cannot reject it. We conclude that parasitoid defense is an important function of hitchhiking but also that there are probably other functions when parasitoids are absent.

We monitored the effect of this drought on phenology and water status of trees with young leaves and compared modifications of phenology in trees of different functional types with the pattern observed during the regular dry season. Although deciduous trees at dry sites were severely water stressed (ΨSTEM < -7MPa) and their mesic leaves remained wilted for more than two months, these and all other trees retained all leaves during the abnormal drought. Many trees exchanged leaves three to four months earlier than normal during the wet period after the abnormal drought and shed leaves again during the regular dry season.

Recent experiments, however, indicate that a hummingbird's ability to feed at artificial flowers of different lengths depends on the widths of the flowers. We examined if the broad range of flower lengths visited by many hummingbird species can be explained by the widths of the flowers. We predicted that both short- and long-billed hummingbirds would include long, wide flower species in their diets, but that short-billed hummingbirds would not include long, narrow flower species because nectar in these species might be beyond the reach of their bills. If so, the slope of the regression for flower width versus flower length should be smaller for flower species visited by longer-billed hummingbirds relative to those visited by shorter-billed hummingbirds. Analyses of data sets for some North American and Monteverde hummingbirds and their food plants were consistent with this prediction, and bill lengths were significantly correlated with the slopes of the regressions of flower width versus length for seven hummingbird species. Comparisons of observed flower use by some Monteverde hummingbird species to flower assemblages generated at random suggest that these significant regressions were not simply a result of allometric relationships between flower lengths and widths, but in some cases reflected active choice by the birds. The two hummingbird-flower data sets also differed significantly in the scaling of corolla width relative to corolla length. In particular, the Monteverde data set contained a large number of long, narrow flower species, which we suggest is a consequence of a different floral evolutionary history and association with long-billed hummingbird species. The evolutionary effects of hummingbirds and their flowers upon one another are more complex than has generally been realized, and a consideration of corolla length jointly with other floral characters may improve our understanding of hummingbird-flower relationships.",64,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Flower morphology | Foraging behavior | Hummingbirds | Monteverde | North America | Pollination | Specialization | Trochilidae,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,57,NA,NA

Trees flowered at the end of March or early in April at the end of the hot dry season and start of the rainy season. Flowering occurred over about a one-month period. Fruits developed over the next six months during the rainy season and matured at the start of the cool dry season in October and November. Phenology was similar in the four trees that were studied in detail. Racemes averaged 30 flowers each and each raceme was receptive for several days, although each flower was only receptive for one day. After pollination, floral parts were shed over several days and fruits began to develop. Pradu is entomopholous but its insect pollinators were not identified. The stigma is covered by hairs and a secretion is produced. A high proportion of flowers were pollinated. Then, there was a rapid loss of flowers and young fruits. These observations and earlier genetic studies indicate the probability of a high level of self-incompatibility in this predominantly outbreeding species. Pradu may have a very late-acting self-incompatibility mechanism found in many other hardwoods. The zygote remains quiescent for six weeks as the endosperm develops. During this time most of the ovules and fruits abort, suggesting resource allocation preferentially to cross-pollinated ovules. Pradu has a high reproductive potential but a low preemergence reproductive success (0.8), which is common for many hardwood species. The major cause of the low reproductive success was fruit loss during early development. Fruit production may be enhanced by increased cross-pollination among unrelated parent trees. This may be accomplished in seed orchards and seed production areas by the introduction of additional insect pollinators that travel greater distances between trees and by the relatively close spacing of unrelated parent trees.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Phenology | Pterocarpus macrocarpus | Receptivity | Reproduction | Reproductive success,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,58,NA,NA

This study examined the composition of an epiphyte community on Vellozia piresiana (Velloziaceae) in a Brazilian rupestrian field, and investigated the factors influencing their abundance and distribution. In July 1998, 98 individuals of V. piresiana were sampled inside three transects in rocky outcrops of Serra do Cipó, Minas Gerais, and their height were measured. All epiphytes growing on these phorophytes were counted and identified. Height and branch diameter at which each epiphyte individual occurred were recorded. Luminosity intensity was measured in the upper canopy, middle canopy, and 10 cm above ground 100 phorophytes in the same population; 712 epiphytes were found growing on V. piresiana, belonging to six species: Vrisea oligantha (Bromeliaceae; 344 individuals), Epidendrum saxatile (251), Constancia cipoencis (50), Prosthechea vespa (31) Sophronites brevipedunculata (30; all Orchidaceae), and Tillandsia usneoides (1; Bromeliaceae). A higher abundance of epiphytes occurred at intermediate heights on the phorophytes, probably because of an intermediate light incidence at these positions. We found epiphytic species across different distributions, both in terms of height and branch diameter of V. piresiana, which may have reflected distinct degrees of tolerance to drought and excessive luminosity. These results indicated that despite the low richness observed in this study, the epiphyte community on V. piresiana presented ecological features similar to that observed for tropical rain forests (e.g., phorophyte partitioning and differential vertical distribution).",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Brazil | Dry habitat | Rocky quartzite outcrops | Rupestrian field | Serra do Cipó | Species diversity | Vascular epiphytes | Vellozia piresiana | Vertical distribution,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,66,NA,NA

We used five quantitative methods (leaf litter sifting, two types of pitfall traps, beating low vegetation, and soil digging) and compared methods within and across habitats. Sample-based and occurrence-based accumulation curves demonstrated that the efficiency of ant inventory methods is habitat specific. Litter sifting, however, was the single most efficient method in both habitats. Overall, our analyses of the relative efficiency of methods recommend the use of sifting and beating in the montane forest site, and sifting alone in the grassland site. In four of five methods, more species were collected in the grassland site (31 spp.) than in the forest site (26 spp.). Occurrence-based accumulation curves based on all methods demonstrated that species richness was similar in the two habitats, reaching a maximum difference of approximately one species. Only five species were shared between the grassland and forest sites. The presence of a high number of ant species restricted to the grassland site (18 spp.) is the first record of high endemism in this habitat in Madagascar and may have strong implications for the reconstruction of the natural vegetation types at the time humans arrived. Their presence suggests that a comparable open habitat, such as montane woodland, shrubland, or thicket, was present on Madagascar long before humans developed the secondary grasslands less than 2000 years ago. These results are contrary to the ""classical hypothesis"" that the central plateau was a continuous region of closed forest. These results support the hypothesis that the montane regions, including the central plateau, once contained areas of habitat with an open structure and that the endemic ants now found in the secondary grasslands were originally native to such a habitat.",45,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Collection methods | Deforestation | Formicidae | Grassland | Inventory design | Madagascar | Tropical montane forest,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,67,NA,NA

We recorded the frequency of distress calls and struggling behavior in 40 species of birds captured in mist nets during the dry season in a Costa Rica cloud forest. We tested the following hypotheses proposed to explain the function of distress calls: (1) calling for help from kin or reciprocal altruists; (2) warning kin; (3) eliciting mobbing behavior; (4) startling the predator; and (5) distracting the predator through attraction of additional predators. Our results did not support the calling-for-help, warning kin, or mobbing hypotheses. Indeed, genera that regularly occurred with kin or in flocks were not more likely to call than non-flocking genera. There was no relationship between calling frequency and struggling behavior as predicted by the predator startle hypothesis. Genera of larger birds tended to call more than smaller birds, providing some support for both the predator distraction hypothesis and predator startle hypotheses. Calls of higher amplitude may be more effective in startling the predator. Distress calls of larger birds may also travel greater distances than those of smaller birds, supporting the predator manipulation hypothesis, but this requires further testing.",16,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Alarm calls | Costa Rica | Lower montane rain forest | Mixed-species foraging flocks | Mobbing | Talamanca Mountains,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,68,NA,NA

Burial by dung beetles as an incidental result of their feeding and nesting activities often provides these seeds with refugia from attack. To examine the effect of habitat disturbance on the dung beetle communities involved in this process, I surveyed dung beetles at three sites in the Amazon basin, in the states of Pará, Amazonas, and Rondônia, Brazil. Through principal component analysis on measurements of size and behavioral characters of beetles, I determined the relative quality of beetle species as seed dispersers (dispersal defined as horizontal or vertical movement of seeds) and ranked them into seed dispersal guilds. I used correspondence analysis to examine in what habitats (primary forest or varying degrees of disturbed habitat) these guilds were abundant. Most guilds decreased with increasing habitat disturbance, but one guild made up of large nocturnal burrowers (primarily Dichotomius) became more abundant with increasing disturbance (up to the level of highest disturbance surveyed), at which point all dung beetle species became scarce. Clear-cuts had lower species richness, lower abundance, and lower biomass than forested areas. These results imply that clear-cutting is detrimental to all seed dispersal dynamics in tropical rain forests, but that some levels of disturbance allow enough disperser activity to preserve this ecosystem function.",86,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Amazonia | Brazil | Community analyses | Dung beetles | Rain forest disturbance | Scarabaeidae | Seed dispersal,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,69,NA,NA
