This may be because the garua season (cool, overcast, and foggy) is a time when environmental conditions mitigate against rapid warm- up in the mornings, so lizards may regulate nighttime body temperatures so that it is easier to warm up to preferred daytime body temperatures. In the warmest season, adult iguanas were found in the coolest sleeping sites available, consistent with hypotheses of voluntary hypothermia, which can be advantageous in energy conservation and in avoiding detrimental effects associated with maintenance of constant body temperatures throughout the day and night. Juvenile iguanas slept in rock crevices regardless of the ambient thermal environments. Such sites are likely to be important as refugia for this life stage which, unlike the adult stage, is vulnerable to predation. -from Authors",52,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Tree establishment rates were higher on burned sites during periods with generally above-average to average spring/summer precipitation than during below-average periods. Highest rates of tree establishment occurred close to fire edges. Current species composition on the older burns closely reflects the composition of residual trees. Drought resistance of the residual tree species may interact with climate to affect establishment rates. Tsuga mertensiana establishes best during wet periods; Abies lasiocarpa, Pseudotsuga menziesii and Pinus monticola establish well during normal periods.

Long-term reproductive success varied markedly among territories and was correlated primarily with the dispersion and density of perches used as foraging sites and secondarily with the abundance of ground squirrels, principally Belding's ground squirrel Spermophilus beldingi. Prey availability appears to be more important to reproductive success than absolute prey abundance. Pairs in territories with few or poorly dispersed perches did not rely more on energetically expensive aerial foraging, but poor dispersion of perches resulted in both decreased flight time and in decreased foraging energy expenditure. Thus it is likely that red-tailed hawks in territories with few or poorly dispersed foraging perches deplete the prey near the perches that are present. Territory size was not correlated with reproductive success. Red-tailed hawks coexisted with Swainson's hawks B. swainsoni and showed strong interspecific territoriality. Some pairs of red-tailed hawks lost portions of their territories to the later arriving Swainson's hawks each year.

In the Venezuelan savanna, breeders (principals) assisted by 2 or more nonreproductive auxiliaries have much greater reproductive success than those with less help. Per capita production of independent juveniles is also higher. Only groups with at least 2 auxiliaries successfully rear 2 clutches in a season. The proportion of nesting attempts successful in producing fledglings is much higher for groups of 4 adults or more than for smaller groups, probably because of lesser predation on the nests of large groups. Rates of food delivery to nestlings and number of fledglings per successful nest are as high for pairs and trios as for larger groups, but feeding of nestlings and fledglings by auxiliaries frees the principals from these tasks and probably makes multiple successful clutches possible. Auxiliaries directly defend the breeding nest from predators and competitors, although the principal male is most active in defense. Aid-giving by auxiliaries is explained 1) by its effectiveness in improving the reproductive success of close kin through reducing risk of predation for nestlings; 2) by the probability of reciprocation of such effective help; and 3) by the low productivity of breeding outside a large established group. -from Author",79,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,7,NA,NA

At the extreme perch separation distance, all but one of the birds ate both species of fruits on the first perch before flying to the second perch. The distance at which each bird switched between the 2 feeding sequences was correlated with the strength of their preference for one species of fruit over another.

The main assumptions are: reproductively active males wait for females in a 'mating arena'; females arrive when they are ready to mate; each female mates with a single mate, then leaves; all males that are reproductively active on a given day have the same chance of mating with available females; each male is not reproductively active every day, but alternates between sexually active and inactive states; active males have a higher daily mortality than inactive males; and each male chooses daily whether it will be reproductively active or inactive, thereby maximizing its lifetime mating success. The Nash equilibrium of this noncooperative differential game is solved by using dynamic programming. The number of active males each day during the season can be calculated if the female arrival schedule, mortalities of active and inactive males, and annual survivorship of males are given. The model predicts that 1) numbers of active males and fertilizable females will be correlated if the number of arrivals of fertilizable females varies among days; 2) the operational sex ratio (the ratio of reproductively active males to fertilizable females) decreases through the season; 3) the rate of decrease in the operational sex ratio during the early part of the season is the same as the mortality rate of inactive males; and 4) the operational sex ratio fluctuates during the later part of the season and increases toward the end of the season.-from Authors",17,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,13,NA,NA

Intrusion pressure, however, accounts for the early-morning bias of foraging to edge areas. Intruders attempted to rob nectar from flowers in the edge areas of territories much more frequently than in the cores, and a higher proportion of these attempts were successful. Intruders frequently returned within 5-10 min to the sites that they had just robbed, and returned most frequently to those territories where they were able to rob for the longest time before being detected and chased. Nectar levels on territories were highest at dawn, and since edges were more prone to food losses than were cores, the territory owner minimized losses by feeding in the edge areas early in the morning.

Partial experimental reduction in herbivory resulted in the development and persistence of dense covers of algae through the summer months, as well as increasing algal abundance during the other times of year. Apparently the primary cause of the seasonal fluctuations in algal abundance is variation in rates of algal production rather than change in absolute rates of algal loss to ther herbivory or physical stresses. Limpets are probably consuming more, not less, algae in the winter months, higher rates of algal production in winter more than compensate for the increased herbivory. During summer, drier conditions cause rates of production by the algae to fall below rates of consumption by limpets and the limpets remove most of the standing crop of algae. Thus, increased grazing pressure coincides with increased physical stress.

Disappearance of Microtus from some habitats during a population decline was accompanied by a shift of Synaptomys into areas formerly occupied by Microtus. Recolonization of Microtus resulted in a return to the previous pattern of microhabitat segregation. Removal of Microtus from an experimental grid was followed by immediate colonization by Synaptomys. One year following removal of Synaptomys from an experimental grid, most of the former Synaptomys habitat remained empty even though Microtus numbers were increasing. Synaptomys diet consisted largely of vegetation that is low in digestible nutrients (Andropogon in summer, moss in winter). Although Microtus ate Andropogon, this species included more dicotyledons and other monocotyledons in its diet. When Synaptomys was living on a grid from which Microtus had been removed, similarity to food habits of Microtus previously living on the removal grid was much greater than on a grid where the species coexisted in separate microhabitats (72 vs. 37%). In the S Appalachians, Synaptomys is thus apparently excluded from preferred habitats by Microtus and, as a result, lives where cover is sparse and food is low in nutritional value. Although these species do compete, this competition is relaxed when Microtus populations decline. The ultimate limiting resource is food.

Small fish of both species foraged predominantly in the vegetation, and 76-91% of their average seasonal diet was vegetation-dwelling prey (non-gastropods).

Individuals of both species were probably abroad every day, but the wide forager was abroad for much shorter periods (2.75 h/d vs. 10.25 h/d). Nevertheless, the widely foraging species had significantly higher field metabolic rates (800 vs. 544 J/d) feeding rates (metabolizable energy of 1165 vs. 739 J/d), production rates (365 vs. 195 J/d) and water influx rates (0.285 vs. 0.156 mL/d). Resting metabolic rates (O2 consumed) were similar at 37oC (0.240 vs. 0.252 mL.g-1.h-1) and at 26o(0.094 vs. O.103 mL.g-1.h-1), the field active and nocturnal burrow temperatures, respectively, of both species. Field metabolic rates, on a 24-h basis, were 3.1 X resting in E. lugubris and 2.2 X resting in E. lineoocellata. Energy expenditures during the activity period were 12.0 X resting in the wide forager and 2.8 X resting in the sit-and-wait predator. Foraging efficiency (metabolizable energy gained while foraging/total energy spent while foraging) was higher in the wide forager (2.0) than in the sit-and-wait predator (1.6). However, when foraging efficiency is expressed as metabolizable energy gained/activity cost (above resting cost), the wide forager (2.2) was less effective than the ambush predator (2.6), apparently because the cost of searching is substantial for E. lugubris but negligible for E. lineoocellata. The hourly cost of foraging was much higher for E. lugubris (almost 5 X that of E. lineoocellata) but the hourly benefit of foraging for E. lugubris was even higher (nearly 6 X that of E. lineoocellata). Thus E. lugubris made a greater profit on its investment (46 vs. 36% each day), and the wide forager grew nearly twice as fast as did the sit-and-wait predator.

Calcium return is also high in most tropical forests, but many tropical forests (lowland and montane) have little P return and very high dry mass/P ratios in litterfall compared to most temperate forests. Phosphorus appears to be cycled highly efficiently in such forests. Fine litterfall in the range of tropical forests studied was predicted from climate; the residuals of this regression were positively correlated with P but not N concentrations in litterfall. Amount of fine litterfall (uncorrected for climate) was also significantly correlated with P concentrations in moist and wet lowland tropical forests.

The extreme dependence of survival on hatching position, coupled to processes producing adequate growth of all fledging birds, is an adaptive response to breeding under conditions where weather may suddenly change adversely.

Mosquitofish show little such behaviour and are more easily displaced by floods. Mosquitofish typically extirpate topminnows from native habitats via predation within 1-3 yr after introduction. Replacement is most rapid in localities that rarely or never flood, while long-term coexistence may occur in frequently flooded habitats. Abiotic disturbances may promote coexistence by periodically reducing population sizes of the exotic predator before the native prey species is eliminated.-from Author",187,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,147,NA,NA

The proportions of yolk and albumen do not change with egg mass, and hatchling mass is proportional to egg mass. Hatching is asynchronous, and later-hatched chicks often starve or die from exposure. These breeding characteristics are proposed to be related to the exploitation of a food supply showing both long- and short-term unpredictability in abundance. The higher mass of the later chicks within a brood may allow them to survive long enough to exploit any sudden increases in food abundance at little parental cost. Systematic variation in mass within a clutch may be due to a facultative response in females; individuals fed upon an extremely constant daily food supply laid less variable clutches than females exposed to the natural food supply.-from Author",28,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,148,NA,NA

The lower limits are generally higher south of central California. This is exemplified by the trochid snail Tegula funebralis. At sites where predator density was high, the lower limit of Tegula's intertidal range was higher on the shore. Shell width was usually smaller, and increased with elevation wherever predators were abundant. Predators were more abundant at southern sites. The primary predators of Tegula are octopuses (Octopus bimaculoides, O. bimaculatus) the starfish Pisaster ochraceus and crabs of the genus Cancer. Octopuses occur only at the southern sites; Pisaster and Cancer are found throughout the geographic range of the study. The lower limit of distribution of adult Tegula is influenced by the snails' defensive behavior. Where predators were abundant, both S and N Tegula placed low on the shore rapidly climbed to higher levels, probably an avoidance response to chemical exudates from predators. Southern snails always climbed upwards sooner and reached higher levels than northern snails; predators thus killed more northern snails. The behavioral difference between S and N Tegula may be the result of long-term differences in intensity of predation by octopuses, which are much rarer in the intertidal N of central California. Young-of-the-year Tegula were found mainly in mid-intertidal region. -from Author",69,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,173,NA,NA

Seed dispersers tend to be flatter and broader billed than other groups, and have a wider mouth relative to bill width. GPT of seed dispersers is signficantly shorter than that of other groups. Morphological correlates of seed dispersers suggest that adaptations for insectivory serve as preadaptations for feeding on whole fruits. Shorter GPT's, in contrast, appear to be an adaptation indispensable to sustained, intense frugivory. seasonal frugivory imposes limits on commitments to permanent structural modifications, and more subtle functional adaptations of seed dispersers to plants are as relevant as the more conspicuous structural adaptations reported for year-round frugivores.-from Author",129,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,181,NA,NA

The species composition of nonisolated patches following reoccupation was independent of patch size. Vegetative growth of organisms adjacent to the patches was the major means of reoccupation. Most larvae that recruited into the patches were overgrown, so that the species composition of the patches reflected the outcomes of interference competition among residents of patches. As a result, sponges and colonial tunicates were the most common taxa, with bryozoans and serpulid polychaetes being excluded. Occupation of isolated patches was strongly size-dependent. On small substrata, species' abundances reflected their ability to colonize substrata by planktonic larvae, with a small number of patches containing tunicates, which have the potential to monopolize such patches. Larger substrata had a higher probability of being colonized by tunicates and sponges, in addition to bryozoans.
