An apparent paradox was found that at the site with the largest trees (Zagne) relatively many small canopy gaps were created. Branch fall is the preferential mode of senescence of emergent tree species; they slowly drop their branches when they die-off, creating many branch fall gaps.

The floral characteristics, scarlet corolla, no odor, and copious nectar and typical of ornithophily, but the near ground position of the flowers seemed inappropriate for bird pollination. Also, the nectar is largely sucrose, a sugar composition atypical of plants pollinated by paleotropical passerines. Three species of honeyeaters, (Melphagidae) were observed to be the only floral visitors capable of effecting pollination. Flowering was diurnal with anthesis beginning at dawn. Floral visits were most frequent during mid-mornings. By early afternoon, if flowers were not visitor-pollinated, elongation of the corolla tube effected self-pollination. Pollination manipulations determined that outcrossed flowers set significantly more fruit, with significantly heavier seeds, than self-pollinated flowers, suggesting an inbreeding depression. Mean seed mass data from open-pollinated controls suggested that the fruits produced were from a combination of self (65%) and outcrossed (35%) pollinations. -from Authors",22,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,22,NA,NA

Some species visited are believed to be pollinated principally by perching birds, lepidopterans, and bees, however. In general, sugar compositions of all hummingbird nectars were highly clustered toward the high-sucrose end of the composition spectrum. Significant correlations were detected between elevation and the percentage of fructose and of sucrose in the nectar (fructose percent positive, sucrose negative). These correlations were due to both elevation and hummingbird-group effects. Daily secretion rate and sugar concentration were both negatively correlated with elevation. Nectar sugar concentration and daily secretion rates together could usually predict whether a species was pollinated by hermit (Phaethorninae) or nonhermit (Trochilinae) hummingbirds and could often predict which eco-morphological group of nonhermits. -from Authors",138,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,23,NA,NA

At the lower scale of determination, biological systems of regulation based on mutualistic relationships between macro- and microorganisms ultimately determine the rates and pathways of decomposition. Four such systems are defined: the litter and surface roots system, the rhizosphere, the drilosphere and the termitosphere in which the regulating macroorganisms are respectively litter arthropods and surface roots, live subterranean roots, endogeic earthworms, and termites. In the humid tropics, this general model is often altered because climatic and edaphic constraints are in many cases not important and because high temperature and moisture conditions greatly enhance the activity of mutualistic biological systems of regulation which exert a much stronger control on litter and soil organic matter dynamics. This general hypothesis is considered in the light of available information from tropical rain forests and humid savannas. Biodiversity is probably determined, at least partly, by soil biological processes as a consequence of enhanced mutualistic interactions, which enlarge the resource base available to plants. -from Authors",344,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,27,NA,NA
