The seed bank was smallest following spring and summer germination and largest in late winter when most seeds had been detached from parent plants. The lowest seed density (600-1100 m-2) was recorded in grass-filled hollows. It was 2-3 times greater on ridges. In both ridge and hollow habitats the seeds, which have a hard seed coat, remained dormant throughout most of the year. The largest transition between dormancy states occurred during winter months when seed coats were scarified and innately dormant seeds entered a state of enforced dormancy. Some 78-85% of experimentally introduced seeds germinated within 12 months, mostly in spring (April-May). Normally only 30-40% of the natural seed bank would germinate in a single year. Medicago lupulina apparently has a persistent seed bank in the study area. The regenerative strategy of M. lupulina was compared with that of Hieracium floribundum which dominated ridge habitats in the study area. While both species had flourishing populations on ridges in the pasture, most seeds of H. floribundum survive for no more than 1 yr, and recruitment to the population is mainly vegetative. The strategy of M. lupulina appeared to be better suited to colonizing small patches of bare ground created by the activities of animals or by erosion.-from Authors",18,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,1

Overall, there was an increase in species density with decrease in mass of crop and of litter but also an increase in variability so that both species-poor and species-rich vegetation with small total crop occurred. Vegetation very rich in species was found only when the above-ground September total crop was less than about 1500 g m-2.

Small-scale gap-phase regeneration of L. bidwillii occurs where poor drainage reduces the abundance and vigour of the young trees of most of the species in the gap. Where the vegetation has been massively disturbed by exogenous phenomena such as land slides or extensive windthrow, L. bidwillii often establishes in relative abundance in association with trees such as Phyllocladus alpinus and Nothofagus solandri. The regeneration failure hypothesis is a logical consequence of climax theory according to which old stands are expected to be in equilibrium.

Stabilization at realistic densities was achieved by modifying values for clonal growth to rates intermediate between the extremes recorded in the field. At normal rates of fertility and mortality there is a continuous turnover of genets. Increasing the rate of clonal growth increased the probability of genet survival and hence the number of genets. A low-density pattern of individuals and clumps could be produced by certain combinations of mortality and fertility rate; competition from other plant species or unsuitability of the environment was not required to explain gaps between individuals or clumps.

This model accounted for 82% of the variability in specific leaf dry-weight growth rate, SGR (% day-1), in all treatments for the duration of the experiment from 9 June to 18 November. Leaf-N concentration decreased to 1% of dry weight during mid-summer in plants limited by N, but remained above 2% at all times in plants not limited by N. Concentration of N in leaves had little effect on SGR, but 49% of variability in SGR was explained by a linear regression on solar radiation, ie. the temporal changes in SGR were largely dependent on climatic factors. Differences in total plant production were attributed to differences in the ratio of growth rate of photosynthetic:nonphotosynthetic tissue rather than to changes in SGR. The growth rate of aerial biomass was initially 1.7-2.8 times that of below-ground biomass, depending on the treatment, while eventually this quotient decreased to less than 1.0. Although aerial and rhizome production were stimulated by increased N supply, total root production did not differ significantly between treatments. -from Author",46,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,43

These types were generally recognizable by indicator species, and that gibbons recognized them too was reflected in their behaviour. The number of times that Kloss gibbons (Hylobates klossii) were seen feeding in a forest type was very highly correlated with the density of trees that were potential fruit sources for gibbons. Female gibbons sang from those forest types with the trees that were tallest and above the break of slope. The gibbon group slept in those forest types in which the trees had a low frequency of the myrmecophilous epiphyte Myrmecodia tuberosa, presumably to avoid being bitten by ants.
