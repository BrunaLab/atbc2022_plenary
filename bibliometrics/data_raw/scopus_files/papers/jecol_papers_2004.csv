Lately, two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the source of such a variation, mainly either at internuclear (multigenomic) or intranuclear (polyploidy) levels. 2 Evidence reported by numerous authors suggests that the magnitude of sequence variation, and the presence in single spores of sequences from apparently unrelated taxa within the Glomeromycota, makes the use of one, or very few sequences, from only one or two isolates of AMF insufficient for taxonomic purposes in some species groups. 3 A large-scale, collaborative study on genetic variation in AMF across different genes could help to address fundamental questions on the biology and genetic structure of these important symbionts.",23,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,Field studies | Gene sequence diversity | Multiple sequences | Mycorrhizal diversity,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,1

This simple general correction should reduce the bias associated with census interval variation, where it is unavoidable. 6 Re-analysis of published results shows that the pan-tropical increase in stem turnover rates over the late 20th century cannot be attributed to combining data with differing census intervals. In addition, after correction, Old World tropical forests do not have significantly lower turnover rates than New World sites, as previously reported. Our pan-tropical best estimate adjusted stem turnover rate is 1.81 ± 0.16% a-1 (mean ± 95% CI, n = 65). 7 As differing census intervals affect comparisons of mortality, recruitment and turnover rates, and can lead to erroneous conclusions, standardized field methods, the calculation of local correction factors at sites where adequate data are available, or the use of our general standardizing formula to take account of sample intervals, are to be recommended.",146,Journal,ar,Article,100,18,18,Carbon dioxide | Global environmental change | Long-term monitoring | Modelling | Neotropics | Palaeotropics | Permanent sample plot | Rain forest | Tree | Tropical forest dynamics,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,3

Our glasshouse experiment used two soil water environments (wet and flood) to measure hybrid trait expression at both the genotypic class and individual genotype level. 4 At the genotypic class level, two of the three hybrid classes (F1s, and backcrosses towards each parental species) were transgressive for at least one physiological trait (F1s for root mass proportion, specific leaf area and final leaf area; backcrosses to I. brevicaulis for leaf area ratio).

We also tested for reductions in growth rate to determine whether induced defence incurs metabolic costs. 3 We tested whether direct grazing, feeding on neighbouring plants, clipping and presence of a non-grazing herbivore could trigger induction. The isopod Idotea baltica and the gastropod Littorina littorea were used as herbivores. 4 Both direct feeding of I. baltica and feeding on neighbouring plants induced chemical defence in F. vesiculosus, whereas the snail L. littorea only induced defence by direct grazing. Simulated herbivory (clipping), or the presence of herbivores without grazing, did not lead to defence induction. All induced defences were reversed within 2 weeks of consumption ending. 5 Thus, F. vesiculosus differentiates between physical damage and natural herbivory. Furthermore, feeding by I. baltica on F. vesiculosus releases signals that trigger neighbouring Fucus individuals to induce defence. 6 We found no evidence that metabolic costs incurred as a consequence of induced defence were sufficient to lead to growth reduction. 7 This algal species demonstrates defence plasticity (i.e. induction and reduction of anti-herbivore defences 'on demand'), with the response depending on both grazer identity and grazing pattern matter.",87,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,Baltic Sea | Chemical defence | Defence induction | Fucus vesiculosus | Herbivory | Idotea baltica | Littorina littorea | Macroalgae | Plant-herbivore interactions | Water-borne cues,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,5

Only a small fraction of the host populations is infected at one point in time and pathogen turnover rate is high. I studied a sample of these populations to find out whether adjacent host populations are differentiated in their resistance structure and whether variable levels of disease resistance among host populations could be linked to disease incidence patterns. 3 Results show striking differences in the resistance structure both within and among host populations. Sixteen resistance phenotypes were identified in a sample of 64 host individuals. Populations varied from one in which all sampled individuals represented a different resistance phenotype, to one in which half showed identical resistance responses. 4 There was no association between local resistance composition and the geographical distance between populations, suggesting that within-population processes, such as founder effects and genetic drift, largely determine local resistance structure. 5 Non-infected populations showed significantly higher mean levels of resistance than infected populations, suggesting that differences in the mean level of resistance among host populations may retard the spread of the fungus and thereby decrease the probability of regional epidemics.",91,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Disease resistance | Host-pathogen interactions | Metapopulation | Plant epidemiology | Plantago lanceolata | Spatial pattern,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,6

Dispersal limitation and the invasibility of the tundra matrix have been implicated and here we propose herbivory as an additional control at some tree lines. 3 We propose a conceptual model in which differing relative impacts of foliage consumption, availability of establishment sites, trampling, dispersal and seed predation can lead to very different tree-line responses. 4 The presence of large numbers of small trees above the current tree line at a site in northern Sweden that experiences limited reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) herbivory suggests range expansion. Other locations in the same region with higher reindeer populations have considerably fewer small trees, suggesting that range expansion is occurring much more slowly, if at all. 5 The use of tree lines as indicators of climate change is confounded by the activity of herbivores, which may either strengthen or nullify the impacts of a changed climate.

Rates of uplift are most rapid in the eastern portion of the lowlands near the lower Albany River study area. 2 The stratigraphy of three raised bogs was investigated to determine rates and pathways of peatland development in the Albany River region. The bogs are distributed evenly along the regional chronosequence from the oldest site at Oldman (5980 ± 100 BP) to progressively younger sites at Albany River (4810 ± 70) and Belec Lake (3960 ± 60). 3 Each bog had the same stratigraphic sequence, beginning with a basal tidal marsh assemblage that was rapidly replaced by a Larix-dominated swamp forest, followed by a Picea-forested bog, and ultimately a non-forested bog. The bog-fen boundary is marked by the disappearance of fen indicators, dominance of bog-forming Sphagna, and a sharp decline in nitrogen. Each of these successional stages was associated with different rates of vertical growth. 4 The rate of successional change was more rapid at the younger sites, and their vertical growth curve was more curvilinear. The formation of a raised bog, for example, was 1.3 times more rapid at Albany River and 5.5 times more rapid at Belec Lake than at Oldman. Belec Lake reached its ultimate successional stage first, although it was the last site to emerge from the sea. 5 The differential rate of isostatic uplift across this region rather than climate was the principal environmental driver for peatland development. The faster rate of uplift on the lower reaches of the drainage basin continues to reduce the regional slope, impede drainage and shift river channels, continually altering the local hydrogeological setting. 6 Groundwater flow simulations based on the Dupuit equation show that the growth of these raised bogs was probably constrained by their local hydrogeological setting. Bog formation was first induced by the creation of interfluvial divides between headwardly eroding streams or shifting river channels, and further bog growth was ultimately constrained by the width of the interfluve and the depth of river incision. The Belec Lake bog was the first to approach its limiting height because its narrow interfluve could only support a low water-table mound. 7 Although peatland succession largely followed the same conservative pathway at each site, both the pace and direction of these pathways were set by geological processes, which are probably the decisive drivers for the evolution of this large peat basin.",96,Journal,re,Review,100,5,5,Bog development | Ground water models | Isostatic uplift | Landscape evolution | Pollen analysis,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,8

In contrast, heterospecific pollen did not decline, indicating that the outcross-pollen decline was not due to reduced pollinator visitation. Increased distance of experimental arrays from a nature reserve did not reduce the probability of pollen receipt. 4 Many flowers were damaged by flower feeding beetles in the genus Arsipoda, which would be likely to substantially reduce the efficiency with which flowers are converted to fruits. The probability of flower damage from these predators was significantly lower in arrays that were more distant from the nature reserve. 5 This study indicates that reduced plant density and increased isolation from a source of outcrossed pollen can lead to a substantial decline in the probability of outcrossing, even when pollinator visitation is maintained at a high level.

The peatland vegetation may be further subdivided into 11 noda, which are closely related to different water levels, ranges in water chemistry, and peat landform type. Species richness generally declines with increasing water level and acidity, whereas the gradient from bog to extremely rich fen is marked by the changing abundance and occurrence of fen-indicator species. 3 Bog landforms are restricted to physiographic settings where surface waters flow downwards and the bog vegetation is therefore isotated from the influence of geogenous waters. In contrast, fens are located in areas where mineral solutes are transported to the peat surface either by upwelling groundwater or by advective/dispersion along lateral flow paths. 4 Peatlands spread across the study area between 6000 and 3000 BP, coinciding with the emergence of new land from the sea. The release of organic acids from the nearly continuous peat cover acidified this calcareous landscape, leading to the convergence of the surface-water chemistry into four discrete groupings of pH vs. calcium. 5 Isostatic uplift, however, continues to alter the topography, fluvial geometry and groundwater flow systems of the lowlands, maintaining diverse peatland types on land surfaces of similar age. The formation of water-table mounds under the interfluvial divides and rising moraine system spurred the development of raised bogs, whereas the formation of regional seepage faces for goundwater on the margins of the moraine and rivers of the till plain maintains large areas of fen. 6 Although peatland succession seems to follow predictable pathways within a given hydrogeological setting, these pathways are locally altered by tectonic drivers that continually modify surface and groundwater flow systems.

We determined whether different nutrients limit the growth of forage plants in the two habitats, and whether these differences affect the nutritional quality of vegetation available to geese at La Pérouse Bay, Manitoba. 2 Results from fertilization experiments indicate that primary productivity in the salt marsh is both nitrogen and phosphorus limited, whereas the freshwater marsh is phosphorus limited. Total amounts of calcium, magnesium and potassium in above-ground biomass per unit area showed similar differences in limitation. 3 Leaves of preferred forage species have higher nutrient concentrations (nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium) and lower C:N and C:P ratios than alternative forage. The main forage species in the salt marsh (Puccinellia phryganodes) has higher nutrient content per unit mass, for nitrogen, magnesium, calcium and sodium, than the major freshwater marsh species(Carex aquatilis). The difference in nutritional quality of forage between the marshes is likely to have had consequences for goose fitness, and may have contributed to the reported declines in gosling survivorship and size. 4 At moderate grazing intensities, seasonal growth of salt-marsh forage is maintained by addition of nitrogen and, to a lesser extent, phosphorus from high numbers of goose faeces to swards. In contrast, the low densities and low phosphorus content of goose faeces in the phosphorus-limited freshwater marsh mean that plants are unlikely to recover rapidly from the effects of grazing. As a consequence, the freshwater marsh is likely to become increasingly less productive as foraging intensifies. 5 Nutrient gradients in vegetation across an ecotone and changes in foraging behaviour have resulted in adverse effects on both the growth rates of individuals and the population structure of a herbivore.",51,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Geese | Mineral nutrients | Nitrogen | Nutrient stoichiometry | Phosphorus | Wetland,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,12

Such models fail to account for creation and destruction of habitat, which may interrupt the movement of slowly migrating species such as forest herbs. 2 To explore the interaction of habitat turnover and population migration, we present a dynamic landscape model inhabited by a dispersing species. The landscape is represented as a square lattice in which individual cells may be either habitat or non-habitat, and a hypothetical species may spread among habitat cells. Rate of species spread, habitat frequency and habitat clearance and regeneration are allowed to vary. 3 In static landscapes, the fraction of the landscape occupied by the species is limited by connectivity among habitat patches and rate of population migration. Slow species often cannot reach all available habitat despite the presence of continuous paths to it. 4 In dynamic landscapes, slow-moving species show reduced map-scale frequency and high risk of extinction due to the cumulative effects of habitat patch destruction and the failure to colonize newly created habitat. Such species decline cannot be predicted based on static descriptions of habitat connectivity or migration rate. 5 Fast-moving species may be reduced in dynamic landscapes by the cumulative effect of numerous local isolation events. Fast-moving species may also experience a modest range expansion in low-connectivity landscapes due to the cumulative effects of short-lived patch adjacency. 6 These results suggest a novel mechanism that could account for species impoverishment in fragmented landscapes.

Radial growth characteristics of killed trees and survivors were compared by dendrochronological analyses. Relationships between growth and climate were investigated using response function analysis. 4 At the tree scale, individuals with variable growth were more prone to die from drought than trees with more regular growth. Juveniles whose growth patterns showed sensitivity to climate were particularly likely to die. However, among both killed trees and survivors, older trees were less sensitive to climate. 5 Mean growth rate was a good predictor of mortality in adult trees, showing that trees with slower growth rate were more susceptible to drought. Susceptible trees may have been negatively affected by the drought that affected northern Patagonia in 1956-57. 6 These results underscore the importance of considering drought-induced tree mortality as a non-random mechanism influenced by site, previous stress/disturbance history, ontogeny, vigour, climatic sensitivity and physiology.

Local plant communities can only function within a metacommunity context if they are connected by appropriate dispersal vectors, accommodating the transport of propagules between sites. The capacity for long-distance dispersal may be a key factor in the survival of local populations, especially in fragmented landscapes, and hence may have a large impact on local species composition. Dispersal vectors with a large efficiency for long-distance dispersal included in this study are: water, wind, large mammals and birds. 2. We tested the hypothesis that variation in dispersal traits across plant communities is related to the position of the communities along major environmental gradients. This hypothesis was tested for (i) separate long-distance dispersal vectors and (ii) multiple dispersal vectors (the number of potential long-distance dispersal vectors per species). 3. To quantify linkages between dispersal traits and environmental gradients, we coupled a data base containing dispersal attributes with another data base, containing 40 000 local vegetation descriptions aggregated into 123 plant communities. For each dispersal vector, the proportions of species that have access to this vector per community (weighted trait scores) were projected along three major environmental gradients: soil moisture, nutrient availability and light availability. 4. The potential importance of individual dispersal vectors showed clear differences along the three environmental gradients, with the greatest differences along the light availability gradient. The differences in dispersal traits probably reflect environmental constraints on the availability or efficiency of individual dispersal vectors. 5. The ability to be dispersed by multiple dispersal vectors is a common phenomenon in most plant communities (an average of 2.15 vectors per species). The mean number of potential long-distance dispersal vectors per species increases with light availability. This probably implies that plant communities differ in their response to both habitat fragmentation and habitat restoration. 6. Despite differences in trait spectra among communities, all dispersal syndromes are represented in nearly all communities. An important consequence of this complementarity in dispersal traits is that species within the same community may experience different connectivity. 7. The results emphasize the need for dispersal models based upon multiple dispersal vectors that explicitly include parameters for habitat characteristics.",157,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Ecoinformatics | Functional traits | Polychory | Trait complementarity | Trait-environment linkages,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,16

The majority of existing studies address mono-causal explanations of this decline.

Studies of the responses of communities to land use or climate change at a functional rather than species level have used species traits as response or effect variables to enable generalization between different communities and biogeographical regions. Data from 10 published experiments on semi-natural and agricultural grasslands in Scotland, and from published information on plant traits, were used to determine whether (a) species and trait attributes behave consistently with respect to changing grazing intensity at sites of different productivity and (b) whether species and attribute responses to grazing were affected by site productivity. 2. Only 9 out of 22 species common enough to show a consistent response to grazing did so. For example, Deschampsia flexuosa and Molinia caerulea declined when grazing intensity increased, whilst Anthoxanthum odouratum and Cerastium fontanum increased. A similar proportion (12/29) of traits behaved consistently between studies. 3. Increased grazing intensity was accompanied by an increase in species with a ruderal strategy, an annual life history, seasonal regeneration by seed, flowering and seed dispersal early in the season, rosette habit, higher requirement for light and a lower minimum height. 4. The response of five species was modified by site productivity. In four cases, the effect was to modulate the rate of response to grazing change. In contrast, Nardus stricta increased with grazing at low productivity sites, but decreased at high productivity sites. Many more traits (22), including attributes related to life history, life form, and vegetative and sexual reproduction, showed a response to grazing modulated by productivity. Eight of these changed in a complex manner, akin to that of N. stricta. 5. The response of some species and traits to grazing appears predictable.

Distribution of plant species in fragmented landscapes is the result of both seed and site availability. Little is known about how their relative importance differs at different spatial scales. 2. I sowed seeds of eight dry grassland species into 22 localities that differed in occupancy by these species and followed seedling establishment over 3 years. I compared the number of emerging seedlings at three scales: between previously occupied and previously unoccupied localities, between occupied and unoccupied blocks within occupied localities, and between plots with and without seed addition within occupied blocks. 3. At the two larger scales, I also studied the relationship of the number of seedlings and of the distributions of adult plants to environmental factors. 4. Both seed and site availability are important in structuring the distribution of these species, but site availability becomes less important with increasing spatial scale. The intensity of this effect is, however, species specific. 5. The relationship between environmental factors and pattern of species distribution is also clearly scale dependent, and differs between seedlings and adults. Whilst abiotic factors are the main determinants of seedling distribution, the occurrence of adult individuals is best predicted by the occurrence of other species. This suggests that the present distribution of species in the landscape is determined mainly by historical factors. 6.

Almost all the species were wind-dispersed. 2. For the discrete source studies, the lognormal was clearly superior, while for the inverse modelling the performance of the three dispersal functions was somewhat more even. We speculate that collisions with boles spuriously enhanced the likelihood of the 2Dt and the Weibull with inverse modelling, as both these functions assume that the greatest seed/seedling density will occur at the base of the maternal parent bole. 3. We conclude that the lognormal function is to be preferred because, as well as providing a framework for mechanistic interpretation, it tends to provide a closer approximation to observed dispersal curves. 4.

The invasion of Betula spp. represents the moment of transition between European lowland heath and scrub ecosystems. We hypothesized that Betula invasion was controlled by a multivariate threshold, comprising factors that may be subdivided into seed and safe-site limitations, and that phosphorus availability was a key determinant of the Betula safe-site. 2. We performed a multifactorial field experiment in which seed rain, P-availability and disturbance were manipulated. All treatments had significant effects on Betula seedling densities, with seed availability proving the single greatest limitation. P addition emerged as having highly significant effects 4 and 12 months after germination. Disturbance had an initially large positive effect that dwindled across time. 3. Detailed descriptions of seedling density data were achieved by converting two factorial variables (seed rain and P availability) to a continuous form, including numerous covariates, and producing 'minimum adequate' generalized linear models (MAMs). These provided accurate descriptions of the data (explained deviance typically > 70%) and delimited site conditions where transition was likely. 4. Seed availability remained the most important factor, but the increased number of parameters in models describing densities of more mature seedlings suggested a temporal accumulation of recruitment limitations. Statistical modelling allowed for the subdivision of disturbance effects into those associated with a reduction in vegetation densities and the remaining 'direct' effects, e.g. soil disturbance, which shifted over time from being positive to negative. The results also support the hypothesis that soil phosphorus sorption capacity (PSC) determines heath-scrub transition as many of the identified determinants are controlled, either directly or indirectly, by PSC. 5. The study demonstrates that a combination of experimental and statistical modelling approaches can provide a detailed description of the factors controlling early stage invasion and may therefore have considerable utility in ecosystem management.

Initial recruitment is by far the most variable and least predictable phase of the plant life cycle. Its dynamics remain little known, particularly in complex seed dispersal systems and over multiple reproductive cycles. 2. Seeds of the tree Frangula alnus are usually dispersed by frugivorous birds. Mediterranean populations, however, are mostly restricted to riparian forests, and their seeds may be re-distributed during the winter by elevated stream water flow. Strength and frequency of peak discharges vary greatly from year to year. I investigated spatiotemporal variation of initial recruitment by monitoring fruit production, seedfall and seedling emergence over 4 years along permanent transects in two F. alnus populations growing along small mountain streams in southern Spain. 3. Seedling abundance varied greatly among years and independently of fruit or primary seedfall abundance. Spatial distributions of both seedfall and seedling emergence were highly consistent among years. Bird-mediated seedfall density decreased exponentially with both increasing distance from the nearest fruiting tree and the decrease of its crop size. Seedling emergence was, however, uncoupled in space from the previous year's seedfall, both across single sample points and entire 60-m transects. Dispersal experiments with seed mimics revealed that flooding caused secondary dispersal of much of the population seed pool over several scores of metres. 4. Seed re-distribution by water appears to override patterns of primary (bird-generated) seedfall and to determine spatial patterns of seedling recruitment. Seedling emergence is, however, more stable across years than would be expected given the unpredictability of rainfall (and thus stream flow), suggesting that seed deposition may be primarily determined by relatively stable microsite characteristics. 5. The dynamics of seed rain patterns are of critical importance for plant population demography and spatial structures. The finding that even complex, multistep dispersal systems may produce remarkably consistent year-to-year distributions of recruits has important implications for the interpretation of long-term patterns of riparian plant regeneration at the landscape level and resulting conservation management.",80,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Bird dispersal | Hydrochory | Hydrology | Interannual variation | Landscape features | Mediterranean climate | Secondary seed dispersal | Seed rain | Seedling emergence | Spatial autocorrelation,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,24

We measured and modelled the dispersal of a wind-dispersed herb, the leafless hawk's beard (Crepis praemorsa, Asteraceae), using a combination of measurement techniques, selected empirical models and mechanistic models originally developed for trees. 2. Dispersal was measured by releasing individual seeds and by placing seed traps around an experimentally created point source of seeding plants. Dispersal distances varied considerably between the experiments. In the seed releases, dispersal distances were positively related to horizontal wind speed (linear regression, P < 0.001) and, under favourable conditions, many seeds dispersed over several metres, with a few at > 30 m. 3. Four empirical models (the inverse power (IP), the negative exponential (NE), Bullock & Clarke's mixed model (MIX) and Clark et al.'s 2Dt model) were fitted to the data. IP and NE models often failed to accommodate the shape of the empirical distribution of dispersal distances, and the MIX model, although extremely flexible, tended to overfit the data. The 2Dt model was, however, flexible and realistic in each experiment. Nevertheless, the parameter values for all of the empirical models varied dramatically between experiments; no set of parameter values predicted the observed dispersal distances under all conditions. 4. Two mechanistic models (Greene & Johnson's analytical model (GJ) and Nathan et al.'s individual-based simulation model (NSN)), originally developed for trees, were parameterized using independent data and parameter values from the literature. Although the NSN model provided a poor fit for the seed trap experiment, it performed almost as well as the best empirical models in the seed release experiments. Its predictions were further improved by including convection, and predicted dispersal > 30 m corresponded closely with our observations. The prediction of low (< 1%) dispersal > 200 m requires further validation. 5. We conclude that dispersal models for wind-dispersed trees can be adapted for herbs with different dimensions and diaspore characteristics. Mechanistic simulations are superior because they are robust to environmental heterogeneity, as well as being informative in terms of understanding and predicting the effects of species characteristics and ecological factors on dispersal distances.

Although, in nature, seed dispersal usually declines with distance from the source, seedling establishment patterns are highly variable. An increase in seed survival can lead to either hump-shaped (Janzen-Connell (J-C) pattern) or declining (Hubbell pattern) establishment with distance from seed source, but declining establishment can also be generated if survival decreases with distance (McCanny pattern). Pathogens and seed predators are considered to be major mortality agents structuring recruitment patterns, but it is unclear how well predation alone can explain variation in these patterns. 2. We introduce a simple mechanistic model showing that distance and density-dependent seed predation can generate all of the observed recruitment patterns. Our approach provides the first mathematical reconstruction of conceptual models previously considered to be based on contrasting underlying mechanisms. Three easily measurable quantities (the proportion of seeds escaping predation at the source, and the mean distance from the source of dispersed seeds and of predators' activity) can be used to test for consistency with the J-C pattern. The association between recruitment patterns and plant (dispersal) and animal (predation) characteristics is robust with respect to parameter values and various functional forms. 3. The model shows that the J-C pattern can occur only if the mean distance over which predators are active is lower than that over which seeds are dispersed, corresponding to a system with host-specific, or immobile, seed predators (often invertebrates) that are restricted to areas of high seed density near adult plants, and therefore selecting for longer dispersal distances of seeds. 4. The Hubbell pattern is generated by the model when dispersal and predation distances are of equivalent magnitudes. The McCanny pattern emerges if more generalized, or more mobile, seed predators (often vertebrates) are attracted to the adult trees but also tend to forage farther away, thereby selecting for short dispersal distances that generate high densities needed to satiate seed predators. 5. The model also predicts that the total number of seeds surviving predation is lowest at intermediate distances, suggesting that distance-dependent predation promotes either short or long dispersal distances, or both (dimorphism).",136,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Dimorphism | Janzen-Connell model | Minimal models | Plant recruitment | Predator satiation | Seed survival,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,26

We investigated a total of 439 sites in rocky habitats with sparse vegetation and 110 meadows with dense vegetation. 2. In both rocky habitats and meadows, soil pH was inversely related to exchangeable P. In rocky habitats plant species richness increased greatly between pH 3 and 5 and was also inversely related to P. 3. Plant communities in rocky habitats contained a relatively larger proportion of non-mycorrhizal species than those in meadows. More non-mycorrhizal species occurred at high soil P in the rocky habitats, but no such relation was found in meadows. 4. Non-mycorrhizal species in rocky habitats were most common at low soil pH (high P availability). Plant species that thrived at extreme soil pH were often non-mycorrhizal. 5. The occurrence of fewer non-mycorrhizal plants in meadows than in rocky habitats supports the hypothesis that AM associations are more important in ecosystems with intense competition among plants. In rocky habitats, where abiotic stress may restrict photosynthesis more than nutrient limitation does, it is adaptive for plant species to utilize strategies other than mycorrhiza, particularly at low pH sites where P availability is likely to be adequate.",44,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Arbuscular mycorrhiza | pH | Phosphorus | Plant coexistence | Plant strategies | Soil acidity | Species richness | Stress tolerance,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,29

The northward expansion of the boreal forest vegetation zone is generally predicted under a warmer doubled CO2, but the delay associated with vegetation development processes often has been overlooked. In the subarctic forest-tundra of northern Québec, reforestation of tundra uplands appears currently limited by the poor reproductive capacity of shrubby black spruce (Picea mariana), and the development of erect stems through accelerated height growth should be the first registered response to 20th century climate warming. The subarctic forest-tundra is characterized by small- and large-scale heterogeneity in topography, vegetation structure and climate. This spatial heterogeneity, added to the complexity of tree growth-climate relationships, can cause various growth responses of subarctic tree line black spruce to 20th century climate change. 2. Twenty spruce populations at subarctic tree lines and seven isolated clones at the species limit were sampled along a > 300-km latitudinal transect from the southern forest-tundra to the shrub tundra. Height growth patterns of black spruce at tree line and above tree line were examined (i) over their life span, using dendrochronological dating of stem cross-sections, and (ii) for the recent decades, using leader shoot elongation measurements. Indexed elongation chronologies were compared with regional climate data. 3. Height growth of tree line trees generally decreased with increasing latitude. However, tree line trees in the northern forest-tundra have experienced an acceleration of height growth since the 1970s, with their growth comparable to that of trees in the southern forest-tundra. Height growth response of spruce trees appeared increasingly delayed from the northern forest-tundra to the species limit. Above the subarctic tree line, wind-exposed conditions obscured the decrease in height growth with latitude observed for tree line trees. 4. Leader shoot elongation of spruce trees established on tundra hilltops appeared more controlled by summer heat sums than those at tree line all over the forest-tundra, except at the arctic tree line. Winter precipitation also was linked to leader shoot elongation in some forest-tundra sites. The increasing snow cover associated with recent warming appeared to have reduced the shoot elongation of spruce at forest margins showing the steepest slopes, hence subjected to snow overloading. 5. In the northern forest-tundra sites, the recent increase in height growth and positive trend in leader shoot elongation, consistent with a 1990s' increase in heat sums, point to the development of spruce krummholz into erect growth forms. In the southern forest-tundra, reforestation of tundra hilltops and northward expansion of the boreal forest predicted under doubled CO2 conditions could be delayed, as suggested by suppressed height growth of spruce above tree line.",109,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Boreal forest | Climate change | Dendrochronology | Forest-tundra | Krummholz | Picea mariana | Shoot elongation | Snow cover | Stem analysis | Wind-exposure,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,30

Milicia regia (Moraceae) is a dioecious light-demanding (Pioneer) timber tree of West Africa. Experiments in shadehouses were used to examine the influence of light and soil source (beneath and away from conspecific adults) on mortality and growth of its seedlings in relation to fungal pathogens and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization. 2. The experiment in Ghana included treatments for light (2% and 20% of unshaded irradiance), three soil sources (under female, under male and 200 m distant from adults), and two different fungicide treatments. 3. The results showed significant effects of irradiance, soil source and fungicide on both seedling mortality and accumulated biomass. Biomass was greater and mortality reduced at higher irradiance. Fungicide application reduced mortality in 2% irradiance, but had no significant effects at 20%, although AM infection of seedlings grown in soils from beneath adults was severely reduced. Mortality was greatest in soil from beneath female trees and least in soil distant from adult conspecifics. However, biomass in 20% irradiance was greater in soil from beneath females, possibly because of enhanced AM colonization: seedlings had a significantly higher percentage root length colonized by AM fungi beneath adult conspecifics, and biomass accumulation was significantly correlated with root length colonized by AM fungi. 4. There were significant interactions amongst light, soil source and fungicide treatments that attest to the complexity of spatial effects on seedling establishment in tropical forest. Whilst there was clear evidence of pathogen-mediated effects that provides support for Janzen-Connell spacing mechanisms, and escape from the parent tree increases the chances of arriving in gaps, spatial differences in AM fungal communities may act in the opposite direction and enhance seedling growth close to adult conspecifics. 5.

Plant community development depends to a great extent on the availability of soil nutrients, but recent studies underline the role of symbiotic, herbivorous and pathogenic soil biota. We tested for interactions between these biotic and abiotic factors by studying the effects of additional nutrients and the removal of soil biota on the replacement of grassland plant species typical of different successional stages. 2. Species representing each of the early, mid and target phases of secondary succession in a grassland community (four per phase) were grown in mid-successional grassland soil. The mixed plant communities were grown in sterilized and non-sterilized soil, at three nutrient supply levels. The distribution of shoot biomass over the different plant species, and the total root biomass, were determined, as well as the composition of nematode and microarthropod communities and soil decomposition rates. 3. The effect of nutrient supply on plant community composition depended on soil sterilization. In sterilized soil, the plant community was initially dominated by grasses that increased in dominance even without fertilization. In non-sterilized soil, the plant community was more diverse and grass dominance decreased over time, except with high fertilization. Fertilization enhanced the productivity of the plant community in sterilized and, to a greater extent, in non-sterilized soil. 4. The abundance of root-feeding nematodes was positively related to increased root biomass, pointing to a strong bottom-up control. Increased levels of nutrient supply were associated with reduced abundance of omnivorous nematodes, the cause of this reduction being less clear. Increased soil fertility altered the functional diversity of the soil nematode community, which might, in the longer term, also affect their feedback effects on the plant community. 5. Increased nutrient supply reduced soil decomposition activity in the non-sterilized soil, but not in the sterilized soil. 6. Our results imply that soil biota may reduce the effects of nutrient supply on plant dominance. Incorporating the effects of soil biota on plant species interactions into studies on succession, plant species diversity and restoration may therefore considerably increase our understanding of the observed plant community patterns.",186,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Grassland restoration | Plant diversity | Plant-soil feedback | Soil fertility | Soil invertebrates | Succession,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,32

Shade-tolerant species have regenerated continuously for the past 400 years, but recruitment of shade-intolerant species has increased only in the past 50 years. These regeneration patterns suggest a lack of catastrophic disturbance, at least since 1650. 4 Analysis of tree radial growth patterns revealed frequent moderate releases of both shade-tolerant and intolerant tree species, consistent with frequent small-scale disturbances, such as individual tree-fall gaps. Increased releases, peaking in 1940 and followed by enhanced recruitment, may be a consequence of individual tree-falls induced by low-intensity windstorms or limited selective logging. Such disturbances have occurred for at least 250 years, but have had little overall effect on stand structure and canopy composition. 5 The replacement and coexistence of shade-tolerant and intolerant tree species in the canopy of this North Patagonian forest can be explained by frequent small-scale disturbances (i.e. gap-phase dynamics) and by the absence of large-scale natural or anthropogenic disturbances over the past four centuries.",57,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Dendroecology | Disturbance regimes | Gap-phase dynamics | Regeneration modes | Shade-tolerance | Species coexistence | Temperate rain forest | Tree-fall gaps,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,34

Abe Run's population was small, with moderate herbivory by deer and relatively constant population size. The population at Big Draft was of medium size, with heavy deer grazing, and a sharply declining number of flowering plants up to the spring before our study started, when the population was fenced. 2 We observed dormant episodes lasting from 1 to 4 years.

Soil properties of the alternate states were measured in conjunction with the ability of transplanted tillers of Puccinellia phryganodes to grow in exposed soil and intact swards. Simulated grubbed patches (2.5-40 cm diameter) were prepared at three sites and the soil properties and inward clonal growth of the grass in each patch were examined during two growing seasons. 3 Where an organic layer was still present on exposed areas, soil properties were similar to those in the rooting zone beneath intact swards, except that soils were hyper-rather than hyposaline. Older exposed mineral soils, where the organic layer had been eroded, were similarly hypersaline, but were also low in soil moisture and total nitrogen, and compacted with a low infiltration rate. Transplanted tillers survived in intact swards, but few survived in any hypersaline soils. 4 Changes in soil properties over two seasons depended on size of experimentally created patches. Again, high salinities developed in soils of the larger patches, and there was a loss of nitrogen and soil moisture and an increase in bulk density with increasing patch size. Although inward clonal growth of P. phryganodes took place from plot perimeters, this is likely to be curtailed by high salinities in plots over 20 cm diameter. 5 As in tropical Africa, intense herbivory can lead to an alternate stable state in this Arctic salt marsh.

Twenty-three functional characters were measured on each of the species, covering the morphology of the shoot and root systems and nutrient status, and intended to represent modes of resource acquisition. 2 Patterns of association between plant species at the four scales were examined for any tendency for plants with similar functional characters to coexist less often than expected at random (e.g. if a point has three species, do they have notably different characters?) The observed results were compared with the patterns expected under a null model using a range of test statistics. 3 A test over all characters found that the mean dissimilarity between nearest-neighbour species in functional space, and the minimum dissimilarity, were greater than expected under the null model at the 0.5 × 0.5 m scale. This supports the MacArthur & Levins model, although the actual community did not show an even spread of species over functional space. 4 Limiting similarity effects were seen even more consistently in separate characters when within-species variation was taken into account to calculate measures of overlap. The characters involved were mainly those related to rooting patterns and leaf water control, and thus perhaps reflecting the acquisition of nutrients and/or water. 5 Our results seem to be amongst the most convincing support for the theory of limiting similarity, and the only example involving vegetative processes in plant communities.

The model was used to investigate potential effects of environment and litter-quality related parameters on peat accumulation, and to examine how well past changes in net accumulation can be reconstructed from the peat core record. 2 Sensitivity analysis of the model indicates that the relative ability of different input parameters to increase peat accumulation changed over time. Short-term results, e.g. from litter decomposition studies, therefore cannot be extrapolated to predict peat accumulation over longer time-scales. 3 In simulations that examined the long-term development of static community types, peat accumulation responded more strongly to water table position in bogs than in fens. In several cases, the relative peat accumulation potential of different community types changed over time. 4 Successional change (fen to bog) increased or decreased net peat accumulation, depending on the water table of the simulated bog. If succession was accompanied by lowered water tables, modelled peatlands showed a net loss of organic matter over extended periods of time. Effects of decreased litter quality in drier communities were outweighed by decreased productivity and greater decomposition in the thicker acrotelm. 5 Plots of cumulative organic matter mass vs. age for simulated profiles were often 'concave', as predicted by models that assume continued decomposition of deep peat. However, simulations that involved community change violated the assumptions of such models, and reconstructed actual (net) rates of organic matter accumulation were unreliable in spite of excellent model fits. 6 Current peat accumulation models often assume that environmental change will affect productivity, but not the botanical composition of peatland communities. Over decadal and centennial time-scales, however, community change will probably play a key role in determining peatland responses to climate change. Results obtained here suggest that interactions between environmental and community-based controls are complex, and their net effect may not be predictable from current data.

We also determined aerenchyma contents and carbohydrate use efficiencies during flooding in plants of these 18 genotypes. 3 In the flooding treatments, genotypes from the lakeside microhabitat produced significantly more rosettes and rooted rosettes than genotypes from the landside microhabitat. This indicates small-scale local adaptation to flooding duration in R. reptans. 4 Unexpectedly, genotypes from the landside microhabitat had a higher proportion of aerenchyma in their roots than those from the lakeside microhabitat. Carbohydrate use efficiency was high in all genotypes. These physiological traits cannot therefore explain the observed local adaptation. 5 Genotypes from the lakeside microhabitat produced shorter stolon internodes than genotypes from the landside microhabitat when flooded. Moreover, in the treatment with long flooding duration, there was selection for reduced stolon internode lengths, which might help to reduce respiratory losses. This suggests that local adaptation is a consequence of differences in plasticity of internode length. 6 Our results indicate an important role for flooding in plant microevolution by demonstrating that variation in flooding duration can induce intraspecific specialization even within populations.

Deciduous shrubs, evergreen shrubs and graminoids increased their biomass with fertilization, whereas non-vascular plants decreased. 3 Dominant species from each growth form usually responded strongly to fertilization, but half of all subdominant species responded weakly or not at all. Few species responded to neighbour removal. 4 Soil nutrient availability, however, was elevated significantly by both fertilization and neighbour removal. Neighbour removal increased nutrient availability in fertilized plots by up to two orders of magnitude, and availability of NH4+ and NO3- in some unfertilized removal treatments was greater than in the fertilized intact community. 5 The failure of many plant species to respond with enhanced growth to soil nutrients made available by neighbour removal, despite their response to fertilization, could be due to (i) tundra plants having such rigid niche complementarity that they are unable to utilize these additional resources, or (ii) insufficient time having elapsed for the remaining species to respond, because nutrients derived from neighbour removal probably became available later than nutrients added as fertilizer. 6 There may be a high potential for loss of available nutrients from the tundra ecosystem when species composition changes, if the remaining plants cannot adjust to use nutrients made available by the loss of their neighbours.",84,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Nitrogen | Phosphorus | Plant functional types | Soil nutrient availability | Species interactions,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,43

Large-seeded species have long been known to have higher survivorship during establishment than small-seeded species. Here, we assessed the size of this advantage by compiling published data on survival through seedling emergence, seedling establishment and sapling establishment. 2. We found no relationship between seed mass and survival through the transition from viable seed in or on the soil to newly emerged seedlings (P = 0.47, n = 33 species). 3. Synthesis of data from experimental studies on the advantages of large-seeded species establishing under particular hazards (such as shade, drought or herbivory) confirmed that seedlings of large-seeded species perform better than those of small-seeded species in most situations. However, the magnitude of this advantage was not sufficient to counterbalance the greater number of seeds produced by small-seeded species m-2 of canopy outline year -1. 4. Synthesis of data from field studies of populations under natural conditions also showed that large-seeded species have higher survival through early seedling establishment than small-seeded species (P = 0.006, n = 112 species). However, the magnitude of this advantage would only be sufficient to counterbalance the greater number of seeds produced by small-seeded species m-2 of canopy outline year-1 if mortality continued at the same rate for some time. 5. The time required for a species with 10-fold larger seeds to recoup the advantage gained by a smaller-seeded species during seed production ranged from 8.8 weeks for the smallest seeded species in the data set, up to an implausible 4.2 years for the largest-seeded species. Thus, while large-seeded species do have a survival advantage over small-seeded species during seedling establishment, the available evidence suggests that advantages must also accrue during other stages in the life cycle.

We predicted that a lack of competition would generate allocation to rapid, short-distance spread (vegetative propagation), while the presence of competition would increase allocation to long-distance dispersal (sexual reproduction), and that the allocation shift would be more pronounced where the competing ramets were related. 3. P. anserina ramets were grown in a glasshouse in small pots, either alone (no competition) or with a size-matched ramet that originated from the same clone (within-genet competition) or a different one (between-genet competition). 4. Competition suppressed both growth and reproduction, but there was no treatment response in relative investment at the level of a whole genet, although both mother ramets and their daughters showed clear effects when analysed separately. 5. When experiencing competition, the mother ramet allocated relatively more to flowers, whereas allocation to vegetative growth was more intense when competition was absent. Allocation patterns were independent of the relatedness of competitors. 6. The results imply that P. anserina can modify the allocation of resources to different life-history traits according to competitive stress. Such flexibility is likely to reflect a shift in the optimal allocation strategy during the life cycle of a plant with a guerilla growth form with rapid exploitation of free space in a new patch by vegetative spread favoured.

The seedlings of larger seeded species generally perform better than those of smaller seeded species under a variety of hazards. The reserve effect proposes that larger seeded species retain a greater proportion of their initial seed resources and their seedlings are therefore better provisioned to cope with post-deployment resource deficits. 2. This hypothesis was tested with a suite of 32 Australian rain forest species with storage cotyledons, and seed reserve mass ranging from 36 mg to 25 g. Seedlings germinated in dim light were harvested as their first set of leaves became fully expanded, dissected into shoot, root and left-over cotyledons, dried and weighed. 3. In cross-species, allometric analyses, the mean mass of the shoot-plus-root scaled less than proportionately (slope c. 0.8), and mean cotyledon mass more than proportionately (slope c. 1.1) with either initial seed mass or seedling mass. These slopes were significantly different from each other. Both conditions for a reserve effect were therefore fulfilled. Cotyledons ranged from 45% of total seedling mass in the smallest species, to 92% in the largest. 4. Solid evidence for a reserve effect was detected within two of four families tested (Lauraceae and Myrtaceae), but only in 7 of the 22 species for which there were sufficient data. 5. Even if the reserve effect has present day utility for enhanced seedling performance in larger seeded species, it may have evolved in response to selection for a greater relative retention of initial seed mass during seedling deployment in larger seeded species, combined with selection for greater deployment of seed reserves to the initial shoot and root of smaller seeded species.",60,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Cotyledon functional morphology | Rain forest seedlings | Reserve effect | Seed mass | Seed-seedling allometry,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,52

We identified species with low re-colonization potential, which could be used as indicators of recovery of species-rich pine savannas, by comparing the ground-cover flora of a 64-year-old slash pine plantation (recovery site) with that of a nearby natural longleaf pine savanna (reference site). We also determined life-history traits that were useful predictors of recolonization potential. 2. The high floristic overlap in species between reference and recovery sites and similar species richness at scales ≥ 10 m2 suggests that substantial vegetation recovery occurred over the 65-year period. However, for areas < 10 m2 the lower species packing in the recovery sites indicates that coexistence of a high number of species at small scales is dependent on local dispersal and establishment, and may take much longer to achieve. 3. The absence, or near absence, of some species from the recovery site, even after 65 years, suggests that some species may be particularly vulnerable to disturbance and may re-establish infrequently, if ever. Several dispersal distance-restricted species were identified that require active reintroduction. While no particular guild of species was a strong indicator of recovery in this study, we identified a group of species that assess the absence of or the degree of recovery from, prior soil disturbance. 4. Local dispersal appears to be an important factor structuring species richness patterns in pine savannas. Limitations of dispersal distance in some species, particularly those with gravity and ant-dispersal mechanisms, represent an obstacle to passive restoration that can only be overcome either by introduction of propagules in the restoration process or by allowing for longer periods of recruitment. 5.

The trade-off between seed mass and the number of seeds a plant can make for a given amount of energy underpins our understanding of seed ecology. However, there is little information on the magnitude of the fecundity advantage of small-seeded species over an entire plant lifetime. 2. We compiled data from the literature to quantify the relationships between: (i) seed mass and plant size (because the photosynthetic area of a plant determines how much energy is available for allocation to seed production); (ii) seed mass and plant reproductive lifetime (the number of years a plant has to produce seeds); and (iii) seed mass and the number of seeds produced per individual per year, and per lifetime. 3. Seed mass was positively related to all measures of plant size (canopy area, plant height, stem diameter, plant mass and canopy volume). There were also positive correlations between seed mass and time to first reproduction, plant life span, and reproductive life span. Thus, although small-seeded species produce more seeds per unit canopy area per year than large-seeded species, large-seeded species tend to have larger canopies and more reproductive years. 4. These patterns accord well with independently gathered data on annual and lifetime seed production. The negative relationship between seed mass and the number of seeds produced per year was much shallower on a per individual basis than on a per unit canopy basis. Seed mass was not significantly related to the total number of seeds produced by an individual plant throughout its lifetime. 5. Our previous understanding of seed mass as a spectrum from production of many small seeds, each with low establishment probability, to a few large seeds each with higher establishment probability, was missing some important elements.

In boreal ecosystems such interactions may dictate the response to climatic change, but the interaction of climate, vegetation composition and the fire regime remains poorly understood. 2. Sediment cores from lakes in south-central Alaska were analysed for lithology, macrofossils, pollen and charcoal to investigate the relationships between moisture availability, species composition and mean fire return intervals (MFI). 3. Macrofossil and lithological evidence suggests that variations in effective moisture occurred over the past 7000 years and that the regional climate has been wetter during the past c. 3800 years than before. 4.

Performance of interaction measures as predictors of relative growth rates in our study varied in agreement with the relative dominance hypothesis for both species and on all sites. Results from other studies suggest that the hypothesis may explain growth performances on a species and individual plant level and for a variety of life forms. 6.

We reconstructed the dynamics of a black spruce (Picea mariana) and jack pine (Pinus banksiana) forest stand in northern Québec using a continuous, 5200-year-long sequence of stem remains buried in adjacent peatland. Simulations of recruitment of such remains provided guidelines for inferring past ecosystem structure and composition at the stand scale. 2. Compared with the late Holocene (4650-0 cal. year BP (CYBP)), the mid Holocene (5200-4650 CYBP) period was characterized by faster tree growth, larger stems and higher stem density, indicating higher forest productivity in association with a milder climate. 3. The presence of stem remains of both species from 17 out of 20 contiguous 250-year time intervals suggests that the spruce-pine stand exhibited high compositional stability, with both species regenerating after fire from canopy-stored seed banks. 4. Relative species abundance closely followed the duration of past fire intervals deduced from the number of tree rings in buried conifers. Time periods of long (4650-3950, 3400-1850 and 250-0 CYBP) and short fire intervals (4950-4650, 3950-3400 and 1850-250 CYBP) were associated, respectively, with decreasing and increasing pine abundance, probably reflecting faster juvenile growth, lower shade tolerance, earlier sexual maturity and shorter longevity in jack pine compared with black spruce. 5. We conclude that both climate change and climate-induced fire disturbance have been driving long-term ecosystem dynamics. Our field evidence supports the idea that interactions between disturbances and the life-history traits of species modulate the impact of climate change at the scale of forest stands.

Small populations of reward-producing plants are likely to be less attractive to animal pollinators than large populations. As a result, both the quantity and the proportion of compatible pollen deposited on receptive stigmas, and seed output per plant, may be lower in small than in large populations. 2. We examined whether pollinator visitation, pollen deposition and seed set varied with population size in the self-incompatible, tristylous herb Lythrum salicaria, in the Skeppsvik archipelago, northern Sweden. We documented both the number of compatible and incompatible conspecific and heterospecific pollen grains received per flower, seed set and degree of pollen limitation of long-styled plants in 14 populations of different size in two consecutive years, and recorded the visitation rate to individual plants and the number of flowers visited per plant in eight of the populations. 3. As predicted, the visitation rate tended to increase, while the number of flowers visited per plant tended to decrease with increasing population size. However, visitation rates were low overall and temporally highly variable, and these relationships only approached statistical significance. The proportion and absolute number of compatible pollen grains received increased with population size, while the total amounts of conspecific and heterospecific pollen grains received did not vary significantly with population size. The results of supplemental hand-pollinations indicated that the among-population variation in seed set was due to insufficient transfer of compatible pollen in small populations. 4. Seed output increased with the receipt of compatible pollen grains up to about 200 compatible pollen grains received per flower. Between 73% and 98% of the L. salicaria pollen grains received were incompatible, and between 9% and 81% of the pollen grains deposited were heterospecific (population means). However, there was no evidence that the deposition of high numbers of incompatible conspecific and heterospecific pollen grains reduced seed set. 5. In the study populations of L. salicaria, variation in seed output and pollen limitation are apparently governed primarily by factors influencing the transfer of compatible pollen. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that a reduction in the efficiency of pollen transfer among compatible mating types may markedly reduce the reproductive output in small populations of self-incompatible plants.

An old-growth mesic forest in northern Michigan, USA, experienced an unusually intense storm in July 2002.

Tree mortality attributable to immediate effects of the storm was of similar magnitude to mortality over the previous decade, amounting to about 9% of basal area and 7% of stem density (mean of 88 inventory plots). 3. Storm mortality differed from baseline mortality in patterns related to species and size. Tsuga canadensis suffered little mortality of either type. Betula alleghaniensis had high baseline mortality in all size classes, but very low storm mortality.

Herbivore damage often induces the release of herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) or the secretion of extrafloral nectar (EFN).

I tested whether mature wild Lima beans (Phaseolus lunatus, Fabaceae) growing in Mexico could be reliably induced to produce HIPVs and EFN in response to application of the phytohormone, jasmonic acid (JA), and investigated whether this treatment leads to any benefit to the plants. 3. Eleven HIPVs were released from JA-treated leaves at significantly higher amounts than from control leaves, and only one (methylsalicylate) at significantly lower amounts than from controls. Treatment with JA increased EFN secretion on leaves on average by more than 30 times and on bracts by more than 20 times. EFN production, which has not previously been described in Lima bean, represents a second induced indirect resistance trait of this species. 4. JA treatment reduced both the number of dead shoot tips and leaf damage by herbivores. Treated tendrils grew faster and produced more leaves than controls. At the end of the experiment, treated tendrils bore c. two times more inflorescences and three times more fruits than controls. 5. Repeated treatment with JA resulted in a combined induction of HIPVs and EFN and strongly benefited wild Lima beans.

Invasive species dominate many ecosystems but the competitive strategies underlying this dominance are unclear. Are invasive species generalist competitors, or do they only thrive in certain environments? Do they occur mainly post-disturbance or can they persist throughout succession? 2. We tested the relative importance of resource acquisition (competitive suppression ability) and the ability to tolerate reduced resource levels (competitive tolerance ability) among four C3 perennial grass species in an invaded oak savanna. Two species (Poa pratensis and Dactylis glomerata) are exotic invaders and are thought to have replaced the two native species (Bromus carinatus and Elymus glaucus) as dominants. 3. Using glasshouse and field experiments we tested whether the two strategies were maintained with changing resource levels and successional conditions, and their relative roles in explaining exotic dominance. 4. The relative importance of suppression- and tolerance-based competition shifted with neighbour density, burning and planting order. Further, the relative importance of particular plant traits changed depending on the imposed conditions, and the exotic dominants were only competitively superior under certain circumstances. 5. Competitive suppression ability was maintained with changing resource levels but was confined to post-disturbance conditions. When planting of neighbours was delayed, the early establishing targets were dominant regardless of species, fertility and neighbour density. 6. Competitive tolerance ability determined long-term patterns of relative abundance and coexistence, but only under the current field conditions of low fertility and limited disturbance. Alteration of these conditions changed the relative abundance of the four grasses, and would probably reconfigure species patterns in the oak savanna community generally. 7. Exotic dominance is presently determined by tolerance-based competitive traits interacting with the long-term absence of disturbance. Dominance is therefore contingent on the interaction of competitive strategies, resource availability and disturbance history rather than any one factor alone. 8. Exotic flora dominate all stages of succession in this savanna because there exists both early (suppression) and late (tolerance) successional specialists. The identity of the dominant changes with succession based on the competitive strategy it employs.

Understorey and microphyllous species, both of which are typically found in gaps or in windy sites, were more abundant on slopes and ridges than in the valley. Habitat preferences of the species, reflecting shade/drought tolerance rather than soil fertility, may be a primary cause of differences in species richness between the topographic types. 4 The total effect of species richness on biomass increment was greater than that of tree density, and biomass increment increased linearly with species richness. This, together with the fact that combined effects of topography, soil properties and ground flora on biomass increment were comparable with that of tree density, indicates that the relationship was caused by habitat heterogeneity rather than a density effect. 5 Frequent disturbances and chronic wind stress resulted in higher mortality and a greater loss of biomass, especially on the ridges, and probably prevented species with different functional traits (e.g. maximum height) from competing for light. 6 Topographic variation therefore appears to lead to structural/compositional heterogeneity within this subtropical forest, enabling the occurrence of a wider range of species. The growth and survival of a variety of species with different functional traits are diversified by environmental conditions along the topographic position.

Overall survival was low, with c. 90% of seedlings dying in the first growing season (c. 98% after several growing seasons). Survival differed among microhabitats, being highest under shrubs and extremely low (or zero) under pines or in bare soil. 3 Seedling growth was the highest in areas of bare soil, intermediate under shrubs, and very low under pines. 4 Establishment under pines was prevented by both mortality and poor performance, and good performance cannot counteract high mortality in the open. Shrubs, however, acted as nurse plants, buffering summer drought without reducing radiation to levels critical for growth, and protecting seedlings from ungulate trampling, hail and frost heave. 5 Patterns of recruitment were similar for woodland stands and successional shrublands. In addition, patterns of survival for naturally established seedlings were similar to those of seedlings originating from experimental sowings. 6 Juveniles were positively associated with shrubs but negatively with bare soil or areas below pine canopies. The facilitative effect of shrubs on seedling survival therefore changes the spatial pattern of recruitment from that determined by germination. 7 Overall, processes controlling seedling establishment in these southern Scots pine forests differ sharply from those operating in its main distribution area.

Most explanations have focused on increased extinction, but, instead, we test experimentally whether increased soil fertility reduces recruitment. Specifically, we test whether variation in recruitment is due to source limitation, germination limitation or establishment limitation, and how litter accumulation and seed predation contribute to these processes. 2 We established four crossed experimental treatments in a perennial-dominated early successional plant community over 3 years. We added seed of 30 species, manipulated access by selected seed predators, removed litter and added slow release fertilizer at four levels (0, 8, 16 and 32 g N m-2). 3 Species recruitment and richness both decreased with increasing fertility, but, counter to our expectations, we found that neither seed additions nor litter removal could counteract the negative effects of fertilizer. 4 Seed additions increased seedling density at all fertilizer levels, and seed predation appeared to have no influence on seedling densities. In spite of high seedling densities at all fertilizer levels, final stem density declined by 70% as fertilizer increased. A strong stem density-species richness relationship suggests that declines in final stem density caused more than half of the decline in species richness along this fertility gradient. 5 These results suggest that establishment limitation, i.e. the reduction of growth and survival from seedling to adult, controls species recruitment in highly fertile sites. 6 The high degree of recruitment limitation commonly observed in productive habitats suggests that high productivity causes establishment limitation, thereby isolating these communities from the regional species pool.

This study examined whether mangrove recruitment differs among species with respect to the effect of forest gap size, ground disturbance, position along an intertidal gradient and canopy membership. 3 The canopy of a tropical mangrove forest in northern Australia was experimentally manipulated to create two gap sizes (50 m2 and 225 m2) in low and high intertidal forests with or without sediment disturbance. Propagules of six species, from three mangrove families, were sown into treatments and their predation, establishment, growth and survival measured for 5 years. 4 All species established, and five survived, in canopy gaps in both high and low intertidal positions. Interspecific difference in establishment, growth and survival of seedlings in two intertidal positions were not closely matched to canopy membership and hence this does not explain zonation. 5 No seedlings survived under the canopy and there was little evidence for shade-tolerant species. The interactions between canopy treatments and sediment disturbance that would have indicated gap partitioning were not detected. Seedling growth and survival was enhanced in large canopy gaps but there were no growth differences among species that matched canopy membership of plots. 6 Most species appear to be able to recruit in canopy gaps if there is no dispersal limitation. Rather, the range of species available to fill gaps is limited because predation of propagules advantages species that are from the adjacent canopy.

However, responses of regional treelines to climatic trends over the last century do not show any clear trends. We hypothesize that these equivocal responses may partly be caused by limitation of dispersal and/or recruitment that is species-specific to particular trees with potentially expanding ranges. 2 To test this hypothesis, we established and parameterized a temporally and spatially explicit model of plant spread and analysed its sensitivity to: (a) variation in predicted climatic trends; (b) the spatial distribution of recruits around a seed source; and (c) variation in the resistance of resident non-woody vegetation to invasion. We used data from a high mountain landscape of the Northern Calcareous Alps in Austria where the treeline is dominated by Pinus mugo Turra, a shrubby pine. 3 Low growth rates and long generation times, together with considerable dispersal and recruitment limitation, resulted in an overall slow range expansion under various climate-warming scenarios. 4 Running the model for 1000 years predicted that the area covered by pines will increase from 10% to between 24% and 59% of the study landscape. 5 The shape of the dispersal curve and spatial patterns of competitively controlled recruitment suppression affect range size dynamics at least as severely as does variation in assumed future mean annual temperature (between 0°C and 2°C above the current mean). Moreover, invasibility and shape of the dispersal curve interact with each other due to the spatial patterns of vegetation cover in the region. 6 Ambiguous transient responses of individual treeline systems may thus originate not only from variation in regional climatic trends but also from differences in species' dispersal and recruitment behaviour and in the intensity and pattern of resistance of resident alpine vegetation to invasion.",298,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Alpine treeline | Climate change | Dispersal | European Alps | Invisibility | Plant spread model,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,70

The abundance of species was compared in grazed vs. ungrazed plots (exclosures) in four neighbouring topographic sites (south- and north-facing slopes, hilltop and Wadi shoulders), representing a gradient of resource availability and productivity. 2 Above-ground potential productivity at peak standing crop in spring (i.e. inside exclosures) varied considerably between years and topographic sites. Productivity was similar among the hilltop, south- and north-facing slopes, and was typical of semi-arid ecosystems (10-200 g -2). Productivity in the Wadi was consistently greater (up to 700 g-2) and reached the range of subhumid grassland ecosystems. 3 The effect of grazing exclusion on the composition of the annual vegetation was productivity-dependent. Lower similarity (Sorenson's quantitative similarity index) between grazed and ungrazed subplots was observed in the productive Wadi compared with the less productive sites. The small-scale variation in grazing impact on species composition, due to differences in productivity, is consistent with models predicting similar trends in perennial grasslands across larger scale gradients. 4 The relationship between plant size (above-ground dry-weight), site productivity and response to fencing was analysed for the 36 most abundant annual species. Large species were more abundant in more productive sites, and small species at lower productivity, although few species were restricted to particular productivity levels. The response of individual species to protection from grazing was productivity dependent, with plant size playing a central role. Larger species tended to increase and small ones to decrease in abundance after fencing, with a mixed response in species with intermediate size. 5 A conceptual model is presented relating the response to protection from grazing along gradients of productivity to species plant size.",115,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Community structure | Competition | Functional traits | Response groups | Similarity,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,71

This may result from diffuse evolution allowing tolerance of a large number of neighbouring species or could be a statistical artefact of over-clumping species into large neighbour groups (e.g. heterospecific neighbours). 3 Other species supported models that differentiated between conspecific and heterospecific (n = 6) or between confamilial vs. non-confamilial (n = 5) neighbours and, in general, effects of neighbours were stronger if they were more closely related to the target. Where target species differentiated between neighbours from different light guilds (n = 15), effects were stronger if both belonged to the same guild (i.e. both gap requiring or both shade tolerant). 4 Despite the fact that the majority of species did not respond to the identity of neighbours, all differed in their response to the degree of crowding. Our results suggest that the response of target species to crowding, rather than individual species effects on targets, may be subject to selection. 5 Variation among species in response to crowding or to the identity of neighbouring species is likely to contribute to the maintenance of species diversity in tropical forests.",239,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Barro Colorado Island | Density-dependence | Ecological equivalence | Neighbourhood effects | Neutral theory,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,72

This stimulation may occur through elevated CO2 concentration, nitrogen deposition or by changes in climate. 2 Sinks also occur during the 'building' phase of high carbon ecosystems, for example following establishment of forests by planting. 3 New methods have been developed to identify biological carbon sinks: ground based measurements using eddy covariance coupled with inventory methods, atmospheric methods which rely on repeated measurement of carbon dioxide concentrations in a global network, and mathematical models which simulate the processes of production, storage and decomposition of organic matter. There is broad agreement among the results from these methods: carbon sinks are currently found in tropical, temperate and boreal forests as well as the ocean. 4 However, on a global scale the effect of the terrestrial sinks (absorbing 2-3 billion tonnes of carbon per year) is largely offset by deforestation in the tropics (losing 1-1 billion tonnes of carbon per year). 5 The Kyoto Protocol provides incentives for the establishment of sinks. Unfortunately, it does not provide an incentive to protect existing mature ecosystems which constitute both stocks of carbon and (currently) carbon sinks. 6 Incentives would be enhanced, if protection and nature conservation were to be part of any international agreement relating to carbon sinks.",250,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,1,1,Carbon sequestration | Carbon sinks | Kyoto Protocol | Plan Vivo,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,73

Individual disjunct genera occupied larger areas and latitudinal ranges in eastern Asia than in eastern North America, which parallels the larger area and latitudinal range of suitable climate in eastern Asia. 3 For all EAS-ENA disjunct genera taken together, the midpoint latitude, northernmost latitude, latitude range and area occupied were all significantly correlated between the two regions. For woody genera, only the correlation for midpoint latitude was significant, whereas for herbaceous genera, all except midpoint latitude were significant. 4 A TWINSPAN analysis partitioned the grid cells into four distinctive groups based on presence or absence of the disjunct genera. Grid cells representing these groups in EAS and ENA remained clustered when plotted on axes defined by floristic ordination (non-metric multidimensional scaling) or climate variables (discriminant analysis), showing that the disjunct genera have similar floristic relationships to each other within regions and respond, to a large degree, in parallel to climate variables. 5 The lack of correlation in distribution variables among woody genera between the continents in part reflects the greater propensity of eastern Asian woody disjunct genera to extend southwards into subtropical and tropical latitudes. 6 Although the disjunct genera exhibit significant conservatism in geographical and climate distribution, reflecting their common evolutionary ancestry, differences between regions in geography, physiography and climate have also acted to diversify environmental relationships between continents.",107,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Ecological breadth | Ecological conservatism | Evolutionary stasis | Latitudinal range | Parallelism,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,74

But there was a continuum of responses following less intense disturbances. Where substantial above-ground tissue was retained, as for wind throw, localized gap disturbances and low intensity fires, there were fewer non-sprouters and more intermediate sprouters. 5 Comparisons across diverse vegetation types and disturbances require quantitative records of sprouting, although the simple sprouter/non-sprouter dichotomy was sufficient for comparisons within fire.

Evidence in favour of topographic niche-partitioning was found: similarity in species composition between ridge and valley quadrats was lower than similarity between two valley (or two ridge) quadrats, and 25% of the species had large abundance differences between valley and ridge-top. On the other hand, 25% of the species were generalists, with similar abundance on both valley and ridges, and half the species had only moderate abundance differences between valley and ridge. 4 Topographic niche-partitioning was not finely grained.

In one year we found that as the seed size or plant size of neighbours increased relative to targets, so did their competitive effect. Although this is consistent with the competition/colonization trade-off model the competitive interactions were not sufficiently asymmetric to allow coexistence. In a second year we found only weak interspecific competition and no relationship with plant or seed size. 4. We found no overall relationship between competition coefficients and the degree of segregation, contradicting the spatial segregation hypothesis for coexistence. However, segregation was linked to differences in plant traits: when targets were smaller than neighbours the degree of segregation increased with relative neighbour size. 5. Most species were positively associated with each other due to a shared preference for otherwise unvegetated patches. The degree of association was negatively correlated with differences in plant and seed size, particularly when interspecific competition was weak.

Dry mass of 2872 D. anglica plants and 2467 D. rotundifolia plants (estimated from field morphological measurements) was used to classify plants into five species-specific size classes. Demographic changes within these two populations were followed from 1995 to 1999, and within segments (quartiles) along the water table gradient and the peat productivity gradient. 2. Mortality was strongly size dependent, and varied between years, for both species; it was high for seedlings, low for the smallest mature rosettes and increased again for the largest mature rosettes. The proportion of fertile rosettes increased with increasing rosette size. Fecundity varied considerably between years, but little relative to gradient position. 3. Growth rate (λ) was > 1, except in the second year, when it fell to 0.572 for D. anglica and 0.627 for D. rotundifolia. For D. anglica small, but significant, differences were found between the two extremities of the water table gradient, and for D. rotundifolia between the second and the uppermost quartile. There was a tendency for D. anglica populations to have a lower growth rate in the most productive sites, whereas D. rotundifolia grew less on both low and high peat productivity. Elasticity analysis showed that stasis and size increase (primarily within mature stages) made major contributions to λ for D. anglica in all years. 4. The variance in population growth rate (var λ) was high between years, and higher for D. anglica than for D. rotundifolia, while the variance between quartiles along the two main gradients was low. Life-table response experiment (LTRE) analyses revealed that for both species, differences in probabilities of transitions within mature stages, and in growth to larger stages, contributed most to var λ. 5. The effects of global warming are uncertain: drier growing seasons would affect Drosera populations negatively, while initially positive responses to a wetter climate may be balanced by competition from increased Sphagnum growth.",27,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Bootstrapping | Demography | Elasticity analysis | Life-table response experiment analysis | Norway | Ombrotrophic bogs | Peatland | Population growth rate | Transition matrix modelling,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,85

The presence, concentration and composition of plant secondary compounds, which confer plant resistance to herbivores and pathogens, vary greatly both within and among individuals. Optimal defence theory predicts that plant tissues most closely tied to plant fitness should be most defended at the constitutive level, and that more expendable tissues should be inducible with damage. 2. We examined variation in glucosinolate content between leaves and petals, as well as among four petal colour morphs of wild radish, Raphanus sativus. We predicted greater levels of constitutive defences in petals, and greater inducibility of glucosinolates in leaves, based on previous studies that could relate leaves and petals to plant fitness. 3. While, overall, optimal defence predictions were supported, individual glucosinolates differed in both their degree of inducibility as well as in their distribution between tissue types. 4. Petal colour variants differed in their induced responses to damage, but not in their constitutive levels of compounds. Yellow and white morphs, which are preferred by the dominant bee pollinators as well as by herbivores, were generally less inducible than anthocynanin-containing pink and bronze petal morphs. 5.

When effects were present, neighbouring vegetation reduced plant growth and survival, and insect herbivores decreased relative biomass allocation to roots and increased plant mortality. 4 Although reduced herbivory caused by insecticide application had little direct effects on plant biomass, it did interact with competition to affect growth for three of the four species. Herbivory reduced the strength of competition experienced by Coreopsis, but increased it in Linum. For both Coreopsis and Helianthus, the combined effects of herbivory and competition on plant growth were less than expected from a simple multiplicative response. 5 We suggest that interactions were found because we used an experimental design that modified insect densities on both neighbours and the focal plant, allowing for determination of both direct and indirect effects. 6 We suggest that the antagonistic interactions between competition and herbivory may have occurred because herbivores altered the competitive environment by harming the neighbouring plants, or because the presence of neighbours facilitated focal plant growth by distributing herbivore loads over the greater amount of plant biomass available. 7 Although as an isolated factor competition is more intense in this system than insect herbivory, herbivory can alter the strength of competitive interactions and thus its importance cannot be determined by measuring intensity alone. This result emphasizes that these two ecological processes are not truly discrete, and further suggests that studies that simultaneously manipulate multiple ecological processes are needed.",49,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Antagonistic interactions | Competition | Herbivory | Indirect effects | Intensity vs. importance,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,88

Circular vector algebra allowed species to be grouped into annual (34 species), supra-annual (3), irregular (7), and continuous (13) reproducers. 2 Wind- and gravity-dispersed species had extended fruiting periods coinciding with the typhoon season (July to November), whereas fleshy fruited trees showed peaks matching those of solar irradiance. Most species flowered at the beginning and fruited at the end of the first peak (April), or they flowered during the first peak and fruited during the second peak (September), indicating that solar irradiance may be a strong selective factor in shaping community-wide phenology patterns. 3 An El Niño and a La Niña climate anomaly occurred during the study period. Principal component analysis showed that 95% of intraspecific variation of flowering and fruiting dates could be explained by delayed or advanced flowering and fruiting of a limited number of species. Mast-fruiting of dipterocarp species could not be correlated with El Niño and La Niña events. 4 Large climate-induced variation in phenology was demonstrated for the percentage of trees that reproduce, while the timing of phenology remained unaffected for most species, suggesting that climatic factors are not directly responsible for triggering and synchronization of phenological events.",86,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Abiotic factors | Dispersal syndromes | Reproductive phenology,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,89

Revegetation of gaps may affect the floristic composition of subalpine grasslands during secondary succession. Six hypotheses concerning overall effects, gap-size and edge effects, and changes in these during secondary succession, are tested using principal response curves (PRCs), a recent derivative of partial redundancy analysis. 2. In a field experiment, large (625 cm2) and small (39 cm2) gaps and controls were established in a replicated successional series (0, 10 and 40 years after abandonment). Colonization modes were quantified in year 1, and the floristic composition was monitored twice yearly over four growing seasons. 3. Micro-successions in gaps account for 8.8-12.2% of the compositional variance. Size effects add 3.3-5.5% per successional stage, while edge effects appear only in the mid-successional stage (adding 1.6%). Seed colonization rates are comparable with those observed in temperate systems, and the effects on community composition are considerable (initial gap response, size effect). In contrast, changes in local competitive regimes have weaker effects (revegetation dynamics after the first year, edge effects). This may be attributed to the slow growth rates of alpine plants and the short growing season in subalpine climates, as well as to the infertile soils of the semi-natural grasslands. 4. A majority (74%) of the species are affected by gaps, but their responses are not consistent across successional stages. Species that recruit into gaps primarily as seedlings, and locally rare species, become relatively more dependent on gaps for local population persistence during succession. 5. These experiments give insight into the effects of gap revegetation processes for community composition and population persistence in these perennial grasslands. During secondary succession, changes in disturbance regime affect the gap revegetation processes and the probability for local population persistence for gap-enhanced species.",37,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Competition | Disturbance | Edge effect | Gap revegetation | Ordination | Principal response curves | Secondary succession | Size effect,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,90

Habitat fragmentation and the resulting decline in population size can affect biotic interactions and reproductive success of plant species.

Although habitat type accounted for significant variation in population size, we did not find any relation between habitat type and either reproductive and vegetative characteristics. Population size, however, strongly affected reproductive success, such that plants in small populations produced significantly fewer fruits per plant and seeds per fruit, and therefore fewer seeds per plant. 3. No significant difference was found between morph types for any reproductive characteristic, nor an interaction with population size. However, when morph frequency was strongly biased (≥ 1:3), the proportion of flowers setting fruit and the number of seeds per fruit were significantly lower in individuals of the common morph type. 4. Within populations, individual plants varied tremendously in size and floral display. Total number of fruits per plant significantly increased with floral display, but the highest fruit set per flower was found at intermediate flower number. 5. The proportion of fruit suffering pre-dispersal predation per plant significantly increased with floral display, but this did not offset the potential fitness gains of producing a large display. Furthermore, the absolute number of predated fruits per plant was significantly and positively affected by the interaction of the total number of fruits per plant and the density of the population.",107,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,Distyly | Floral display | Fruit predation | Morph bias | Pollinator limitation | Reproduction,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,91

Plants of the two sexual systems exhibit divergent life-history characters associated with the disturbed vs. competitive habitats in which monoecious and dioecious populations occur, respectively. We evaluated the prediction that populations of the two sexual systems would have different patterns of phenotypic plasticity because of the contrasting habitats in which they occur. 3 We grew four clonal replicates of 10 genotypes from seven monoecious and five dioecious populations (total = 480 plants) in two fertilizer treatments under glasshouse conditions and measured components of life history, leaf and flower morphology, and sex allocation. 4 The two sexual systems displayed divergent patterns of plasticity for four life-history traits but only flowering time and ramet production showed the expected pattern of greater plasticity in monoecious populations, and the reverse was true for flower production. Fertilization had opposite effects in the two sexual systems for corm production (increased in monoecious populations) and time to flowering (delayed in dioecious populations). 5 Leaf size generally increased due to the addition of fertilizer; however, this increase was substantially greater in dioecious populations. Larger leaf size in dioecious populations was associated with more convex leaves and greater surface area, potentially increasing light capture in the shaded and more competitive habitats in which these populations occur. 6 We found significant plasticity for female sex allocation in monoecious populations, with more female flowers at higher nutrient levels.

Avena barbata occurs as two multilocus allozyme genotypes associated with moist (mesic) and dry (xeric) habitats in California. We examined the divergence of quantitative traits between these genotypes, and heritable trait variation in the progeny of a cross. 2. A replacement series showed that the mesic genotype was competitively superior to the xeric. Early germination could alter this competitive outcome, but there was very little difference between the genotypes in germination time. 3. The mesic genotype exhibited larger seeds, and seedlings, as well as greater fecundity. However, there was no difference in relative growth rate between the genotypes. Thus the early size advantage of the mesic genotype seems to be due primarily to larger seed size. 4. Seedlings of the xeric genotype expressed a greater root mass ratio (RMR), and allocated a higher fraction of their root mass deeper in the soil when grown in artificial soil columns than did the mesic genotype. 5. We crossed the two genotypes and allowed the F1 to propagate by self-fertilization to yield F3 families. There was significant among-family (i.e. genetic) variation in RMR, root mass allocation by depth, and seed size. F3 families did not vary significantly in rooting depth per unit shoot mass. 6. In a competition experiment similar to that above, there was significant variation among F3 families in fecundity, but not dry mass, and family by competitor interactions were not significant. 7. There was little correlation among traits across F3 family means, indicating no common genetic basis to the traits. This suggests that novel combinations of characters can be created through crossing between genetically diverged populations. In addition, there was a significant family by block (environment) interaction for RMR, indicating that the degree of plasticity in this character has heritable variation that can respond to natural selection.",25,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Competition | Ecotype | Genetic correlation | Heritability | Root allocation,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,97
