Mud-shrimps were collected in three similar sites that differ in grain size and in the anthropogenic organic matter enrichment. Four-hundred-nine mud-shrimps were collected; the largest abundance was registered in the organically enriched site, but they were significantly smaller and more heavily parasited than the animals from the site lacking such organic enrichment. The size of the parasite is clearly dependent on the size of the mud-shrimp.

Some differences were found in the distribution (presence or absence) of the variants (some of them private) of the GOT, PEPA, RH, TF and TPI loci when the results reported here were compared with those of the Bribris and Cabecars that inhabit in the Pacific side of the country. Admixture with non-Indians was detected at the ABO, ADA, and G6PD loci. The proportion of polymorphic loci (P) found were 17.1 in the Bribris and 19.4 in the Cabecars; their average heterozygosites (H) estimates were 0.039 and 0.049 respectively. Fst values (0.019 in the Bribris and 0.056 in the Cabecars) seem to indicate that random events have played important roles in the divergence of the Cabecars. Low effective population sizes of the emigrant groups to the Pacific side and probable gene flow in the case of the Bribris, could be the cause of these differences.",7,1844158,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,2
