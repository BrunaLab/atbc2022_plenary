Species often compete for breeding sites in heterogeneous landscapes consisting of sources and sinks. To understand how the presence or absence of sink breeding sites influence ecological outcomes, we extend Pulliam's source-sink model to competing species. 2. In a homogeneous landscape consisting of source sites, we prove that one species, the 'superior' competitor, competitively excludes the other. Dominance is determined by a simple rule: the species that at equilibrium acquires new breeding sites at a faster rate dominates. 3. We prove that the inclusion of sink sites can alter this ecological outcome by either mediating coexistence, reversing competitive dominance, or facilitating a priority effect. 4. Sink-mediated coexistence requires the species to exhibit asymmetries in acquiring sink sites, the 'inferior' species to have a competitive advantage on sink sites and the ratio of sink to source sites be sufficiently low. 5. For example, if the sink breeding sites are competitive refuges for the 'inferior' competitor and not too low in quality, coexistence occurs if the number of sink sites lies below a threshold. Alternatively, when the number of sink sites exceeds this threshold, competitive dominance is reversed and the 'superior' competitor is displaced. 6. Counter-intuitively, despite being unable to support species in isolation, sink habitats embedded in a geographical mosaic of sources and sinks can enhance biodiversity by mediating coexistence or alter species composition by reversing competitive interactions. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",13,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Competition | Population dynamics | Sink-mediated coexistence,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,1

We incorporated spatial data on swift foxes (Vulpes velox) with genetic analysis to assess the influence of relatedness between individuals on their social and spatial ecology. We recorded the space use patterns of 188 radio-collared swift foxes in south-eastern Colorado from January 1997 to December 2000. One hundred and sixty-seven foxes were also genotyped at 11 microsatellite DNA loci and the degree of relatedness between individuals was estimated. 2. We described the genetic structure of the population by examining the relatedness of neighbours and the relationship between the spatial and genetic distance of all individuals. We found that close kin appeared to cluster within the population. Neighbours were significantly more related (mean R = 0.089 ± 0.01) than non-neighbours (mean R = 0.003 ± 0.01; randomization test, P < 0.0002). Female clusters were more extensive than male clusters. 3. The degree of genetic relatedness among foxes was useful in explaining why foxes tolerated encroachment of their home ranges by neighbours; the more closely related neighbours were, the more home-range overlap they tolerated (Mantel test, P = 0.0004). Foxes did not appear to orientate their home ranges to avoid neighbours and home ranges overlapped by as much as 54.77% (x = 14.13% ± 0.41). Neighbours also occasionally engaged in concurrent den sharing. 4. Relatedness influenced the likelihood that an individual would inherit a newly vacated home range, with a mean relatedness of range inheritors to previous owners of 0.333 ± 0.074. Thus, the genetic structure of the population and interactions between kin were interrelated to space-use patterns and social ecology of the swift fox. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",42,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Kin clusters | Relatedness | Social tolerance | Space use patterns | Swift fox,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,2

Habitat complexity may stabilize interactions among species of different trophic levels by providing refuges to organisms of lower trophic levels. 2. Searching behaviour of the parasitoid, Diadegma semiclausum, was followed in different semifield set-ups, a low and high-density monoculture of Brassica oleracea and two intercrops, B. oleracea with Sinapis alba (also a member of the Brassicaceae) and B. oleracea with Hordeum vulgare (Poaceae). 3. When a low-density monocrop of B. oleracea was compared with a high-density monocrop, no differences were found in the ability of the female wasps to locate a host-infested plant, B. oleracea, infested with Plutella xylostella that was placed in the centre of the set-up. 4. The efficiency of the parasitoid to locate the host-infested plant was differentially affected by the species composition of the vegetation. Wasps entered the Sinapis-Brassica set-up faster, but took more time to find the host-infested plant than in the Hordeum-Brassica set-up. 5. The horizontal arrangement, i.e. by mixing S. alba or H. vulgare with, or placing them as rows between B. oleracea, did not affect host-finding efficiency. 6. Plant height did influence host finding. Wasps found the host-infested plants earlier in the set-up with short Sinapis plants compared with tall Sinapis plants. 7. Once the wasps had landed on the host-infested plant, the surrounding vegetation did not affect time needed to parasitize five consecutive hosts on the same infested plant, regardless of the composition or horizontal/vertical arrangement of the set-up. 8.

Ungulates are viewed as being highly susceptible to predation during the initial weeks or months of life. Yet aggressive defence by adult females is common in many ungulates and has the potential to reduce the vulnerability of the young significantly. 2. We observed naturally occurring predatory encounters between coyotes Canis latrans Say and deer fawns to test the hypothesis that a difference in aggressive defence leads to the differential vulnerability of mule deer Odocoileus hemionus Rafinesque and white-tailed deer O. virginianus Zimmermann fawns in summer, when fawns are 0-14 weeks in age. Whitetail fawns suffer higher levels of coyote predation than do mule deer fawns at that time. The two species of deer are similar in size, but are known to differ in their antipredator behaviour in winter when fawns are older. 3. Coyotes were less likely to attack mule deer than whitetail fawns they encountered, and were less likely to kill mule deer than whitetail fawns they attacked. 4. The presence of a mule deer, but not a whitetail, female with a fawn deterred coyotes from attacking the fawn. Once attacked, fawns of both species were less likely to be killed when females defended them, but mule deer females were far more likely to defend fawns. 5. Mule deer females defended fawns that were not their own offspring, including heterospecific fawns. Mule deer fawns were more likely to be defended if they had a larger number of females nearby when encountered. These observations raise the possibility that mule deer, and even whitetail, fawns may have improved survival in areas with higher densities of mule deer females. 6. These results show that higher levels of defence by mule deer females reduced the vulnerability of mule deer fawns, contributing to the lower predation rates reported for mule deer than for whitetail fawns of this age group. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",51,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Aggressive defence | Cooperation | Predation risk | Temporal variation | Vulnerability,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,4

To minimize study-area artefacts in a study of natal dispersal distances in tree swallows, we intensively banded nestlings and adults in nest-boxes in upstate New York and recruited and trained 70 volunteer banders within a 400 km radius of Ithaca. We banded 26 567 nestlings in the years 1985 through 1998, and captured 4774 adults at the nest, 630 of which had been banded as nestlings and were recaptured the year after fledging. 2. To correct for spatial variation in capture intensity, we resampled the distribution of all boxes where an adult capture was made under uniform, exponential and Cauchy null hypotheses. Compared to the null distributions, the frequency of observed dispersal events was significantly higher at 0-10 km and lower for all larger dispersal distances. The Cauchy distribution came closest to approximating the observed dispersal distance distribution. 3. Dispersal distances were sensitive to the distribution of nesting sites, and all measurements of dispersal distance distributions must be seen as being habitat-specific. We could detect no effect of dispersal distance on the subsequent timing of breeding and no effect of the timing of fledging on dispersal distance. The sexual differences in raw mean dispersal distances (8·38 km for females, 2·44 km for males) are similar to those reported for other species. 4. While it is tempting to conclude that studies in smaller areas have not missed a great deal, even a study area of 10 km extent (substantially larger than most) would have missed 11% of the dispersing birds detected and 95% of the range of distances recorded. Despite this sizeable component that would have been missed with a smaller study area, the relatively low frequencies of long-distance dispersal overall reinforce the conclusion that tree swallows, and probably most other migratory passerines, generally disperse much less far from their natal sites than the distances of their annual migrations might lead one to expect. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",69,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Bird | Dispersal distance distribution | Life history | Natal dispersal | Swallow,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,5

The functional response of post-dispersal seed predators (house mouse, Mus musculus) to absolute densities of southern beech seed (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) was studied in laboratory and field trials. House mice showed a Type II (hyperbolic) functional response to seed availability and this was not modified by the presence of an alternative food source. 2. Maximum daily intake rate of beech seeds during field trials averaged 1042 seeds mouse(-1). This is sufficient to provide house mice with both the energy and protein required for growth and reproduction. 3. We explicitly incorporated the functional response into the numerical response of house mice to beech seed, measured for field populations monitored in a New Zealand beech forest. House mice showed a strong numerical response to beech seed intake rate that was modified by some density-dependent mechanism(s). 4. We developed a model that simulated seedfall, house mouse population growth and seed reserve depletion over one year. We found that the previously reported decline in house-mouse populations in beech forests during spring and summer is likely to be related to spring beech seed germination that renders seed no longer available as a food source for house mice. 5. From our simulation model it does not appear that house-mouse populations can completely eat-out beech seed reserves prior to germination in a year of large seedfall. 'Masting' behaviour in New Zealand native beech trees is therefore sufficient to satiate an eruptive population of an exotic mammalian omnivore, despite the lack of a long co-evolutionary interaction. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",43,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Mus musculus | Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides | Predator satiation | Simulation model,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,6

Top-down control of trophic structure is often highly variable both within and among ecosystems. We explored the roles of relative body sizes of predators and prey, their metabolic types, the production-to-biomass ratio (P : B) of plants, and system productivity in determining the strength of the indirect effects of predators on plants. 2. We used a well-studied food chain model with three trophic levels that is parameterized based on allometric relationships for rates of ingestion and metabolic efficiency. The model predicts that invertebrate and ectotherm predators and herbivores should propagate cascades to a greater degree than vertebrates and endotherms because of their higher metabolic efficiency. 3. Increasing the herbivore-to-plant body-size ratio strengthened the effects of cascades, while predator body-size was predicted to have no effect. Increasing system productivity or plant P : B magnified cascades. Because herbivore : plant body size ratios and plant P : B are both generally greater in aquatic than terrestrial systems (especially those with unicellular producers), the model predicts stronger cascades in water than on land. This prediction is supported by a recent cross-system comparison of trophic cascade experiments. 4.

Dispersal of parents and offspring in relation to manipulated brood size were analysed in the great tit Parus major (L.) to study the potential confusion between dispersal and survival. The study area consisted of eight woodlots interspersed with nonbreeding habitat. The maximum distance between nestboxes was 10 km. 2. The brood size of pairs with similar clutch size and laying date was manipulated in 3 years when chicks were 2 days old (1995, 1997 and 1998). Three nestlings were removed from one and added to another brood while a third was kept as a control. Offspring were measured, weighed and marked and breeding birds were captured and marked to allow dispersal estimates. 3. For the offspring, dispersal was estimated as the distance between the natal nestbox and the nestbox of first breeding (natal dispersal distance) and, for the parents, as the distance between breeding boxes in two subsequent seasons (breeding dispersal distance). 4. Natal dispersal distance was positively affected by brood size manipulation. This effect was more pronounced in males than in females. Breeding dispersal distance was not affected by manipulation. 5. The practical consequence of this finding is that fitness estimates used to measure selection on brood size did depend on the spatial scale of the study area. For the Lauwersmeer population measured selection pressure changed from positive to stabilizing when I restricted the spatial scale of recovery. Other brood size manipulation experiments may suffer from similar biases in their fitness estimates. 6. The biological consequence of this finding is that, if clutch size has a heritable component, local adaptation of clutch size will depend on the spatial heterogeneity of the habitat. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",41,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Brood size manipulation | Dispersal | Fitness | Parus major | Selection,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,8

We examined the influence of helpers on reproductive success in the apostlebird using data gathered over three breeding seasons (116 nests, 34 breeding groups). Initially, annual productivity and individual components of reproductive success were examined in relation to group size (two to 17 birds). The effect of helping per se was then examined in a reduced data set by comparing (a) the predictive power of group size and actual helper numbers, and/or (b) the productivity of groups that changed in size between nests or seasons. 2. Group size was positively and linearly related to annual fledgling production and the number of offspring that survived to the following season. This was attributed to the presence of helpers, as the number of birds that fed nestlings, but not group size, was significantly related to annual fledging success. Neither group size nor helper number influenced fledgling survival over the subsequent winter. 3. The probability of re-nesting after a successful first brood increased with group size. Among double-brooded groups, the interval between nests was inversely related to group size. 4. Clutch size increased linearly with group size among groups with two to five birds, but was not related to group size among larger groups. A matched comparison of groups that changed size between years further suggests that clutch size was facultatively adjusted to group size, a phenomenon rarely reported in species with non-breeding helpers. 5. Hatching success was not related to group size or the number of birds participating in incubation. 6. The number of birds provisioning the brood was a better predictor of feeding rate per chick than group size, and was significantly and inversely related to the incidence of nestling starvation. However, there was no relationship between group size and fledgling body mass. 7. Fledging success per brood increased linearly among groups with three to five members. The only case of pair-breeding was unsuccessful, suggesting that this species is one of only a few birds that may be obligately cooperative. 8.

Plants and insects are part of a complex multitrophic environment, in which they closely interact. However, most of the studies have been focused mainly on bi-tritrophic above-ground subsystems, hindering our understanding of the processes that affect multitrophic interactions in a more realistic framework. 2. We studied whether root herbivory by the fly Delia radicum can influence the development of the leaf feeder Pieris brassicae, its parasitoid Cotesia glomerata and its hyperparasitoid Lysibia nana, through changes in primary and secondary plant compounds. 3. In the presence of root herbivory, the development time of the leaf herbivore and the parasitoid significantly increased, and the adult size of the parasitoid and the hyperparasitoid were significantly reduced. The effects were stronger at low root fly densities than at high densities. 4. Higher glucosinolate (sinigrin) levels were recorded in plants exposed to below-ground herbivory, suggesting that the reduced performance of the above-ground insects was via reduced plant quality. Sinigrin contents were highest in plants exposed to low root fly densities, intermediate in plants exposed to high root fly densities and lowest in plants that were not exposed to root herbivory. 5. Our results show, for the first time, that root herbivory via changes in plant quality can reduce the performance of an above-ground multitrophic level food chain.

Compared with most terrestrial data sets used in development of theoretical models, what characterizes data sets from marine soft sediments is that they have a very high number of species. Marine data also show large numbers of rare species, even if the extent of the study is greatly increased from a few square metres to hundreds of square kilometres. 2. Fitting log-normal distributions to data on species abundance distributions (SADs) for marine benthic assemblages from the continental shelf of Norway, and for the well-studied tropical tree data of Barro Colorado Island, Panama (BCI), show patterns suggesting that more than one log-normal distribution occurs. 3. We have developed a simple model of SADs comprising two groups of log-normally distributed species, a group of rare species and a group of common species. The model appears to fit the marine data and also applies to the BCI tropical tree data and yet is simpler than Hubbell's Zero-Sum Multinomial (ZSM) distribution model. 4. The plots of the model results show that the marine data are dominated by the rare group of species at all scales studied. In the tropical tree assemblage a similar pattern to that in the marine data is apparent only at small spatial scales (5 and 10 ha), but not at the larger extent (25-50 ha). It is important to note, however, that marine data at all the scales studied are samples from a given area, whereas the terrestrial data are exact counts of all species of tree within the total 50 ha plot studied. 5. Most ecological data are likely to be based on samples rather than exact counts so the patterns found with the marine data are likely to be common, and our findings general ones. 6. A biological explanation for the two-group log-normal model is that recruitment of rare species from outside the studied area dominates benthic assemblages of soft sediments at all sampled scales. Within the tropical forest the dominance of recruitment processes are only apparent at small scales. 7.

Data on soft-sediment macrobenthos from the Norwegian continental shelf (56-71°N) was used to examine the use of average taxonomic distinctness (Δ+, a measure of the average degree to which species are related to each other) as a diversity measure. 2. Δ+ for all taxa combined decreased with both latitude and depth. In contrast Δ+ for annelids and crustaceans (71% of the fauna) was positively correlated to latitude and depth, whereas molluscs (20.1% of the fauna) were not related to latitude or depth. Depth explained most of the variance in Δ+ for annelids and crustaceans. Neither latitude nor grain size appeared to be important in explaining large-scale patterns in the taxonomic breadth of the three dominant phyla. In contrast latitude rather than depth explained most of the variance in Δ+ of all taxa combined. 3. The finding that molluscs showed different patterns of Δ+ than the two other dominant phyla shows that the biodiversity of different phyla responded differently to environmental gradients and that one phylum cannot be used as a surrogate for others in such studies. The most likely explanation for the inconsistency in Δ+ is because the taxonomic classification system also varies between different phyla, and taxonomically related biodiversity measures might be more meaningfully applied to a single phylum than to all taxa combined. 4. Δ+ and species richness (S) displayed different patterns of biodiversity. Thus Δ+ is not a surrogate for species richness. Species richness of all taxa combined and annelids were highest in the middle depth range, and lowest in the shallowest and deepest parts of the shelf. Most of the variance in species richness is accounted for by depth, followed by latitude and grain size for all three dominant phyla and all taxa combined. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",88,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Environmental variables | Latitude | Marine biodiversity | Soft-sediment communities | Taxonomic distinctness,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,14

A major hypothesis of life history theory is that early development conditions affect future survival and reproductive success. However, although a growing number of studies have addressed this question, many of them are taxonomically biased, thereby impeding the generalization of this hypothesis. 2. This study examines the factors influencing post-weaning survival in five weaned cohorts of subantarctic fur seal pups from Amsterdam Island, southern Indian Ocean. It used mark-recapture data from 7 consecutive years of different environmental conditions. 3. The cohort return rate varied from 45% to 74% of weaned pups, depending on the year of weaning. In each cohort, 96% of weaned pups returned between 3 and 6 years of age, and none of the factors examined seemed to influence this timing pattern. The probability of survival to this first return was negatively related to sea-surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) of the 6 months following the weaning process. It increased with pup preweaning growth rate and differed between the sexes. Females' survival rate was significantly higher than males', except during years of extreme SSTa, where no difference was detected. 4. The juvenile state represented young individuals after their first return on their native island. Annual juvenile tag loss rate was constant at 0.217 (SE = 0.027), whereas temporary emigration rate varied over cohorts and was higher in males 0.423 (SE = 0.035) than in females 0.170 (SE = 0.012). This dispersion pattern may be prolonged in some cases, as the yearly immigration probability was constant at 0.290 (SE = 0.065). 5. Taking into account tag loss and temporary emigration, the estimated yearly survival probability of juveniles was 0.964 (SE = 0.022). This value was unrelated to any tested oceanographic or individual parameter including sex. 6. Results support the hypothesis that early development traits affect short-term post-weaning survival. However, no long-term effect of maternal postnatal investment was detected after the first return to the native island. Results also indicate that the effect of early development traits on survival interacts with environmental conditions encountered shortly after independence of individuals. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",76,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Early development | Multistate mark-recapture models | Post-lactating survival | Sea surface temperature anomalies | Temporary emigration,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,16

Aposematism is an antipredatory strategy in which prey animals conspicuously signal their noxiousness to potential predators. This successful strategy is based on avoidance learning of predators. 2. Most species in the viperid genus Vipera have a characteristic dorsal zigzag pattern. It has previously been suggested that the dorsal zigzag pattern of Vipera berus (the adder) has a cryptic function and thus makes the snake less conspicuous to avian predators. However, a recent experiment suggested that the pattern may function as an aposematic signal rather than being cryptic, and therefore induces active avoidance in avian predators. 3. We conducted a field experiment in Dõana national park in Spain, testing whether the zigzag pattern gives survival value to Vipera latastei gaditana against avian predators. We used two sizes of plasticine models with a zigzag pattern vs. without a zigzag pattern to record attacks by avian predators. The background was controlled (white vs. natural) to exclude the possibility that one morph would be more cryptic to predators than the other one. We also tested size-dependent mortality against the signalling and nonsignalling snakes as aposematic signal is expected to enhance the survival of the aposematic species in a size-dependent manner. 4. Predation pressure against snakes was severe, and on average 39% of models were attacked. Coloration did not enhance the survival of juvenile-sized zigzag-patterned snakes, but significantly increased the survival of adult-sized zigzag-patterned snakes on both backgrounds. 5.

Graham & Lambin (2002) have reported on a weasel-reduction experiment, concluding that the impact of weasel predation on field vole survival was neither sufficient nor necessary to initiate and drive the cyclic decline of field vole populations in Kielder Forest, northern England. They also stated that their findings contradict conclusively the specialist predator hypothesis put forward to explain population cycles of voles in North Europe. 2. Straightforward inferences from Kielder Forest to the northern boreal zone are misleading, because the population cycles of voles in Kielder Forest differ essentially from North European vole cycles. The low amplitude of the vole cycles in Kielder Forest, their restricted spatial synchrony in comparison to northern Europe and the virtual lack of interspecific synchrony in Kielder Forest suggest that there are essential differences between the mechanisms responsible for the two types of cyclic fluctuations of voles. 3. The weasel-reduction experiment may provide a misleading picture on the role of predators, even in the Kielder Forest cycle. The experimental reduction of weasels alone may not stop the population decline of voles, because competing larger predators are expected to increase their hunting in the weasel-reduction areas. The small spatial scale of the experiment, which produced only slight, short-term differences in weasel densities between reduction and control areas, also suggests that other predators could have compensated easily for the weasels that were removed. 4. We propose a new version of the predation hypothesis to explain low-amplitude population cycles of voles in temperate Europe, including the Kielder Forest. The interaction between generalist predators and vole populations might account for these cycles because generalists can have a functional response that is destabilizing in the neighbourhood of the equilibrium point. As most generalists are orders of magnitude larger than weasels, and thus need much more food for survival, generalist-driven cycles should be characterized by high prey minima, as observed in Kielder Forest. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",64,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Functional response | Generalist predators | Herbivores | Population cycles | Specialist predators,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,18

Consumer-resource interactions may be modified by complex environmental interactions. We experimentally manipulated light, nutrients, consumer density (tailed frog tadpoles - Ascaphus truei), and enclosure sizes in two small and steep streams of coastal British Columbia, Canada. We used flow-through, screened enclosures in situ as experimental units and measured the responses of algae (as chlorophyll a), periphyton (ash-free dry mass) and growth rates of tailed frog tadpoles using a factorial model design. 2. Light exerted a strong, positive effect on algae and periphyton production with 30-40% higher biomass over shaded treatments, and a 14% higher relative growth rate of tadpoles. Nutrient additions had little to no effect on any measure, alone or in interaction with other factors. Tadpole growth, algae and periphyton standing crop were significantly reduced along a gradient of increasing consumer density. Enclosure size had a large effect on all three measures. 3. Algae and periphyton production were under simultaneous top-down (tadpole grazing) and bottom-up control (light); however, the relative importance of these effects was stream-dependent. At Klondike Creek algae and periphyton production was influenced primarily by grazing, and by light levels at Dipper Creek. 4. Mean growth rate of tadpoles was on average 45% higher at Klondike Creek than at Dipper Creek. Most of the effects of the abiotic treatments and consumer density interacted statistically with stream identity, despite these streams being very similar and < 6 km apart. The strong effect of stream on the outcomes may be a consequence of large temperature differences. 5. This study demonstrated that light, consumer density, stream, enclosure size and nutrients alone and in combination affected algae and periphyton production, and grazer growth rate.

To investigate the role of fish ecology in controlling terrestrial particulate organic matter (POM) uptake by benthic fish species and population responses to changes in continental inputs to coastal areas, depth distribution, diet and stable isotope (δ13C and δ15N) data from the juveniles and adults of five important flatfish species (Arnoglossus laterna, Buglossidium luteum, Citharus linguatula, Solea lascaris and S. solea) were compared off the Rhone River delta (NW Mediterranean). 2. In moderate river discharge, isotopic signatures differed with fish species and benthic life stage, suggesting intra- and interspecific differences in trophic levels and food sources. Food web analysis indicated terrestrial POM uptake in all life stages of S. solea and A. laterna (δ13C = - 20.1 to -20.0‰ and -18.9 to -18.2‰, respectively), in the adults of B. luteum (δ13C = -19.0‰) and in the juveniles of S. lascaris (δ13C = -18.7‰), whereas all life stages of C. linguatula (δ13C = -17.6‰), S. lascaris adults (δ13C = -16.9‰) and B. luteum juveniles (δ13C = -17.5‰) exploited marine POM almost exclusively. 3. Fish diet and depth distribution accounted fully for the intra- and interspecific differences in terrestrial POM uptake observed. Greater terrestrial signatures were observed in fish eating larger quantities of deposit-feeding polychaetes (the main prey exploiting terrestrial POM for growth) and occurring mainly in the 30-50 m depth zone (where river POM sedimentation and its uptake by the benthos were the highest). Due to intra- and interspecific differences in fish depth distribution and diet, Rhone River floods were predicted to have little effect on C. linguatula populations but to increase the other four species' local stocks for several years, with a maximum impact on S. solea. 4. This study shows that the ability of benthic fish to exploit terrestrial POM inputs to the coastal zone depends strongly on their ecology.

The ecological factors that promote delayed dispersal of offspring in cooperatively breeding bird species are poorly understood. While single population studies have supported the view that natal dispersal is delayed as a consequence of lack of suitable breeding vacancies (ecological constraints hypothesis), recent theoretical models claim that habitat saturation cannot be the main factor leading to kin sociality. 2. The carrion crow (Corvus corone ssp.) is an ideal model to investigate the ecology of delayed dispersal. The occurrence of kin sociality is highly variable among European populations, and it is known to be determined by environmental rather than genetic factors. Here we compare juvenile dispersal, territory turnover, habitat saturation (number of competitors per breeding vacancy), variability of territory quality and territoriality of two crow populations that differ in social organization (extensive kin sociality in Spain vs. social monogamy in Italy). 3. We found that philopatry occurred in the less competitive and less variable environment. A review of the information available in literature on other crow populations qualitatively supports this result. 4. In crows, juvenile philopatry seemed to be associated with breeders' year-round residency in territories. This association is widespread among birds and it has been previously explained through an ecological constraints perspective, with residency slowing territory turnover and therefore augmenting saturation. Our data do not support this explanation. 5. We suggest that year-round residency might play a direct role in determining kin sociality in crows. In Spain, adults occupy and defend the territory year-round, providing the offspring with a place where they enjoy a preferential access to resources that may represent an incentive to stay. Conversely in Italy, where adults often abandon their territories after breeding, the natal site does not have any special value for the offspring that hence disperse. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",55,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Benefits of philopatry | Corvus corone | Ecological constraints | Social behaviour,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,21

The hypothesis that multiple infections might disrupt or alter the density-dependent processes regulating a host-pathogen interaction is explored using time series from a well-known laboratory insect-pathogen model system. 2. We compare the population dynamics of the same host (Plodia interpunctella) infected with a single (granulovirus) or multiple (granulovirus and nucleopolyhedrovirus) pathogens and show how the dynamical fluctuations are altered by the presence of this second pathogen. 3. Using a maximum likelihood-based approach, we explore the density-dependent mechanisms underpinning the host-pathogen interaction. These regulatory processes differ between single and multiple infections. In singly infected systems, the density-dependent mechanisms of regulation operate through birth rate while in doubly infected systems, density dependence is mediated through death rate. 4. Further, these deterministic dynamics are modulated by the effects of demographic stochasticity. This stochastic process, the overall sum of individual probabilities of births, deaths and infection influence the changes in population size. In the Plodia-granulovirus system, nonlinear density-dependent births coupled with demographic noise is the necessary prerequisite for the observed dynamics. In the multiple infection system, noise acts together with disease transmission and mortality to affect the population dynamics. 5. We discuss the implication of these differing regulatory processes in the different-sized species assemblages in the presence of noise for understanding the ecologies of host-pathogen interactions. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",9,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Baculoviruses | Diseases | Maximum likelihood | Model choice | Model selection | Population dynamics | Time series,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,22

Comparatively low levels of population change in drier and wetter sites ranged over two orders of magnitude. 3. Time-series analysis revealed best fit models of population change that included total winter precipitation from October to May and/or cumulative Pearson Drought Severity Index (PDSI) for the same period, plus a 1-year delay in precipitation or PDSI in some cases. 4. For populations on willow clones in drier sites, the model accounted for 73% of sawfly population change, and in wetter sites, with high mean populations, the model predicted 67% of the variation in gall density. 5. The mechanistic link between predictors of water availability to host plants and sawfly populations was better growth of willow after high winter precipitation, producing more and longer shoots. Also, willow clones with younger ramets, with more vigorous growth, were more favourable to sawflies than clones with older ramets. 6. Strong female preference for longer shoots resulted in more eggs laid, and this was coupled with higher larval survival on longer shoots. The major component of loss in a cohort was aborted ovipositions, with significant and negative influence on survival through the immature stages.

Two common species of acorn barnacle, Chthamalus montagui and C. stellatus, with similar resource needs, occur together on rocky shores of NW Europe but differ in their adult distribution over two environmental gradients, wave exposure and vertical height on the shore. 2. A sampling programme was undertaken over 2 years to determine the causal mechanisms of this differential distribution. Three alternative, although not mutually exclusive, models were tested: first, adult distribution is determined at settlement as a direct result of differential larval supply; secondly, adult distribution is determined at settlement as a result of larval choice rather than differential larval supply; and thirdly, settlement occurs homogeneously over the two gradients and the adult pattern is set by differential post-settlement mortality. 3. Near-shore larval abundance in the water column over the gradient of wave exposure was determined at eight dates during the main settlement period in 2003. Larval production was assessed by quantifying early-stage larvae, while the supply of competent settlers to the adult habitat was determined by quantifying late-stage cyprid larvae. 4. The pattern of settlement of the two species was determined over both environmental gradients by daily sampling of the proportional abundance of C. stellatus and C. montagui settled cyprids at three tidal heights at exposed and sheltered shores. Differential post-settlement mortality was determined by quantifying day-old, week-old and up to 3 months-old metamorphosed individuals. 5. Larval production reflected the distribution of adults, with early-stage larvae of C. montagui predominating in shelter and C. stellatus in exposure. However, the supply of late-stage cyprid larvae to the near-shore area showed no difference in the proportion of each species over the wave-exposure gradient; differential larval supply was not responsible for dictating adult distribution. 6. Despite no differential supply of larvae, the pattern of settlement of the two species differed over both environmental gradients, with C. stellatus settling in greater proportions low on the shore and in exposure and C. montagui settlement predominating higher on the shore and in shelter.

Quantitative predictions of the effects of perturbations on communities of interacting species have often proved to be difficult. However, if precise predictions are not a requirement then qualitative models of community dynamics offer an alternative method for predicting species responses to perturbations. 2. We used two qualitative modelling approaches to predict the effects of predator control on the fledging rate of an endangered New Zealand bird, the North Island kokako. The first approach was based on loop analysis and provided predictions on the probable direction of change in species abundances to single species perturbations. The second approach, 'fuzzy interaction webs', used fuzzy logic in the framework of a fuzzy cognitive map to provide predictions on the probable magnitude of change in species abundances to perturbations. 3. Using both methods, we predicted the qualitative change in the equilibrium fledging rates of kokako under various regimes of single- and multispecies predator control (ship rats, brushtail possums and stoats). Single species control was insufficient to lift the fledging rate from 'low' to 'moderate'. However, simultaneous control of both ship rats and possums had the greatest influence on the fledging rates compared with any other combination as a result of the additional indirect effect of ship rat control on stoat abundance. 4. We propose qualitative modelling of community dynamics as a method suitable for predicting the effects of perturbations in complex ecological communities that can encapsulate diverse sources of knowledge about food web interactions. We believe that these methods are a useful set of heuristic tools that can be used to propose testable hypotheses about ecosystem functioning that can complement existing statistical and quantitative modelling approaches. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",41,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Food webs | Fuzzy cognitive maps | Fuzzy logic | Interaction strength | Kokako | Loop analysis,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,27

We found that variation in body size of the masked shrew in Alaska appears to contradict to the prediction of Bergmann's rule, decreasing in high latitudes and in areas cold January temperature. 4.

Previous studies of insect dynamics have detected spatial synchrony in intraspecific population dynamics up to, but not exceeding, 1000 km. Oddly, interspecific synchrony has recently been reported at distances well over 1000 km (at continental and circumpolar scales). While the authors implicated climatic effects as the cause for the apparent large-scale interspecific synchrony, there is no evidence that weather data are synchronized over such great distances. 2. In the present study, intraspecific circumpolar synchrony in the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), was tested for among 11 regions across three continents (North America, Europe and Asia). Analyses indicate that most gypsy moth populations around the world tend to oscillate at periodicities between 8 and 12 years. 3. These oscillations were synchronized at distances up to c. 1200 km within continents. There was no evidence for intraspecific synchrony of gypsy moth populations between continents. 4.

It is predicted that the movements of foraging animals are adjusted to the hierarchical spatial distribution of resources in the environment, and that decisions to modify movement in response to heterogeneous resource distribution are scale-dependent. Thus, controlling for spatial scales of interaction with environment is critical for a better understanding of habitat selection, which is likely to follow scale-dependent processes. 2. Here we study the scales of interactions and habitat selection in a long-ranging marine predator foraging from a central place, the yellow-nosed albatross. We use first-passage time analysis to identify the scales of interaction with environmental variables and compositional analysis to study habitat selection. 3. Of 26 birds, 22 adopted an area restricted search (ARS) at a scale of 130 ± 85 km, and 11 of these 22 birds adopted a second, nested ARS scale at 34 ± 20 km. Habitat use differed according to the spatial scale considered. At the oceanic basin macro-scale, birds foraged in pelagic, subtropical waters. Birds commuted to the ARS zones after a c. 1500-km trip to reach predictable turbulence zones from Agulhas return current, where primary productivity was enhanced at large scale. At a smaller, meso-scale, birds increased their search effort according to sea surface height anomalies (SSHa) and chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl-a), indicating association with productive cyclonic eddies. 4. Among birds, differences in search pattern were noted: 11 birds concentrated their search effort directly at a small scale of 77 ± 22 km, avoiding anticyclonic eddies. The 11 other birds showed two scales of ARS pattern: (i) first at 180 ± 90 km with a preference for high Chl-a concentrations but unrelated to SSHa; and (ii) secondly at a nested scale at 34± 20 km related exclusively to SSHa where prey patches were expected to be distributed at this scale. This second group of birds appeared to be less efficient, spending more time at sea for the same mass gain than the first group. 5.

Temporal and spatial variation can strongly affect life-history traits, but few studies to date have quantified the importance of the interplay between temporal and spatial components of population dynamics. 2. We analysed spatiotemporal variation in early survival of roe deer fawns over 15 years (1985-99) in an intensively monitored population in western France at two spatial scales: the maternal home range (a few tens of hectares) and the forest stand (a few hundreds of hectares). 3. Spatial variation in resource availability interacted with temporal variation to shape fawn survival. In good years, survival was not influenced by habitat quality (being 0.68 in the rich oak stand with hornbeam coppices vs. 0.64 in the poorer part of the reserve). At the home range scale, early survival of fawns during good years decreased with increasing occurrence of preferred plant species in the rich habitat; there was no effect in the poor habitat. 4. During bad years, however, there was a positive relationship between the occurrence of preferred plant species and survival of fawns in the poor habitat, whereas no relationship occurred in the rich habitat. Spatial variation in early survival during bad years was significant at the plot scale (from 0.19 to 0.40 in the poor habitat and from 0.49 to 0.61 in the rich habitat) even after accounting for the forest stand variations (from 0.27 to 0.51). The occurrence of key plant species therefore limits female reproductive success only in the poor habitat under harsh conditions. 5.

Individual animals optimize their body mass to enhance fitness and mass is expected to be optimized over both short and long time-scales. On the short time-scale small birds increase mass as they build up energy reserves over each day to avoid starving at night. Theory predicts that starvation risk should be minimized by gaining mass at the start of the day thus insuring against unpredictable food supply later. However, if predation risk is mass-dependent due to reduced escape flight performance, birds should delay mass gain until later in the day to minimize predation risk. 2. Regulation of mass change over longer time-scales has been well documented and a number of studies have been able to show that over weeks, months and years mass is regulated consistent with the starvation-predation risk trade-off being mass-dependent. However, it is crucial to mass-dependent predation theory that it functions over shorter time-scales as well and that birds are able to regulate their diurnal mass gain strategies in response to predation risk. This has not yet been investigated and recent studies of flight performance have been unable to show that small-scale mass change (< 10%) over short time-scales (e.g. diurnal mass change) affects escape flight performance as predicted. 3. We used a unique design of automated identification and weighing system that for the first time allowed the diurnal mass gain of individual great tits Parus major to be monitored remotely in the wild. While automatically tracking diurnal body mass changes of individuals we manipulated perceived predation risk by using model sparrowhawks. We were thus able to investigate experimentally the effect of increased perceived predation risk on diurnal mass gain patterns. 4. We show, for the first time, that birds are capable of manipulating their diurnal body mass gain strategy in response to heightened predation risk and that they do so by delaying mass gain until later in the day, as predicted by mass-dependent predation risk theory. Furthermore, the results are consistent with changing flight performance rather than changing exposure time to predators being the driving force for mass-dependent predation risk. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",71,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Diurnal mass change | Mass-dependent predation risk | Starvation-predation risk trade-off,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,32

In long-lived species, adult survival is an important life-history trait. Better knowledge of the effects of non-catastrophic climate variation on the adult survival of long-lived seabirds is therefore needed. However, documentation of such effects is still rare. 2. Using capture-mark-resighting data, we modelled the annual survival rates of five species of seabirds, the common guillemot (Uria aalge), Br̈nnich's guillemot (Uria lomvia), razorbill (Alca torda), Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) and black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla). The data spanned 14 years of observation at a colony on Hornøya, off Northern Norway in the western Barents Sea. 3. A method of taking into account ring-loss of marked individuals is proposed. This approach made it possible to keep many observations which otherwise would have to be discarded. 4. The estimated survival rates were higher and less variable than most estimates for the same species from other colonies. There was extensive resighting heterogeneity. Ignoring this effect would have underestimated breeding life span by more than 50% in some species. 5. The analysis presented is the first study to document a correlation between the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and adult survival in North Atlantic seabirds. Other environmental variables considered were sea surface temperatures (SST) and prey stocks. In most of the species, models incorporating climatological variables were considerably better supported than models with constant survival, time-dependent survival or prey effects. SSTs tended to explain more of the variability in seabird survival than did the NAO. 6. The importance of prey availability was evident in some of the species, but climate was generally a better predictor of survival. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests that meteorological parameters affect seabird mortality only indirectly, possibly through the food chain. This conclusion rests on the observations that most NAO effects are lagged, and that survival rates decreased with increasing SSTs. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",178,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Adult mortality | Barents Sea | Fish stock biomass | North Atlantic Oscillation | Sea surface temperature,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,33

We compared the reproduction of a marine diving bird, Brunnich's guillemot (Uria lomvia), breeding at two Arctic colonies close to the northern and southern limits of the species' range in the Canadian Arctic. 2. At both colonies, timing of breeding for Brunnich's guillemots was positively correlated with summer ice cover, which was determined by winter and spring temperatures. Spring temperatures also modified the effects of ice conditions on timing of breeding. 3. At Coats Island, northern Hudson Bay, in low Arctic waters, the date of egg-laying has advanced since 1981, simultaneous with a decrease in summer ice cover in surrounding waters. Lower ice cover in this region is correlated with lower chick growth rates and lower adult body mass, suggesting that reduction in summer ice extent is having a negative effect on reproduction. 4. Conversely, at Prince Leopold Island, in the High Arctic, there has been no trend in summer ice cover and no detectable change in timing of breeding. Reproduction there is less successful in years of late ice than in years of early ice break-up. 5. Current trends suggest that continued warming should benefit birds breeding on the northern limit of the species range, while adversely affecting reproduction for those on the southern margin.

Buffer effects occur when increases in population size result in an increasing proportion of a population inhabiting poor quality sites. When there are fitness costs to inhabiting poor sites, buffer effects can potentially regulate population sizes. In migratory populations, the regulatory capacity of buffer effects will clearly be influenced by their role in both the breeding and nonbreeding seasons, but previous studies have been restricted to one season only. 2. Icelandic black-tailed godwits Limosa limosa islandica are currently increasing in number and previous studies have revealed a large-scale buffer effect operating on the wintering grounds. 3. Here, we reconstruct the pattern of population expansion and colonization of new breeding grounds, in relation to breeding habitat quality, to investigate whether a buffer effect is also operating during the breeding season. 4. Godwit breeding success is higher in marsh habitats than in dwarf-birch bogs. Prey densities are also higher in marsh habitats, and breeding success increases with the density of shallow pools, which are more common on marsh sites. Large lowland basins with higher marsh coverage were colonized earlier than small ones with low marsh coverage. Recent colonizations have been into basins that are closer to occupied sites and have higher cover of dwarf-birch bog. 5. Thus godwits appear to be expanding into poorer quality breeding habitat as well as poorer quality winter habitat. The large spatial scale of these analyses and the fitness costs of occupying poor quality sites suggest that this double buffer effect is likely to play a key role in regulating this expanding population. In most migratory populations, some level of density dependence is likely to operate at both ends of the range. Double buffer effects may therefore be a common phenomenon and an important mechanism regulating migratory populations. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",55,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Buffer effects | Density dependence | Expansion pattern | Habitat quality | Limosa limosa islandica | Migratory population | Waders,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,35

In parallel with recent studies of plant-animal mutualistic networks, our analyses suggest that host-parasite interactions in these systems are highly asymmetric: specialist parasites tend to interact with hosts with high parasite richness, whereas hosts with low parasite richness tend to interact mainly with generalist parasites. 4. The observed distribution of specialization was predicted by a null model that assumed that species-specific probabilities of being assigned a link during the randomization process were roughly proportional to their relative abundance.

Two published data sets of helminths of the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus (L.) were analysed to test the hypothesis that the structure of these component communities is influenced by interactions between species.

Significant differences from null models were detected for associations based on prevalence, but when subgroup constraints were taken into consideration, most lost significance. Among three and 15 pair-wise associations possible in data sets 1 and 2, respectively, only that between Trichuris muris and Heligmosomoides polygyrus was not dependent on context, and that between H. polygyrus and Catenotaenia pusilla, while always positive, varied in magnitude among sites of capture. 3. Pair-wise comparisons of abundance revealed three significant associations, only one of which (H. polygyrus with C. pusilla) still remained significant after controlling for quantified extrinsic and intrinsic factors. With increasing burdens of H. polygyrus, mice carried more of other helminth species and this relationship remained significant after controlling for confounding factors. 4. Overall, positive co-occurrences of pairs of helminths of A. sylvaticus were highly context dependent and quantitative associations were weak and not convincing.

The performance of the approximation has not been assessed. 2. We compare the performance of the retrospective matrix method to a complete decomposition for two bighorn sheep populations and one red deer population. 3. Different demographic rates make markedly different contributions to variation in growth rate between populations, because each population is subject to different types of environmental variation. 4. The most influential demographic rates identified from decomposing observed variation in population growth are often not those showing the highest elasticity. Consequently, those demographic rates most strongly associated with deterministic population growth are not necessarily strongly associated with temporal variation in population growth. 5. The retrospective matrix method provides a good approximation of the demographic rate associated most strongly with variation in population growth.

The veracity of food webs and other trophic structures derived from empirical data sets depends ultimately on our ability to identify species' diets and, thus, to classify organisms according to their major energy source or functional feeding groups. True omnivory (mixing plant and animal food) is common among terrestrial and marine arthropods, but poorly documented in freshwater systems. In a field study, we examined a guild of six large-bodied, lotic insects (Plecoptera and Trichoptera) that are generally considered to be predatory and that coexist in one stream. Gut contents analysis was used to characterize prey in the diet and to quantify the consumption of plant material. Nitrogen isotope ratios (δ15N) were measured in whole-animal samples to determine whether any algae were assimilated into body tissues. 2. Gut contents analysis showed that all six study taxa were polyphagous with respect to their animal prey. All taxa also consumed substantial amounts of algae, but little true detritus (terrestrial plant material). Contrary to previous suggestions, an ontogenetic shift from carnivory to algivory was apparent in two species; a shift from algivory to carnivory was not observed. 3. Stable isotope analysis indicated that some predators assimilated algae: δ15N was lower than expected if predators were wholly carnivorous. Using a stable isotope mixing model to estimate the proportion of algae assimilated into body tissues, we suggest that three taxa are true omnivores and estimate that 40-55% of body nitrogen is derived from algae. The remaining three taxa appear to be primarily carnivorous. 4. Intraguild omnivory is a distinctive feature of the food web in this stream, and probably many others, and needs to be incorporated explicitly into models of stream systems. The food limitation hypothesis may explain, in part, true omnivory at this site. However, the nutritional value of algae and its role in the growth and fecundity of predatory stream insects requires further investigation before underlying mechanisms can be identified with confidence. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",65,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Diet mixing | Plecoptera | Stable isotopes | Trichoptera | True omnivory,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,40

Few studies have related metrics of fitness to broad-scale, multivariate patterns of resource selection. 2. Our objective was to relate long-term predation-mortality patterns for adult woodland caribou [Rangifer tarandus caribou (Banfield)] from Alberta, Canada (1991-2002), with patterns of multivariate habitat selection. 3. We first compared probabilities of radio-tracked caribou dying (n = 55) from predation in habitats within the home range, controlling for habitat availability, with that expected from habitat selection probabilities for the same animals during life. We then compared survival rates of caribou (n = 141) possessing dissimilar patterns of habitat selection using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. 4. Patterns in habitat-specific predation mortality differed significantly from expected given probabilities of habitat selection during life (P < 0·0001). Cox regression indicated that mortality rates of caribou due to predation were affected significantly by and can be predicted from patterns of selection (P = 0·02). 5. Our results strongly suggest that uplands (primarily mixed deciduous and coniferous forest) present caribou with higher than expected levels of predation risk, and that caribou can avoid predation by maximizing selection of peatlands (open, conifer-dominated bogs and fens). 6. Approaches presented in this study may be useful for ecologists interested in assessing the influence of mortality factors on broad-scale, multivariate resource selection. Linking metrics of fitness to multivariate resource selection will enable us to ask questions of evolutionary ecology once restricted to only the finest ecological scales. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",81,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Cox regression | Habitat selection | Predation | Survival | Woodland caribou,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,41

Many far-ranging bird and mammal species aggregate in colonies to breed, and most individuals remain faithful to one colony. Here, we use modelling to explore the consequences of this site fidelity for the metapopulation dynamics of such species. 2. We develop a spatially explicit model of the annual transfer process between colonies. We apply it to different spatial arrangements of 20 identical colonies and thus demonstrate that connectivity alone can, in the short term, give rise to heterogeneity in colony size. 3. We place the annual transfer model within a state-structured population model and examine the consequences of local and global density dependence for long-term dynamics. For each scenario, we investigate the implications of the strength of site fidelity, the cost of migration and the population's intrinsic growth rate. 4. Our results suggest that, under local density dependence, site fidelity slows down the colonization process and can temporarily trap the entire population in a subset of the available potential colonies. When site fidelity is strong, the metapopulation follows a step-like trajectory. Population growth occurs only rarely because individuals must overcome their site-fidelity to found new colonies. Even though this effect is temporary, it renders the entire metapopulation vulnerable to rare catastrophic collapses. 5. Under global density dependence, site fidelity imposes competition between colonies for the limiting resource. Stochastic events lead to the dominance of certain colonies and the temporary extinction of others. If site fidelity is strong, it can permanently prevent the metapopulation from occupying all available potential colonies. 6. We conclude that, irrespective of the mechanism of population regulation, colonially breeding species that show strong site fidelity are likely to occupy only a portion of the breeding habitat available to them. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",102,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Apparent carrying capacity | Breeding habitat | Natal dispersal | Philopatry | Prospecting,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,42

Many endotherms employ torpor during periods of resource scarcity, but this state of substantially reduced body temperature and metabolism appears to impose significant physiological costs. Accordingly, individuals can be expected to vary the expression of torpor according to the size of their energy reserves. 2. Although dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are important for maintaining the fluidity of membrane phospholipids and depot fats at low body temperatures, they are also prone to autoxidation, which can result in significant somatic damage. Dietary PUFA may thus influence the depth and duration of torpor during hibernation. 3. We evaluated the hypothesis that both an increase in the size of the burrow food hoard and an elevation of its PUFA composition can cause chipmunks to reduce their use of torpor both by reducing the time spent torpid and by maintaining higher body temperature during torpor. 4. We provided individual chipmunks with equicaloric natural-PUFA and high-PUFA supplements 10 days prior to autumn immergence. We measured seven parameters that characterize the depth and duration of torpor used by hibernating chipmunks using temperature-sensitive data loggers mounted on neck collars. We compared torpor patterns for the natural-PUFA, high-PUFA and control groups at a study site in southern Quebec, Canada. We also compared control animals from Quebec with unsupplemented controls from a more southerly site in Pennsylvania, USA characterized by higher food availability and less severe winters. 5. Chipmunks provided with natural-PUFA supplements spent less than half as much time in torpor as control animals at the same study site, and when in torpor they exhibited skin temperatures almost twice as high as controls. Chipmunks provided with high-PUFA supplements significantly reduced the depth and duration of torpor bouts compared with animals provided with natural-PUFA supplements. The torpor patterns of unsupplemented chipmunks at the southern site approximated those of natural-PUFA chipmunks at the main study site. 6. Our results provide clear evidence that chipmunks adjust the depth and duration of torpor expression according to both the size and the composition of their energy reserves. Furthermore, both the extent and the nutritional form of environmental energy availability are important determinants of the cost and benefits of torpor expression by free-ranging endotherms. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",69,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Hibernation | Hoarding behaviour | Oxidative stress | Rodent | Temperature logger,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,43

Following the passing of a typhoon over central Japan in late August 2001, a large-scale flood occurred owing to the heavy precipitation. Willow trees on the banks of the Yasu River were badly damaged. In the following year, we examined the effects of the flood on the regrowth response of a willow, Salix eriocarpa (Franch), and its subsequent effects on the densities of a leaf beetle, Plagiodera versicolora (Laicharting), and its predators. 2. We used 10 randomly selected pairs of heavily and lightly damaged trees. Field observations showed that the number of sprouting shoots was significantly greater on heavily damaged trees than on lightly damaged trees. The sprouts continued to grow until August, producing lateral shoots and leaves. 3. The numbers of leaf beetles at all developmental stages (egg, larva, pupa and adult) significantly increased on heavily damaged trees as compared to numbers on lightly damaged trees. Adults of the leaf beetle aggregated predominantly on sprouting shoots throughout the growing season. 4. As a result of the increase in the number of leaf beetles, leaf herbivory on heavily damaged trees was significantly greater than on lightly damaged trees. 5. Two arthropod predators, the larvae of the ladybird Aiolocaria hexaspilota (Hope) and the web-building spider Agelena opulenta (L. Koch), also increased significantly on heavily damaged trees.

The environmental conditions that migratory birds experience during their stay at different locations throughout the year can have significant impact on the variation of annual survival rates. Because migrants often crowd during non-breeding, environmental conditions can affect survival rates of individuals originating from different breeding populations, thus also provoking spatial synchronisation of annual survival rates. The identification of critical environmental factors affecting survival is therefore crucial for understanding large-scale population dynamics of migrants. 2. We studied temporal and spatial variation of survival rates of migratory white stork Ciconia ciconia from eastern Germany and Poland and examine factors associated with this variation. We used resighting and dead-recovery data from more than 30 000 individuals sampled over 19 years to estimate survival. 3. Survival rates of juvenile and adult white storks originating from the two countries varied in parallel over time. Thus, variation in survival was caused by environmental variation to which individuals of both age classes from both countries were similarly sensitive. Variation in the primary production (as reflected by the normalized difference vegetation index) at one staging area in the eastern Sahel that is visited from October to November contributed up to 88% to the temporal variation in survival. Annual survival was reduced when primary production in the Sahel was low. 4. As the population growth rate of white storks is very sensitive to changes in survival, variation in primary production in the Sahelian staging area contributed significantly to population changes and is likely to be an important reason for population synchrony. 5.

Through reconciling census totals with population structure, annual survival rates were estimated for the juvenile, yearling and adult stages of 10 ungulate species over 14 years or longer in South Africa's Kruger National Park. During this period four species maintained high abundance levels, while six species declined progressively in abundance. 2. Multiple regression models fitted to these estimates indicated that juvenile survival was sensitive to annual variability in rainfall for most of these species, especially in the dry season component, but with no density feedback apparent. Rainfall components affected adult survival in several of the declining species, while negative density dependence in adult survival was evident for three of the four species that maintained high abundance. A negative effect of past prey availability, indexing putative changes in predator abundance, on adult survival was more strongly supported statistically among the declining species than the lagged effect of prior rainfall, potentially affecting herbaceous vegetation cover and composition. 3. The high sensitivity of juvenile survival to environmental variability among these ungulate species was consistent with the general pattern identified for large mammalian herbivores, although the absence of any survival response counteracting the density declines was surprising. The susceptibility of adult survival to environmental influences for the declining species appeared unusual and probably reflected an interaction between nutritional shortfalls and a numerical increase in lions, preying largely upon the adult segment of these species. The ungulate species that persisted at high abundance seemed resistant to effects of rainfall on food resources and evidently drove the changes in predator abundance. The sharp density effect on adult survival among these species could indicate prey switching by lions following changes in their relative availability. 4. Findings extend past generalizations about the demographic processes underlying the population dynamics of large mammalian herbivores and reveal how the survival rates of particular population segments respond differently to environmental influences.

A key issue in ecology is the prediction of future population fluctuations. Such population predictions are fundamental for population-viability analysis and are essential for assessing the implications of various management actions. Development of reliable population predictions is however, difficult because it requires estimation and modelling of the separate effects of the deterministic components of the population dynamics as well as the stochastic influences on the population fluctuations. Here we model the stochastic dynamics of an introduced population of muskox Ovibos moschatus in the Dovrefjell mountains of central Norway, using a simple model without density regulation. Our aim is to examine quantitatively factors affecting the accuracy of the population projections by applying the concept of Population Prediction Interval (PPI). 2. The long-term growth rate was ŝ = 0·0511, assuming no density dependence. The environmental variance was relatively large (σe2 = 0·0159). This gives a deterministic growth rate of r̂ = 0·0591. However, accounting for losses due to various kinds of human activities resulted in a nearly doubling of s (ŝ = 0·0980). 3. Autumn temperature and late winter snow depth were each able to explain a significant proportion of the annual variation in population growth rates. 4. The impact of environmental stochasticity made the PPI wide after only a few years. Uncertainties in the estimates of the population parameters were quite small and had a minor impact on the PPI. 5. A sensitivity analysis showed that ignoring demographic stochasticity led to an overestimate of the environmental variance σe2, but that the impact on the width of the PPI was small. 6.

Selectivity of harvest influences harvest sustainability because individuals with different characteristics contribute differently to population growth. We investigate the effects of selection based on chick weight on a traditional harvest of the sooty shearwater Puffinus griseus by Rakiura Maori in New Zealand. 2.

Intensity and selectivity of harvest are defined in terms of weight-specific hazard functions. 3. We investigate the effect of harvest intensity and selectivity on population growth rate, λ, and the chick exploitation rate, E. We also consider the interaction of chick harvest and adult mortality. 4. λ decreases and E increases as harvest intensity increases. At low harvest intensities, selection has little effect on λ. At high harvest intensities, λ increases as selectivity increases because of the non-linear relationship between harvest intensity and the probability of being harvested. 5. λ is determined almost completely by E, irrespective of the combination of harvest selectivity and intensity producing E. This is true for both general patterns of selectivity and specific patterns estimated from empirical data. 6. The elasticities of λ, the net reproductive rate and the generation time are unaffected by selectivity and show only small responses to harvest intensity. 7. Adult sooty shearwaters are killed as bycatch in long-line and driftnet fisheries. Such mortality of adults has an effect on λ about 10-fold greater than an equivalent level of chick harvest. 8.

Batesian mimicry describes the situation in which a palatable mimic resembles an unpalatable model. In some species of butterflies, both sexes mimic, but in others only females do. Two mechanisms have been proposed to generate female-limited mimicry: sexual selection via female choice, and sexual selection via male-male competition. Each is not satisfactory because of too many exceptions. 2. I hypothesized that reductions in physiological life span because of mimicry constituted the costs, while extensions of ecological life span because of mimicry constituted the benefits. Mimicry would result from the balance of a costs/benefits relationship; when balances are favourable, mimicry occurs. 3. Non-mimetic females of female-limited mimicry butterfly Papilio polytes lived longer than its mimetic females in a butterfly farm greenhouse. Therefore, reduction in physiological life span must be a cost of mimicry. 4. Male-biased sex ratios were found in 11 of the 14 non-mimetic and non-model species netted in the Kakamega tropical rainforest in west Kenya, in other one species almost equivalent, and in remaining two species female-biased. For each species, the sexes netted less frequently had more beak marks than those netted more frequently. That is, the biased sex ratios could be responsible for the higher predation rates of the opposite sex. 5. Predators may have selectively attacked females with wider thoraxes, which flew at higher levels and flew more quickly. However, attack rates on males of some species may be high or low regardless of thorax width. 6. As the benefits accrue largely to females with wider thorax due to female-biased predation, balances of costs/benefits relationships divide participating species into three theoretical groups: those in which the adaptation is favourable for both sexes; favourable only for females; and unfavourable for both sexes. 7.

Among large mammalian herbivores, juvenile survival tends to vary widely and may thus have a greater influence on population dynamics than the relatively constant survival rates typical of adults. However, previous studies yielding stage-specific survival rates have been mostly on temperate zone ungulates and in environments lacking large predators. 2. Annual censuses coupled with assessments of population structure enabled annual survival rates to be estimated for the juvenile, yearling and adult segments of nine ungulate species in South Africa's Kruger National Park. Four of these populations persisted at high abundance after initial increases (zebra, wildebeest, impala and giraffe), while five showed progressive declines during the latter part of the study period (kudu, waterbuck, warthog, sable antelope and tsessebe). 3. The magnitude of the reduction in adult survival between periods showing contrasting population trends was similar to or greater than the corresponding change in juvenile survival for five of the nine species. Accordingly alterations in population phase, from increasing to stable or stable to declining, were brought about mostly through reduced survival within the adult segment. Elevated predation risk may have been responsible. 4. Estimates were derived of the relative survival rates of juveniles, yearlings and adult segments associated with zero population growth, and the survival differential between adult males and females, for all nine species. Stage-specific survival rates appeared dependent on body mass, but with some anomalies. The sex difference in adult survival showed no obvious relation with sexual size dimorphism. 5. For large mammalian herbivores, assessments of relative elasticities of stage-specific survival rates on population growth are problematic for several reasons. Sensitivity to corresponding increments in either survival or mortality rates provides a better basis for ecological or adaptive interpretation. Survival rates of adults seem to vary more over multiyear periods compared with mainly annual fluctuations in juvenile survival. More studies are needed on tropical species and in environments retaining large predators to support generalizations about factors influencing ungulate life-history patterns. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",77,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Life history | Population dynamics | Predation | Temporal variability | Vital rates,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,51

Capital breeding is a resource use tactic common among polygynous mammals, such as many ungulates. Even though large, prime-aged males stop eating during the rutting season, younger individuals often do not and may adopt alternative mating tactics that are less strenuous. The pattern of reproductive effort is therefore probably very variable among age classes, but has rarely been quantified in male mammals. 2. Based on data of body weight of 9949 male moose (Alces alces L.) aged up to 21 years from seven populations in Norway, we tested hypotheses regarding the pattern of reproductive effort (weight loss during rut) in this capital breeder, and how this may be affected by factors such as age, population sex ratio and density. 3. Reproductive effort increased with age, even after prime-age was reached around the age of 6 years. This provides the first evidence consistent with the terminal investment hypothesis in male mammals. For the very oldest males (> 12 years) data were limited, but the tendency was that effort stabilized or even decreased slightly. Effort did not depend on the population sex ratio or density for adult males. 4. Yearling males also lost some weight during the rutting season, but this was not related to population sex ratio. Decreasing trends in yearling body weight as seen in many strongly harvested moose populations, therefore are due probably to other causes than earlier onset of rutting. Further, effort in yearlings decreased with increasing density. 5. Despite the lack of a correlation between effort and population sex ratio, a significantly faster ageing after prime-age was observed with an increasingly female-biased population sex ratio. This is consistent with the hypothesis that strongly skewed sex ratios may affect the ageing process. 6. Most ungulate populations in Europe and North America are heavily harvested or otherwise managed extensively, harvest being typically male-biased to varying degrees. The resulting skews in sex ratio provide manipulations that give unique opportunities to study life-history variation, in particular for large mammals that are otherwise difficult to manipulate.

Maternal yolk hormones can enhance the development and phenotypic quality of nestling birds. Nevertheless, within species large differences in yolk androgen concentrations among clutches are observed.

Potential costs include an increased susceptibility to parasites in nestlings exposed to high concentrations of yolk androgens during embryonic development, weaker immune response or increased levels of circulating corticosterone that indirectly reduce immune function. 3.

At the end of the nestling period, nestlings originating from testosterone-injected eggs were heavier than control nestlings. This effect was strongest in nestlings at the end of the size hierarchy, as shown by a significant interaction between hormone treatment and the nestlings' size rank within nests. 5. High levels of yolk testosterone promoted growth of the nestling's body mass similarly in parasite-infested and parasite-free nests, and neither affected the levels of plasma corticosterone, nor the nestling's cell-mediated immune response. 6. In summary, our results do not show negative short-term effects of high concentrations of yolk testosterone on immune function or parasite susceptibility, but emphasize that maternal investment via deposition of yolk testosterone can promote fitness-related growth and development of nestlings. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",82,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Ceratophyllus gallinae | Corticosterone | Host-parasite interactions | Maternal effects | Maternal hormones,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,53

The spatial and temporal scale at which infectious animals pose a transmission risk to others may be inferred by a study of space-time interaction in the clustering of cases of infection. 2. We analyse the distribution of bank voles and wood mice infectious with cowpox virus, using 7 years of monthly live-trapping data from a woodland in north-west England. 3. A published method, K-function analysis, is adapted to measure space-time interaction among infectious animals trapped on a grid system, where the populations at risk may vary in density. 4. We hypothesized that the risk of cowpox transmission from an infectious animal would be contained within a temporal scale of one infectious period and a spatial scale of one home-range diameter. 5. Cowpox cases among wood mice showed significantly greater spatial clustering than the population at risk at the smallest spatial scale, corresponding to animals caught in the same location. At larger scales, and for bank voles at all scales, cowpox cases showed no spatial clustering beyond that expected from an association with host distribution. 6. Cowpox cases among wood mice showed strong evidence of temporal clustering beyond that of the host population, indicating short-lived outbreaks. No such effect was apparent among bank voles. 7. Significant space-time interaction among cowpox cases was detected at the hypothesized spatial and temporal scales in both host species. This suggests that the risk of transmission is concentrated locally. 8.

Timing and synchrony of reproduction are regarded as crucially important factors for fitness in seasonal environments. Natural selection has probably favoured temperate and arctic female herbivores that match reproduction with onset of plant growth in spring. However, breeding synchrony may also be affected by variation in phenotypic quality of females in a population, because females in poor body condition have been found to delay ovulation and subsequent calving. 2. We compared breeding phenology, i.e. the timing and synchrony of rutting (roaring, sexual aggregation) and calving of red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) in France (latitude: 49°N) and Norway (latitude: 63°N). We hypothesized (H1) that calving and rutting were later at the site with latest onset of plant growth. 3. We further quantified overall environmental predictability as the sum of annual constancy and seasonality and tested three different (not mutually exclusive) hypotheses about breeding synchrony: (H2a) the population experiencing most seasonal plant phenology should show the highest breeding synchrony; (H2b) overall predictability of plant phenology should determine breeding synchrony; and (H2c) breeding should be more synchronized in the population with lowest female body weight variation within age classes because they ovulate more synchronously. 4. Calving and rutting, as well as onset of plant phenology, were later in Norway than in France, complying with the first hypothesis. Plant growth in spring was overall more predictable and also more seasonal in Norway than France. Hence we expected higher breeding synchrony in Norway than in France according to H2a and H2b. Variance in female body weight was slightly higher in France than in Norway, which should also cause more synchronized breeding in Norway than in France (H2c). Contrary to all predictions, variance in rutting and calving dates was around two times higher in Norway than in France. 5. We suggest two alternative explanations of breeding synchrony. A more variable topography in Norway can make optimal birth date more variable on a local scale than in France, thereby maintaining a higher genetic variance for calving date in Norwegian red deer. Further, population age structure may play a role, as ovulation varies according to female age. Clearly, processes of breeding synchrony are far more complex than previously realized. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",94,Journal,ar,Article,100,10,10,Birth | Cervus elaphus | NDVI | Reproduction | Seasonality,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,55

Intraspecific variation in reproductive decisions is generally considered as a reaction to environmental circumstances. We show that variation in reproductive parameters also covaries with intraspecific variation in personality. 2. During 4 years, we studied reproductive parameters in a natural population of great tits in association with a personality trait: exploratory behaviour as measured in a novel environment. 3. Nest success, fledgling size and condition were all correlated with this personality trait. Slow-exploring females had a higher nest success and largest fledglings. Fledgling condition was affected by the interaction between male and female exploratory behaviour, with assortative pairs at both ends of the behavioural spectrum producing fledglings in best condition. Fast-exploring males bred in nestboxes that produced heavy fledglings in other years. 4. We hypothesize that fast-exploring individuals are better able in defending or obtaining a high quality territory, while slow-exploring individuals are either better parents or have better chicks which may, in part, explain the patterns in reproductive success. We discuss how these patterns in reproduction can explain earlier reported relationships between offspring recruitment and avian personality and may result in the maintenance of intraspecific genetic variation in personality. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",234,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Boldness | Exploration | Fitness | Genetic variation | Personality | Reproduction,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,56

Megaplanktivores such as filter-feeding sharks and baleen whales are at the apex of a short food chain (phytoplankton - zooplankton - vertebrate) and are sensitive indicators of sea-surface plankton availability. Even though they spend the majority of their time below the surface it is still not known how most of these species utilize vertical habitat and adapt to short-term changes in food availability. 2. A key factor likely to control vertical habitat selection by planktivorous sharks is the diel vertical migration (DVM) of zooplankton; however, no study has determined whether specific ocean-habitat type influences their behavioural strategy. Based on the first high-resolution dive data collected for a plankton-feeding fish species we show that DVM patterns of the basking shark Cetorhinus maximus reflect habitat type and zooplankton behaviour. 3. In deep, well-stratified waters sharks exhibited normal DVM (dusk ascent - dawn descent) by tracking migrating sound-scattering layers characterized by Calanus and euphausiids. Sharks occupying shallow, inner-shelf areas near thermal fronts conducted reverse DVM (dusk descent - dawn ascent) possibly due to zooplankton predator - prey interactions that resulted in reverse DVM of Calanus. 4. These opposite DVM patterns resulted in the probability of daytime-surface sighting differing between these habitats by as much as two orders of magnitude. Ship-borne surveys undertaken at the same time as trackings reflected these behavioural differences. 5. The tendency of basking sharks to feed or rest for long periods at the surface has made them vulnerable to harpoon fisheries. Ship-borne and aerial surveys also use surface occurrence to assess distribution and abundance for conservation purposes. Our study indicates that without bias reduction for habitat-specific DVM patterns, current surveys could under- or overestimate shark abundance by at least 10-fold. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",167,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Archival telemetry | Behaviour | Conservation | Shark | Zooplankton,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,57

Moreover, we know little about how digestive physiology may also influence the shape of the growth/predation risk trade-off function. 2. We determined the role of behaviour and digestive physiology in experiments in which damselny larvae were induced to grow slowly or rapidly by manipulating photoperiod (time stress), and exposure to a fish predator. 3. We showed that larvae under time stress grew more rapidly. Rapid-growing larvae had a higher foraging activity and a higher growth efficiency. 4. Under predation risk, larvae not only had a lower foraging activity but also a lower growth efficiency. 5. Rapid-growing larvae (i.e. those under time stress) balanced the growth/predation risk trade-off differently and took more risk in the presence of a predator, which resulted in a behaviourally mediated higher predation cost compared to slow-growing larvae. Their higher growth efficiency, however, made this cost smaller compared to a completely behaviourally mediated rapid-growth strategy. 6. Our results provide the first explicit experimental proof of a behaviourally mediated predation cost of rapid growth.

During early development male offspring in avian species often suffer from enhanced mortality compared to female offspring. This has been attributed to different nutritional requirements, as sex-biased mortality has been reported particularly in sexually size-dimorphic species. However, other traits of the male phenotype, such as the embryonic hormone profile, have been suggested to contribute to this male disadvantage. In particular the negative effects of sex steroids on immune function may be causally involved. 2. We investigated the role of testosterone in the expression of male phenotype disadvantage through an experimental reduction of the availability of testosterone receptors by in-ovo injection of an anti-androgen (Flutamide©). Experimental nests contained a male and a female chick hatching from control treated eggs and a male and a female chick hatching from Flutamide treated eggs. 3. Male-biased mortality occurred in control chicks at a stage where the sexes did not yet differ in their growth pattern, suggesting that sex-specific nutritional requirements are not necessary for male-biased mortality to occur. Control males and control females did not differ in their cell-mediated immunity (CMI). This renders it unlikely that the observed skewed mortality was due to sex-specific differences in the CMI. 4. Treatment of the eggs with flutamide antagonistically affected males and females. Flutamide treatment positively affected male development in particular through an enhanced growth rate, indicating that testosterone is involved in the expression of the male phenotype disadvantage. Female chicks hatching from Flutamide treated eggs were disadvantaged in growth and CMI. The possible pathways of this sex-specific effect of Flutamide are discussed with regard to differential consequences of blocking the beneficial effects of maternal androgens and the interference with the process of sexual differentiation in males. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",50,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Anti-androgen | Brood size | Flutamide | Immunity | PHA,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,59

We investigated the effects of changes in taxonomic resolution on analyses of patterns of multivariate variation at different spatial scales for the highly diverse fauna inhabiting holdfasts of the kelp Ecklonia radiata. 2. Multivariate analyses were performed using several transformations to examine differences in spatial patterns of variation from metres up to hundreds of kilometres for composition vs. relative abundance in assemblages. 3. The greatest variability in assemblages occurred at the smallest spatial scale, from plant to plant, pointing to the existence of important small-scale processes. The proportional amount of variation at the smallest spatial scale decreased with decreasing taxonomic resolution (i.e. from species through to phyla). For composition, the next-greatest source of variation was at the largest spatial scale (hundreds of kilometres), while for relative abundance, the next-greatest source of variation was at the level of sites (hundreds of metres to kilometres). 4. For abundance data, location-level variation became less important and site-level variation became more important with decreasing taxonomic resolution, while for compositional data, the opposite pattern occurred. This suggests that variation in the presence of species or taxa at a particular location along the coast is driven by large-scale processes, while variation in relative abundances within locations is driven by medium-scale processes. 5. The lack of significant variation in the proportional abundances of phyla at large spatial scales suggests that some consistency of pattern may emerge at larger scales (spatial and/or taxonomic), even in the presence of high small-scale variability.

With a set of time-series observations from different locations not necessarily covering the same time span, it is shown how the spatial autocorrelation of the residual variance component, not explained by the covariates and corrected for demographic stochasticity, can be estimated using classical multinormal theory. 3. Some previous results on spatial scaling in continuous linearized models on log scale are extended to also provide the scaling for the residuals. This is shown to be close to the spatial scaling of the autocorrelation in the environmental noise and only weakly affected by migration. 4.

While density-dependent mortality and emigration have been widely reported in stream salmonid populations, density-dependent growth is less frequently detected. A recent study suggests that density-dependent growth in stream salmonids occurs at low densities, whereas density-dependent mortality and emigration occur at high densities. 2. To test the hypothesis that density-dependent growth occurs primarily at low rather than at high densities, we examined the relationship between average fork length and population density of young-of-the-year (YOY) Atlantic salmon at the end of the growing season using a 10-year data set collected on Catamaran Brook, New Brunswick. We tested whether (1) average body size decreases with increasing density; (2) the effect of density on average body size is greatest at low densities; (3) growth rate will decrease most rapidly at low effective densities [∑(fork length) 2]; (4) density-dependent growth is weaker over space than over time; and (5) the strength of density-dependent growth increases with the size of the habitat unit (i.e. spatial scale) when compared within years, but not between years. 3. There was a strong negative relationship between the average body size and population density of YOY Atlantic salmon in the autumn, which was best described by a negative power curve. Similarly, a negative power curve provided the best fit to the relationship between average body size and effective density. Most of the variation in average body size was explained by YOY density, with year, location and the density of 1 + and 2+ salmon accounting for a minor proportion of the variation. 4. The strength of density-dependent growth did not differ significantly between comparisons over space vs. time. Consistent with the last prediction, the strength of density-dependent growth increased with increasing spatial scale in the within-year, but not in the between-year comparisons. 5. The effect of density on growth was strongest at low population densities, too low to expect interference competition. Stream salmonid populations may be regulated by two mechanisms: density-dependent growth via exploitative competition at low densities, perhaps mediated by predator-induced reductions in drift rate, and density-dependent mortality and emigration via interference competition at high densities. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",137,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Intraspecific competition | Juvenile salmonids | Population regulation | Spatial scale | Temporal scale,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,62

The behaviour of predators is rarely considered in models of predator-prey interactions, nor is it common to include multiple predators in models of animal behaviour. 2. We introduce a model of optimal diel vertical migration in zooplankton prey facing predation from two functionally different predators, fish and other zooplankton. Zooplankton predators are themselves subject to predation from larger zooplankton, and all zooplankton face the classical trade-off between increasing growth rate and predation risk from fish towards the surface. Prey are most vulnerable to zooplankton predators at small sizes, but become more visible to fish as they grow. However, by habitat selection prey continuously manage their exposure to different sources of risk. 3. We analyse situations with cascading behavioural interactions of size-structured predator-prey interactions in the pelagic. In particular, we explore how vertical gradients in growth rates and relative abundance of fish and zooplankton predators affect optimal distribution patterns, growth and mortality schedules. 4. A major model prediction is that prey susceptibility to one functional predator type depends on the abundance of the other predator. Higher abundance of zooplankton predators leads to risk enhancement from fish, minor increases in predation rate from zooplankton and unchanged prey growth rates. Increasing abundance of fish does not alter the risk from zooplankton predators, but reduces growth and development rates. Such asymmetric emergent effects may be common when prey and predators share the same spatial refuge from a common top predator. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",21,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,DVM | Dynamic programming | Emergent effects | Multiple predators | Zooplankton,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,63

Pathogens are known to cause horizontally transmitted overt (fully symptomatic) and vertically transmitted covert (asymptomatic) infections. Here, we explore a range of different covert infection strategies on the persistence and dynamics of insect host-pathogen interactions. 2. The three strategies we explore are (i) sublethal infections in which hosts survive initial infection but suffer costs on fecundity or development, (ii) persistent infections, which are transmitted vertically with minimal costs on fecundity and development and which also confer immunity against superinfection and (iii) persistent infections without immunity against superinfection. 3. We examine the conditions that allow these three strategies to invade. We find that sublethal infections can act to modulate the population dynamics (i.e. cause changes in amplitude and periodicity of cycles) as well as inducing different dynamics (stable and unstable states). This is in line with empirical findings. 4. Covert infection strategies are also able to generate novel dynamics. In particular, over a wide range of parameter space the predicted dynamics of the covert infections without immunity are of a persistent stable interaction solely between the covertly infected hosts and the pathogen, with the exclusion of clean susceptible hosts. 5. Our results suggest that, in general, host-pathogen interactions may be maintained in low-level persistent endemic states without the propensity to show the cyclic oscillations characteristic of enemy-victim interactions. Understanding host-pathogen dynamics requires a knowledge of the factors involved, such as covert infections, that may compensate for the destabilizing effects of time-lags. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",31,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Host-pathogen interactions | Latency | Parasites | Sublethal effects,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,64

Biotic interactions and abiotic suitability are often emphasized as factors influencing invasion success. Here we examine how these factors might interact to affect the competitive performance of invasive Argentine ants (Linepithema humile) in Western Australia. 2. In standardized bait surveys Argentine ants controlled twice as many baits in the morning (ground temperatures: 18-25°C) compared to the number they controlled in the afternoon (ground temperatures: 30-40°C). Moreover, Argentine ants displaced native ants from baits only in the morning and were, in turn, displaced by native ants only in the afternoon. 3. We used a factorial field experiment to test the relative importance of interspecific competition (±) and ground temperature variation [warm (25°C)/hot (33°C)] as determinants of competitive performance among established colonies of Argentine ants and two species of native Iridomyrmex (I. bicknelli and I. rufoniger suchieri). 4. We observed a condition-specific competitive asymmetry between I. bicknelli and L. humile. In the absence of each other as competitors, these two species responded to ground temperature variation in an opposite manner. I. bicknelli foraged more actively when ground temperatures were hot, whereas L. humile foraged more actively when ground temperatures were warm. In competition with I. bicknelli, Argentine ants monopolized two-thirds of all baits but controlled more than twice the number of baits under warm conditions than under hot conditions. Iridomyrmex bicknelli dominated 22% of all baits but did so primarily when conditions were hot. 5. Linepithema humile and I. r. suchieri responded to abiotic variation in a qualitatively similar manner. Both species foraged less actively when ground temperatures were hot than when ground temperatures were warm, but L. humile showed stronger declines when ground temperatures were hot than did I. r. suchieri. In competition with I. r. suchieri, Argentine ants again monopolized two-thirds of all baits. 6.

Of the many models for species-abundance distributions (SADs), the lognormal has been the most popular and has been put forward as an appropriate null model for testing against theoretical SADs. In this paper we explore a number of reasons why the lognormal is not an appropriate null model, or indeed an appropriate model of any sort, for a SAD. 2. We use three empirical examples, based on published data sets, to illustrate features of SADs in general and of the lognormal in particular: the abundance of British breeding birds, the number of trees > 1 cm diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) on a 50 ha Panamanian plot, and the abundance of certain butterflies trapped at Jatun Sacha, Ecuador. The first two are complete enumerations and show left skew under logarithmic transformation, the third is an incomplete enumeration and shows right skew. 3. Fitting SADs by χ2 test is less efficient and less informative than fitting probability plots. The left skewness of complete enumerations seems to arise from a lack of extremely abundant species rather than from a surplus of rare ones. One consequence is that the logit-normal, which stretches the right-hand end of the distribution, consistently gives a slightly better fit. 4. The central limit theorem predicts lognormality of abundances within species but not between them, and so is not a basis for the lognormal SAD. Niche breakage and population dynamical models can predict a lognormal SAD but equally can predict many other SADs. 5.

The latter removes the absurdity of the invisible highly abundant half of the individuals abundance curve predicted by the lognormal SAD.

The dynamics of exploited populations are clearly affected by two major processes, recruitment and harvesting. The large variation in recruitment is caused mainly by the variation of the brood stock size, which links at least partly to harvesting and consequently is under anthropogenic control. Therefore, harvesting has the potential to modulate the dynamics of exploited populations in many ways. 2. Demonstrated by a pelagic planktivore fish, vendace Coregonus albula L., using population dynamics in Lake Oulujärvi, northern Finland, this study shows that the changes in harvesting induced a tendency to generation cycling in the dynamics of a freshwater fish population. 3. The relatively long-term oscillation in recruitment and stock dynamics of the vendace population transformed into clear 2-year cycling in recruitment and also into the same tendency in the spawning stock, both induced by the increase of the harvest rate to a high and stable level. The high harvest rate evidently simplified the spawning population structure from a multigeneration state to an almost totally single-generation state, followed by generation cycling in the population dynamics. 4. The results demonstrated clearly that harvesting can work as forcing agent and actually dictate the population fluctuations. It is very important to be aware of how natural variations in population abundance interplay with harvesting and also with other human actions. All these support a precautionary policy in harvesting and stress the importance of understanding the basic mechanisms of population dynamics in order to gain sustained yields from the population in space and time. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",31,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Coregonus albula | Fishing rate | Population oscillation | Recruitment,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,67

We investigated abundance-size spectra and body size-density allometry using an exceptionally detailed data set from a stony stream. The body size distribution of the whole metazoan community was expressed in terms of both density and biomass over a 14-month survey, and the relationships of body size with population density and taxon richness were also evaluated. 2. The distribution of density among size classes varied considerably between sampling occasions, although that of biomass was rather more consistent. This suggests that the body size distribution is dynamic and does not always fall into any single pattern or category, as has been assumed hitherto. 3. Analysis of the modes in the density-body size distribution in individual sample-units revealed small-scale spatial variation, with little consistency in the number or position of modes in any one month. 4. This stream community did not conform to the -0.75 (or indeed to any other significant regression) relationship between body size and population density, although such patterns are very sensitive to methodological details. 5. In data aggregated over the whole study, most metazoan taxa fell into the size range < 10-100 μg. The annual average density- and biomass-body size spectra appeared tri-and bimodal, respectively (on log-log scales), with minor troughs in the density spectrum at about 100 and 0.1 μg body mass. This could indicate, at this scale of analysis, discontinuities in the way in which benthic species exploit their environment. 6. Spatial and temporal heterogeneity in size spectra, and the lack of clear density-body size allometry, could be due to biotic or physicochemical fluctuations and environmental change (including seasonal and longer-term changes in acidity) that cause rapid species turnover and changes in density and distribution, particularly among the meiofauna. Small and rare species may thus be in the process of colonization or decline and the pattern would indicate a lack of equilibrium, particularly among organisms in the smallest size classes, at this temporal scale of the study. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",45,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Meiofauna | Scale | Size spectra | Stream benthos | Temporal,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,68

We tested the hypothesis that Gerbillus henleyi (de Winton 1903), the smallest species (10 g) of a pssamophilic guild in Israel, is scarce on relatively productive dunes of the Israeli desert, due to negative interactions from the common G. allenbyi (Thomas 1918) and G pyramidum (Geoffroy 1825). 2. The alternative hypothesis was that scarcity on sand resulted from the size of its naked hind feet, that do not allow efficient locomotion on sand. 3. Despite their naked soles the weight-bearing surface of G. henleyi feet carry less mass/area than those of any other species. 4. We measured interaction coefficients with the two common species using field-manipulation experiments in two enclosures. 5. Habitat usage of G. henleyi changed from significantly preferring the stabilized sand, when alone, to significantly using the semistabilized dune, when G. allenbyi was also present. 6. We also estimated the interaction coefficients and calculated the G. henleyi's isoclines competing with the two common gerbil species using a technique we developed elsewhere. 7. The stability analysis of the isoclines of G. henleyi competing with either G. allenbyi or with G. pyramidum suggests that stable coexistence occurs when G henleyi is relatively scarce while the competitors are common. 8. Interspecific competition from either G allenbyior G. pyramidum accounts for 90.3% reduction in G. henleyi density, relative to when it is alone. 9. We concluded that the negative interactions from congeners was the major cause for the scarcity of G. henleyi on the relatively rich sand dunes of the Israeli desert. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",8,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Biodiversity | Conservation | Gerbils | Scarce species,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,69

According to the 'territorial behaviour' hypothesis, red grouse population cycles are caused by delayed density-dependent changes in male aggressiveness influencing recruitment. These lagged changes in aggressiveness might be caused by changes in the kin structuring of male populations and differential aggressive behaviour between kin and non-kin ('kinship' hypothesis). 2. A population-level manipulation of male aggressiveness in autumn affected the kin structure of male populations, their subsequent aggressiveness, and recruitment of both sexes. On two moors, we implanted the old territorial cocks in autumn with testosterone on an experimental area (T-areas) and with sham implants on a control area (C-areas). 3. Increased aggressiveness in autumn t reduced recruitment in autumns t and t + 1, and breeding density of both sexes in springs t + 1 and t + 2, confirming previous studies elsewhere. A new observation was that cocks on T-areas had bigger combs (an ornament whose size is testosterone-dependent) than those on C-areas for at least 1.5 years after treatment, evidence that they remained more aggressive. 4. Increased aggressiveness reduced not only subsequent density but also kin structuring among territorial cocks. This is consistent with the 'kinship' hypothesis that changes in the kin structure of male populations mediate year-to-year changes in male aggressiveness. 5. Increased aggressiveness did not increase intensity of infection by the dominant intestinal nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis, which might have affected recruitment through reduced breeding success. Moreover, breeding success after treatment was no lower on the T- than on the C-areas. 6. The results show for the first time that increased aggressiveness affects both kin structure and subsequent recruitment, supporting a key assumption of the kinship hypothesis for red grouse population cycles. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Aggressiveness | Experiment | Kin structure | Red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) | Relatedness | Territorial behaviour | Unstable population dynamics,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,70

We tested the performance of least squares cross-validated kernel-density estimation (LSCV KDE) using data from global positioning system (GPS)-collared lions subsampled to simulate the effects of hypothetical radio-tracking strategies. 3.

Patterns of failure and variation were not consistent among lions, reflecting different individual space use patterns. 4. Intensive use of core areas and site fidelity by animals caused LSCV to fail more often than anticipated from studies that used computer-simulated data. 5. LSCV failures at large sample sizes and variation at small sample sizes, limits the applicability of LSCV KDE to fewer situations than the literature suggests, and casts doubts over the method's reliability and comparability as a home-range estimator. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",223,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Algorithm | Panthera leo | Subsampling | Systematic error | Variability,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,71

An experimental manipulation of parental effort was conducted by creating broods of, on average, three, five and eight nestlings. Breeding females were immunochallenged to mount a humoral immune response to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) and a cell-mediated response to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). The consequences of adult decisions on offspring quality were assessed through immune responses to PHA, growth rates and residual body mass of nestlings. 3. Clutch initiation date, a strong measure of individual quality in tree swallows, was linked with immune responses, with earlier-nesting, presumably higher quality, females mounting stronger immune responses than did later-nesting birds. Increased reproductive effort led to decreased parental immune responses. There was a significant interaction between individual quality and reproductive effort treatment, with lower-quality individuals showing greater depression of humoral immune response to SRBC while raising enlarged broods, suggesting individual-level variation in trade-offs. 4. Breeding females raising enlarged broods tended to raise offspring of similar quality to control females, with only growth rate decreasing with increasing brood size, but not residual nestling body mass or nestling immunocompetence.

On a broad-scale, lions shifted their ranges according to the seasonal movement of prey, but at a finer scale (< 100 m) lions fed in areas with high prey 'catchability' rather than high prey density.

The literature was examined for three geographical regions - North America north of Mexico, Europe and Japan. 2. In each region tenthredinid sawflies (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) were significantly more likely to be eruptive on conifers than on angiosperms. 3. The diprionid sawflies (Hymenoptera: Diprionidae) that attack conifers exclusively showed a significantly higher probability of eruptive dynamics than the tenthredinid sawflies on angiosperms in two regions, North America and Europe, and in Japan the trend was in the same direction. 4. The probability of species showing eruptive dynamics on coniferous hosts was not significantly different among tenthredinids and diprionids on conifers in North America. Europe and Japan. 5.

In the adaptive radiation of tenthredinid sawflies from flowering plants onto conifers, larches (Larix) appear to be particularly favourable for colonization, but pines (Pinus) have not been colonized in any region, a pattern likely to be explained by the growth characteristics of the host plants. 7. Among tenthredinid species in Europe, where sawfly/host relationships are best known, there is a significant trend for an increasing proportion of outbreaking species from herbs, to shrubs, to trees. 8.

Maternal control of offspring sex remains a contentious topic in the evolutionary and behavioural ecology of vertebrates. Two models of adaptive sex allocation - the Trivers-Willard (TW) and local resource competition (LRC) hypotheses - have been supported in some studies, but in many other cases the forces shaping offspring sex ratios are unclear. One reason that past studies may not have provided clear support for either model is that the two processes interact, producing complex patterns of sex allocation in relation to the life histories of individual mothers. 2. The TW hypothesis predicts that in dimorphic, polygynous mammals, females in good condition should be more likely to produce male offspring. The LRC hypothesis predicts an independent effect of age on the offspring sex ratio; females should be more likely to produce sons early in their reproductive lives and daughters later, in order to minimize the duration and reproductive cost of mother-daughter competition. We tested these two predictions in a, study of sex allocation in the common brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula. 3. Offspring sex was strongly dependent on maternal age: females breeding for the first time were likely to produce sons, and at subsequent breeding attempts the sex ratio of offspring was slightly biased towards females. After the first breeding season, sex of offspring was influenced more strongly by body condition than by age, and females in good condition were more likely to have sons. Individual females that showed a between-year gain in condition were also more likely to produce a male in the subsequent year. 4. Body mass of male offspring at 5 months was positively correlated with maternal condition. No relationship was found between maternal condition and mass of female offspring. 5. We conclude that patterns of change in sex allocation in relation to individual life histories of female common brushtail possums can be explained by the interaction of TW and LRC effects. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",34,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Local resource competition | Maternal effects | Reproductive investment | Sex ratio | Trivers-Willard,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,77

Explanations for the integration of migratory and non-migratory (resident) birds in the Neotropics have been complicated by the paradox that arthropod abundances are low when bird abundances reach their annual peak. The breeding currency hypothesis offers an explanation for this paradox by postulating that resident birds are limited in the breeding season by the availability of large arthropods suitable for reproduction, whereas the carrying capacity of all birds in the non-breeding season is limited by the availability of arthropods suitable for self-maintenance of adults. 2. Field data from Jamaica supported this hypothesis. Among 19 sites, the ratio of migrant to resident bird abundance was correlated negatively with the ratio of large arthropod biomass in the breeding season to total arthropod biomass in the non-breeding season. 3. However, after controlling for effects of arthropod seasonality, migrant to resident bird abundance ratios were higher in human-disturbed than undisturbed sites. 4. Other factors may interact with the availability of food for nestlings to limit the populations of resident birds below carrying capacities set by non-breeding season arthropod abundance, thereby creating a set of resources available to non-breeding migrants. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",34,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Competition | Consumer-resource model | Food | Insectivore | Migration | Seasonality,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,79

Models linking the behaviours of individual animals, their positions within socially complex groups and spatio-temporal variation in resource distribution offer a promising base for predicting population responses to changing environments. The ideal free and despotic distributions and their derivatives are particularly influential in this regard. 2. Due to the difficulties of conducting work in the wild, for some groups of animals such models are often based on observations of animals in small-scale systems under conditions that are well controlled, but unnaturally simple. 3. Using an experimental system based on field observations of home range size and variation in food availability, the present study tested whether models derived using small-scale laboratory observations are valid for juvenile Atlantic salmon in more natural conditions. 4. Contrary to predictions, we found no differences in behaviour between the control fish (which experienced consistently rich feeding patches) and the experimental fish (which experienced unpredictable 10-fold changes in patch quality). 5. Also contrary to predictions, in the variable condition, salmon used high quality patches (which were an order of magnitude better than low quality patches) only marginally (5%) more than would be expected if they were to forage at random. There was significant variation in foraging strategies between individual fish, with 28% of the population making non-random use of foraging patches. 6. The only apparent systematic relationship between social rank and use of foraging patches was that fish that were both dominant and made many moves between feeding locations tended to leave rich patches less frequently than they left poor patches. 7. Despite the low correlation between patch quality and movement, there was substantial movement of fish among patches.

The study exposes a discrepancy between expectations derived from the basic concepts of patch choice theory and the behaviour of Atlantic salmon in the conditions pertaining in the present study. 9.

Drought is a natural disturbance that can cause widespread mortality of aquatic organisms in wetlands. We hypothesized that seasonal drying of marsh surfaces (i.e. hydrological disturbance) shapes spatio-temporal patterns of fish populations. 2. We tested whether population dynamics of fishes were synchronized by hydrological disturbance (Moran effect) or distance separating study sites (dispersal). Spatio-temporal patterns were examined in local populations of five abundant species at 17 sites (sampled five times per year from 1996 to 2001) in a large oligotrophic wetland. 3. Fish densities differed significantly across spatio-temporal scales for all species. For all species except eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), a significant portion of spatio-temporal variation in density was attributed to drying events (used as a covariate). 4. We observed three patterns of response to hydrological disturbance. Densities of bluefin killifish (Lucania goodei), least killifish (Heterandria formosa), and golden top-minnow (Fundulus chrysotus) were usually lowest after a dry down and recovered slowly. Eastern mosquitofish showed no distinct response to marsh drying (i.e. they recovered quickly). Flagfish (Jordanella floridae) density was often highest after a dry down and then declined. Population growth after a dry down was often asymptotic for bluefin killifish and golden topminnow, with greatest asymptotic density and longest time to recovery at sites that dried infrequently. 5. Fish population dynamics were synchronized by hydrological disturbance (independent of distance) and distance separating study sites (independent of hydrological disturbance). Our ability to separate the relative importance of the Moran effect from dispersal was strengthened by a weak association between hydrological synchrony and distance among study sites. Dispersal was the primary mechanism for synchronous population dynamics of flagfish, whereas hydrological disturbance was the primary mechanism for synchronous population dynamics of the other species examined. 6. Species varied in the relative role of the Moran effect and dispersal in homogenizing their population dynamics, probably as a function of life history and ability to exploit dry-season refugia. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",97,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Dispersal | Drought | Florida Everglades | Moran effect | Spatial synchrony,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,81

Sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana Douglas) seeds are dispersed by wind, but yellow pine chipmunks (Tamias amoenus Allen) and Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri Gmelin) gather the seeds and scatter-hoard them. Chipmunks and jays store seeds in a similar manner, and during cache recovery they appear to compete for stored seeds. 2. A series of aviary studies and radioactive seed studies in the field were used to examine how chipmunks and jays interact over stored seeds. 3. Aviary studies revealed that chipmunks use spatial memory and olfaction to find seeds, including those stored by conspecifics and jays, whereas jays use spatial memory and observational learning, so they usually find only the seeds that they have stored. Use of olfaction makes chipmunks much better pilferers than jays. 4. In the field, both chipmunks and jays have a recovery advantage (they retrieve their own caches 3.6 faster than do pilferers), and chipmunk caches disappear 3.4 faster than jay caches. 5. Steller's jays appear to avoid chipmunk pilferage by caching seeds in closed-canopy pine forests with little shrub understorey where chipmunks seldom forage, whereas chipmunks cache under shrubs in forest openings. The risk of pilferage by chipmunks appears to force jays to cache in forests. 6. Competition between chipmunks and jays for stored seeds might have indirect effects on sugar pine seedling establishment because seedlings survive better when under shrubs. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",45,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Cache pilferage | Competition in distantly related taxa | Food caching | Indirect interactions | Seed dispersal,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,82

It is theoretically well established that body mass in birds is the consequence of a trade-off between starvation risk and predation risk. There are, however, no studies of mass variation from sufficiently large wild populations to model in detail the range of diurnal and seasonal mass change patterns in natural populations and how these are linked to the complex environmental and biological variables that may affect the trade-off. 2. This study used data on 17 000 individual blackbirds Turdus merula to model how mass changes diurnally and seasonally over the whole year and over a wide geographical area. Mass change was modelled in respect of temperature, rainfall, day length, geographical location, time of day and time of year and the results show how these mass changes vary with individual size, age and sex. 3. The hypothesis that seasonal mass is optimized over the year and changes in line with predictors of foraging uncertainty was tested. As theory predicts, reduced day length and reduced temperature result in increased mass and the expected seasonal peak of mass in midwinter. 4. The hypothesis that diurnal mass gain is optimized in terms of starvation-predation risk trade-off theory was also tested. The results provide the first empirical evidence for intraspecies seasonal changes in diurnal mass gain patterns. These changes are consistent with shifts in the relative importance of starvation risk and predation risk and with the theory of mass-dependent predation risk. 5. In winter most mass was gained in the morning, consistent with reducing starvation risk. In contrast, during the August-November non-breeding period a bimodal pattern of mass gain, with increases just after dawn and before dusk, was adopted and the majority of mass gain occurred at the end of the day consistent with reducing mass-dependent predation risk. The bimodal diurnal mass gain pattern described here is the first evidence that bird species in the wild gain mass in this theoretically predicted pattern. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",94,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Blackbird | Diurnal mass gain | Energy reserves | Mass change | Mass-dependent predation,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,83

Recent research reveals the widespread influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), a large-scale climatic variation, on northern ungulate populations. Little is known, however, about the influence of the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO), a similar climatic index, on ungulates. 2. The influence of the NPO on elk population dynamics in Banff National Park (BNP) was examined using a 15-year time-series of three elk subpopulations exposed to different levels of predation by wolves. NPO was strongly related to local climate data including snow depth (r = +0.61) and winter temperatures (r = -0.51). 3. Higher NPO values reflected increasing winter severity, reducing elk population-growth rate irrespective of wolf-predation pressure. Elk population-growth rate, however, declined more strongly in areas with wolf predation through the interaction with winter severity, indexed by NPO. Effects of NPO were weaker in the absence of wolf predation. 4. Differences between the effects of snow and NPO were revealed that depended on wolf-predation pressure. Without wolf predation, NPO reduced elk population-growth rate, suggesting overall climate was important. With wolf predation, snow depth was more important than NPO, suggesting a mechanism of increased wolf-predation rates in deeper snow. 5.

Habitat edges are thought to explain much of the negative effects arising from habitat fragmentation; however, progress has been limited in extrapolating edge effects to different situations because ecologists still do not understand if and how multiple edges interact within fragments. It also remains controversial whether edge effects govern patch-size effects, such as area sensitivity, observed in many migratory songbirds. 2. I examined how multiple edges within fragments may intensify edge responses by investigating spatial distributions of an area-sensitive songbird that breeds in temperate grasslands of North America, the bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus Linnaeus). I tested whether bobolinks avoid edges and whether avoidance is stronger near two edges (double-edge plots) than near only one edge (single-edge plots). I subsequently linked bobolink distributions to landscape maps that vary in the amount of habitat and degree of fragmentation to explore some potential implications of multiple edges on patch- and landscape-level distributions. 3. Multiple edges appeared to influence the magnitude of observed edge effects, in which the probability of bobolink occurrence was four times lower in double-edge plots and two times lower in single-edge plots than in the interior of grasslands. Within single-edge plots, the probability of occurrence increased with increasing distance from edge. Within double-edge plots, the probability of occurrence increased as a function of the nearest and next-nearest distances from edges. Multiple edges also appeared to increase the extent of edge effects, or distance of edge influence, which was estimated to be approximately 11-33% greater in double-edge plots than in single-edge plots, depending on the next-nearest distance from edge. 4. Extrapolating local bird distributions to landscape models suggests that edge effects can have strong influences on large-scale distributions and that models incorporating multiple edge effects are different to simple nearest-edge models only in highly fragmented landscapes, regardless of landscape composition. Furthermore, edge effects can lead to patch-size effects similar to empirical patterns of area sensitivity observed in this species. I conclude that edge effects can be intensified when multiple edges collide, a feature that permeates many fragmented landscapes. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",109,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Bobolink | Dolichonyx oryzivorus | Edge effect | Habitat edge | Patch-size effects,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,86

Phenotypic plasticity and microevolution represent the two processes by which phenotypic traits in a population can track environmental change. While there is a growing literature documenting microevolution in reproductive traits in naturally occurring animal populations, few studies to date have examined either between-individual variation in levels of plasticity or how selection acts on plasticity. 2. We present here mixed-effect linear models analysing changes in calving date in relation to autumn rainfall observed over a 30-year study of 2147 red deer on the Isle of Rum, Scotland. The study period is characterized by a phase of low and rising population density (up to and including 1980), followed by a phase of high and fluctuating population density (1981 to present). 3. Variation within individual females explained a population-level trend of delayed calving dates following years of high autumn rainfall. There was significant variation between females both in their average calving dates and in their individual plastic responses of calving date to autumn rainfall. 4. Females born in the low population density phase were, on average, phenotypically plastic for the calving date-autumn rainfall relationship, and showed significant variation in plasticity. Selection favoured individuals with early average calving dates among these females. 5. Among females born at high population density, there was on average no significant plasticity for calving date, but variation in plastic responses was still present. Selection favoured females with increasingly positive plastic responses of calving date to autumn rainfall. 6. We argue that early experience of high population density affects the physiological condition of females, making an environmental response (calving early following dry autumns) in later life physiologically untenable for all but a few high quality individuals. These same few individuals also tend to be fitter and have higher reproductive success. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",83,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Cervus elaphus | Natural selection | Phenotypic plasticity | Rainfall | Timing of breeding,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,87

The ability to resist infection is an important component of survival and lifetime reproductive success. Mounting and maintaining an immunological defence is assumed to be energetically costly and nutritional resources expended on immune function may induce trade-offs with other energetically expensive functions, including reproduction. Resource limitation may even have transgenerational effects on immune function during reproduction because mothers are the primary source of humoral immunity in young vertebrates. 2. To determine whether protein restriction affects humoral immunity, either within or across generations, we fed adult Japanese quail Coturnix japonica isocaloric diets containing either the recommended protein content for reproducing adults (20%), or a low protein diet (12%). 3. Females fed the low protein diet weighed less than control females and produced fewer eggs that were smaller in size. However, dietary treatment did not affect the antibody response to a novel antigen (SRBCs) or immunoglobulin concentration (IgG = IgY) in either females or their eggs. 4. This suggests that the magnitude of the humoral immune response is either not constrained by protein availability or that birds can compensate for low dietary protein intake when fed ad libitum. Maternal protein reserves may be catabolized to support egg production and antibody formation under protein restriction such that only very severe malnutrition would affect immune function. Future work should address whether other resources mediate the trade-off between immunity and reproduction or whether other components of the immune response are impacted by resource limitation. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",55,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Antibody transmission | Immunity | Maternal effects | Protein | Trade-off,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,88

Positive correlations between energy and species richness are frequently observed, but the causal mechanisms of such species-energy relationships have rarely been identified conclusively. 2. The more individuals hypothesis (MIH) describes one possible cause of positive species-energy relationships. It suggests that greater resource availability in high-energy areas increases population sizes, reducing local extinction rates and promoting species richness. It predicts that extinction rates will be lower in high-energy areas and that, because a given change in population size has a greater influence on extinction risk when initial populations are small, such relationships will be more pronounced in numerically rare species than more abundant ones. 3. Colonization rates may also influence local species richness, and they may respond positively to the greater resource abundance in high-energy areas. 4. We provide the first empirical test of relationships between extinction/ colonization rates and energy availability and of the influence of population size on these relationships. We use data on the changing distributions of British birds, in which positive species-energy relationships have previously been documented. 5. We find that extinction rates are lower in high-energy areas, but that such patterns are stronger in more abundant species. Spatial variation in colonization rates is influenced less markedly by energy availability, but such patterns are also more marked in numerically abundant species. While these results provide little overall support for the MIH, nor some of its alternatives, they add to increasing evidence that common species drive much of the spatial variation in species richness. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",32,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Abundance | Energy availability | More individuals hypothesis | Rarity | Species richness,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,89

We explore the relationship between patch occupancy and local abundance in a general model for regional population dynamics. We vary colonization ability and key demographic and habitat characteristics in order to explore the effects on abundance-occupancy relationships. 2. In populations in which colonization rates are very high, new habitat is rapidly colonized and there is a simple asymptotic relationship between occupancy and abundance, assuming that habitat quality and abundance are linked. 3. If colonization rates are moderate to low, as in metapopulations, there is similarly a positive relationship between occupancy and abundance, but there is a minimum abundance below which the metapopulation becomes extinct. 4. These responses are modulated by the occurrence of Allee effects, demographic stochasticity or depensatory effects: when such effects are significant, the metapopulation rescue effect becomes important, and regional occupancy becomes more sensitive to changes in local density. 5. Finally, in populations in which colonization rates are very low, there is no relationship between occupancy and abundance. 6. Our results emphasize two aspects of large-scale ecology as being key in generating positive abundance-occupancy relationships: (i) a relationship between average habitat quality and the proportion of habitat that is habitable; and (ii) the nature of colonization. It is important to note that colonization is a function of dispersal, fecundity, and local processes such as Allee effects, as well as the availability and isolation of habitat patches. 7. When an abundance-occupancy relationship exists there is typically a non-linear scaling from local to total population sizes at low population densities, and we discuss how this may be detected in real data, as well as its implications. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",85,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,British birds | Extinction threshold | Macroecology | Population size | Tree sparrows,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,90

Factors affecting population birth sex ratio and variations of sex ratios within popu-lation in very long-lived animals are poorly known, apart for humans that have attracted much attention. We measured the age and sex structure of a population of a monogamous long-lived seabird, the wandering albatross Diomedea exulans, where reproductive performance of individuals is known, to examine factors affecting sex ratio variation and survival consequences of producing a particular sex. 2. The overall sex ratio at hatching is significantly biased toward the production of males. Very young and old parents tend to produce an excess of female offsprings, whereas intermediate-aged birds, which represent the bulk of the population, produce an excess of males. Low-quality parents (quality is measured as average breeding success over the cumulated past breeding life, and is not related to condition or age) produce more female chicks compared with high-quality parents that represent the bulk of the population. The combined effect of age and quality of parents produce an extensive sex ratio variation at the level of the population. 3. The survival of male and female parents is influenced differently by their quality and by the sex of offspring. Male parents die in larger numbers when rearing a female chick, whereas low-quality female parents have a lower survival, especially when they rear a male offspring, the sex needing higher parental investment. The differences between males and females parents' survival are probably due their contrasted investment in parental care. 4. After fledging, during the 5-8-year period of immaturity, there is a much higher mortality of males that balances the surplus of males at hatching and fledging and results in a similar number of males and females at the time of recruitment. However, the overall operational sex ratio is male biased due to the slightly higher mortality of adult females that results in an excess of old widowed males: excluding these post-reproductive males leads to an unbiased operational sex ratio. 5. These results show that sex ratio at hatching varies extremely with the age and phenotypic quality of parents, and lead to a complex age and sex structure of the population in this strictly monogamous long-lived species. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",91,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Age effect | Individual quality | Operational sex ratio | Recruitment | Survival,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,91

Birth date can be important to lifetime reproductive success. However, selection for birth date has rarely been addressed in fish, despite the opportunity provided by otolith microstructure. 2. This study examined the relationship between maternal age, spawning time and early survivorship in the North Sea haddock stock. Temporal changes in egg production were compared with the birth date distribution of progeny surviving to the demersal phase in 1994, 1996 and 1999, when the age structure of the spawning stock differed. 3. Estimates of intra-annual variation in stock egg production indicated that first-time spawning 2-year-olds began spawning much later than older age-classes. 4. The form and magnitude of selection on birth date varied between years, indicating that the production of multiple batches of eggs over an extended period has some adaptive significance to progeny survival. 5. Survivorship was consistently poor from the late spawning period when age 2 females contributed most to stock egg production. This persistent selection against late hatched offspring could reflect either low parental investment, as age 2 females produce smaller eggs, or the short length of the growing season prior to settlement. 6. Variability in birth date selection, particularly with respect to first vs. subsequent years of spawning, implies a strong selection pressure for a long reproductive lifespan. As such, reproductive potential in this and other exploited fish species with a similar reproductive trait may have been affected adversely by the general decline in repeat spawning females in recent years. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",60,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Birth date analysis | Haddock | Maternal effects | Otolith microstructure,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,92

Age at first breeding has a large influence on fitness and hence is crucial to the evolution of life-history strategies. Goshawks Accipiter gentilis start breeding aged 1-4 years. Using 30 years of data and both lifetime reproductive success (LRS) and λind as a fitness estimate for 74 female goshawks, I showed that the optimal age at first reproduction was 3 years in this population. 2. Females that started to breed earlier had lower LRS and λind, not because of reduced life span, but because of lower reproduction at early ages. 3. The constraint hypothesis, which states that foraging or other skills improve with age was the most likely explanation for the higher reproduction with increasing age. 4. Incorporating habitat heterogeneity provided the mechanism that explained not only the fitness cost to early maturity, but also why this cost was heterogeneous. Females starting to breed aged 1 suffered a very high fitness cost if they were in a bad-quality territory, but fitness costs were small when they were in a good-quality territory. This explains why I found evidence for a nonlinear selection pressure on age at first breeding. 5. Population density also affected whether a female started to breed early or not: over the study period, population density increased and the percentage of females starting to breed aged 1 decreased. 6. The optimal age at first breeding seems to be a trait affected by a complex interplay between cost and benefits of early reproduction mediated by habitat heterogeneity and population density. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",81,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Delayed maturity | Fitness | Life-history evolution | Selection | Territory quality,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,93

Distinctive sponge faunas of Caribbean coral reefs and mangroves seem to support the assumption that abiotic factors determine sponge diversity within habitats and faunal differences between habitats because these habitats differ greatly in abiotic characteristics and because lower species diversity on mangroves appears to reflect their inferiority as sponge habitat. 2. A way to test this assumption is provided by unusual mangrove cays in Belize that are inhabited by the typical Caribbean reef sponge fauna. Reciprocal transplant experiments, combined with caging (predator-free space) and artificial substrata (competitor-free space), demonstrated control of community membership by biological interactions for 12 common species: spongivorous predators excluded typical mangrove sponges from reef sponge assemblages, and reef sponges were excluded from mangrove sponge assemblages by competition. 3. Variation in growth rate was related inversely to variation in defences against predators in the species studied, suggesting a trade-off between resistance to competitors and to predators. 4. This trade-off influences community structure, as the key importance of competition for space among mangrove species results in lower within-habitat diversity, while multiple challenges, including predation, may maintain high diversity of reef sponges. Differences in species composition between habitats are maintained, as this trade-off precludes success of individual species as members of both faunas. 5. Most surprising is that typical faunas of mangroves and reefs are not tied to these habitats by abiotic factors. Greater sponge species diversity on the reef does not necessarily indicate superior conditions for sponges. Instead reefs may be a refuge for species that grow too slowly to coexist with typical mangrove species. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",59,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Caribbean | Coral reefs | Mangroves | Porifera | Spongivory,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,94

Understanding the trade-off females make between offspring size and number requires knowing how neonatal size, and traits associated with size, affect survival. 2. We studied neonatal survival in the northern watersnake Nerodia sipedon in outdoor enclosures with artificial hibernation sites. 3. From a total of 950 neonates from 77 litters collected over 3 years, we found a survival rate of 65% between birth and hibernation and 47% during hibernation. Estimated survival from birth to the end of hibernation was 31%, comparable with indirect estimates for free-living watersnakes. 4. Consistent with the 'bigger is better' hypothesis, larger neonates and neonates heavier relative to their body length were more likely to survive both the pre-hibernation and hibernation periods. 5. Survival in the pre-hibernation period also decreased with the duration of that period and varied among years. 6. Survival during hibernation was higher in warmer winters. Mass change prior to hibernation did not affect survival during hibernation. 7. These results suggest that an optimal reproductive strategy should exist for female watersnakes, producing a 'consensus' among females on the optimal size for offspring.

Colonization is critical to invasion propensity and the viability of fragmented populations. This study evaluates the behavioural and demographic effects of patch occupancy on immigration in the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara). 2. We manipulated connected two-patch systems during one year. Two treatments were contrasted: both patches initially occupied vs. one occupied patch connected to one empty patch. Effects of manipulation were measured on emigration from occupied patches, on settlement in arrival patches and on demographic parameters in residents and immigrants. 3. Settlement probability was not influenced by the presence of conspecifics, but unsettled lizards stayed longer in initially empty than in occupied patches. The relationship between yearlings' body condition and emigration probability was affected by the manipulation, indicating that different yearlings disperse depending upon metapopulation structure. 4. Growth and maturation rate were influenced positively in juveniles colonizing empty patches, whereas there was no difference between immigrants to occupied patches and residents. Faster growth allowed female juvenile immigrants to reproduce earlier during colonization. No effect on growth or reproduction was detected in yearlings and adults. Selective benefits of colonization at the juvenile stage may provide an ultimate explanation for why natal dispersal prevails over breeding dispersal in this species. 5. At the population level, immigration and increased reproductive recruitment led to higher population growth in colonized patches. This may contribute to the species' capacity to develop and maintain a wide geographical distribution. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",42,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Colonization | Habitat selection | Lacerta vivipara | Metapopulation,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,96

Avian brood parasites include species that are host specialists and others that are generalists. The impact of each kind of parasite on the persistence of the host population is studied by means of a population dynamics model. 2. Our model examines conditions for coexistence and invasions in a community of three South American cowbirds, the shiny cowbird Molothrus bonariensis (a generalist parasite), the screaming cowbird M. rufoaxillaris (a specialist parasite), and the baywinged cowbird Agelaiodes badius (a nonparasite that hosts the other two). 3. Three biologically realistic characteristics not previously included in brood parasitism models are explored and shown to be crucial for the stability of the system. These characteristics are: (i) female parasites take at least a day to produce an egg and cannot store eggs for delayed laying - this is modelled by means of a type II functional response; (ii) parasites often remove or puncture (destroy) host eggs when visiting a nest; and (iii) hosts desert nests when the total clutch (host plus parasite) exceeds some threshold. 4. These characteristics have a direct impact on parasite population renewal and reduce dramatically the stable coexistence conditions. 5. Comparing the stability conditions of the host-specialist system with those of the three-species system shows the impact of the arrival of a generalist parasite on the persistence of the host-specialist system when the three characteristics are present. The stability boundaries are restricted when the generalist is absent and change little for a realistic density of generalist. 6. The study of invasion by a specialist into a host-generalist stable community shows that the parameter region for coexistence and invasion coincide. 7. Comparison of our model against its precursors using field data for the parameters when available, shows that the three-species cowbird model system is stable for empirically realized parameter values, unlike a previous model by May & Robinson (1985; American Naturalist, 126, 475-494) where none of the three characteristics were included. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",5,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Brood parasitism | Cowbirds | Host specialism | Molothrus sp. | Population dynamics,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,98

The specialist insects responded to varying host-plant abundance in two contrasting ways: as expected, specialist herbivore species were more likely to be present when their host-plant species were abundant; however, counter to predictions, in plots where specialists were present we found strong negative linear relationships between herbivore loads and host-plant abundances - a 'resource dilution' rather than concentration effect. 4.

The presence of a cost of reproduction was confirmed by an experiment where a subset of females was prevented from breeding in their first year of life. 5. Our results suggest that breeding decisions are quality or condition dependent.

Rate-maximizing foragers that only divide their time between searching and handling prey should, according to the classical contingency model (CM), only select those prey whose energy content per unit handling time (i.e. profitability) exceeds or equals long-term average energy intake rate. 2. However, if digestively constrained foragers were to follow this so-called 'zero-one rule', they would need to take digestive breaks and their energy intake over total time would not be maximized. They should, according to the digestive rate model (DRM), also consider the rate at which a prey type is digested (i.e. digestive quality), such that time lost to digestive breaks is minimized. 3. In three different contexts, we tested these competing models in a mollusc-eating shorebird, the red knot (Calidris canutus), that is often digestively constrained due to its habit of ingesting its bulky prey whole. Measurements on gizzard size (using ultrasonography) and prey-characteristics confirmed that in each test the birds were digestively bottlenecked and should thus follow the DRM in order to maximize long-term energy intake. 4. In the first experiment, knots were offered a choice between two fully exposed prey, and tended to select prey by the criterion of digestive quality rather than profitability. 5. In the second experiment, knots were offered two buried prey types and preferred the highest quality prey to the most profitable prey. 6. In the wild, knots mainly fed on high quality Mya and largely ignored poor quality, but equally profitable, Cerastoderma. 7. Thus, each test verified the predictions of the DRM and rejected those of the CM.

Predation risk was measured as the rate of raptors flying over. This danger from the environment did not directly affect the departure decision of wheatears, but their FDR was negatively correlated with predation risk. Thus, predation risk influenced the stopover decision via FDR, because time-minimizers are said to skip stopover sites with low FDR when better refuelling conditions may be expected elsewhere along the migration route. 4.

In several regions of South America, the neotropical jumping spider Psecas chapoda inhabits and reproduces strictly on the bromeliad Bromelia balansae. Previous studies reported that this spider is more frequent on bromeliads in grasslands than on those growing in forests, and on larger plants, but only when the bromeliads are without inflorescence. Upon blooming, B. balansae fold their leaves back, thereby changing the plant architecture from a tri-dimensional to a bi-dimensional flattened shape, and our hypothesis is that this alteration affects the spider's habitat-selection decisions. 2. In the present study, we examined experimentally the effects of inflorescence, plant size and blockade of the axil of the leaves (spider shelters) of forest bromeliads on the colonization of a bromeliad by P. chapoda. By using sticky traps, we also compared prey availability in grassland and forest. 3. Plants with simulated inflorescence were colonized at a lower frequency than those without inflorescence simulation. Grassland bromeliads in which the rosettes were blocked with dry leaves were colonized less frequently than open bromeliads, whereas forest bromeliads from which dry leaves had been removed were not colonized. Spiders generally abandoned bromeliads in which three-quarters of the length of the leaves had been removed, although females with eggsacs remained on these plants. Prey availability (biomass and number) was up to 18 fold higher in the grassland than in the forest. These results suggest that microhabitat structure and prey availability shape the spatial distribution of P. chapoda populations. 4. Our findings suggest that Psecas chapoda can evaluate, in fine detail, the physical state of its microhabitat, and this unusual spider-plant association is readily destabilized by changes in the microhabitat (i.e., it is strictly dependent on the size and morphology of the host plant).

Evidence suggests that changes of temperature-related performance curves can trigger a selective response in life-history traits. Hence, it should be expected that insects adapted to different temperature regimes should exhibit optimal performance at the temperature to which they are adapted. 2. To test this idea we investigated how fecundity and longevity are influenced by ambient temperatures in a set of satyrine butterflies adapted to live in dry open landscapes or in closed forest landscapes, respectively, by keeping egg-laying adult females at five different constant temperatures ranging between 20 and 40°C. 3. We studied four species, two of which are confined to dry and hot open habitats, namely the grayling (Hipparchia semele) and the small heath (Coenonympha pamphilus), and two of which are shade dwelling, namely the ringlet (Aphantopus hyperantus) and the speckled wood butterfly (Pararge aegeria). 4. As predicted, the results showed that lifetime fecundity exhibited bell-shaped curves in relation to temperature with the open landscape group peaking at a higher temperature, 30°C, compared with the shade-dwelling group that peaked at 25°C. Longevity decreased with increasing temperatures among all species, but the open landscape living species survived better at higher temperatures. Moreover, although the magnitude of reproductive effort measured as lifetime egg mass did not differ between the two ecological groups, lifetime fecundity did with open landscape species laying more and smaller eggs than the shade-dwelling species. 5. This difference in life-history character traits suggests either that dry and relatively warm open habitats open life-history opportunities in terms of higher fecundity and longevity that remain closed to butterflies adapted to cooler temperatures, or that life in dry open habitats actively selects for higher fecundity and survival as a result of increased offspring mortality.",68,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Fitness | Lepidoptera | Life history | Nymphalidae | Reproduction | Temperature,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,105

Dispersal in many species is sex-biased. Greenwood (1980, Animal Behaviour, 28, 1140-1162) hypothesized that the direction of sex bias was dependent on the mating system, and suggested that female-biased dispersal in birds is associated with monogamy and resource defence by males, while mammalian male-biased dispersal is associated with polygyny and male defence of mates. 2. Cooperatively breeding brown jays Cyanocorax morio live in large territorial groups and are one of the few bird species known to exhibit male-biased dispersal. Survivorship of adults is high, and both males and females delay breeding for many years. 3. In this study, dispersers almost always moved to neighbouring social groups, rarely in response to a known breeding vacancy, and both sexes dispersed into groups with fewer members of the same sex than their origin group. 4. Dispersal and extra-group forays were strongly male biased. Forays were more common during nest building and egg laying, suggesting that males were monitoring mating opportunities, and many males later dispersed into the groups they visited. Genetic parentage analyses indicated that males mainly obtain paternity outside their natal groups through extra-group forays and dispersal. 5. The major routes to breeding status for females are inheritance of breeding positions on their natal territories and/or breeding there concurrently with an established breeder. Females usually dispersed on their own into groups where reproductive success had previously been poor. 6. Kin facilitation appears to affect male dispersal options: related males formed coalitions and tended to disperse to groups where male relatives were already established. 7. Male dispersal, female philopatry, and a matrilineal society correspond to three of Greenwood's seven predictions for a 'mate-defence' system, but overt mate defence itself is absent, territorial defence is communal, and genetic polyandry is common. Social behaviour appears to affect a reversal in sex-specific costs and benefits of dispersal, so that females benefit from philopatry and matrilineal inheritance, while males benefit from expanded dispersal options in part through kin facilitation, but without effective mate defence or clear cut sex-specific resource defence.",72,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Cooperative breeding | New World jays | Sex-biased dispersal | Tropical birds,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,106

The movement of species from their native ranges to alien environments is a serious threat to biological diversity. The number of individuals involved in an invasion provides a strong theoretical basis for determining the likelihood of establishment of an alien species. 2.

Six years after their original release, psyllids were present in 22 of the 55 release sites. Analysis by logistic regression showed that the probability of establishment was significantly and positively related to initial release size, but that this effect was important only during the psyllids' first year in the field. 4. Although less likely to establish, some of the releases of two and four psyllids did survive 5 years in the field. Overall, releases that survived their first year had a 96% chance of surviving thereafter, providing the release site remained secure. The probability of colony loss due to site destruction remained the same throughout the experiment, whereas the probability of natural extinction reduced steeply over time. 5. During the first year colonies were undergoing a process of establishment and, in most cases, population size decreased. After this first year, a period of exponential growth ensued. 6.

In studies of processes in ecosystems, species are often merged into functional groups. The concept of functional groups requires that species have a similar function with respect to some process. However, in many cases little is known whether the actual species are sufficiently similar. 2. In the present study, species-specificity among lake-dwelling detritivores was investigated. Microcosms were used to test 10 species of shredders regarding ability to process alder (Alnus glutinosa) and oak (Quercus robur) leaves. Taxonomically, nine species were caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera Limnephilidae) and one a freshwater louse (Isopoda Asellidae). 3. The shredders differed significantly in ability to process leaf litter. The most common shredder in lakes of the study area (SE Sweden), the isopod Asellus aquaticus, was shown to be inferior both in terms of capacity per individual and per g animal biomass. Also among the trichopterans, significant differences were found. 4. Consequently, these species cannot be treated as a unit with equal properties in the decomposition process. 5. In addition, 12 multispecies combinations of the shredders were tested for synergistic effects breaking down alder and oak leaves. No positive or negative effects due to species richness were found; it was possible to predict the yield of multispecies treatments using the decomposition output from the single species experiment.",21,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Decomposition | Ecosystem functioning | Functional groups | Shredders | Species richness,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,108

We then compared the performance of kernel estimators with traditionally used minimum convex polygons (MCP). 2. Given the lack of a consistent across-male sample size-area relationship, we opted to use each male's full set of locations in the kernel calculation rather than standardizing sample size across males. 3. All locations collected for each male were biologically independent though statistically autocorrelated. Subsampling locations did not achieve independence even at time intervals far exceeding biological independence. 4. The physical space bounded by kernel and MCP methods differed drastically in certain cases, especially in situations where there were large areas within a territory that were never visited during our data collection sessions. 5. Kernel methods of territory estimation were far more accurate and informative than MCP for cerulean warblers. We suggest that evenly sampling individuals in a biologically relevant manner during a strictly defined study period is more important than standardizing sample size across individuals. Furthermore, sampling regimes can safely be guided by biological vs. statistical independence timelines. 6.

Cooperation in prey capture has never been reported for a solitary spider. Here, we conducted a laboratory experiment to determine if group hunting occurs in the ant-eating Zodarion spiders and if it yields higher individual benefit than solitary prey capture. 2. Spiderlings of the second instar were kept in groups of one, three and six individuals. Their foraging behaviour was studied with two ant species as prey: a large Messor and a small Tapinoma. 3. Groups of three and six spiders had better capture success than a single individual. The paralysis time of Messor was reduced as the number of spiders in a group increased, while that of Tapinoma ants was similar for all group sizes. The feeding time on Messor increased with the number of spiders in a group; all six individuals could feed simultaneously. For Tapinoma ants, six spiders fed for a significantly shorter time than the group of three spiders due to more intraspecific interactions. Only one to two spiders fed on Tapinoma at the same time. For spiders feeding on Messor the individual gain was on average 1.5 times greater than that when feeding on Tapinoma. The per capita gain decreased with group size but was not shared equally between the group members: the catchers gained about twice as much as the intruders. The catchers, however, experienced higher capture risk than intruders. 4. Our results show that solitary foraging is more beneficial when Zodarion spiders hunt small ants, while the strategy of group foraging is more beneficial when hunting large ants. The observed foraging behaviour of immature Zodarion spiders seems to be an example of mutual parasitism in which catchers are parasitized by intruders.

There is a current debate about the appropriateness of prey-dependent vs. ratio-dependent functional responses in predator-prey models. This is an important issue as systems governed by these models exhibit quite different dynamical behaviour. However, the issue is not yet resolved on a theoretical basis, and there is a lack of experimental evidence in natural systems. We used a paper wasp-shield beetle system in a natural setting to assess the validity of either approach. 2. We manipulated the abundance of herbivorous insect prey on thistle plants and of predatory paper wasps in the immediate environment of the prey by opening or closing cages containing wasp nests. 3. The number of wasps foraging at the site increased when cages were opened, but rapidly reached an asymptote, indicating predator interference. The predation rate per predator decreased with the number of wasps in the environment. Thus, the functional response depended on both prey and predator density. 4. Neither a pure prey- nor a pure ratio-dependent model fitted perfectly our observations. However, the functional response of the paper wasps towards shield beetle larvae was closer to ratio-dependence. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental evidence discriminating between ratio- and prey-dependence in a natural setting with unconfined predators and prey. 5. Predator interference was most probably responsible for the specific form of the functional response found. We found indications that both direct (e.g. aggression) and indirect interference mechanisms (e.g. depletion of easy-to-find prey) were at work in our system.

Mammalian life histories can be ordered along a slow-fast continuum from slow-developing, long-lived species with low reproductive rates at one end to rapidly developing, short-lived species with high reproductive rates at the other. Body size and mortality rate are strong correlates of the slow-fast axis, whereby juvenile and adult mortality rates correlate positively but are linked to certain life-history traits with differing strengths. The strong covariation of life-history traits renders it difficult to evaluate the adaptive value of single life-history elements. Species that deviate from the common pattern might help to identify specific selected strategies. 2. Caviomorph rodents show an unusual combination of life-history traits. Like slow-living mammals, they produce few precocial young after long gestation periods, but they have the early maturation potential of their fast-living counterparts. This combination of life-history traits suggests low levels of juvenile mortality but high adult mortality rates, and thus an unusually low ratio of juvenile to adult mortality compared to other small mammals. To test these predictions, we modelled age-specific survival probabilities using capture-recapture data from a wild population of Cavia magna. 3. Patterns of age-specific survival rates were in accordance with the predictions, but atypical for small mammals. Levels of adult survival were low, and comparable to those of much smaller rodent species. Juvenile survival probabilities were high relative to those reported for other small mammals and reached adult levels after only 1 month. The ratio of adult to early juvenile survival depended strongly on the date of birth. Whereas survival of young from the first birth cohort in spring did not differ from that of adults, early survivorship of later cohorts was lower. 4. Our results fit expectations from life-history theory and suggest that high levels of adult mortality selected for the early onset of reproduction in wild cavies. The comparatively low juvenile mortalities are probably a consequence of the precocial state of the cavy offspring. We suggest that the reproductive strategy of cavies represents a different solution to the trade-off between fecundity and juvenile survival compared to altricial small mammals.",57,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Altricical-precocial dichotomy | Cavies | Fecundity-juvenile survival trade-off | Slow-fast continuum | Small mammals,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,113

Gain functions decelerated with patch residence time, but there was considerable variation among individual animals and patch types in the nature of this response. Asymptotic and piecewise-linear models received the greatest support in the data. 3. Deceleration in gain was caused by a composite of effects that retarded instantaneous intake rate, including reductions in bite mass and increases in bite interval (time between successive bites). Bite interval increased as a result of increases in processing time of accumulated forage in the mouth, rather than increases in time allocated to cropping. 4.

Nestedness is a composite property of many suites of biotas. Such patterns may be driven by dispersal limitation, species-area relationships, hierarchical niche requirements, or occur as an artefact of passive sampling. Despite its widespread occurrence, few studies have explored the factors underlying nested subset structure, and ecological distinctions between nested and non-nested (idiosyncratic) taxa within a region have been largely ignored. 2. Macroinvertebrate assemblages from 45 heathland ponds in south-west England are used to (i) unravel the relative importance of processes driving nested subset structure and (ii) test spatially explicit hypotheses concerning the response of nested and idiosyncratic taxa to parameters shown to structure assemblage-level nestedness. 3. Despite being dominated by taxa with good powers of inter-site dispersal, pond macroinvertebrate assemblages were found to be significantly nested. This nesting was not due to passive sampling, and was best explained by pond area, with habitat parameters and isolation being of secondary importance. 4. The spatial responses of nested and idiosyncratic taxa matched predictions; nested taxa showed strong spatial structure, which was reduced when the effects of pond area and habitat were removed. In contrast, a greater proportion of idiosyncratic taxa were completely spatially random and exhibited weaker responses to factors that structure assemblage level nestedness. 5. Nested and idiosyncratic species tend to differ ecologically: idiosyncratic taxa generally possess broad ecological tolerance and good dispersal capacity, whilst nested species are more likely to have narrow tolerances or limited powers of dispersal. 6. Factors structuring nestedness in ponds can be viewed as probabilistic filters which act to limit the spatial distribution of species with narrow ecological tolerance or low dispersal tendency. Nestedness analysis alone fails to elucidate processes that structure assemblage composition.

Despite their documented effects on trophic interactions and community structure, parasites are rarely included in food web analyses. The transmission routes of most parasitic helminths follow closely the trophic relationships among their successive hosts and are thus embedded in food webs, in a way that may influence energy flow and the structure of the web. 2. We investigated the impact of parasitism on the food web structure of a New Zealand intertidal mudflat community. Different versions of the food web were analysed, one with no parasites, one with all parasite species and several other versions, each including a single parasite species. We measured key food web metrics such as food chain length, linkage density and proportions of top, intermediate and basal species. 3. The inclusion of all parasite species in the food web resulted in greatly increased mean and maximum food chain length, but had little impact on linkage density and realized connectance. The main change caused by introduction of parasites was the relegation of a number of species from top predators to intermediate status, although the addition of parasites as top predators left the actual ratio of predators to prey relatively unchanged. 4. When individual parasites were added to the food web, their effect on food web properties was generally minimal. However, one trematode species that affected several host species, because of its complex life cycle and low host specificity, produced food web properties similar to those in the web version including all parasite species. 5.

Reintroductions provide a good opportunity to study density-dependent population growth, as populations can be studied at a range of densities and the change in density is not confounded with environmental conditions. An understanding of density dependence is also necessary to predict dynamics of reintroduced populations under different management regimens, and assess the extent to which they can be harvested for further reintroductions. 2. We monitored a North Island saddleback (Philesturnus rufusater) population for 6 years after reintroduction to Mokoia, a 135 ha island in New Zealand that was made suitable for saddlebacks by eradicating introduced Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus). We modelled adult and juvenile survival using Program MARK, and modelled numbers of young fledged per pair using Proc Mixed in SAS with individual female as a random factor. 3. Juvenile survival clearly declined as the population increased, and the decline was closely correlated with the number of breeding pairs. Reproduction also showed a clear decline that was explained by two factors: a difference in quality between territories occupied immediately after reintroduction and those occupied later, and an overall decline as the number of pairs increased. Reproduction was also strongly affected by age, and this needed to be accounted for when modelling density dependence. 4. A stochastic simulation model incorporating these dynamics closely predicted the observed population growth. The equilibrium population size was insensitive to density dependence in reproduction, but highly sensitive to density dependence in juvenile survival. 5.

When prey occur at high densities, energy assimilation rates are generally constrained by rates of digestion rather than by rates of collection (i.e. search and handle). As predators usually select patches containing high prey densities, rates of digestion will play an important role in the foraging ecology of a species. 2. The red knot Calidris canutus shows tremendous inter- and intra-individual variation in maximum rates of digestion due to variation in the size of the processing machinery (gizzard and intestine), which makes it a suitable species to study the effects of digestive processing rate on foraging decisions. 3. Here we report on patch use, prey choice, and daily foraging times as a function of gizzard size in free-ranging, radio-marked, red knots. As knots crush their bulky bivalve prey in their gizzard, the size of this organ, which we measured using ultrasonography, determines digestive processing rate. 4. Using the digestive rate model, we a priori modelled patch use, prey choice, and daily foraging times as a function of gizzard mass. Focusing on two contrasting patches, birds with small gizzards were expected to feed on high-quality (soft-bodied) prey found in low densities in the one patch, while birds with large gizzards were expected to feed on low-quality (hard-shelled) prey found in high densities in the other patch. Assuming that red knots aim to balance their energy budget on a daily basis, we expected daily foraging time to decline with gizzard mass. 5. Observed patch and prey choices were in quantitative agreement with these theoretical predictions. Observed daily foraging times were only in qualitative agreement: they declined with gizzard mass but less steeply than predicted. 6. We discuss that red knots might be aiming for a slightly positive energy budget in order to (i) refuel their stores depleted during migration, and (ii) to insure against unpredictability in supply and demand during winter. Red knots arriving from their breeding grounds with small gizzards are only able to realize this aim when densities of soft-bodied prey are high, which is the case in late July and early August. Rapidly declining soft-bodied prey densities throughout late summer pose a major penalty for individuals arriving late at their wintering grounds. 7. The long daily foraging periods required by knots with small gizzards are only feasible through 'tide-extension'. In our study area, birds can and do raise the daily low tide period from 12 h to almost 17 h by moving along with the tide in an easterly direction, subsequently flying back to their starting point at the high tide roost.",98,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Digestive constraint | Foraging | Gizzard | Patch use | Prey choice | Time constraint,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,120
