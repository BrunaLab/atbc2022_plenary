Seedlings were planted at three months of age and the juveniles were monitored for two years. Treatments included: intact plants protected from mammals by cages, defoliated plants similarly protected, and unprotected plants, each planted in treefall gaps, on gap edges, and in the shaded understorey. Juveniles planted in treefall gaps survived seasonal drought far better than those planted on gap edges or in shaded understorey. Two years after establishment, juveniles protected from mammalian herbivory showed a 78% survival in gaps (mean 6.8% skylight), 50% survival on gap edges (mean 3.0% skylight), and 33% survival in shaded understorey (1.4% skylight). This advantage was due to accelerated growth in gaps. Juveniles in gaps increased 616% in height, 1075% in leaf number, and 1800% in total leaf area. Comparable numbers in edges were 247%, 378% and 690%; in understorey 33%, 222% and 289%. Accelerated growth in gaps permitted yearlings to survive drought that killed suppressed yearlings in understorey. Mean light differentials as small as 0.6% and 0.3% skylight significantly influenced survival on edges and in shaded understorey, respectively. Mammalian herbivory killed juveniles directly, and defoliation by mammals strongly accentuated drought mortality by suppressing root development. Natural defoliation was not attributable to gap conditions. Demographic projections from experimental data suggest that mammalian herbivory kills at least 48% of the juveniles of this species over two years, and contributes to the death of 32% more that actually die of drought stress. These projections suggest that 14% of the juveniles of this species die of drought mortality, independent of herbivory, during the first two years. Herbivory most strongly affects plants < 0.5 m in height, and is a continuing source of mortality among suppressed juveniles in the understorey. Steep slopes and large seed size each enhanced juvenile growth and survival in the intermediate conditions of gap edges, but not under the extreme conditions of gaps or shaded understorey. The context of establishment determines the ‘shade tolerance’ of this conspicuous canopy tree. Without serious mammalian herbivory or extreme dry seasons, V, surinamensis can easily recruit as a shade tolerant plant in the understorey. Under present conditions on Barro Colorado Island, it cannot. Persistence involves both the chances of arrival in different microhabitats, and survival therein. Projections that include both the forest area represented by gaps, gap edges, and understorey and the experimental results from this study indicate that juvenile V. surinamensis can survive for two years in gaps, edges, and understorey, but that the higher proportions of vigorous individuals survive in edges, gaps and understorey, respectively. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

The canopy heights (with height of the highest emergent in parentheses) ranged from 35-40 m (45 m) at 100 m to 20–23 m (32 m) at 2600 m; basal area was least (22.7 m2) at 100 m and highest (51.2 ma) at 2600 m; the tree (>10 cm dbh) density ranged from 391 ha-1at 500 m to 617 ha-1at 2600 m. Most trees were identified and on samples of them we recorded presence of buttresses, lianes, skiophytic climbers, vascular epiphytes and bryophytes; and drew profile diagrams. In the classification of Whitmore (1984) the two lower plots are evergreen lowland rain forests; the other four are lower montane rain forest. Species richness was highest in the plot at 500 m, with at least 135 species of tree, and least at 2600 m, with at least 35 species.

Mast fruiting of Vouacapoua at the beginning of the wet season coincides with scatter-hoarding seed dispersal. During the wet season, almost 100% of marked seeds on three sites were removed: nearly 70% were buried and the rest were eaten by mammals. Unburied seeds were attacked by insects and/or lost their ability to germinate. Rodents preferred ungerminated seeds, and had no interest in germinated seeds. Seeds were buried individually near natural objects such as palms, branches, logs, lianas, roots and trees. After predation by rodents, seedling distribution did not differ from seed distribution. Most seeds were transported less than 5 m from the feeding plots but some were carried as far as 22.4 m. Between 40 and 85% of dispersed seeds were retrieved during the following month by rodents and eaten. The disinterest of caviomorph rodents in germinated seeds, because of rapid exhaustion of endosperm reserves, prevents feeding from hoarded Vouacapoua during the long dry season when resources are scarce. Seedlings emerging from forgotten or abandoned cached seeds appear to increase the recruitment of Vouacapoua americana. © 1990, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved."

Trees in gaps displayed much less seasonality in fruit production than trees of intact forest sites. For example, ripe fruits were common on gap trees for a six month period (January-June) when few or no trees under intact canopy were in fruit. The frequent and aseasonal fruiting of gap trees demonstrates that they are not constrained by phenological cueing mechanisms; the influence of such cues is overridden by habitat. Trees in gaps also produced larger crops, had more extended fruiting episodes, and fruited more frequently than shaded conspecifics. This level of intra-specific variation in fruiting behaviour suggests that treefall gaps play an important role in determining the reproductive success of M. centrodesma. A substantial proportion of an individual's lifetime seed output may be produced during the brief period it occupies a gap. In addition, the large and continuous supply of fruits produced in gaps by M. centrodesma and other understorey plants, may mean that gaps function as ‘keystone habitats’ by providing resident frugi-vores with fruit during periods of general fruit scarcity. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

The proportion of ovigerous females did not increase in July or August when the number of rainy days was greater. However, breeding and egg laying were only observed in the latter season. The principal environmental change that stimulated oviposition was frequent daily rain which increased humidity in the terrestrial nest sites. Pair formation, nests, and males carrying larvae are reliable criteria that indicate the breeding period of Colostethus trinitatus. The average number of mature ovules (> 2 mm) was greater in the wet season (x=13.1) than during the dry months (x = 11.3). Female standard length and the number of yolked follicles was positively correlated. Five nests contained an average of 13.6 eggs, and males carried only slightly fewer larvae (x = 11.5).

An analysis of soil solution composition in the field indicated that K, P and NO3--N were being more effectively retained in weathered sand topsoil than in recent sand but, in a leaching experiment, only NO3--N was more effectively adsorbed by this soil. Fine roots in weathered sand were more concentrated superficially than in recent sand, and a bioassay with seedlings of Cedrela odorata showed more fine root proliferation in this medium than in recent sand. In combination, these data suggest that weathering of sand in this area promotes an increased nitrate adsorption capacity which may stimulate greater root proliferation in topsoils and lead to the entrainment of other nutrients in a more concentrated topsoil-vegetation cycle. If these results can be applied to the larger domain of tropical soils generally, they suggest that nitrate adsorption may play an important role in stimulating effective nutrient recycling by forests occupying weathered soils. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

The amount of total nitrogen in drainage from bare rock was 79% of that in rainfall whilst that in drainage from vegetation mats was 29% of the rainfall amount. The respective values for nitrate-nitrogen were 57% and 13%; for potassium they were 90% and 38%. It was assumed that the loss of nutrients as water drains through vegetation mats and over bare patches was due to absorption by plants and soil in the mats and lichens in the bare patches. It was therefore concluded that there was no net enrichment of rainwater with nutr-rients as it flows over inselberg slopes. There is, however, a funelling of water along with contained nutrients from the inselberg to the surrounding areas. This funnelling is additional to the nutrients and rainfall incident on these surrounding areas and may account for the vegetation around inselbergs being more lush than vegetation in the same area but further away from the inselbergs. A simple modelling approach was used to assess potential nutrient outflow from inselbergs. The model shows that discharge of nutrients from the edges of inselbergs increases linearly with inselberg diameter. The model further shows that if nutrient funnelling only affects an area near to the edge of the inselberg then nutrient addition is several times higher than would be expected from rainfall deposition alone. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

Densities of all species were lower in areas with lower productivity. Breeding success on both biomes was similar, the lower densities of birds on the least productive biome apparently compensating for the lower productivity. Eagles produced more one-egg clutches, laid later and reared fewer young in the period of poor rainfall, probably as a result of reduced productivity. Vulture data were difficult to interpret because abundant food at breeding time was created by ungulate population management throughout the entire study period. Concentrations of all species on the more productive biome, and solitary breeding on the least productive biome by a normally colonially breeding species, suggests that primary production also influences vulture densities and perhaps breeding success.

This study reviews the evidence from soil science, ecology and atmospheric chemistry and generates hypotheses to explain the role of termites in dry tropical ecosystems. It is suggested that termite activity exhaustively partitions litterfall among adjacent competing colonies, where it is so thoroughly decomposed that little or no organic C is incorporated into the soils. Associated N, P, and cations build up in the mounds, but C apparently is emitted as CO, and CH4from the mounds. While not adequate to calculate nutrient fluxes through termites, the data available support the argument that termites contribute significantly to atmospheric fluxes of CO, and CH4.

We evaluated occurrence and abundance of lianas and woody hemiepiphytes on canopy and emergent tree species in primary tropical wet forest at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Two pioneers, Cecropia obtusifolia and C. insignis, lacked both lianas and hemiepiphytes. The seven non-pioneer species differed significantly in their loads of lianas and hemiepiphytes. For all non-pioneer species, two measures of liana and hemiepiphyte loads (the percentage of the crown occupied and the combined basal area of descending hemiepiphyte and liana roots and stems) increased significantly with tree diameter. In all non-pioneer species, most trees >70 cm diameter (50–97%) were colonized. Lianas occupied more trees and had a smaller mean host diameter than did hemiepiphytes; however, basal area of descending roots or stems was equivalent for the two life forms in occupied trees. We used partial correlations controlling for tree diameter to evaluate the relationship between annual tree diameter growth and loads of hemiepiphytes and lianas for six non-pioneer species. Five of the six species showed a significant negative correlation between loads and diameter growth. Existing published data show that the high incidence of lianas and hemiepiphytes at La Selva is paralleled in most other Neotropical wet forests. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

In terms of individuals, 7–12% of all captures were frugivores. However, the true proportion of frugivores at both sites was probably closer to 1%, because the sampling procedures were strongly biased towards frugivores. In contrast, previously published studies indicate that frugivores comprise 34–48% of species, and up to 80% of individuals in bat communities in the understorey of Neotropical forest. These results support the hypothesis, developed from studies of bird communities, that the understorey of Malaysian dipterocarp forest supports relatively few obligate frugivores, at least in non-masting years.

The opportunity was taken to investigate the establishment and seedling survival of Shorea curtisii, Shorea multiflora and Shorea pauciflora over the subsequent year. The germination and seedling survival of Shorea curtisii was compared between canopy gaps and forest understorey sites. Under the shaded conditions none of the species grew beyond the two leaf stage over their first year. Shorea multiflora seedlings suffered a 72% mortality, significantly lower than that of Shorea pauciflora (89%) and Shorea curtisii (93%). The major cause of mortality appeared to be drought, though Shorea curtisii was also prone to predation by small mammals. In a gap, Shorea curtisii seeds probably germinated less well but seedling survival (28% versus 7%) and growth was better than canopy-shaded conspecifics.

The abundance and distribution of reptiles and amphibians inhabiting tropical monsoonal wetlands in Kakadu National Park, northern Australia, were monitored between late 1979 and 1982. Seasonal trends in species richness, and the influence of various environmental attributes (including those caused by feral ungulates) on species distribution patterns were also examined. These wetlands support a high proportion of the amphibian species known from the Park, but are of less importance to reptiles. Within the wetlands, the structurally more complex forested ‘margins’ support many more species than the treeless floodplains. Amphibian species distributions seem to be influenced primarily by elevation, through its effects on soil moisture and flooding levels, while reptile distribution patterns reflect a more complex set of environmental factors, with structural attributes (e.g. vegetation height structure and cover, refuge abundance, leaf litter cover and depth, extent of flooding) being of prime importance. Feral buffalo and pigs, through their grazing, trampling and wallowing, may considerably influence such structural attributes and change the duration and extent of water lie, and thus indirectly affect species distribution patterns. Current buffalo culling programmes provide an opportunity to monitor vegetation and faunal changes, and quantify feral animal impact post facto. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

The Asian elephant’s foraging strategy in its natural habitat and in cultivation was studied in southern India during 1981–83. Though elephants consumed at least 112 plant species in the study area, about 85% of their diet consisted of only 25 species from the order Malvales and the families Leguminosae, Palmae, Cyperaceae and Gramineae. Alteration between a predominantly browse diet during the dry season with a grass diet during the early wet season was related to the seasonally changing protein content of grasses. Crop raiding, which was sporadic during the dry season, gradually increased with more area being cultivated with the onset of rains. Raiding frequency reached a peak during October-December, with some villages being raided almost every night, when finger millet (Eleusine coracana) was cultivated by most farmers. The monthly frequency of raiding was related to the seasonal movement of elephant herds and to the size of the enclave. Of their total annual food requirement, adult bull elephants derived an estimated 9.3% and family herds 1.7% in quantity from cultivated land. Cultivated cereal and millet crops provided significantly more protein, calcium and sodium than the wild grasses. Ultimately, crop raiding can be thought of as an extension of the elephant’s optimal foraging strategy. © 1990, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved."

The literature on tropical secondary forests, defined as those resulting from human disturbance (e.g. logged forests and forest fallows), is reviewed to address questions related to their extent, rates of formation, ecological characteristics, values and uses to humans, and potential for management. Secondary forests are extensive in the tropics, accounting for about 40% of the total forest area and their rates of formation are about 9 million ha yr -1. Geographical differences in the extent, rates of formation and types of forest being converted exist. Secondary forests appear to accumulate woody plant species at a relatively rapid rate but the mechanisms involved are complex and no clear pattern emerged. Compared to mature forests, the structure of secondary forest vegetation is simple, although age, climate and soil type are modifying factors. Biomass accumulates rapidly in secondary forests, up to 100 t ha -1during the first 15 yr or so, but history of disturbance may modify this trend. Like biomass, high rates of litter production are established relatively quickly, up to 12–13 t ha -1 yr -1by age 12–15 yr. And, in younger secondary forests (< 20 yr), litter production is a higher fraction of the net primary productivity than stemwood biomass production. More organic matter is produced and transferred to the soil in younger secondary forests than is stored in above-ground vegetation. The impact of this on soil organic matter is significant and explains why the recovery of organic matter in the soil under secondary forests is relatively fast (50 yr or so). Nutrients are accumulated rapidly in secondary vegetation, and are returned quickly by litterfall and decomposition for uptake by roots. We propose a model of the gains and losses, yields and costs, and benefits and tradeoffs to people from the current land-use changes occurring in the tropics. When the conversion of forest lands to secondary forests and agriculture is too fast or land-use stages are skipped, society loses goods and services. To avoid such a loss, we advocate management of tropical forest lands within a landscape perspective, a possibility in the tropics because land tenures and development projects are often large. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

Foliar N concentrations were not significantly higher in trees fertilized with N compared to control trees. In Dendropanax cf. pendulus and Hedyosmum arborescens fertilization with N resulted in lower P concentrations but only after the third year of fertilization, possibly due to dilution by increased leaf production. Mean trunk diameter growth was significantly higher in the N-fertilized trees than in controls. Mean foliar P concentrations were higher in Podocarpus urbanii and Clethra occidentalis following fertilization with P, but only after two years of fertilization.

The densities of the breeding populations and the sex of all flowering individuals were recorded for five dioecious canopy tree species of Central Amazonian Myristicaceae, in 11 study areas of the Minimum Critical size of Ecosystems Project totalling 22.5 ha. Adult population densities were extremely low, ranging from 0.38 to 1.61 ha-1for the five species studied. In a 10 ha study plot the mean distance to the nearest flowering conspecific ranged from 48 to 100 m, while the mean distance to the nearest opposite sex conspecific was 147 m. The two most abundant species, Iryanthera macrophylla and Virola calophylla, both showed male-biased sex ratios, of 23:9 and 20:6, respectively. The size class distribution of males, females and non-flowering individuals in V. calophylla suggests that earlier reproductive maturation of male plants may provide a partial explanation for this bias. In I. macrophylla, since 95% of the individuals were observed flowering, the observed ratio is representative of the population, and may be caused by sex shifts from male to female. The low reproductive densities, combined with the skewed sex ratios and overlapping generations of these species, create very small effective breeding populations, placing species such as these at great risk in the face of deforestation and habitat fragmentation. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

Germination varied significantly among habitats, with only seven species germinating well in all three sites. Seed germination of most species demonstrated clear patterns of shade tolerance or intolerance identical to those long recognized for tree seedlings. Favoured locations for germination were similar to known distributional patterns of adult individuals in mature and secondary forests. Most forest canopy species germinated in the gap, but germination in the large clearing was dramatically reduced or nil; the regeneration of these species in large clearings will be severely retarded even when seeds are present. Canopy-induced inhibition of germination was apparent in several pioneer species; seeds moved from the forest into the gap or clearing germinated rapidly. Results indicate that natural treefall gaps do not inhibit the germination of most species, but do allow pioneer species to germinate, and therefore regenerate. Although germination occurred in all three locations, the level of germination for particular species varied greatly among habitats. We conclude that germination requirements play a very important role in controlling the species composition of regeneration in forest understorey, gap, and large clearing habitats. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

The permanence and stability of 20 territories of the dikdik Rhynchotragus kirki, were studied at Arusha National Park Tanzania. Response criteria included the structure, size and vegetation attributes of territories, density of dikdik, and spatial distances between neighbouring territories. Fourteen of the territories studied were spatially fixed and stable while six were unstable. Two of the unstable territories were completely abandoned. Mean territory size was 0.11 and 0.13 ha during the rainy and dry seasons, respectively. 14.2% of circular territories and 42.9% of elliptical and kidney-shaped territories were stable. The figure of 55 dikdik km-2sighted during morning censuses was lower than that for evening censuses by 13.5%. Spatial distance between territories ranged from 4.5 m to 100 m, an indication that population density might be a function of the size of suitable habitat. Although shrub canopy cover within stable territories decreased by 44.6% between 1982 and 1987, and some territories were realigned with changes in rainfall pattern, pair-bond was maintained by dikdik in 70% of the territories studied. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

Terrestrial ungulates use different strategies to cope with widespread annual flooding of the Amazon basin. Red brocket deer (Mazama americana) and collared peccary (Tayassu tajacu) retreat to floodplain islands and shift from a frugivorous to a woody browse diet. However, both white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) and lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris) diets are unaffected by inundations; in the case of white-lipped peccary because they migrate into and out of flooded areas and in the case of lowland tapir because of their semi-aquatic nature. These-strategies of white-lipped peccary and lowland tapir enable them to exploit the greater fruit production of flooded forests more frequently than brocket deer and collared peccary. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

A total of 44 phytophagous insect species were found on M. pigra. The five most abundant of these made up 74% of the total community. This insect community in general showed a distinct seasonal cycle of abundance with maximum numbers during the wet season. However, a few species had a completely different pattern. Two species, Mictis profana (Hemiptera: Coreidae) and Platymopsis humeralis (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae), were observed to cause substantial damage to M. pigra. When compared with the fauna of M. pigra from its native region, Central America, that of the Northern Territory is low in leaf and flower-feeding insects. It is suggested that these types of insects be sought as future biocontrol agents to complement those native insects causing damage and those bio-control agents already released. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.

(Moraceae) in tropical dry forest by documenting its (1) fruiting phenology, (2) rates of visitation by vertebrate frugivores, and (3) rate of recruitment of juveniles in different habitats at Santa Rosa National Park in northwestern Costa Rica. At Santa Rosa, C. peltata is a common but patchily-distributed plant. Fruiting in females is seasonal, and fruit availability peaks in June through August (the early wet season). Females bear a few ripe fruit per day over a 4–5 month. fruiting period. At least 28 vertebrate species (15 diurnal and 13 nocturnal species) eat Cecropia fruit; equal numbers of ripe fruit are removed during the night and day. Owing to their more gentle treatment of seeds in the gut, birds and bats probably are more effective dispersal agents than monkeys. The recruitment rate of juveniles into already established populations was about 0.8 ha-1y-1compared with a rate of 176 ha-1 y-1during the colonization of a cleared roadside. © 1990, Cambridge University Press.
