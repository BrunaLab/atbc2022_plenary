Whereas this small tree is sparse in its native range of Central America, it has spread in Tahiti into a wide variety of habitats including native wet forests. The remarkable success of this invasion is due in great part to prolific reproduction: a mature tree can bear up to 220 inflorescences with an average of 1330 flowers/inflorescence, 208 fruits/infructescence and 195 seeds/fruit. Two and a half years of phenological observations in a highly invaded site indicated that three major peaks of flowering occur/year over brief periods: flower anthesis lasted a few days and pollen grain germination suggested a short stigmatic receptivity of only a few hours; no pollinators were observed foraging on flowers during our survey; the production of fruits containing viable seeds in bagged inflorescences showed that self-fertilization can occur; pollen-ovule ratio (log P/O = 2.68) suggested facultative xenogamy; bagged isolated flowers to test for autogamy and style cutting to learn whether apomixis occured or not were not conclusive. The flowering phenology and the breeding system of M. calvescens enable this plant to build up rapidly successful populations from even a single propagule on the island of Tahiti and on other sites of introduction.

Two frog species were sampled from each of the two main forest habitats on both banks of the Juruá River in the southwestern Brazilian Amazon Basin at various points along its course to contrast different barrier strengths. Scarthyla ostinodactyla and Scinax rubra were sampled from flooded forest (varzea), and Physalaemus petersi and Epipedobates femoralis from non-flooded forest (terra firme). All species showed high levels of within-population genetic variation. Average Nei's (1978) and Rogers' (1972) genetic distances between sampled sites for all species were high indicating substantial among-population differentiation. The observation of low gene flow between sampled sites within species was further substantiated with Slatkin's (1993) M̂ analyses. Randomization tests suggested that there was some population structure at a few assayed polymorphic loci that was consistent with the riverine barrier hypothesis. However, it was apparent from the raw allozyme frequency data that these results were largely driven by substantial differentiation at one or a few collecting localities rather than by basin-wide patterns of riverine differentiation. Phenograms using genetic distance matrices supported this interpretation.

Older pitchers contained more insect carcasses. The bacterial density increased with the age of the pitchers, but decreased in withered pitchers that contained finely decomposed detritus. In live pitchers, the bacterial density, the density, mass and species richness of metazoa, and the number of trophic levels per pitcher were positively correlated with detrital mass, which was correlated with volume of pitcher fluid. The metazoan fauna from N. alata consisted of 4 predators and 12 saprophages, among the richest known for Nepenthes species. However, each individual pitcher harbored a limited numbers of species, owing to (1) the low incidence of many species, and (2) the aggregated distribution and different temporal colonization pattern of major species. Six dipteran taxa (one predator and five saprophages) accounted for the bulk of metazoan inhabitant biomass. Of 48 combinations of predator-prey encountered, only four occurred frequently (in > 30% of pitchers), which included two predators and three saprophages.

Tadpoles of many species are predaceous, consuming larvae of insects that use the same microhabitat for breeding, such as giant damselflies and mosquitoes. Previous studies and observations on the behavior of poison frog tadpoles led us to question whether tadpoles might be cannibalistic. We studied a population of Dendrobates castaneoticus in lowland rainforest in Pará, Brazil; additional data were collected on Dendrobates auratus in Nicaragua. At the study site in Brazil, we established a grid of 40 Brazil nut capsules, the microhabitat used by D. castaneoticus for tadpole deposition. Of 42 tadpoles deposited during the 55 days of the study, 20 were killed or died; 16 of these were presumably killed by conspecific tadpoles. Growth rate and time to metamorphosis was higher among tadpoles that consumed three or more tadpoles or relatively large larvae of the mosquito Trichoprosopon digitatum, a colonist of newly opened Brazil nut capsules. We propose that selection has favored the development of predatory behavior in poison frog tadpoles primarily as a mechanism to eliminate predators from the small phytotelmata in which they develop and that cannibalism is a secondary outcome of this behavior. Predatory behavior also provides tadpoles with a source of food, which is frequently limited in these microhabitats.

Dominance of a few species in the treatment plots is consistent with the hypothesis that hornbills are effectively dispersing seeds of some, but not all, of their diet species.
