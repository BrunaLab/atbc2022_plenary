Our primary objective was to test whether complex nonlinear models are necessary to describe dynamics of the Algonquin rodent populations. Variation in abundance among species was related to mean abundance by a simple power function with an exponent of 1.77, implying that population variability did not increase with mean density as much as one might expect for strictly statistical reasons. Time-series analyses of annual population densities indicated no significant autocorrelation functions for five species. Southern red-backed voles, red squirrels, and flying squirrels had significant autocorrelations, but only flying squirrels had an autocorrelation function suggestive of cyclic population dynamics. Per capita rates of population growth were density-dependent in all eight species, although in most cases there was substantial deviation around the fitted regression lines. Response surface models with one- and two-year lags significantly improved the statistical fit to data for three species, but only one of these response surface models was sustainable in the face of realistic stochastic variation in per capita growth. These results suggest that simple logistic models are adequate for predicting the long-term dynamics of the Algonquin small-mammal assemblage.

Regional surveys have demonstrated strong correlations among soil pH, N content, and base saturation on the one hand and plant productivity and community composition on the other, but the nature of these relationships is poorly understood. We studied in detail the variation in and controls of soil acidity, availability of N and P, and changes in community composition and plant nutrition along a short (only 90 m long) but extreme forest productivity gradient in northern Sweden, which ranged from a groundwater recharge area with low productivity to a very productive discharge area. The pH in the soil solution of the mor layer ranged from 3.5 in the recharge area to 6.4 in the discharge area, and it was strongly correlated with the base saturation of the exchange complex. Neither the acid strength of organic matter, the ionic strength of the soil solution, nor the quantity of acids could explain more than a minor part of this variation in pH. There were strong correlations between total N in the mor layer and soil solution pH (r = 0.97) and base saturation of the exchange complex (r = 0.88). At the poor end of the transect the concentration of inorganic N was very low in the mor, and plants with either ectomycorrhizae (ECM) or ericoid mycorrhizae (EM) dominated. With increasing pH, there was an increase in NH4 concentrations, while plants that potentially have arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) became prominent along with ECM and EM species. In the discharge area, which comprised only the last 10 m of the transect, NO3 dominated over NH4 in the soil solution, the soil had a high capacity for net nitrification, and the vegetation was totally dominated by potentially AM or nonmycorrhizal herbs, some of which had high foliar nitrate reductase activity. Foliar and root N concentrations increased steeply towards the discharge area, but foliar P/N ratios declined below critical levels at the end of the transect. Root 32p uptake bioassays also indicated a P deficiency in the discharge area, where the soil total P content was high, while the concentration of PO4 in the soil solution was very low. The high capacity of the mor in the discharge area to adsorb PO4, due to the presence of organically complexed Fe and Fe-oxihydroxides, may explain the low PO4 concentrations. Our data indicate that the underlying factors influencing both productivity and community composition are pH and supply of base cations. Fundamental differences in exchange characteristics of soil and soil water underlie other related nutrient supply features, in particular the amount and availability of N. Our study of a single short topographic transect supported a previous suggestion based on a regional survey in Norway that variability in soil pH and the supply of base cations affects plant productivity and community composition via effects on N supply. Our data also encompass the interrelations between soil pH, soil N turnover, and the mycorrhizal type of dominant plant species, which, according to Read (1991), occur along long latitudinal or altitudinal climatic gradients. Through millennia discharge areas like the one observed by us have probably provided a relatively stable environment for plants demanding high soil pH and N supply, at the same time as surrounding recharge areas have been acidified naturally through podzolization.",135,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Base saturation | Boreal forests | Fennoscandia | Groundwater discharge | Mor layer | Mycorrhizae | Nitrogen | PH | Phosphorus | Plant communities | Soil chemistry,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA,NA

Leaf litter standing crop in the treatment stream was < 1% that of the reference stream, and fine benthic organic matter (FBOM) was 50% lower than the reference. We used a whole-stream tracer addition of 13C-1 sodium acetate for 3 wk to label bacteria and hence their consumers during both July and December. Bacterial δ13C was measured by collecting respired bacterial carbon. We estimated the contribution of bacterial carbon to consumers using a mixing model for invertebrates and bacteria. The acetate label declined exponentially downstream with a 10-m uptake length in each stream and season. FBOM and biofilm were the only detrital samples to show a strong label; both were more labeled in the litter-excluded stream. Bacteria in the litter-excluded stream had 7-10 times more label than those in the reference stream during both seasons, showing their higher relative use of streamwater DOC. The percentage of invertebrate carbon derived from bacteria was >20% for many taxa. This was significantly related to the percentage of amorphous detritus in invertebrate guts, suggesting that bacterial carbon supporting higher trophic levels was associated with amorphous detrital particles. Predatory invertebrates were labeled, showing that bacterial carbon was important for higher trophic levels. Some invertebrates were more highly labeled than the bacteria. Stenonema in the treatment stream contained eight times more label than measured bacteria. This suggests that they were using an unmeasured bacterial source such as bacteria in exposed epilithic biofilms, which had higher δ13C than all other detrital components. Invertebrates in the treatment stream did not appear to use more bacterial carbon than in the reference stream despite a lower standing crop of detritus. Tallaperla, a shredding stonefly, derived 20-40% of its carbon from bacteria in both streams, even though it was more labeled in the treatment stream. Our estimates of the percentage of invertebrate carbon derived from bacteria were higher than those found in laboratory-based studies. To investigate reasons for this difference, we examined the possibility that bacterial carbon was principally found in exopolymers, as our labeling method would have labeled exopolymers.

Here we present the results of observations and experiments designed to investigate pollinator discrimination and its consequences for female reproductive success in two monoecious Begonia species pollinated by deceit. Male and female flowers of B. urophylla are similar in shape, but female flowers are smaller than male flowers, while in B. tonduzii, male and female flowers have strikingly different shapes, but their petaloid tepals are similar in total area. Flower visitors displayed marked discrimination against the rewardless female flowers of both species. Seven bee species were observed on B. urophylla, and for all species taken together the relative visitation rate to male flowers was 8.6 times that to female flowers. The bee Trigona fulviventris accounted for 95% of all visits to B. tonduzii and visited male flowers 15.4 times as often as female flowers. The flower visitors of B. urophylla varied significantly in their degree of discrimination against female flowers, with visitation rates to male flowers 3.7-21.8 times those to female flowers. The two most abundant flower visitors displayed the greatest discrimination against female flowers and, although they comprised nearly 54% of all visits, were responsible for only 15% of all visits to female flowers. Thus, the relative abundance of different flower visitors on B. urophylla is a poor predictor of pollinator importance. In both species the inflorescence sex ratio was male-biased early in the season and female-biased later. Hand-pollination experiments revealed that fruit set in B. tonduzii was pollinator limited both during peak and late flowering, with supplemental pollination having its greatest effect late in the season when male flowers were rare. In contrast, fruit set was only weakly affected by supplemental hand-pollination in B. urophylla. The significant pollinator limitation observed in B. tonduzii and the lack of it in B. urophylla are consistent with our observation that the visitation rate to female flowers was much higher in B. urophylla than in B. tonduzii, which was due in part to the lower level of pollinator discrimination against female flowers of B. urophylla.

After 3.5 growing seasons, in situ plastic greenhouses that raised air temperature during the growing season had little effect on total biomass, N content, or growing-season N uptake of the major plant and soil pools. Similarly, vascular ANPP and net ecosystem CO2 exchange did not change with warming, although net primary production of mosses decreased with warming. Such general lack of response supports the hypothesis that productivity in tundra is constrained by the indirect effects of cold temperatures (e.g., low nutrient availability or short growing-season length) rather than by cold growing-season temperatures per se. Despite no effect on net ecosystem CO2 flux, air warming stimulated early-season gross photosynthesis (GP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) throughout the growing season. This increased carbon turnover was probably associated with species-level responses to increased air temperature. Warming increased the aboveground biomass of the overstory shrub, dwarf birch (Betula nana), and caused a significant net redistribution of N from the understory evergreen shrub, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, to B. nana, despite no effects on soil temperature, total plant N, or N availability. Thus, although air warming had no effect on total ecosystem N pools, it did mediate N distribution within the plant community. The early-season stimulation of GP is consistent with warming effects on leaf expansion of dominant shrubs (including B. nana) observed in other studies in tussock tundra. The stimulation of ER probably resulted from maintenance and growth respiration associated with higher aboveground B. nana biomass production and higher root N uptake and/or turnover in the greenhouses. The species responses to warming are consistent with changes in plant species assemblages associated with past warming and suggest that future warming may increase the abundance of B. nana in tussock tundra.

Increased productivity reduced species richness by effectively preventing the seedling establishment of the subordinate forb species and reduced the recruitment of Andropogon gerardi by inhibiting both germination and survival. Litter removals carried out at each of two levels of nitrogen enrichment (no nitrogen, nitrogen added) showed that litter significantly reduced species richness by the same amount in fertilized and unfertilized plots, suggesting that living biomass and litter were purely additive, rather than interactive in their effects. In contrast, the results of litter additions suggested that the declines in richness associated with fertilization could largely be due to the suppressive effects of increased litter biomass alone.

Partitioning is achieved, in part, through separation of flowering in space and seasonal time, and through interspecific differences in pollinator guilds. Nevertheless, co-flowering Acacia species shared several pollinators, this means that interspecific pollen transfer is possible. We analyzed daily patterns of pollinator activity and pollen release in 10 Acacia assemblages containing a total of 10 Acacia species. Pollinator activity was scored using counts at flowers over constant time intervals throughout the day. Pollen availability was assessed using a simple method which allows quantification of pollen exposed on the surface of the Acacia inflorescence. Sympatric co-flowering Acacia species each show high intraspecific synchrony but release their pollen at different times of day. Pollinators rapidly harvest available pollen and move from one Acacia species to the next, following the daily sequence of pollen release. The activity of shared pollinators is structured throughout the day as a result of temporal patterns of pollen release across Acacia species. The observed temporal structuring of pollen release is compatible with patterns predicted to result from competitive displacement. Additional support for a competition-based explanation for this patterning comes from the observation that an Acacia species flowering without competitors shows no synchronized peak of pollen availability at any time of day.",133,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,"Acacia | Bees | Character displacement | Competition, dehiscence, niche, pollination | Resource partitioning, Tanzania",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,9,NA,NA

We developed a model for determining saguaro age, using the growth rates of over 3000 plants from 1964 to 1970. The model was verified with 1993 data. Changes in population size and the estimated age structures were then used to infer regeneration trends. Saguaro populations on all slope aspects nearly doubled since 1908. Yet, during the same period, relative abundances of saguaros remained higher on the south and east aspects than on the north and west aspects. Higher recruitment and survival of young plants rather than mortality of older ones are largely responsible for the differences between aspects. The estimated age structures show large, multi-decadal fluctuations in saguaro regeneration. Prior to 1908, populations on all slopes experienced an extended period of decline beginning around the late 1860s. The recent surge in recruitment began in the 1920s and peaked in the 1970s. Populations currently are again in decline. Better regeneration generally corresponds with relatively wet conditions, and poorer regeneration with drier conditions. However, extended periods of decline often included episodes of relatively wet conditions (e.g., from the 1860s to the 1920s), indicating that other climatic and biotic factors also determine recruitment success.

We gave doses of different types of pollen to two nectarivorous (Anoura geoffroyi and Leptonycteris curasoae) and two frugivorous (Artibeus jamaicensis and Sturnira lilium) bats and collected their feces at regular intervals.

In addition to estimating the percentage of empty pollen grains in the feces, we determined digesta time distributions in the gastrointestinal tract and interpreted them using chemical reactor theory. Extraction efficiency was higher in bats that regularly include pollen in their diet. This pattern was not explained by differences in the rate with which the bats processed pollen, or by the time that pollen was retained in the stomach, where little degradation of pollen grains occurs. Within species, however, the percentage of empty grains increased asymptotically with time in the gastrointestinal tract. In general, the digestive system of the bats seemed to process pollen grains as a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) connected to a plug-flow reactor (PFR), with longitudinal mixing in the PFR: the food was retained for a relatively short period in the stomach and then was moved through the intestine, where it was mixed longitudinally. Artibeus jamaicensis was an exception to this pattern in the way its digestive system processed H. undatus pollen; in this case, its gastrointestinal tract apparently functioned as a PFR with a considerable amount of longitudinal mixing.

We used multistate capture-recapture models to test the hypothesis of equal recapture probabilities for breeding and nonbreeding Kittiwakes and found no evidence of an effect of breeding state on this parameter. The same method was used to test whether reproductive state affects survival probability. Nonbreeding individuals have lower survival rates than breeders. Moreover, nonbreeders have a higher probability of being nonbreeders the following year than do breeders. State-specific survival rates and transition probabilities vary from year to year, but temporal variations of survival and transition probabilities of breeders and nonbreeders are in parallel (on a logit scale). These inferences led us to conclude that nonbreeders tend to be lower quality individuals.

The reduction in predicted nutrient uptake with increasing variability was more pronounced with higher mean concentrations of P, while mean concentration had little effect on the patient of NO3- uptake.

Six isolation variables characterized properties of stream corridors, land barriers, and source pools of invading species; four extinction variables were related to habitat severity, lake area, and productivity. Two types of multivariate analyses were used: the nonparametric classification and regression trees (CART) and the parametric linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Both types of analyses showed that extinction variables were collectively more important than isolation variables in predicting richness and composition both in Finland and Wisconsin. We interpret that the greater importance of extinction vs. isolation results, not because isolation is unimportant, but because the probability of an arrival of a new species is much less than that of an extinction. Thus, the time after an extinction event before a subsequent invasion is long relative to the time after an invasion event before a subsequent extinction; consequently, fish assemblages sampled at a given point in time more likely represent the stamp of the extinctions than of the invasions. This conclusion was robust to the differences in the geomorphic settings and fish faunas of Finland and Wisconsin. However, the importance of individual isolation and extinction variables in determining richness and composition differed between the two regions, apparently more from differences in geomorphic settings than from differences in fish faunas. Influences of horizontal rather than vertical barriers over land and water were more apparent in Wisconsin, with its lower relief and higher incidence of lakes without stream connections; influences of the area of the nearest lake (representing the size of the available species pool) and stream gradient were more important in Finland, with its higher relief and higher incidence of lakes with stream connections.

Fine root production and mortality varied seasonally, with greatest rates of production occurring during June each year, and greatest rates of mortality occurring in fall and over winter. Annual production and mortality during 1993, a year of unusually low precipitation, were significantly higher than during either 1992 or 1994. Aboveground herbivory significantly reduced monthly rates of fine root production, and on an annual basis, fine root production of browsed plots (311.4 ± 31.7 mm · tube-1 · yr-1) was significantly less than that of unbrowsed plots (453.8 ± 49.8 mm · tube-1 · yr-1) when averaged over 3 yr. Because herbivory had less of an effect on monthly or annual rates of fine root mortality, fine root turnover was higher for browsed stands. Browsed plants had a higher percentage of annual production in surface soft layers. Production on all plots shifted to deeper soil layers as the growing season progressed; this shift occurred deeper in the profile for unbrowsed plants than for browsed plants. We used a parameter estimation program (Program MARK) to generate fine root survival and decomposition estimates from models testing the direct and interactive effects of time period, cohort (i.e., when the root first appeared) age of the root, browsing, and site on fine root longevity and decomposability. Cohort effects showed that survival of fine roots was greatest for roots that first appeared in May, and that survival progressively declined for roots first appearing during subsequent time periods, while age-based estimates showed a rapid decline in survival over the interval following first appearance. Survival and decomposition estimates were inversely correlated within a growing season, with the lowest survival but highest decomposition occurring over winter. Two-factor models indicated that time-dependent survival and decomposition rates of fine roots differed significantly between browsed and unbrowsed stands, among the 10 fine root age groups, and among the three study sites. Browsing significantly reduced fine root survival, but this effect varied among sites. Fine root decomposition rates were consistently lower (-21%) in browsed stands. Two important features distinguish fine root dynamics in our stands from temperate and more southerly boreal ecosystems: (1) low overwinter survival of fine roots, and (2) a substantial time lag between leaf-out and maximum fine root growth, suggesting greater reliance on aboveground stores for spring regrowth. Herbivores appear to play an important role in linking these two events, first by exacerbating overwinter mortality, and second by consuming a substantial amount of aboveground stores. Thus, not only do herbivores have pronounced direct effects on carbon and nutrient cycling processes, but climatically driven effects on fine root processes may be linked with herbivory in complex ways that define fundamental latitudinal patterns in plant growth and allocation to defense against herbivory.",132,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,"Alaska | Browsing | Fine roots | Herbivory | Longevity, nutrient cycling | Production | Turnover",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,17,NA,NA

Sightings of leopard seals (Hydrurga leptonyx) and incidents of leopard seal predation on fur seal pups were recorded opportunistically during daily fur seal research at both sites. High mortality of fur seal pups, attributed to predation by leopard seals frequently observed at NC, caused pup numbers to decline rapidly between January and March (i.e., prior to weaning) each year and probably caused a long-term decline in the size of that colony. The NA colony, where leopard seals were never observed, increased in size during the study. Pup mortality from causes other than leopard seal predation appeared to be similar at the two sites. The number of pups counted at four locations in the Elephant Island vicinity increased slowly, at an annual rate of 3.8%, compared to rates as high as 11% at other locations in the South Shetland Islands. Several lines of circumstantial evidence are consistent with the hypothesis that leopard seal predators limit the growth of the fur seal population in the Elephant Island area and perhaps in the broader population in the South Shetland Islands.

The experiment, which included manipulation of the depositional environment, was designed specifically to test whether patterns of recovery following abrasion or removal of the biota differed among patches of different sizes, produced at different times of the year and at different locations and undergoing different rates of sediment deposition. Variable size, intensity, timing and location of disturbance, and variable stress induced by deposition of sediment significantly influenced the success of erect algae that persist by sexual reproduction but did not affect spatial dominance by the filamentous algal turf. The turf regained space very quickly by vegetative reproduction and persisted as the dominant species in all the experimental plots, independent of the disturbance and stress regimes imposed. The impressive rate of vegetative propagation was identified as a major determinant of the structure of the assemblage and the probable basis for the capability of the turf to compete for space and resist disturbance.

In Trois Fontaines (eastern France), 51 sets of twins were ear-tagged as newborns and then intensively monitored until adulthood (to ≥4 yr of age). On the island of Storfosna (central western Norway), 79 sets of twins and 40 sets of triplets were radiotracked from birth to ≥1 mo of age. In both populations, family effects were observed for measures of early body development and winter body mass. Measurements for sibling fawns were more similar than the same measures for nonsiblings. During unfavorable years (i e, poor deer survival in summer or high population density), sibling fawns survived or died together much more often than expected by chance. Conversely, during favorable years (i.e, high fawn survival or low density), there was no evidence for family effects on survival of either twins or triplets. These results demonstrate that family effects on juvenile fitness of roe deer are pervasive, and that family effects on early survival differ among years. To assess the consequences of family effects on population dynamics, we tested the model of J. F. Crow and N E. Morton. This model proposes that family effects should cause increased variance in recruitment among females. Consistent with this model, family effects led to a threefold increase in the variance of total reproductive success over 5 yr of 37 females in Trois Fontaines Data from Storfosna (11 females monitored for 3 yr) also supported Crow and Morton's model.

Characters of the progeny, such as dispersal, that are determined by the maternal parent and that vary with the maternal environment are said to exhibit maternal environmental effects. Because dispersal is maternally determined, the response to selection on dispersal depends on the correlations between generations for maternal traits that influence dispersal. These correlations depend on the direction and degree to which the maternal plant responds to its environment. Although it is widely appreciated that seed dispersal is maternally determined, the evolution of dispersal has not yet been addressed within the context of maternal character evolution. In this study, I identify maternal traits that influence seed dispersion patterns and characterize their variation as a function of maternal environmental conditions in order to determine whether maternal environmental effects on dispersal are possible and to predict the direction of correlations between generations for these traits. The traits included morphological traits of the fruits and architectural traits of the maternal plant. Laboratory and field studies were combined to investigate dispersal of Cakile edentula var. lacustris, an annual beach plant with heteromorphic fruit segments. Fruit traits influenced dispersal under laboratory conditions and in the field. Taller, more sparsely branched plants with a greater percentage of fruits on their primary stem had impeded dispersal, and plants with more fruit segments had denser seed shadows. Path analysis revealed that the total effect of a trait on dispersal often differed from its direct effect because of intercorrelations among variables. Environmental factors influenced dispersal directly, but they also strongly influenced the expression of plant traits. By considering both the effects of plant traits on dispersal and the influence of environmental variables, such as density, on the expression of these plant traits, this study predicts positive phenotypic correlations between maternal and progeny generations for some traits and negative correlations for others. The extent to which each maternal trait influences dispersal, the extent to which it varies with the environment, and the extent to which the environment varies as a function of dispersal will all influence phenotypic correlations between maternal parent and offspring.

Because photosynthesis rates in co-occurring tree species can differ in their sensitivity to environmental conditions, these changes in species composition are likely to alter the carbon dynamics of temperate forests. To help improve our understanding of such atmosphere-biosphere interactions, we explored changes in leaf-level photosynthesis in a 60-70 yr old temperate mixed-deciduous forest in Petersham, Massachusetts (USA). Diurnally and seasonally varying environmental conditions differentially influenced in situ leaf-level photosynthesis rates in the canopies of four mature temperate deciduous tree species: red oak (Quercus rubra), red maple (Acer rubrum), white birch (Betula papyrifera), and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis). We measured in situ photosynthesis at two heights within the canopies (top of the canopy at ~20 m, and in the sub-canopy of the same individual trees at ~14-16 m) through a diurnal time course on 7 d over two growing seasons. We simultaneously measured a suite of environmental conditions surrounding the leaf at the time of each measurement. We used path analysis to examine the influence of environmental factors on in situ photosynthesis in the tree canopies. Overall, red oak had the highest photosynthesis rates, followed by white birch, yellow birch, and red maple. There was little evidence for a substantial midday depression in photosynthesis. Instead, photosynthesis declined throughout the day, particularly after 1600. Diurnal patterns of light reaching canopy leaves, leaf and air temperature, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) contributed to diurnally varying photosynthesis rates. Large differences in these parameters through the growing season partly led to the seasonal differences observed in photosynthesis rates. Path analyses helped to identify the relative contribution of various environmental factors on photosynthesis and further revealed that species-specific sensitivities to various environmental conditions shifted through the season. Red oak photosynthesis was particularly sensitive to air temperatures late in the season when air temperatures were low. Further, red maple photosynthesis was particularly sensitive to high VPDs through the growing season.

Fossil pollen was interpreted by comparison with 66 surface samples from small hollows in Michigan and Wisconsin, using three different statistical methods: pollen ratios, a dissimilarity index, and canonical variates analysis (CVA) ordination. We found that four hemlock stands along a 10-km transect across Sylvania originated as patches of white pine (Pinus strobus) forest that were invaded by hemlock ~3000 yr ago (calibrated 14C dating) when hemlock expanded its range in northern Michigan. Invasion occurred at about the same time (within 800 yr) at all sites but was not associated with disturbance at any site. Over the next several thousand years hemlock coexisted with white pine, but eventually, at a time that differs from site to site, hemlock became dominant, and white pine disappeared from all but one of the four stands. These changes were apparently driven by climate changes over the last 4000 yr that caused the water table to rise (Brugam and Johnson 1997). The history of four nearby maple stands is more variable and less well understood. Unlike the hemlock stands, three of the four maple patches were not dominated by pine at the time of hemlock invasion, but instead had abundant oak (Quercus) and/or maple. Two of these stands were not invaded by hemlock, and the third, if invaded at all, was invaded for a few centuries by low densities of hemlock trees. Thus invasion by hemlock was sensitive to the species composition of the resident forest. Sugar maple and basswood increased in these stands, and by 2000 to 800 yr ago, depending on site, they resembled modern maple stands.

In nine stands of Austrocedrus chilensis, a xeric conifer, we used dendrochronological techniques to date the outermost tree ring on dead-standing and fallen trees to estimate the dates of tree death for 336 trees. To evaluate climatic conditions during periods of high tree mortality, we used regional records of precipitation and temperature from six climate stations and also used a regional set of 24 tree ring chronologies from Austrocedrus. Good preservation of the resinous wood of Austrocedrus allowed relatively precise dating of tree deaths over the past ~90 years. Episodes of massive tree mortality coincide with exceptionally dry springs and summers during the 1910s, 1942-1943, and the 1950s. Although there is a general regional synchroneity of tree death associated with drought, intra-regional variations in the intensity of droughts, as interpolated and mapped from the regional network of tree ring chronologies, are also reflected by north-to-south variations in tree mortality patterns. Periods of drought and associated tree mortality during the 20th century in northern Patagonia are strongly associated with above average sea level atmospheric pressure off the coast of Chile at the same latitudes. Temperature and precipitation in northern Patagonia are highly influenced by the intensity and latitudinal position of the southeastern Pacific anticyclone, which, in turn, are greatly affected by ENSO. Tree mortality in northern Patagonia appears to be intensified by extreme events of the Southern Oscillation and is more strongly coincident with El Nino events along the coast of northern Peru. These results, in combination with previously established climatic influences on fire occurrence and tree seedling establishment, strongly link stand-level and regional-scale forest dynamic processes in northern Patagonia with variations in large-scale atmospheric conditions.",138,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Austrocedrus chilensis | Climatic variability | Dendrochronology | Drought | El Nino-Southern Oscillation | Forest dynamics | Northern Patagonia | Tree mortality,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,26,NA,NA

For animal-pollinated plants, the pattern of pollen dispersal arises from the pollinator's interactions with floral organs during each flower visit and with the pollen it carries during transport. These interactions typically cause some portions of a flower's pollen to experience different transport conditions than other portions. We model three classes of heterogeneous transport conditions to assess their effects on pollen dispersal. Two classes occur when the pollen carried by individual pollinators becomes spatially structured. 'Horizontal' structure arises when areas of a pollinator's body differ in their frequency or intensity of contact with anthers and/or stigmas. Alternatively, 'vertical' structure develops when pollinators do not disturb their pollen load, causing pollen to accumulate on the pollinator's body in layers, so that much pollen is temporarily inaccessible to stigmas. The third class of heterogeneity occurs when the pollinators that visit a flower differ consistently with respect to pollen transfer from pollinator to stigmas. These classes of heterogeneous transport produce similar mean patterns of pollen dispersal, which differ from that expected if transported pollen acts as a homogeneous population. In particular, near and far recipient flowers receive proportionately more of the donor pollen reaching stigmas than predicted for a single population. Reanalysis of data in the literature illustrates that predictions based on heterogeneous transport conditions are more representative of observed dispersal patterns than predictions of the traditional characterization of pollen dispersal. We also demonstrate that stochastic variation between flowers in pollen donation and receipt does not affect the arithmetic mean pattern of pollen dispersal, although it does reduce the geometric mean. Although the different types of heterogeneous transport conditions produce similar mean patterns of pollen dispersal, the influences of specific floral and pollinator characteristics on dispersal can depend on the type(s) of heterogeneity involved. In particular, pistil characteristics should affect dispersal independently of stamen characteristics when horizontal heterogeneity governs transport dynamics, but not when pollen accumulates in layers. This relation is likely reflected in many aspects of floral divergence among related taxa pollinated by different vectors and convergent design among unrelated taxa served by similar vectors.",70,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,"Animal pollination, flower design, pollen carryover | Pollen deposition, pollen layering | Pollen removal, pollination, pollinator grooming, stochastic variation",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,27,NA,NA

This investigation examines how nuptial gifts influence female nitrogen and carbon budgets in a polyandrous butterfly, Pieris napi. During mating, a virgin male of this species transfers a large and nutritious ejaculate containing 14% nitrogen by dry mass. The amount of nitrogen transferred is equivalent to that in ~70 eggs. Females use the male-transferred nutrients to increase their pool of nutrients used for egg production and show a positive relationship between amount of ejaculate material received and lifetime reproductive output. It is clear that for multiply mated females, nitrogen derived from male nuptial gifts is essential for a balanced nitrogen budget. As in earlier studies, female thorax mass decreased with age, indicating that old females of P. napi are able to use more of the resources from their thorax than young females. Since male-transferred material also increases female longevity, multiply mated females also use more of their resources from the thorax. Consequently, multiply mated females have a relatively higher reproductive investment than singly mated females, i.e., they transform a larger part of their body reserves to egg production. These results are important for studies that involve male-transferred nutrients in female life history patterns as well as for investigations of links between nuptial gifts and sexual selection theory.

We analyzed data from 30 studies providing 44 comparisons of plant species richness under low vs. high grazing pressure in enriched or nutrient-rich and non-enriched or nutrient-poor ecosystems. All 19 comparisons from non-enriched or nutrient-poor ecosystems exhibited significantly lower species richness under high grazing than under low grazing. In contrast, 14 of 25 comparisons from enriched or nutrient-rich ecosystems showed significantly higher species richness under high grazing than under low grazing. However, nine of these 25 comparisons showed no significant impact of grazers on species richness, while two comparisons showed declines in species richness under high grazing. Based on all the comparisons, plant species richness decreases with high grazing in nutrient-poor ecosystems, while it increases with high grazing in nutrient-rich ecosystems. Although nutrient-rich ecosystems seemed to produce more variable responses to grazers than did nutrient-poor ecosystems, in rare cases high grazing produced a decline in species richness in nutrient-rich environments. We suggest that species richness declines with high grazing in nutrient-poor ecosystems because a limitation of available resources prevents regrowth of species after grazing, which may not be the case in nutrient-rich ecosystems. It is also possible that an increase in species richness under high grazing in nutrient-rich ecosystems may be due to an increase in the dominance of inedible species.

Our perception of the demographic effects of habitat fragmentation comes primarily from studies in the midwestern and eastern United States and Scandinavia. We know very little about the demographic effects of anthropogenically caused habitat fragmentation in habitats prone to natural disturbance, as is typical of most forest types in the western United States. We located and monitored 1916 nests on eight sites located in mostly forested landscapes and eight sites located in primarily agricultural landscapes to study the effects of landscape-level fragmentation on nest predation and brood parasitism in riparian areas in western Montana. Patterns of nest predation were opposite those documented from more eastern locales; predation rates were higher in forested landscapes than in fragmented landscapes dominated by agriculture. This pattern probably reflects the importance of forest predators in these landscapes. Red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) were much more abundant in forested landscapes and declined quickly with decreasing forest cover, whereas predators that typically increase in fragmented landscapes in the Midwest (such as corvids) increased only at very high levels of fragmentation. Patch size and distance to habitat edge did not influence predation rates. Brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater) decreased with increasing forest cover, but the strongest predictors of parasitism were the abundance of human development (farms and houses) on the landscape and the density of cowbird host species, not forest cover. The combined effects of predation and parasitism resulted in low nestmg productivity in both forested and agricultural landscapes for heavily parasitized species, while the species not affected by cowbird parasitism had greater nesting productivity in fragmented agricultural landscapes. Our results suggest that the effects of fragmentation are dependent on the habitat structure, the landscape context, the predator community, and the impact of parasitism.

However, the community effects of an important and widespread group of generalized parasites, the parasitic plants, have been poorly studied. I performed removal experiments to assess the role of a small annual hemiparasite, Triphysaria pusilla (Scrophulariaceae), in a California coastal prairie community. Removal of Triphysaria led to increased total biomass of the host assemblage; this effect was largely attributable to a substantial increase in the biomass of graminoids. In addition, host suitability differed dramatically among three annual taxa Triphysaria parasitizing grass hosts produced 3.2 and 6.4 times more fruits, on average, than those attacking two dicot hosts, Hypochaeris glabra and Lupinus nanus, respectively. Availability of multiple host species failed to improve parasite performance beyond that achieved on grasses alone. Triphysaria impacts also differed greatly among host species: natural densities of Triphysaria significantly reduced the dry mass of grasses, while Hypochaeris and Lupinus were unharmed. In addition to these direct effects, I tested whether Triphysaria attack influenced competitive interactions among host taxa. Natural densities of grasses significantly reduced growth and fecundity of Hypochaeris and Lupinus, suggesting that the presence of Triphysaria in mixed stands of hosts might allow competitive release of these dicot species. However, the combination of grasses and Triphysaria caused a more severe reduction in Lupinus performance than that caused by grasses alone. Thus, observations of direct effects among pairs of species were not sufficient to explain either the outcome or intensity of multi-species interactions. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that a generalist plant parasite can influence the structure of a natural plant community, and that interactions between a generalist parasite and its multiple host species can be difficult to predict from studies that consider only single host taxa.",63,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,"Coastal prairie, competition | Generalist | Parasitic plant | Parasitism | Triphysaria pusilla",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,31,NA,NA

We determined rates of carbon and nitrogen accumulation in the uppermost decimeters of a bog ecosystem using the pine method, which enables accurate dating of surface peat layers. We combined accumulation data with numerical and geostatistical analyses of the recent vegetation to establish the relationship between bog vegetation and rate of peat accumulation. Use of a laser technique for spatial positioning of 151 age-determined peat cores within a 20 x 20 m plot made it possible for us to give the first fine-scaled account of spatial and temporal variation in rates of mass, carbon, and nitrogen accumulation during the last century. Rates of C and N accumulation were highly variable at all spatial scales studied. For example, after ~125 yr of peat growth, C and N accumulation varied by factors of five and four, respectively, from 25 to 125 g/dm2 for C, and from 0.7 to 2.6 g/dm2 for N. It takes ~40 yr of peat accumulation before significant amounts of C are lost through decay. Hummocks built up by Sphagnum fuscum and S. rubellum were able to maintain average rates of C accumulation that exceed 2 g·dm-2·yr-1 during 50 yr of growth.

We also sought information on sex and age differences in timing of mortality, rarely studied among passerines. After colormarking, individuals were resighted monthly from September to May. Capture-recapture models were applied to separately estimate survival and resighting probabilities. Survival estimates given by three methods of varying complexity (simple counts, Jolly-Seber, Cormack-Jolly-Seber) were compared. The three different methods yielded similar survival estimates. Because simple counting does not account for emigration, consistent results from different analyses support the earlier view that Willow Tits are sedentary. Adults survived better than yearlings in all winters and exhibited more constant survival rates. Two-year data also suggest that winter and summer survival rates were similar in adults, but not in yearlings, for which mortality was greatest in winter. Males survived better than females in one winter. Temperature per se did not correlate with survival, but deviations to colder than long-term average temperature seemed to be associated with low survival probability, which could reflect occasional food limitation.

Fed birds survived winter better than did control birds, significantly so in yearlings and males, but not in adults or females.

To test the effects of a fourth trophic level on successive lower trophic levels under different levels of plant resource availability, we used Piper ant-plants and their associated arthropods as a model system in lowland, tropical rain forest.

To benefit from an association with maternal debris, seeds must remain with the debris, resulting in reduced risks to seedlings and enhancement of establishment success. Seedlings of Frasera speciosa (Gentianaceae) and Cirsium scopulorum (Asteraceae) were disproportionately abundant under decaying adult rosettes and infructescences relative to other microsites equidistant from the parent. Beneath decaying infructescences of both species, soil was significantly moister, and evaporation rates from hydrometers that mimicked young seedlings were significantly lower than in exposed (control) microsites. For F. speciosa, mean water potential of seedlings planted under infructescences was also significantly higher than that of seedlings planted into exposed plots. These data suggest that drought stress is reduced for seedlings associated with adult debris. In two populations of F. speciosa, adult cover had significant positive effects on seedling establishment in 1995. These advantages were mediated through enhanced survival of young seedlings, rather than emergence success. Cover enhanced seedling survival by 80% in one population and 145% in the other. In one population of C. scopulorum, no seedlings were established from seeds planted with or without debris in 1994 (an extremely dry year). However, in 1995 (a wetter year), seedlings were seven times more likely to emerge and about four times more likely to survive in association with debris than in exposed plots.

In this previous experiment, Danthonia and Panicum changed the soil community in a manner that reduced their growth relative to that of a third plant species, Anthoxanthum odoratum. In the current experiments, we found that inoculation with Pythium reduced overall plant mass and root: shoot ratios, but Danthonia and Panicum were more susceptible to the presence of Pythium than the other two plant species, Anthoxanthum and Plantago lanceolata. In addition, Pythium accumulates at different rates on different plant species, with a greater than tenfold higher population observed in association with Panicum compared to Anthoxanthum. The results of these experiments suggest that the accumulation of species-specific soil pathogens could account for the previous observation of negative feedback on plant growth through changes in the soil community.

Annual production and biomass turnover were estimated for the larval chironomid (midge) assemblage found on the submerged woody (snag) habitat of a Coastal Plain blackwater river. Temperature-specific growth rate equations, generated from field growth studies, were applied to the biomass values from quantitative field samples to obtain mean daily production on a monthly basis throughout the year. The most productive genera were the filtering collectors, Rheotanytarsus (31.1 g dry mass·m-2·yr-1 for snag surface area) and the gathering collectors, Polypedilum (11.3 g·m-2·yr-1) and Rheocricotopus (9.8 g·m-2·yr-1). Total production was 65.4 g·m-2.yr-1 based on summing values of individual taxa, and 69.9 g·m-2·yr-1 when applying a family-level equation to biomass of all taxa. When converted to production per square meter of river channel bottom, values were about one-third of the snag surface area estimates (20.1 g·m-2·yr-1). Total chironomid production was somewhat higher in a second sampling year (81.9 g·m-2·yr-1 for snag surfaces and 26.8 g·m-2·yr-1 for channel bottom). Production was relatively high throughout both years but tended to be lowest in winter with peaks in either summer or fall. These production estimates are among the highest ever reported for chironomids in freshwater systems, primarily owing to extremely high biomass turnover. Annual production/biomass (P/B) values were 158 for Rheocricotopus, 258 for Polypedilum, 196 for Rheotanytarsus, and 202 for total Chironomidae. For Polypedilum, such high annual P/B represents a biomass turnover rate of almost once per day. The P/B values are among the highest estimated for aquatic metazoans (including zooplankton) and are similar to or exceed turnover rates of microbes in many aquatic ecosystems.

To explore the interaction between disease incidence and mating system within natural populations of K. latifolia, we ascertained the correlation between disease intensity and two measures of plant reproductive success (proportional fruit set and seedling survival) and partitioned the correlation by pollination treatment (i.e., naturally pollinated, hand pollinated with outcrossed pollen, or self-pollinated). For outcrossed flowers, neither the number of fruits produced nor the performance of seedlings from these fruits was affected by the intensity of disease damage. However, for selfed flowers, both the number of fruits and the performance of seedlings were negatively correlated with disease damage on the maternal parent. Consequently, fungal infection on a maternal plant was associated with an increased proportion of outcrossed progeny produced by the host plant. Motivated by the observed correlation between disease and selfing, we performed a manipulative field experiment to examine the mechanism by which disease could influence the fitness consequences of different mating strategies. We hypothesized that intense C. kalmiae infection reduced K. latifolia resources by reducing photosynthetic leaf area and, consequently, enhanced abortion of self-fertilized fruits more than outcrossed fruits. We found that artificial leaf damage reduced outcrossed fruit set by 17% compared to controls. However, artificial leaf damage reduced selfed fruit set by 31% compared to controls. Similarly, artificial damage did not significantly affect infructescence abortion in outcrossed pollinations. However, for self-pollinated inflorescences, those subtended by damaged leaves experienced a 44% increase in infructescence abortion compared to controls.

Pinyon performance (e.g., growth, reproduction, water stress) has been shown to be markedly lower in cinder than in sandy-loam environments. Fungal community composition and richness were determined using RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) analysis of ectomycorrhizal root tips collected from three sites within each soil type. Several patterns emerged from these analyses. First, communities in both cinder and sandy-loam soils were dominated by one or a few abundant ectomycorrhizal types, a species abundance pattern common to many plant and animal communities. Second, unlike the pattern for many other organisms, ectomycorrhizal fungal type (species) richness was not correlated with measures of ecosystem productivity such as soil nutrient and moisture levels; cinder and sandy-loam soils had similar numbers of ectomycorrhizal fungal types (range of 15-19 fungal types for both soil types). Third, soil type and fungal community composition were linked, as cluster analysis demonstrated greater similarity of fungal communities from sites within soil types than between them. Differential amplification using primers with enhanced specificity for basidiomycetes indicated that an average of 85% of the ectomycorrhiza found at the sandy-loam sites were members of the subphylum Basidiomycotina, whereas over half (mean = 52%) of the ectomycorrhiza at the cinder sites were formed by members of other fungal groups, probably the subphylum Ascomycotina. Fourth, a preliminary survey of 14-45 ectomycorrhizal root tips from each of 20 trees at one cinder site indicated that trees were dominated by one or a few ectomycorrhizal RFLP types. However, the same RFLP types did not dominate on all trees, and dominant types showed considerable spatial variation. Fifth, the RFLP patterns of some fungal sporocarps matched those of ectomycorrhizal root tips, but many did not, indicating that many of the ectomycorrhizal fungi at these sites fruit infrequently, whereas other fungi with more abundant sporocarps may not form ectomycorrhiza. This emphasizes the need to characterize the ectomycorrhizal communities formed on the plant roots themselves, rather than characterization based on sporocarps alone, particularly in arid environments. Finally, the differences in ectomycorrhizal fungal communities we observed between soil types supported the concept that conserving fungal diversity requires conservation of host plant species over their entire range, not just typical sites. If future studies corroborate these patterns, our results suggest that abiotically stressful environments are important to include in these conservation efforts.",173,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Community composition | Conservation | Diversity | Ectomycorrhizal fungi | Environmental stress | RFLP analysis | Species richness | Sporocarp surveys,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,45,NA,NA

We also tested whether the amounts of organic compounds produced by Dysidea differed in the presence or absence of Cacospongia. To determine whether 7-deacetoxyolepupuane had another ecological function, we tested the compound as a predator deterrent. In field experiments, crude extracts of Dysidea and pure 7-deacetoxyolepupuane both caused necrosis in Cacospongia when they were incorporated into agar strips and placed in contact with Cacospongia for 7 d. Organic extract, scalaradial, and desacetylscalaradial concentrations in Cacospongia were not affected by the overgrowth of Dysidea.

For the first time, in this experiment, we have considered irradiance as a factor, in combination with animal prey, for an array of natural field conditions. The goal was to determine how carnivory translates to fitness within different radiation regimes. For this, it was necessary to quantify an array of plant responses, such as survival, growth, reproduction (sexual and vegetative reproduction), as well as responses related to carnivory investment (leaf shape and mucilage secretion). Both irradiance and animal food supply proved to be important limiting factors for P. vallisneriifolia under field conditions. Plants clearly decreased in performance from the sunny habitat to the deep-shade one, with plants growing in the least irradiance registering the lowest values for all variables analyzed. The clearest response to prey was the production of axillary buds. Most vegetative and reproductive responses depended heavily on the initial biomass of the plant before the experiments, the largest plants bearing the most leaves, flowers, stolons, and axillary buds. A gradient from less to more mucilage secretion appeared from deep-shade to sunny habitat, and within each habitat from prey exclusion to prey addition levels. Trapped prey stimulated digestive secretions in a positive feedback (the more prey, the more mucilage secretion) under all irradiance conditions. The curled, more secretory leaves of the sunny plants, in comparison with the nearly flattened, less secretory leaves of the deep-shade plants, illustrate the constraints imposed by differing scenarios on the capture of both prey and photons. With nonlimiting water availability, more irradiance and prey results in more survival, growth, and sexual and vegetative reproduction. Nevertheless, it is not usual to find an optimum combination of resources (i.e., irradiance, prey, and water) available in the same microhabitat during the Mediterranean summer. The spatial uncoupling of limiting resources progressively increased towards the extremes of the irradiance gradient (sunny and deepshade habitats, respectively), and therefore the dual photosynthetic and carnivore functions of P. vallisneriifolia leaves were not equally efficient in all habitats. These opposing resource gradients determined all vegetative and reproductive plant responses.

By adding glucose and nutrients we intended to manipulate microbial biomass in litter and soil which is assumed to form a major part of the food resources of saprophagous soil animals. Manipulation of the microbial part of the diet of saprophagous soil animals allowed us to study the importance of 'bottom-up' forces without changing spatial habitat characteristics. Addition of glucose and nutrients caused an increase in microbial biomass with a maximum in the CNP treatment (+52.3%, +51.1%, and +44.0% for the litter layer, for 0-3 and 3-6 cm soil depths, respectively). Separate additions of carbon and nutrients indicated that microorganisms in the litter layer were primarily limited by nitrogen, whereas soil microorganisms were primarily limited by phosphorus. In soil the content of carbon decreased by addition of phosphorus, and in litter the content of nitrogen increased by addition of nitrogen, also indicating that soil microorganisms were limited by phosphorus and litter microorganisms by nitrogen. Nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) concentrations in leaves of ash seedlings growing in experimental plots indicated that competition between microorganisms and plants for nutrients was severe in glucose treatments with microorganisms being the superior competitor. None of the animal groups studied (Lumbricidae, Diplopoda, Isopoda, and Chilopoda) exhibited a response that was parallel to that of microorganisms. Rather, earthworms appeared to be limited by availability of carbon, and in contrast to microorganisms, earthworm numbers and biomass increased strongly with application of glucose only. Maximum biomass of earthworms in the glucose-only treatment indicates that earthworms and microorganisms competed for carbon resources with microorganisms being the superior competitor when carbon and nutrients were available. Earthworm species differentially responded to experimental manipulations, and the density of one species (Aporrectodea rosea) even declined due to glucose applications. The responses of millipedes and isopods were generally less pronounced, but some species increased in numbers under certain treatments.

In a field experiment we manipulated natural burdens of five nematode species via anthelmintic treatment in one-half the free-ranging snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) on each of six study areas and supplemented overwinter food level on three areas, to assess whether treatments interacted synergistically. We predicted that the effects of parasitism would be aggravated in malnourished hares (i.e., hares not administered supplemental food), and that animals receiving both treatments would have (1) lower parasite burdens, and (2) higher body mass, fat storage, and reproduction, than those receiving only one or no treatments. Mean numbers of Trichuris leporis were lower in hares subjected to food supplementation, suggesting that nutritional status affected immunity to that species. Obeliscoides cuniculi, Nematodirus triangularis, Dirofilaria scapiceps, and Protostrongylus boughtoni numbers were not directly affected by supplementation. Body mass of parasite-normal controls (i.e., not administered the anthelmintic treatment) was negatively correlated to nematode abundance during May-June, implying that parasitism had a deleterious effect on hare mass at that time. However, the anthelmintic treatment failed to directly affect hare body mass, fat storage, or reproduction. Food supplementation had a positive effect on body mass, fat storage, and reproduction, although effects of food were neither strong nor consistent among study areas and body condition parameters being measured. Only 2 of 22 analyses of hare production yielded marginally significant (i.e., 0.05 < P < 0.10) interactions between food and parasitism; therefore, we concluded that the two factors were not strongly linked.

Soils were incubated at 30°C under aerobic and anaerobic conditions for 59 wk, and the results were fit with a two-pool kinetic model. Additionally, 39 different soil quality variables were used in a principal components analysis (PCA) to predict mineralization rates. Mineralization of C, N, and P differed significantly among wetland types, aeration status (aerobic vs. anaerobic), and their interaction term. Despite low total soil N and P, there was a rapid turnover of the nutrient pools in ombrotrophic sites, particularly under aerobic conditions. On a volumetric basis, C and N mineralization increased in a predictable manner across the ombrotrophic-minerotrophic gradient, largely due to increasing soil bulk density. However, P mineralization per cubic centimeter remained relatively high in the bogs. The higher total P content of more minerotrophic soils appears to be offset by greater P immobilization due to geochemical sorption, yielding overall lower availability. Total C turnover rates were relatively similar among sites, despite large differences in soil quality. We suggest that, over time, the decay rates of organic matter in different wetland communities converge to a common rate. In contrast, CH4 production was extremely low in ombrotrophic peats. The apparent labile pools of N (N0), P (P0), and C (C0) were generally <10% of their respective total pool sizes, except for P0 in the bogs, which constituted up to 33% of total soil P. From 10% to 87% of the N, P, and C mineralized after 59 wk was derived from their respective labile pools. A simple group of variables describing the physical degree of decomposition of organic matter was often as good as, or superior to, more complicated chemical analyses in predicting C, N, and P mineralization. Because peats are classified and mapped according to these variables, it should make scaling efforts in landscape analyses much more tractable. Large differences in mineralization rates in northern wetland communities demonstrate that climate change models should not consider these areas as homogeneous entities.

Few data are available on the effects of food quality on copepod life history traits. We measured several life history traits on a large number of individuals to document the effects of food quality on individual traits, on life history correlates, and on a composite measure of individual fitness in the freshwater copepod Boeckella triarticulata Thomson. Nauplii were raised individually on two diets: one consisted of the high quality alga Cryptomonas sp. (abbreviated as CR), and the second diet consisted of a combination of Cryptomonas sp. and the low quality cyanobacterium Anabaena flos-aquae (CA). The mixed CA diet slowed growth and development so that individuals raised on this diet were Older and smaller at metamorphosis and maturity. Despite these effects, there were no differences between diets in survival to maturity, and male copepods raised on the mixed diet lived significantly longer than females or than either sex raised on Cryptomonas alone. Females raised on the mixed diet produced more and larger clutches than those raised on CR, so that total egg production increased on this diet, although large intradiet variation obscured statistical differences between diets in these parameters. Intradiet variation was due to a large range in the number of clutches produced by individual females: some individuals produced 10-15 clutches, contradicting previous descriptions of this species as semelparous. Although diet affected age at first reproduction, it had no significant effect on individual fitness, estimated as λ. Boeckella triarticulata achieved high fitness either by minimizing age at first reproduction (CR diet) or by increasing reproductive output (CA diet). Data collected from cast-off exuviae allow nondestructive measures of individual life history traits along with a composite measure of individual fitness.

However, the reasons for the variability of DOC flows are unknown. Phytophagous insects such as aphids have not been considered a potential source of organic carbon, even though aphids feeding on trees excrete copious amounts of honeydew. We followed the key processes determining the origin, flow, and path of honeydew from the phyllosphere of a Norway spruce stand to the soil. We analyzed the chemical composition of needle leachates, throughfall, and soil solution to calculate fluxes of DOC and hexose-C in an aphid-infested and an uninfested Norway spruce stand. At the individual aphid level, the amount of honeydew produced was dependent on temperature, developmental stage, and the nutritional status of spruce. At the population level, colony growth and natural enemies influenced the amount of honeydew available in the phyllosphere. The growth rates of microorganisms on spruce needles were significantly increased when honeydew was available. This study of the fate of honeydew and associated metabolites within a forest stand shows that the concentrations of DOC and hexose-C in throughfall were reduced on the way to the soil and that there were no differences in the soil solutions from infested and uninfested stands. However, the distribution and abundance of honeydew-producing Homoptera had a marked effect on the spatial and temporal variability in the DOC concentrations in throughfall. High DOC concentrations in throughfall during summer are not exclusively due to the leaching of nutrients from leaves, but may also be attributed to the excreta of aphids. Our results highlight the importance of studying physiological and life history processes in addition to taking the traditional biomass approach to ecosystem studies. We discuss our results with regard to the types of information that are preserved, transformed, or lost when crossing the conceptual border between one scale of observation and another.

In laboratory experiments, increased tannin levels can interfere with the transmission of a virus that is consumed by larvae on oak foliage, and high mortality rates of larvae in the field are sometimes associated with low levels of defoliation. These latter results have led to the suggestion that gypsy moth defoliation may cause reduced mortality attributable to the virus by elevating oak tannin levels. In a series of field experiments, we directly tested the hypothesis that gypsy moth defoliation of oaks leads to reduced virus transmission rates. In each of three study years, in oak forests with almost no naturally occurring gypsy moths or virus, we measured virus transmission rates in gypsy moths feeding on oaks, with and without experimental defoliation. By carefully synchronizing our experiments with the phenology of natural gypsy moth populations, we mimicked natural virus transmission processes during that part of the gypsy moth life cycle when virus transmission occurs. In our experiments, there was no effect of gypsy moth defoliation on tannin levels; consequently, virus transmission in both the field and the lab was unaffected by defoliation. Although we did observe increased tannin levels on more severely defoliated oak trees in one of two naturally defoliated oak stands late in the season, virus transmission had virtually ceased by that time.

We defined regions at four spatial scales: major drainages, drainage-physiography units, hydrologic-physiography units, and sites. We used multiple regression to identify key correlates of local native and introduced diversity for each regional scale. Both local (e.g., microhabitat diversity) and regional (e.g., species richness) factors were correlated with local diversity; regional diversity was the most consistent correlate. Plots of local vs. regional native diversity were asymptotic for the three largest regional definitions, thereby suggesting community saturation. However, analogous plots for introduced species were not asymptotic; local introduced diversity was a linear function of regional introduced diversity. Introduced populations were pervasive, but less abundant locally than native populations, thereby suggesting that native species are better adapted. Overall, stream fish communities in Virginia appeared to be neither completely saturated nor freely invadable. The ability of regression models and particular independent variables to account for variation in local diversity changed considerably with regional scale. Most regional correlates of local diversity were scale dependent. The concept of hierarchical environmental filters provides a useful framework for integrating the multiple scales over which ecological processes organize communities.

We used data from laboratory analyses on energy content of fruit species eaten by trumpeters to calculate a phenology of energy content for food available on territories of focal groups, and to calculate daily energy intake of focal trumpeters. Additionally, we used lab measurements of basal metabolic rate of trumpeters to estimate daily energy requirements of wild trumpeters. Both census and focal sample data suggested that food availability on trumpeter territories varied widely, sometimes greatly exceeding and sometimes falling short of the amount that we calculated was necessary to meet average daily energy requirements of groups. To determine whether trumpeter territory size was related to food density, we conducted fruit removals. Every day, we removed an amount of fruit from the territory that was equivalent to the amount of fruit ingested daily by the focal group during a control period preceding the removal experiment. We conducted removal experiments during periods when food density on territories appeared to be abundant and also when food abundance appeared to be low. Trumpeter food consumption did not change when fruit was removed during periods of resource abundance; however, when experimental removals were conducted during periods of food scarcity, the total energy value of food consumed decreased significantly. These results suggest that food abundance on trumpeter territories sometimes exceeds and sometimes is close to or below the amount needed to meet energy needs of the groups.

Sessile and low mobility stages of all species were extremely vulnerable to IGP. Generally, the larger sized individual won confrontations. For similar sizes, lacewing larvae were superior to coccinellid larvae. We also tested whether IGP decreases when extraguild prey are introduced into the system. Data from five predator combinations revealed three types of responses: (I) an exponential decrease in IGP (lacewing instar I vs. coccinellid instar I); (2) a constant IGP (lacewing instar III vs. coccinellid instar I); (3) a constant IGP at low densities decreasing at high densities (lacewing instar III vs. gall midge old larva). Four theoretical scenarios are derived from these responses. Each is discussed according to the ecological attributes of the protagonists. This study shows that IGP is influenced by factors inherent to the predators and external factors such as extraguild prey density.

To investigate whether similar long-term patterns can occur when there is environmental variability, we produced stochastic versions of the three models. Long-term population fluctuations occurred over a wider range of parameter values in the stochastic models than in the deterministic models. This suggests that long-term population fluctuations are plausible features of natural tritrophic systems. We use this example to argue that characterizing nonlinearities should not be the sole objective when analyzing stochastic population dynamics. The long-term dynamical patterns produced by our stochastic models can be investigated using linear techniques to quantify the patterns of density dependence in the multispecies system. These techniques identify long-term patterns as near-random-walk dynamics occurring concomitantly with short-term quasi-cyclic dynamics in the three-dimensional three-species system.

We used the acetylene-reduction assay with carbon monoxide controls to determine whether high rates of N2 fixation are associated with pine forests in Maine.

Three hypotheses for the origin of parks are proposed. The 'permanent site hypothesis' states that the park-forest vegetation mosaic is a result of differences in physical characteristics of sites. In the 'remnant hypothesis' parks are thought to be remnants of vegetation that was widespread under previous climate conditions. The 'replacement hypothesis' states that parks replace forest vegetation in response to disturbance, climate change, or a combination of these two factors. Patterns in the past distribution of park and forest vegetation in the vicinity of Fish Creek Park (elevation 2750 m) were used to test these hypotheses. Fossil pollen extracted from the sediments of five small ponds in and around Fish Creek Park was used to reconstruct Holocene vegetation changes. Changes in vegetation were reconstructed through the use of multivariate analyses and pollen ratios derived from modern surface samples and by comparison with pollen data from other studies. The pollen record indicates that shortly after deglaciation (~ 11 000 yr BP) the area supported alpine tundra, followed by whitebark pine-spruce-fir parkland at ~9500 yr BP. From ~8500 to 6000 yr BP, a pine parkland occupied the area, perhaps in response to climate conditions warmer than today. By 5000 yr BP a mixed pine-spruce-fir forest resembling the modern subalpine forest near Fish Creek Park probably replaced the pine parkland at all five sites. The modern park vegetation originated only within the last ~2500 yr. The conversion to park vegetation may not have been synchronous at all three sites, and the replacement of forest by park did not always result in a long-term conversion to park vegetation. The timing and pattern of changes in the vegetation mosaic eliminate the permanent site and remnant hypotheses and suggest instead that climatic cooling over the last several thousand years, possibly combined with removal of forest cover by fire or some other disturbance, could explain the origin of Fish Creek Park.",54,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Climate change | Palynology | Park | Quaternary paleoecology | Vegetation mosaic | Wind River Range | Wyoming,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,71,NA,NA

At high elevations one likely result is a longer snow-free season, which will affect plant growth and reproduction. We studied flowering and fruiting of 10 angiosperm species in a subalpine meadow over 4 yr, focusing on plant responses to warming by overhead heaters. The 10 species reproduced in a predictable sequence during 3-4 mo between spring snowmelt and fall frosts. Experimental warming advanced the date of snowmelt by almost 1 wk on average, relative to controls, and similarly advanced the mean timing of plant reproduction. This phenological shift was entirely explained by earlier snowmelt in the case of six plant species that flowered early in the season, whereas four later-flowering species apparently responded to other cues. Experimental warming had no detectable effect on the duration of flowering and fruiting, even though natural conditions of early snowmelt were associated with longer duration and greater overlap of reproduction of sequentially flowering species. Fruit set was greater in warmed plots for most species, but this effect was not significant for any species individually. We conclude that global warming will cause immediate phenological shifts in plant communities at high elevations, mediated largely through changes in timing of snowmelt. Shifts on longer time scales are also likely as plant fitnesses, population dynamics, and community structure respond to altered phenology of species relative to one another and to animal mutualists and enemies. However, the small spatial scale of experiments such as ours and the inability to perfectly mimic all elements of climate change limit our ability to predict these longer term changes.

Here we develop a demographic model describing the life history of a hemimetabolous insect to evaluate the relative importance of predator effects on mortality and growth of damselflies (Enallagma boreale) in fishless ponds and may flies (Baetis bicaudatus) in trout streams. Previous experiments have shown that dragonfly predators in fishless ponds inflict direct mortality and cause reduced growth rates in Enallagma damselflies. Parameterization of the demographic model from these data show, however, that only the direct mortality effects of dragonflies should significantly influence damsel fly population dynamics. This is because damselfly size at emergence does not influence adult female fecundity, so the effects of dragonflies on damselfly larval growth do not influence adult fecundity. Likewise, both trout and stonefly predators inflict mortality on larval Baetis mayflies and cause decreases in growth rates. However, our demographic analyses indicate that the growth effects of both predators should dominate the population-dynamic effects on Baetis. This is because size at emergence translates directly into adult fecundity in mayflies. We also present data suggesting that developmental responses to changes in environmental conditions (e.g., predator abundances, resource availabilities) differ between species depending on these same life history parameters. The biological significance of lethal vs. sublethal predator impacts must be evaluated in a demographic framework to identify whether alterations in growth rate, and the timing of and size at metamorphosis, significantly influence population dynamics.

We examined patterns of seed rain, seed abundance in the soil, and seed mortality of two common pioneer trees, Miconia argentea (Melastomataceae) and Cecropia insignis (Moraceae), on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. For each species, we selected four isolated, reproductive trees within a 50-ha forest dynamics plot. Seed rain and soil seed bank samples were collected, respectively, in mesh traps and from soil cores sampled along transects radiating away from the tree crowns. At below-crown sites, seed rain inputs far exceeded soil seed bank densities measured at the end of the fruiting season. For Miconia, the below-crown seed bank in the surface 3 cm of soil accounted for only 23% of seed rain, and for Cecropia, only 2%. However for Miconia, at distances >5 m from the crown seed bank densities exceeded the annual seed rain input. For both species log seed densities in the seed bank declined linearly with log distance from the crown and also decreased dramatically through the year. The annual loss rate of Miconia Seeds was >90% below the crown and declined to 65% at 30 m from the crown. The annual loss rate for Cecropia was >90% at all distances. Seed losses in the seed bank could be largely attributed to mortality from pathogenic fungi. Fungicide treatment significantly increased seed survival in the soil for both species. For these two gap-dependent pioneer species, rapid seed-bank turnover rates and logarithmic declines in soil seed density with distance from adults suggested that both the spatial distribution and timing of gap formation may have influenced their chances of successful gap colonization.

Nevertheless, dormant stages could potentially have significant impacts on the ecology and evolution of the active population.

Variation in the duration of energy storage prior to reproduction is an important, but little-studied, axis of life history variation. We experimentally manipulated the availability of resources to females of a long-lived viviparous lizard (Eulamprus tympanum, Scincidae) in the first year of a two-year study to assess the relative importance of current food intake vs. stored reserves as sources of energy for breeding. Females given greater access to high temperatures (and hence, to resources) in the laboratory amassed larger caudal energy stores than did females with lesser opportunities. Energy intake during gestation slightly influenced offspring size, but the magnitude of energy stores prior to ovulation had a more dramatic effect: females with larger caudal energy stores produced much larger litters in the following year. Growth rates of females were unaffected by basking treatments or by reproduction in either year, but females that reproduced in the second year showed a large concomitant decrease in caudal energy stores compared to females that did not reproduce, indicating a large energetic cost of reproduction. Hence, reproductive output within this species can be influenced by resource availability over 12 months prior to reproduction, and simple comparisons of reproductive output with current resource availability may fail to detect the ways in which phenotypically plastic life history traits are influenced by environmental features. In addition to an appropriate temporal framework, models of resource allocation should also incorporate the possible roles of physiological and morphological constraints (e.g., maternal inability, in some species, to modify postovulation reproductive expenditure) and trade-offs with other life history currencies (e.g., decrements in maternal survival due to high relative clutch masses). The time lag between resource acquisition and expenditure may have significant consequences for a population's demographic response to shifts in resource availability or predation pressure (via tail autotomy).

Larval anurans are an important prey assemblage found in both kinds of ponds. We stocked both predators in artificial ponds together with six species of larval anurans, forming different species assemblages, to assess whether a similar abundance and biomass of each predator would have comparable impacts on community patterns. The predators differed in their effects on prey species composition but had similar impacts on composite community attributes, including prey species diversity and total prey biomass. Enneacanthus eliminated Pseudacris crucifer, Hyla andersonii, Hyla versicolor, and Scaphiopus holbrookii, creating a community dominated by Bufo woodhousii and Rana sphenocephala. Notophthalmus eliminated Bufo, creating an assemblage dominated by Pseudacris but also containing four additional species. Very few anurans survived in ponds containing both newts and fish. The different consequences of predation by newts and fish reflect different effectiveness of anuran antipredator defenses against these predators. Mechanisms that reduced predation by fish, such as unpalatability, were ineffective against newts.

Often, these ontogenetic changes are discrete and coincide with metamorphosis (e.g., amphibians), but more gradual niche changes can occur during growth. Identifying nondiscrete changes in diet and understanding their implications at the population and community levels are especially difficult for ecologists who study detritivores and other species that have poorly characterized diets. Theory and several lines of evidence suggest, however, that benthic juveniles of species that deposit feed as adults may be unable to meet their nutritional demands by deposit feeding. To reject the null hypothesis that both juveniles and adults of deposit-feeding species assimilate the same diet and to infer ontogenetic changes in diet, I used stable carbon isotopes as a natural diet tracer. I quantified body-size-dependent variations in the δ13C of four species of tentaculate, surface-deposit-feeding polychaetes: the ampharetid Hobsonia florida and the spionids Pseudopolydora kempi japonica, Polydora cornuta, and Pygospio elegans. In addition to worm tissues, I measured the isotopic compositions of the most likely primary producers at each field site (benthic diatoms, macroalgae, and saltmarsh grasses) to predict the worms' carbon sources. All species showed significant size-dependent variations in δ13C. Furthermore, populations of P. kempi japonica at two different sandflats had similar ontogenetic trends despite isotopic differences in available foods at each site. Individuals fed a fixed diet in the laboratory, however, did not show significant size-dependent variation in δ13C, leaving ontogenetic changes in diet as the most parsimonious explanation of the field data. Regression analyses indicated that the gradual change in δ13C with body size was nonlinear, with most of the change in δ13C occurring before individuals reach sexual maturity. The complex life cycle of these species, therefore, includes both a radical change in niche when larvae metamorphose to juveniles and a gradual niche shift as benthic juveniles grow. The isotopic data indicate that the smallest juveniles assimilated much of their carbon from benthic diatoms (δ13C ≃ -20‰), while adults assimilated most of their carbon from detritus derived from macroalgae (δ13C ≃ -9‰) or saltmarsh grasses (δ13C ≃ -14‰). Because abundances of benthic diatoms or other high-quality components of sediment are more variable and more likely to be in limiting supply than detritus or bulk sedimentary organics, populations of species that deposit feed as adults may experience food-related recruitment bottlenecks during the juvenile stage.",115,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,"Benthic ecology | Complex life cycle | Deposit feeder | Detritivore | False Bay, Washington | Ontogenetic niche shift | Polychaete | Recruitment bottleneck | Resource partitioning | Skagit Bay, Washington | Stable isotope | δ C 13",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,87,NA,NA

We compared equally sized clipped and unclipped plants in two populations in central Sweden during three years, 1992-1994, and plants clipped at different occasions, from 20 June to 2 August. Clipping once, by removing half of the biomass, significantly increased fruit production without affecting the number of seeds per fruit or seed mass. The degree of compensation was sensitive to the timing of clipping. Damage induced overcompensation only during a restricted inductive time period (ITP) in July. Plants clipped before about 1 July or after about 22 July achieved no overcompensation. The early limit of ITP was presumably determined by the availability of resources that could be mobilized for regrowth after damage. The late limit, on the other hand, depended primarily on the differentiation of meristems close to flowering in early August. The effects of clipping varied between years, presumably due to drought in 1994. During 1992-1993, plants consistently overcompensated for clipping on 1-20 July, whereas in 1994 only early clipping from 1 to 12 July induced overcompensation. In 1994, plants clipped in late July compensated less well, due to delayed fruit maturation leading to a high proportion of immature fruits at the end of the season. Because of this between-year variation, we used geometric mean fitness to calculate the expected tong-term effects of damage over generations. The analysis suggests that the long-term effects can vary from positive to negative, depending on the frequency of bad fruiting years. The time limits of ITP fit well the hypothesis that predictable damage in July may have selected for a capacity of overcompensation in the field gentian. Because the ultimate limits of ITP are set by the length of the vegetation period, we expect overcompensation in this species to be more common in regions with a longer growing season.",160,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Fruit production | Gentianella campestris | Geometric mean fitness | Grazing | Induction | Lifetime success | Mowing | Overcompensation | Phenology | Temporal heterogeneity,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,88,NA,NA

One fundamental prediction from the theory is that long-lived species should be restrictive in any increase of their current investment. It has been suggested that long-lived species, therefore, have evolved a fixed level of investment in young in order to maximize their own adult survival. However, recent experimental studies have shown that long-lived seabirds have a flexible reproductive performance and adjust their effort in raising young, both according to their own body condition and to the need of the chicks. In this study, we present a model of the optimal balance between reproductive effort and adult survival for long-lived birds breeding in a stochastic environment. During poor breeding conditions, maximum fitness is achieved either by not breeding at all, or by abandoning the brood. Beyond a certain threshold in breeding conditions, there is a steep increase in reproductive effort and an equally steep decrease in adult survival. The model is applied to two hypothetical long-lived seabirds differing in their potential fecundity. For the genotype with a potentially high fecundity, the model predicts a high threshold for breeding (i.e., breeding conditions need to be very good for the species to attempt breeding); above the threshold, the value of reproduction in terms of fitness is high. For the genotype with potentially low fecundity, the model predicts a low threshold for breeding, and the value of reproduction in terms of fitness is low. By increasing clutch size in the model, we examine the optimal response of the two genotypes to an experimental brood size manipulation. For both genotypes, the model predicts that the threshold for breeding is lower among controls than among enlarged broods, giving a range of possible outcomes of the experiment depending on breeding conditions. The few studies on brood enlargements in long-lived species carried out so far may support the predictions from the model.",220,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Brood enlargement | Cost of reproduction | Life history | Long-lived species | Models | Parental effort | Seabirds | Stochastic environment,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,92,NA,NA

At the brackish marsh, herbivory caused a shift in dominance in the fertilized plots from a species that is considered the competitive dominant, but is selectively eaten, to another less palatable species. At the fresh marsh, increased dead biomass in the absence of herbivory and in the fertilized plots probably contributed to the decrease in species density, perhaps by limiting germination of annuals.

Understanding factors affecting survival patterns is therefore critical for developing and testing theories of population dynamics and for developing management strategies aimed at preventing declines or extinction in such taxa. Few studies have used modern analytical approaches for analyzing variation and testing hypotheses about survival probabilities in large mammals. This paper reports a detailed analysis of annual adult survival in the Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris), an endangered marine mammal, based on a mark-recapture approach. Natural and boat-inflicted scars distinctively 'marked' individual manatees that were cataloged in a computer-based photographic system. Photo-documented resightings provided 'recaptures.' Using open population models, annual adult-survival probabilities were estimated for manatees observed in winter in three areas of Florida: Blue Spring, Crystal River, and the Atlantic coast. After using goodness-of-fit tests in Program RELEASE to search for violations of the assumptions of mark-recapture analysis, survival and sighting probabilities were modeled under several different biological hypotheses with Program SURGE. Estimates of mean annual probability of sighting varied from 0.948 for Blue Spring to 0.737 for Crystal River and 0.507 for the Atlantic coast. At Crystal River and Blue Spring, annual survival probabilities were best estimated as constant over the study period at 0.96 (95% CI = 0.951-0.975 and 0.900-0.985, respectively). On the Atlantic coast, where manatees are impacted more by human activities, annual survival probabilities had a significantly lower mean estimate of 0.91 (95% CI = 0.887-0.926) and varied unpredictably over the study period. For each study area, survival did not differ between sexes and was independent of relative adult age. The high constant adult-survival probabilities estimated for manatees in the Blue Spring and Crystal River areas were consistent with current mammalian life history theory and other empirical data available for large, long-lived mammals. Adult survival probabilities in these areas appeared high enough to maintain growing populations if other traits such as reproductive rates and juvenile survival were also sufficiently high lower and variable survival rates on the Atlantic coast are cause for concern.",57,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Life history traits | Marine mammals | Mark-recapture | Open population models | Photo-identification | Sighting probabilities | Survival probabilities | Trichechus manatus,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,94,all,All Open Access

We conducted a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA, a form of direct gradient analysis) of sapling and environmental data collected from 1980 to 1990 to investigate this hypothesis. The CCA recovered two significant axes, and of the eight environmental variables included, only elevation and percentage sky explained significant portions of the variability in species location. Axis 1 was correlated with elevation, while Axis 2 was correlated with percentage sky. Comparison of first axis rankings with species flood tolerance rankings obtained from the literature showed substantial agreement, indicating that elevation was a surrogate for flood tolerance. Comparison of second axis rankings with species shade tolerance rankings obtained from the literature showed little correspondence between position on the light gradient and species shade tolerance rankings; several of the most shade-tolerant species were placed on the high-light end of the light gradient. These results suggest that sapling distributions are responding primarily to flooding and light. The failure of the species to assort along the light gradient in accordance with their shade tolerance suggests that flooding interacts with life history traits of individual species, especially shade tolerance, resulting in complex species-specific responses. When we attempt to tease apart the interaction between light and flooding, we find two components: flood tolerance may allow persistence of some species under lower light conditions than normal, and flood intolerance may limit some normally shade-tolerant species to high-light conditions, where growth is fast enough to allow escape from the flooding hazard.",82,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Big Thicket National Preserve | Bottomland | Direct gradient analysis | Flood tolerance | Floodplain | Light | Neches River | Ordination | Regeneration | Saplings | Shade tolerance | Texas,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,97,NA,NA

Assessment of clonal variation using 'in gel' DNA fingerprinting of gynogens from three drainages indicated that all drainages contained only a single clone. When environments associated with beaver pond succession were pooled across drainages, P. eos was more abundant in active beaver ponds, while gynogens were at higher frequencies in collapsed pond and stream environments. Gynogen frequency for different successional environments classified according to drainage indicated strong variation among drainages, especially in pond environments, but a consistent pattern of increased gynogen frequency in collapsed ponds or streams. Intensive sampling within one drainage across successional beaver pond sites, physical habitats, and gradients of oxygen concentration indicated that P. eos, P. neogaeus, and gynogens were all most abundant in the highly oxygenated littoral environment of an upland pond. P. eos abundance and its relative frequency in the gynogenetic complex decreased, while gynogen frequency increased, in a poorly oxygenated collapsed beaver pond and beaver meadow. Fish transplant experiments revealed that gynogens survived longer and had greater physiological tolerance to oxygen stress than sexual progenitors, especially P. eos. Principal component analysis of 11 growth-related morphometric characteristics revealed morphological intermediacy of the hybrid gynogens between the sexual progenitors, with factors related to trophic morphology, especially mouth width and mouth length, segregating the different forms. A comparison of morphological relationships in a beaver pond with a gynogen frequency of 25-35% to those of a pond with a gynogen frequency of only 6-7% suggested that there was a release in the trophic morphology of P. eos in response to reduced gynogen abundance.

On a broad geographic scale, young birds were highly philopatric, returning from wintering grounds several thousand kilometers away to nest on the same island and often in the same field where they had hatched the year before. In some cases, birds chose nest sites within a few meters of their natal nest. The median dispersal distance between a bird's natal nest and its first nest as an adult was 228 m, a distance equivalent to about six times the diameter of an average territory. Nearly three-quarters of the breeding birds in the study population had been banded as nestlings or fledglings within a 10-ha area on one island, which suggests that most birds in the population originated within the 127-ha archipelago. Within the archipelago, males and females dispersed similar distances from their natal site. There was no correlation between natal dispersal distances of parents and their offspring, nor was there a correlation between natal dispersal distances of siblings, which indicated that natal dispersal has low heritability. Sex, hatching date, fledging mass, and population densities during the previous and current years were all poor predictors of natal dispersal distance. Males that were strongly philopatric recruited significantly more offspring during their lifetime than males raised outside the study area, although there were no differences between philopatric and dispersing females. Birds tended to shift to distinct parts of the island to breed if their parents of the opposite sex still occupied the territory where they had hatched. Dispersal was not affected by return of same-sex parents. Distances between nests of siblings raised the same year were farther apart than expected by chance, based on Monte Carlo simulations. Although many birds in the population had the opportunity to pair with kin, some mechanism, yet to be determined, enabled birds to avoid inbreeding: in 1073 nesting attempts involving birds of known parentage, no individuals were known to have paired with close relatives (coefficient of kinship >0.125). Because complete inbreeding avoidance occurred in <1% of Monte Carlo simulations, the absence of inbreeding among Kent Island Savannah Sparrows is unlikely to be due to chance. Understanding natal dispersal in birds requires a combination of models: ecogenetic models at broad geographic scales (e.g., adaptation to local environments), ecological constraints and neutral models at smaller spatial scales (e.g., unavailability of territories within particular habitats), and genetic models (e.g., inbreeding avoidance).",133,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Canada | Inbreeding | Islands | Kent Island | Natal dispersal | Passerculus sandwichensis | Philopatry | Savannah Sparrow | Scale,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,99,NA,NA

In this paper, we examine the role of flow velocities in governing community structure in marine intertidal communities. We broaden the traditional definition of 'bottom-up' forces to include the delivery of nutrients, food, and larval resources to habitats and then test the hypothesis that, by controlling these fluxes as well as mediating predator effects, flow velocities leave strong bottom-up signatures on shoreline communities. We examined this hypothesis by quantifying community structure and dynamics at high and low flow sites in a tidal estuary in Maine. High flow sites were characterized by dense barnacle and mussel cover, while low flow sites had considerable bare space. High flow sites also had greater grazer and predator densities than low flow sites. Recruitment of all common shoreline organisms with planktonic larvae was greater at high flow sites, in direct proportion to the increased fluid flux there. Flow effects on the growth of the herbivorous and carnivorous components of the food web were less predictable. High flows increased the growth of barnacles, but not mussels, and increased the growth of the carnivorous gastropods that preyed on them. In contrast, high flows decreased the accumulation of benthic diatoms, but this was unrelated to the growth rates of herbivorous gastropods. High flow sites were universally characterized by low predation intensity and per capita predation rates on all three prey species. Our results show that the strength of top-down and bottom-up forces varies with flow rate in this estuary. Consumer stress (top-down) models accurately explain patterns we saw at low flow sites, but bottom-up processes predicted from nutrient/productivity models dominate at high flow sites. High consumer pressure is the dominant structuring force at low flow sites, whereas at high flow sites predators are inhibited, and individual recruitment and growth rates become the dominant structuring forces. We suggest that hydrodynamics may commonly decouple predation and resource processes in many aquatic systems when the physical process responsible for variation in top-down forces also acts as a strong bottom-up force.",190,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Bottom-up forces | Estuary | Hydrodynamic refuge | Intertidal community structure | Larval recruitment | Maine | Predation | Tidal currents | Top-down forces,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,100,NA,NA

Previous studies have demonstrated that soil nutrient resources become spatially more heterogeneous and are redistributed into islands of fertility with the shift in vegetation. The research presented here addressed the question of whether soil resources become more temporally heterogeneous as well as more spatially heterogeneous when grassland undergoes desertification to form shrubland. Within adjacent grassland and creosotebush sites, soil profiles were described at three soil pits, and samples were collected for description of nutrient resources within the profile. Relative abundance of plant cover and bare soil was determined within each site using line transects. Surface samples (0-20 cm depth) of bare soil and soil beneath the canopies of grasses and creosotebush were collected 17 times during 1992-1994. Soil samples were analyzed for moisture, extractable ammonium and nitrate, nitrogen mineralization potential, microbial biomass carbon, total organic carbon, microbial respiration, dehydrogenase activity, the ratio of microbial C to total organic C (C(mic)/C(org)), and the ratio of microbial respiration to biomass carbon (metabolic quotient). The major differences in the structure of soils between sites were the apparent loss of 3-5 cm depth of sandy surface soil at the creosotebush site and an associated increase in calcium carbonate content at a more shallow depth. Soils under plants at both sites had greater total and available nutrient resources, with higher concentrations under creosotebush than under grasses. Greatest temporal variation in available soil resources was observed in soils under creosotebush. When expressed on the basis of area, available soil resources were higher in the grassland than in the creosotebush shrubland, primarily due to the difference in plant cover (45% in grassland, 8% in creosotebush shrubland).",182,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Bouteloua eriopoda and gracilis | Chihuahuan Desert | Desertification | Ecotone | Grass-land | Larrea tridentata | Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site | N mineralization | Shrubland | Soil microbes | Soil respiration | Temporal variability,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,101,NA,NA

Furthermore, there is a need for theory to predict the conditions under which we expect interactions to remain mutualistic once established. We adopt a biological market approach to present a model for the evolution of resource exchange mutualisms, using the relationship between plants and mycorrhizal fungi as an example. We apply the economic theory of relative advantage to investigate the conditions under which species ought to specialize and trade. A simple economic analogy demonstrates that, in a two-resource model, a species that is relatively efficient at acquiring one resource would benefit from specialization on acquisition of that resource accompanied by trade for the other resource. The theory of relative advantage extends this prediction to show that specialization and trade confer an advantage even for species that are relatively poor resource competitors for both resources. Under the assumptions of our model, we show that two species ought to specialize in the acquisition of one resource and trade for a second resource as long as each species perceives different relative acquisition costs for the two resources. We also describe the conditions under which changing resource availabilities will benefit, or harm, both partners in a mutualism. We predict conditions conducive to mutualisms to occur when the costs of resource exchange are low, the opportunity to ensure fair trade is high, or the cost of tolerating cheaters is low.

Relative root mean squared error was used as the primary assessment criterion.

Inductive food concentrations are well above the threshold food concentration (where r(m) = 0). Even when severely food limited, some females produce only subitaneous eggs, and some produce a mixture of subitaneous and diapausing eggs. Production of both types of eggs may be a risk-spreading strategy: diapausing eggs provide a refuge from short periods of very low food availability, and subitaneous eggs permit some population growth as long as food availability remains above the threshold food concentration. While prolonged food limitation reduces the birth rate, the diapause response is not always associated with, and thus probably is not directly caused by, a decreased birth rate. This supposition is consistent with the fact that the presence of a toxic cyanobacterium at high food concentrations reduces the birth rate but does not induce the diapause response.

To illustrate, I predicted territory boundaries for populations of the fire ant Solenopsis invicta using several alternative mathematical descriptions of territorial fighting. According to the most successful formula, the aggressive pressure applied at any point on the territory perimeter increases linearly with the biomass of the defending colony but decreases with territory area and with the square of the distance to the colony's nest. An iterative algorithm predicts the size and location of boundary segments given the positions and sizes of colonies. By all measured criteria, this model produced more accurate predictions of territory areas and shapes than alternative models that omit the effects of resident size or the dependence of aggressive pressure on territory area. Modifications can incorporate nest relocations, strategic variation in the degree of aggressive pressure applied, habitat heterogeneity, and other biological details. However, even with simple assumptions, the model predicts much of the variation in the sizes and shapes of fire ant territories in natural conditions.

Here we examine whether a thermodynamic perspective can enhance our mechanistic and predictive understanding of the biogeochemical function of soil-stream interfaces, by considering how microbial communities interact with variations in supplies of electron donors and acceptors. Over a two-year period we analyzed > 1400 individual samples of subsurface waters from networks of sample wells in riparian wetlands along Smith Creek, a first-order stream draining a mixed forested-agricultural landscape in southwestern Michigan, USA. We focused on areas where soil water and ground water emerged into the stream, and where we could characterize subsurface flow paths by measures of hydraulic head and/or by in situ additions of hydrologic tracers. We found strong support for the idea that the biogeochemical function of soil-stream interfaces is a predictable outcome of the interaction between microbial communities and supplies of electron donors and acceptors. Variations in key electron donors and acceptors (NO3/-, N2O, NH4/+, 8O4/2-, CH4, and dissolved organic carbon [DOC]) closely followed predictions from thermodynamic theory. Transformations of N and other elements resulted from the response of microbial communities to two dominant hydrologic flow paths: (1) horizontal flow of shallow subsurface waters with high levels of electron donors (i.e., DOC, CH4, and NH4/+), and (2) near-stream vertical upwelling of deep subsurface waters with high levels of energetically favorable electron acceptors (i.e., NO3/-, N2O, and 8O4/2-). Our results support the popular notion that soil-stream interfaces can possess strong potential for removing dissolved N by denitrification. Yet in contrast to prevailing ideas, we found that denitrification did not consume all NO3/- that reached the soil-stream interface via subsurface flow paths. Analyses of subsurface N chemistry and natural abundances of δ15N in NO3/- and NH4/+ suggested a narrow near-stream region as functionally the most important location for NO3/- consumption by denitrification. This region was characterized by high throughput of terrestrially derived water, by accumulation of dissolved NO3/- and N2O, and by low levels of DOC. Field experiments supported our hypothesis that the sustained ability for removal of dissolved NO3/- and N2O should be limited by supplies of oxidizable carbon via shallow flowpaths. In situ additions of acetate, succinate, and propionate induced rates of NO3/- removal (~1.8 g N·m-2·d-1) that were orders of magnitude greater than typically reported from riparian habitats. We propose that the immediate near-stream region may be especially important for determining the landscape-level function of many riparian wetlands.

Here we use a capture-recapture approach to species richness estimation with North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) data in order to estimate species detectability and thus gain insight about its importance. In particular, competing models making different assumptions about species detectability are available.

Stream impoundment by beavers affected species richness at the reach scale, but this effect was highly dependent on pond age and drainage area above the pond. In headwater streams, species richness per pond increased to a high in ponds 9-17 yr old and then decreased to a low in ponds >17 yr old. Farther downstream, species richness showed little change with pond age. Assemblage structure varied significantly among unimpounded, impounded, and previously impounded stream reaches, and variation in assemblage structure among ponds was related to pond age and physical habitat. In large ponds there was a shift from lotic to lentic species, and as ponds aged, small-bodied minnows were replaced by larger predators. Because there was high species turnover among impounded and previously impounded reaches, beavers affected patterns of species richness at the drainage basin scale; we collected more species in first- and second-order streams (32 and 38, respectively) than in third-order streams (26). Taken together these results indicate: (1) that beavers have a positive effect on fish species richness in low-order, blackwater streams, but maintenance of this effect requires preservation of both spatial and temporal dynamics of beaver pond creation and abandonment, and (2) the positive relationship between stream fish species richness and drainage area described for many streams may be a recent phenomenon resulting from the extirpation of beavers from much of their historical range.",101,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Anoxic conditions | Beaver ponds | Castor canadensis | Fish assemblages | Fish predation | Landscape position | Patch dynamics | Pond age | Species richness,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,110,NA,NA

We used two genetically distinct strains with different intrinsic characteristics to test explicitly for interactions between spacing behavior and the degree of habitat fragmentation and connectivity. The experimental habitat configurations were created by mowing enclosed meadow plots so that habitat (meadow) fragments were imbedded in a hostile, barren matrix of nonhabitat. We used three types of habitat patch configurations to contrast two levels of fragmentation (large vs. small habitat fragments) and two levels of connectivity (small isolated vs. small corridor connected habitat fragments), while keeping the total area of habitat and distances between fragments constant. The least fragmented systems contained two habitat fragments large enough to encompass several female home ranges (large fragment plots). Both of the two other habitat configurations contained six small habitat fragments, each of the size corresponding to the home range of a single female. The two small fragment configurations differed with respect to connectivity in that one configuration had 0.5 m wide corridors connecting two triplets of patches (corridor plots), while the other small patch configuration had no corridors (small fragment plots). Four population replicates (two of each root vole strain) of each configuration were employed over two years. Home range area estimates showed rather complex responses to habitat fragmentation depending on strain and sex. This was expected as the two strains and males and females had been previously shown to exhibit different space requirements. Core areas were, however, unaffected by fragmentation pattern at the spatial scale employed. The most pronounced and consistent responses to habitat fragmentation concerned movement rates for both sexes and the degree of space sharing between matrilineally related and unrelated females. The frequency of home range overlaps (irrespective of matrilineal relatedness and strain) was highest in the large-fragment plots and lowest in the small-fragment plots. The degree of overlap between matrilineally related females showed a reverse trend, however, indicating that space sharing was more directed towards kin in the most fragmented systems. The rate of interfragment movements increased with habitat fragmentation. Corridors induced more individuals to move between the smallest fragments. Males generally moved more frequently between fragments than did females.

In natural populations, two morphs, euphallic individuals (regular hermaphrodites) and aphallic individuals (missing the male copulatory organ), co-occur at various ratios. To quantify whether the loss of the male organ in aphallics may be compensated for by other functions, we compared the fecundity, size, and survival of 123 aphallic and 111 euphallic snails originating from 53 families and three natural populations under optimal (25°C) and stressful (19°C and 30°C) temperatures. We also compared the hatching rate and survival of offspring of 10 aphallic and 10 euphallic snails per population at these three temperatures. Firstly, we confirmed a strong effect of temperature on the determination of the sexual morph. Secondly, we found that the two morphs did not differ in size, fecundity, hatching rate, or survival of offspring, suggesting no obvious cost of the male function in isolated snails, even under stressful conditions. However, a trade-off was observed: aphallic individuals laid more capsules, though with fewer eggs per capsule, than euphallic individuals.

Vertical biomass profiles at peak standing crop were similar for short, mid-height, and tall grasslands, with root biomass dropping sharply with depth, except for short grasslands on soils that, atypically, lack a hardpan. In those grasslands, shallow root biomass was lower than in other grasslands, but biomass at depth was distinctly greater. For long-term protected grasslands, root biomasses at peak were identical in short grasslands, whether fenced or unfenced, but fenced tall grasslands had a lower root biomass than grazed plots.

We investigated how variation in forest-canopy openness caused by hurricanes affected population dynamics.

Seven 8 x 8 stage-classified matrices for plant population dynamics were derived from four field populations and two posthurricane years. These populations spanned a strong gradient of forest-canopy openness resulting from hurricane disturbance caused by Hurricane Andrew (24 August 1992). The patch-transition matrix was analyzed for its stable patch distribution. The seven single-environment matrices were each analyzed for population growth rates and elasticity of stage classes. The 56 x 56 megamatrix was analyzed for population growth rate, reproductive value, stable patch-stage distribution, and elasticity of both patches and stages. Population growth rate of the single-environment matrix models (8 x 8) was lowest for the shadiest environment (λ = 1.0), intermediate but Variable for intermediate environments, and highest for the most open environment (λ = 1.96). The population growth rate (λ,) of the megamatrix model was 1.71. The stable patch-stage distribution was characterized by a high proportion of seeds in open patches. Reproductive value was highest for very large adults in open patches. Megamatrix elasticity analysis revealed several components of the demography that were not apparent from examination of the single-environment matrices. Although closed-canopy patches were the most common type of environment, elasticity analysis of the megamatrix showed that the highest patch elasticity was for the most open environment. We found contrasting predictions for the relative importance of life history stages to population growth rate from single-environment analysis vs. the megamatrix analysis. In the most common single-environment patch, very large adults had the highest elasticity.

However, few rigorous empirical tests exist. This study examined the effects of a tapeworm parasite (Hymenolepis diminuta) on competition between two flour beetle species (Tribolium confusum and T. castaneum). The flour beetles are the intermediate host of this rat tapeworm parasite. Previous studies demonstrated that T. castaneum is usually the superior competitor in competition with T. confusum in parasite-free environments. However, because T. castaneum is more susceptible to parasitism and shows higher fitness costs when infected than T. confusum, we expected that T. castaneum would bear a competitive disadvantage in the presence of the parasite. In contrast, we found that tapeworm infection significantly increased the likelihood of T. castaneum winning the competition, reduced the time needed for T. castaneum to win, and increased T. castaneum population density compared to parasite-free populations. Therefore, our results suggest that the tapeworm infection confers some advantage to T. castaneum and are in contrast to the expectation based on mathematical studies and verbal arguments.

Based on soil coring, canopy gaps had less fine (<2 mm) root length and biomass than comparable closed canopy sites. Reductions in root length and biomass were greater on the infertile (residual) soil type than the fertile (alluvial) type but were unrelated to gap size, age, or percentage canopy openness.

Each gap was sampled thrice for sapling composition (stems ≤1 cm in diameter at breast height). Additional measurements included the extension growth of border trees into the gap, recent mortality rates of border trees, deterioration rates of gap makers that had been standing dead in earlier samples, and the composition of understory plots. The mean extension (branch) growth of border trees was 12 cm/yr, with slower growth by longer branches. Gap makers that had been tall stumps tended to deteriorate, although 35% stayed intact over the 14 yr of the study. Border-tree mortality averaged 0.60%/yr, with higher rates for larger stems and with much interspecific variation. Stem density of saplings in gaps increased during the first sampling interval and decreased during the second as self-thinning counteracted increased establishment. Basal area increased during both sampling intervals. The death of border trees increased basal area per unit gap area. The four main species (Acer saccharum, Tsuga canadensis, Fagus grandifolia, and Halesia carolina) showed different patterns of correlation to gap size and age. Species in general showed more correlations with gap age for the first sample than afterwards; gap size was more consistently related to species importance. Species patterns also were affected by the presence or absence of border-tree mortality. The stands studied seem nearly at equilibrium. Some small changes are likely to occur, but the species present dominated all size classes: gap saplings, border trees, other canopy trees not related to gaps, and understory saplings. Species differed in their relative growth rates in the understory and in gaps of different sizes. Species also differed in their survival rates in the understory and in the canopy.",94,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,"Acer saccharum | Border trees | Canopy gaps | Fagus grandifolia | Halesia carolina | Long-term studies | Old-growth forests | Repeated disturbance, impacts on vegetation/species | Southern Appalachians (USA) | Tree species, relative growth and survival | Tsuga canadensis",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,124,NA,NA

Mite burdens were within the range encountered in the field. Both testis and body condition were significantly reduced among infested males compared with control, uninfested males. Moreover, both measures of host condition decreased progressively with mite burden, demonstrating a dose-dependent effect of ectoparasitism. The slope of the function between ectoparasitism and testis condition was significantly steeper in males that had carried mites for 6 d as opposed to 4 d, demonstrating that the strength of the effect of ectoparasitism on testis condition depended also on the duration of infestation. A field study revealed negative relationships between mite burden and both body and testis condition, but only the relationship with body condition was statistically significant. Although thorax length (estimate of overall body length) was strongly positively correlated with dry testes and body mass, the interaction between thorax length and mite burden was not significant in regression analyses, in which either testis condition or body condition served as dependent variables. This lack of significant interaction effects indicates that larger males were not better able to buffer the physiological cost of ectoparasitism than smaller individuals.

The experiment was conducted as a 2 x 3 factorial design to reveal possible interactions between reproductive manipulation and resource limitation. Heavy metals decreased the total biomass of the plants and number of flowers and ramets produced. Only 50% of the plants grown with the higher level of heavy metals produced flowers. Pollination treatment interacted significantly with the heavy-metal treatment. In the metal control (no metals added) and lower heavy-metal treatment, there were no significant differences in total vegetative biomass between the two pollination treatments. Costs of reproduction in terms of subsequent flowering in the later season appeared to be clear, because the number of flowers per whole plant was lower if the plants were hand-pollinated and because the proportion of flowering ramets decreased due to hand-pollination. However, flowering may also be partly hormonally controlled. In contrast, hand-pollinated plants exposed to high concentrations of heavy metals tended to have greater biomass of vegetative plant structures and higher number of flowers compared to nonpollinated plants.

In birds, the costs and benefits associated with alternative breeding dates cause variation in clutch size, which is a main cause of seasonal decline in reproductive success. An immediate cause for this might be seasonal variation in the environment, or alternatively, but not mutually exclusively, date-independent differences in the parental/territory quality of early and late parents. The predictions of these hypotheses on seasonal reduction of reproductive success were tested by manipulating the hatching date and the amount of food during the nestling period of Pied Flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca). Delay in the hatching date caused lower fledging mass and lower fledging production, suggesting a causal relationship between breeding time and reproductive success. However, if delayed parents were provided with extra food, their success was the same as that of the controls. This suggests that deteriorating food supplies and/or higher energy demands for rearing the brood later in the season are important causes of the lower success of late breeders. Additionally, parental molt was affected by manipulation of both breeding date and food; delayed parents often began molting while still feeding young, but control parents generally did not. Furthermore, fledglings in the delayed group weighed less if their fathers began molting while feeding the young. This implies that parents traded off their onset of molt against the time and energy needed for their brood. These results support the view that timing-related energy constraints on breeding are important causes of seasonal decline in clutch size and reproductive success.",146,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Clutch size | Ficedula hypoleuca | Food limitation | Molt | Reproductive success | Timing of breeding,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,130,NA,NA

The release of gametes by Fucus distichus occurred in still water under high light and was associated with the depletion of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in tide pools isolated from the ocean during daytime low tides. Diurnal patterns of gamete release that lasted for 2-3 d, as in natural populations, were found in receptacles cultured in a 12 h light: 12 h dark photoperiod under calm conditions or in a simulated tidal regime. Constant light disrupted the diurnal component of release, however, suggesting that an endogenous circadian periodicity was absent. The effects of increased [DIC] on cultured receptacles under calm conditions were similar to the inhibitory effects of high water motion; both conditions reduced release in several species from both tide pool and intertidal habitats. Bicarbonate concentration, rather than carbon dioxide, or carbonate, was shown to be the component of the DIC system most closely correlated (inversely) with gamete release in the intertidal fucoid Pelvetia compressa. The hypothesis that gamete release is triggered by DIC depletion in the unstirred boundary layer during periods of low water motion in the light was further supported by experiments with P. compressa. These showed that gamete release was not inhibited by high water motion when DIC was absent. In the same experiments, high water motion inhibited release at 2 and 20 mmol/L DIC, confirming that the sensitivity of gamete release to water motion is DIC dependent.

These groups differ in growth form, phenology, and other traits relevant to nutrient cycling (e.g., rooting depth, litter C:N ratio). Two or three species of each type were planted in single-group treatments, and in two-, three-, and four-way combinations, giving a range of richness from zero to nine species. I tested the hypothesis that, because of complementary resource use, increasing functional group diversity will lead to higher net primary production. At the scale of this experiment (α-diversity and yearly production), more diverse treatments were not necessarily the most productive. Live plant biomass varied more within than among levels of diversity. In most two-, three-, and four-way mixtures of functional groups, overall productivity did not differ significantly from the average of the yields of component one-group treatments. This pattern apparently resulted from competition: early season annuals and late season annuals reduced the biomass of perennial bunchgrasses (the most productive group in monoculture) below levels expected from monoculture yields. Relative Yield Totals (RYT) indicated complementary resource use in the EL and LP two-way and ELPN four-way mixtures. In the EL mixture, complementarity appeared to result from temporal rather than spatial partitioning of resources. Because of shifts in root: shoot ratio in mixtures, however, only the LP treatment had consistently significant RYT > 1 when assessing total (roots plus shoots) productivity and nitrogen yield. These results show that (1) composition (the identity of the species present) can be at least as important as richness (the number of species present) in effects on ecosystem processes; (2) competition during critical parts of the growing season may prevent absolute increases in net primary production with increasing diversity, despite complementary resource use at other times of the year; and (3) shifts in belowground allocation in species mixtures can have significant effects on estimates of productivity and resource use as species diversity changes.",313,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,California | Complementary plant resource use | Ecosystem processes | Functional group richness | Net primary productivity | Plant composition | Relative Yield Total | Serpentine grassland | Species diversity,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,135,NA,NA

In two experiments with naturally occurring Piper ant-plants, ~50 individuals were randomly selected and maintained either as controls (with ants) or as ant-exclusion plants (without ants) for 2 yr. Leaf replacement rates and seed production, as measures of relative plant vigor and reproductive potential, were significantly greater in control plants with intact ant colonies than in plants from which ant colonies were experimentally excluded by periodical treatment with dilute insecticide. A series of experiments was designed to assess the relative contribution of antiherbivore defense, nutrient procurement, and antipathogen defense as potential mutualistic functions of the ants. To assess the fitness effects of antiherbivore defense, leaf replacement rates and seed production were measured on plants to which artificial folivory was applied over a 2-yr period (33% of each leaf blade removed), and stem-boring weevil damage was monitored on plants with and without ants. Nutrient procurement by ants was estimated quantitatively, and net leaf production was monitored experimentally on control plants (with ants), on plants without ants, and on nutrient-enriched plants with ants (microquantities of fertilizer added to lower stem). Epiphyll loads, phylloplane spore densities, and disease incidence were compared on experimental plants with and without ant colonies. The results indicate that folivory, the classical parameter measured in ant-plant studies, was not related to differences in fitness in Piper ant-plants; instead, ant disruption of stem-borers and ant foraging on inflorescences to reduce fungal invasion were identified as probable mechanisms by which ants conferred an average fitness advantage of at least 60 and 10%, respectively, in the 2nd yr of the comparison. Although neither antifolivore defense nor nutrient provisioning by ants appeared to benefit Piper plants, they may contribute synergistically or may operate on temporal or spatial scales not included in the study.

We aimed to determine the role of juvenile and adult life history differences in promoting coexistence of the four main overstory species (Nothofagus menziesii, Weinmannia racemosa, Dacrydium cupressinum, and Prumnopitys ferruginea). There was no evidence that major compositional shifts were occurring: N. menziesii, D. cupressinum, and P. ferruginea were represented by all-aged populations, indicating continual recruitment of all three species within the 5-ha study area during recent centuries. No age data were obtained for W. racemosa, but the diameter distribution of this species was consistent with an all-aged population structure. The temporal distribution of releases in tree ring sequences suggested a history of chronic patchy disturbance during at least the last 400 years. Ring width sequences were consistent with species differences in growth histories. About half (53%) of N. menziesii >20 cm dbh appeared to have reached the canopy in one growth spurt, compared to only 11% of P. ferruginea. Many trees of the latter species showed multiple episodes of release and suppression, indicating successive responses to several gap events before reaching the canopy. D. cupressinum growth histories were intermediate between these two extremes. Nearest neighbor age relationships also indicated species differences in regeneration patterns. Neighboring individuals of N. menziesii ≤10 cm dbh were, on average, significantly more similar in age than random pairs drawn from the age data pool under a bootstrap null model. This pattern is consistent with regeneration of N. menziesii in small, even-aged patches, in response to treefall gaps. In contrast, age differences between nearest neighbor pairs of P. ferruginea and D. cupressinum trees did not deviate significantly from the null model of randomly selected ages, suggesting that establishment and survival were not closely linked to gap formation. Maximum radial growth rates of N. menziesii saplings were nearly 2.5 times those of D. cupressinum and P. ferruginea. Fast growth of N. menziesii beneath treefall gaps may compensate for the greater shade tolerance of P. ferruginea, in particular. D. cupressinum, although apparently outperformed by one or another of its competitors in both shade and treefall gaps, has a longer life-span than any of the other species. Thus, relatively low recruitment rates may be sufficient to maintain its present abundance. Fewer data were available for W. racemosa, but its ability to reproduce vegetatively may be an important factor in its persistence in competition with the other dominants. Under a disturbance regime dominated by treefall gaps, coexistence of the four dominants appears to be associated with complementary differences in growth rate, shade tolerance, canopy residence time, and facility for vegetative reproduction.

Different size classes of each species were sampled to evaluate life cycle changes in foliar N and phenolic chemistry and their corresponding influence on insect herbivory. Oak trees had consistently higher foliar N and hydrolyzable tannin concentrations, and they experienced greater herbivore damage than did red maple trees; maple trees had higher condensed tannin levels. Foliar chemistry and herbivore damage were usually quite similar for all size classes. However, condensed tannins, and occasionally total phenolics, were higher in well-insolated mature trees than in shaded understory conspecifics, fitting the pattern expected through plant carbon/nutrient balance relationships. Rainfall fluctuations during 1992-1994 significantly influenced plant-herbivore processes. Foliar N and phenolic concentrations were reduced in all species during the much drier summer of 1993, relative to 1992. The summer drought in 1993 was apparently severe enough to restrict carbon allocation to plant phenolics. In contrast, foliar N levels in oaks were somewhat elevated by the end of the wet 1994 growing season. Total phenol and hydrolyzable tannin levels remained quite low in 1994, when carbon may have been preferentially allocated to growth rather than differentiation, as N uptake increased during the wet summer following drought. Nevertheless, carbon allocation to condensed tannins was quite high for all species during the wet summer. Insect herbivore damage was directly correlated with rainfall totals over the 3-yr period. Herbivore damage on oaks was reduced during the 1993 drought, principally because of less impact by leaf skeletonizers. Insect feeding on oaks and maples was elevated during the wet 1994 summer, when strip feeding by lepidoptera larvae was at its highest.

Here we evaluate the application of several major techniques (protein electrophoresis, nuclear and mitochondrial RFLPs [restriction fragment length polymorphisms], minisatellite and microsatellite VNTRs [variable number tandem repeats], RAPDs [random amplified polymorphic DNA], and DNA sequencing) to an array of questions regarding individual identification, exclusion and assignment of parentage, and various levels of population structure. In our evaluation, we briefly explain the technical components of each molecular approach and assess whether the typical outcomes expected from each approach will provide useful information as applied to each level of inquiry. For studies of population genetic structure, protein electrophoresis remains a powerful tool for most taxa, although techniques based on nucleic acids (particularly DNA sequencing and mitochondrial DNA RFLPs) are useful here as well.

We systematically varied fish density and algal availability in large (8-m2) arenas and examined distributions before and after exposure to an avian predator model, a stuffed cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus). Pollock preferred the algal habitat, and the proportion of fish in the algae increased as the amount of algal habitat increased. When density of fish in the arena increased, the number of fish in the algal habitat increased, but the proportion decreased. Following exposure to the predator model, the proportion of fish in the algae increased. Fish in the open were aggregated most of the time, but there was a trend toward increased aggregation of those fish remaining in the open following exposure to the predator. Thus, the use of two alternative antipredator tactics can produce very dynamic spatial distributions.

Effects of simulated blowdown on light levels and CO2 concentrations were more pronounced after three years than effects on nitrogen availability and other soil resources. Spatial heterogeneity in light levels and net nitrification rates was greater in the blowdown, but heterogeneities of soil organic matter concentration and net mineralization rates were greater in the undisturbed forest. Availability of nitrate, a limiting resource in most New England forests, was low on mounds and in pits, but high on the vertical portion of forest floor resulting from uprooting of canopy trees. At a spatial scale relevant to seedlings, resource congruence was greater in the undisturbed forest than in the experimental blowdown, primarily because of the effects of blowdown on light levels. Congruence in the blowdown increased with an increase in spatial scale, but congruence in the undisturbed forest was similar at both spatial scales. Seedling growth of two birch species was correlated with light levels and with congruence among soil resources. This study shows that immediate disturbance effects on microtopography and light levels determine recruitment patterns of colonizing species, with changes in soil resource levels influencing later community development.

Glucosinolates and their breakdown products from the action of the enzyme myrosinase are putative defensive compounds in brassicas.

Where feasible, accurate characterization of interaction strength can shift the theory of multispecies communities from identifying the vast range of possibilities to isolating the most likely possibilities. To derive generality in our understanding of interaction strengths, however, they must be placed within a unified framework, a framework that can be applied to empirical situations. In this paper we first identify four different theoretical concepts of interaction strength prevalent in the literature (community matrix, Jacobian matrix, inverse Jacobian, and removal matrix), showing how they are related to each other and how they are derived. We also demonstrate that their behavior is not necessarily concordant; hence it is important to identify clearly which concept of interaction strength is being discussed. Then we evaluate several observational and experimental approaches to estimating interaction strength empirically, highlighting their ties to theory, if any, and the limitations and strengths of each approach. Finally, we apply several techniques to a simulated data set, based on an intertidal community, evaluating both accuracy and logistical ease of these approaches. We find that per capita interaction strength is often the most useful index to measure, that caution must be exercised in interpreting empirical estimates of interaction strength because of equilibrium assumptions and the potential confounding effect of indirect effects, and that concentrating on evaluating the relationship between empirically observed rates of change and species abundances may be a profitable way to proceed.",211,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Community matrix | Competition | Dynamic regression | Experiment | Food web | Interaction strength | Jacobian matrix | Lotka-Volterra model | Observation | Per capita effects | Simulation,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,145,NA,NA

At high densities acorn barnacles commonly form hummocks of tall, densely packed individuals. We examined hummock development and its consequences on filter feeding and growth in the northern acorn barnacle, Semibalanus balanoides. Hummocking occurs in response to high recruitment densities and growth rates, which intensify competition for primary substrate space. In the field, hummocks are more common at low than at high tidal heights, paralleling within-site variation in recruitment and growth rates. Hummocks also are most pronounced at high-flow sites with high barnacle recruitment and growth rates. In laboratory flume studies, particle capture rates were higher for individuals near the peak of hummocks than for solitary individuals, and were lower for individuals in the troughs between hummocks than for solitary individuals. Hummocked individuals are elevated above the surface and are thus likely exposed to higher particle fluxes than either individuals between hummocks or solitary individuals. These patterns in particle capture closely match patterns of barnacle shell growth in the field. The shells of hummocked individuals were larger than those of solitary individuals, which were larger than the shells of individuals in troughs between hummocks. The tissue growth of solitary individuals, however, is lower than that of crowded individuals, apparently since, without neighbors, solitary barnacles must allocate more resources to structural support than do crowded individuals. Thus, crowding may benefit individual barnacles by reducing their skeletal support costs. Most studies of crowding in sessile, space-limited invertebrates have focused on negative, competitive effects. Our results, along with previous work showing that crowding may benefit northern acorn barnacles by buffering them from heat and desiccation stress and increasing reproductive output, illustrate that crowding also can positively affect sessile organisms.

I tested the hypothesis that individual birds exhibit foraging area fidelity. I also investigated evidence for information transfer among birds and the role of tidal cycles in foraging behavior. Flight speed, feeding methods, chick growth rates, and fledging success were similar for radio-tagged birds and birds without radio-tags, suggesting that radio-tags had no significant effect. Birds made an average of two foraging trips per day for 13 d, during a spring and a neap tide series.

During spring and neap tides, 17 and 14 birds, respectively, timed their foraging trips to coincide with daily tidal cycles. Foraging area fidelity indicates that kittiwakes learn and remember when and where to forage and therefore may gain local knowledge of their foraging area. Individuals possessing such knowledge may have an advantage over individuals without local knowledge. Foraging area fidelity in individuals indicates that information transfer among colonial seabirds may be less important than previously expected. Birds were selective in joining feeding flocks (13 of 35 flocks were joined). Those that were joined most often were large feeding flocks that occurred in the birds' preferred feeding areas. Birds often fed alone (n = 26 observations) rather than with feeding flocks (n = 9 observations). Individuals of a mated pair did not forage in the same area, suggesting that information transfer regarding foraging did not occur between mates. Some mates were unable to coordinate their tidally timed foraging with nesting activities, and chicks were left unattended, which may have reduced the number of chicks fledged.

Delayed density dependence was detected in populations on granite submassifs, but not on schist, despite significant cyclicity there. Spring densities and the number of young reared per brood were higher on schist than on granite. Population change from one spring to the next was related to intervening breeding success on both granite and schist, but to summer loss only on granite. The same factors that determined variations in clutch size among years also largely affected breeding success. Population change, breeding success, summer loss, and clutch size showed delayed density dependence on granite, but not on schist, where numbers fluctuated more erratically. On granite, but not schist, early plant growth was followed by larger clutches, breeding success was related to June air temperature, and June temperature tended to peak 1-2 yr before ptarmigan peaks. Cyclic June temperature may have entrained the timing of ptarmigan cycles on granite. Results on both schist and granite were inconsistent with expectations from predator-prey hypotheses for cycles. In years of rising numbers, hens laid more eggs and reared more chicks per extra egg laid than in years of decline, and the proportion of surviving young recruited into the spring population was probably greater.

In most species of strongly seasonal climates (e.g., trees of the cold temperate forests of North America and Japan), seed dispersal and seedling establishment are processes separated in time by at least a few weeks and more typically by a few months. This leaves ample opportunity for various factors to affect the spatial patterns of seed dispersal, survival and germination, and seedling emergence. Spatial uncoupling between these sequential processes leads to spatial independence (i.e., absence of a relationship) in the abundance patterns of life stages. Along a topographical gradient in an old-growth cold temperate forest of northeastern North America, I analyzed the spatial patterns of seed rain, seed bank, and seedling emergence of a major tree component, Betula alleghaniensis, over a 4-yr period. I examined the degree of consistency through time of the spatial patterns of each life stage and of their relationships with one another. Seed rain and seedling spatial patterns were quite variable through time, but that of the seed bank was relatively consistent despite large interyear fluctuations in abundance. Overall, two major spatial patterns emerged along the topographical gradient: one that emphasized the three peaks of density of mature Betula trees, and one with a single peak in the middle section of the gradient, where Betula tree density was higher. Correlations between the spatial patterns of seed and seedling abundance were significant in some years, but not in others. Seed survival was practically constant in space in one year, but quite variable in another; yet, it was consistently density independent.

I examined microhabitat preferences and adaptiveness of preferences for seven bird species coexisting in high elevation snowmelt drainages based on study of microhabitat and survival of 1556 nests. Habitat features in the nest patch differed from both random and non-use (sites centered on the same plant species as used for the nest) sites within each bird species, indicating nonrandom nest site choice. Bird species within a nesting guild (ground, shrub) also differed from each other based on the same vegetation features that differentiated nest sites from non-use and random sites, and this vegetation feature dominated the microhabitat type that was used most frequently by each species. In short, frequency of use of dominant vegetation types, comparisons of nest vs. random and non-use sites, and comparisons among species were concordant in their indications of microhabitat preferences. The frequency in use of microhabitats was taken as an unambiguous measure of microhabitat preference within this study system: vegetation varied along a short microclimate gradient in the study system and territories of birds encompassed the entire gradient, thereby making all microhabitats available within the territory of each individual, such that use reflected a clear choice among alternatives. Microhabitat preferences differed among species and reflected differing positions on the microclimate gradient. Thus, species partitioned either microhabitat or microclimate within each nesting guild. Nest success was greater at preferred than at nonpreferred microhabitats for all seven species, indicating that preferences were adaptive. Examination of cubic spline curves and standardized directional selection differentials (s) and selection gradients (β) indicated that preferences had positive directional selection coefficients. These selection coefficients suggested that selection might be acting to favor preferences, but information on genetic bases of habitat choices is needed before selection can be ascertained. Advances in understanding evolution of habitat preferences depend on an individual-level examination of habitat choices and their fitness consequences, and also examination of the phenotypic traits and mechanisms that underlie habitat-induced variation in fitness components.",351,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Arizona | Directional selection | Habitat preference | Habitat selection | Natural selection | Nest predation | Resource partitioning,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,152,all,All Open Access

We test four hypotheses that might account for stability at high-nutrient levels: (1) greater abundance of inedible algae with enrichment interferes with Daphnia's feeding; (2) Daphnia's death rate increases with enrichment; (3) Daphnia's death rate increases with Daphnia density; (4) Daphnia's functional response depends on Daphnia's density.

Additional evidence on Daphnia death rates strengthens the case against hypotheses (2) and (3). We consider other hypotheses and conclude that three in particular would repay further investigation.

Despite recent statistical contributions that have stimulated an interest in characterizing the limits of a variable, a consensus on an appropriate methodology to quantify the boundaries of scatter diagrams has not yet been achieved. We tested regression techniques based on least squares and least absolute values models using several independent data sets on prey length and predator length for piscivorous fishes and compared estimated slopes for consistency. Our results indicated that least squares regression techniques were particularly sensitive to outlying y values and irregularities in the distribution of observations, and that they frequently produced inconsistent estimates of slope for upper and lower bounds. In contrast, quantile regression techniques based on least absolute values models appeared robust to outlying y values and sparseness within data sets, while providing consistent estimates of upper and lower bound slopes. Moreover, the use of quantile regression eliminated the need for an excess of arbitrary decision-making on the part of the investigator.

During 17 censuses between June 1993 and October 1994, we recorded 10020 captures of 3946 individuals and found strong landscape differences but weak fragment-size effects. Although fragmentation reduced the habitable area by 72%, density and adult recruitment were significantly higher on the fragmented landscape relative to the control. With the exception of adult recruitment (higher on small relative to medium and large patches), no significant demographic differences existed among patches of different size. Low rates of between-population movement and differential juvenile growth rates suggested that higher recruitment rates on the fragmented landscape likely resulted from enhanced local reproduction rather than from immigration. Thus, despite the fact that populations in the fragmented landscape experienced severe habitat loss, some individuals on fragments accrued important reproductive advantages (possibly as a result of diminished social costs or enhanced food resources). That population and individual responses to fragmentation could differ so dramatically provides a novel result that illustrates the importance of using hierarchical field designs in tests of population responses to large-scale habitat alteration.

Carbon mineralization and microbial biomass increased with the proportion of birch soil along the experimental mixtures, while N mineralization decreased. Microbial community structure (estimated by examining the phospholipid fatty acid pattern) changed linearly along the soil series. Carbon mineralization, microbial biomass, and microbial community structure in soil mixtures could therefore be predicted from the patterns in pure birch and spruce soils. However, the mineralization of N was lower in mixtures than predicted from the pure soils. Earthworms increased C and N mineralization, decreased microbial biomass, and modified microbial community structure, but they required at least 25% birch content in the soil mixture to be active throughout the experiment. The results suggest that microbial community structure and respiration are predictable in soil mixtures, but that earthworms exhibit thresholds and may respond in a nonlinear manner. Possible mechanisms behind the observed C and N mineralization pattern were explored with a simple model in which N mineralization was linked to the C flow through microbes. The model suggests that nitrogen concentration of assimilated substrate may have been lower in birch soil than in spruce soil, although the opposite was true for bulk soil.

In the arid deserts of Baja California, coyote abundance along the shore of the Gulf of California is much higher compared to adjacent inland areas. These high densities are achieved because coastal coyotes are subsidized by the flow of abundant and diverse resources that come directly and indirectly from the ocean. Analysis of scats between coastal and inland sites indicates that the diet breadth of coastal coyotes is expanded (i.e., more food types were eaten) and that much more food is consumed by individuals and populations of coyotes in coastal regions. On average, scat mass at coastal sites is more than double that at inland sites. An average of 47.8% of all items found in coastal scats come directly from the sea. Such allochthonous input facilitates a numerical response: each of our four measures of coyote abundance shows that coyotes are significantly more dense along the coast than inland.

We used a series of laboratory reconstructions of the detritus-based food web in the leaves of the northern pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea to test the hypothesis that interactions at higher trophic levels could control bacterial densities and community structure. The typical pitcher community is composed of a basal-level bacterial assemblage, bacterivorous protozoa and rotifers, and larvae of the pitcher plant mosquito Wyeomyia smithii. Using organisms isolated from natural pitchers, we constructed food webs comprising 1-4 consumer species (all possible combinations of the presence and absence of Colpoda, Cyclidium, Bodo, and Wyeomyia larvae) along with a constant bacterial species pool in a factorial design experiment. Bacterial community structure was modified by the direct effects of grazing by protozoa and mosquito larvae, by the indirect effects of competitive interactions among the three protozoans, and by the cascading effects of predation by mosquito larvae. Each combination of grazers/predators produced a different, species-specific pattern of bacterial species relative abundances. Changes in nutrient supplies and other abiotic characteristics of the microcosm environment resulting from the feeding activities of Wyeomyia and the protozoa also had indirect effects on bacterial species profiles. We found an apparent trophic cascade that was mediated by the species composition and relative abundances of the intermediate-level protozoan grazers. Our data support the hypothesis that Wyeomyia smithii serves as a keystone predator in the pitcher community. Mosquito larvae were responsible for the overall architecture of the pitcher food web and the subsequent interactions among grazers and the basal-level bacterial community. At low densities, mosquito larvae controlled patterns of coexistence among protozoan species by modifying competitive interactions, while at normal field densities, Wyeomyia rapidly drove the two ciliates to extinction but permitted continued existence of heterotrophic microflagellates. Wyeomyia larvae also played a dominant role in structuring the bacterial assemblage. Bacterial species profiles in food webs containing Wyeomyia were more similar to each other than to the patterns observed in webs without mosquito larvae. Our results suggest that the interactions among members of microbial communities are just as complex as those observed in plant and animal communities and require study at the species level.

Data from 20 islands and five years (1990-1994) show that the cumulative productivity of islands, a sum of the input of marine detritus and terrestrial plant productivity, varies spatially and temporally. Marine inputs are a function of the perimeter/area ratio and are thus relatively greater on smaller islands. Land plant productivity, a function of precipitation, is negligible in most years but can increase greatly (10-160x in plant cover) with heavy rains from El Nino events (e.g., 1992-1993). Consumer intensity is a function of the continual influence of predaceous scorpions and the sporadic occurrence of parasitoid spider wasps (Pompilidae); the importance of these factors varies greatly, both because scorpions are absent on some islands and because parasitoid densities show extreme year-to-year oscillations. El Nino rains produced large changes in the quantity and quality of plant resources and the control of spider populations. Spider densities doubled in 1992 in response to high levels of prey that followed heavy rains but crashed in 1993, despite continued high plant productivity and prey availability. The appearance of copious nectar and pollen, food of adult parasitoid wasps, caused wasp populations to erupt in 1993. Wasps emerged as a major, but previously hidden, trophic influence and greatly suppressed spider populations. Pompilids act as nonequilibrium agents-they are regulated by factors other than prey (spider) availability. In general, smaller spider populations were more variable year to year in the magnitude of their increases and decreases.

Kill rates by coyotes were higher during the increase in density of hares than during the cyclic decline, while the reverse was true for lynx.

Studies with evergreen trees, and with insects feeding on other plant parts, have yielded more variable results. This study examined the effects over several seasons of controlled defoliation on the suitability of an evergreen conifer, red pine (Pinus resinosa) to insects and pathogens that exploit foliage, stem phloem, and root tissue. Test insects included a folivorous sawfly (Hymenoptera) and two species of stem- and root-colonizing beetles (Coleoptera). Each of these species undergoes periodic population irruptions. Controlled defoliations were administered to 10-yr-old trees at levels that mimic naturally occurring sawfly outbreaks. Additional studies were conducted on seedlings in a glasshouse. Foliar suitability to the redheaded pine sawfly (Neodiprion lecontei) varied in a nonlinear fashion with defoliation intensity one year after treatment. However, not all parameters of sawfly success were equally affected. Female cocoon mass was related to foliar concentrations of nutrients, but not monoterpenes or diterpene acids. Suitability to the stem boring pine engraver (Ips pini) increased 2 yr after defoliation. Moderate defoliation reduced stem resin flow rate by 50% and increased stem phloem colonization rate by the beetle's mutualistic fungus, Ophiostoma ips. Defoliation also affected host suitability to adult pales weevils, Hylobius pales. Weevil feeding increased 1 yr after defoliation, but this response dissipated 2 yr after treatment. The observation that intermediate defoliation stress can either decrease or increase foliar suitability in an evergreen conifer, depending on intensity, is consistent with elements of both the plant stress and carbon: nutrient balance hypotheses. Moreover, host responses to a single stress agent may significantly and differentially influence the population dynamics of insects and pathogens that exploit different plant tissues. Implications of these results for plant stress and carbon: nutrient theories, plant-herbivore interactions, and chronic forest declines are discussed.",28,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Conifer | Defoliation | Forest decline | Hylobius | Ips | Neodiprion | Ophiostoma | Pinus | Plant-insect interactions | Sawfly | Stress,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,165,all,All Open Access

Heat shock triggers germination of certain species but has no stimulatory effect on a great many other postfire species that are chemically stimulated by combustion products. Previous reports have shown that charred wood will induce germination, and here we report that smoke also induces germination in these same species. Smoke is highly effective, often inducing 100% germination in deeply dormant seed populations with 0% control germination. Smoke induces germination both directly and indirectly by aqueous or gaseous transfer from soil to seeds. Neither nitrate nor ammonium ions were effective in stimulating germination of smoke-stimulated species, nor were most of the quantitatively important gases generated by biomass smoke. Nitrogen dioxide, however, was very effective at inducing germination in Caulanthus heterophyllus (Brassicaceae), Emmenanthe penduliflora (Hydrophyllaceae), Phacelia grandiflora (Hydrophyllaceae), and Silene multinervia (Caryophyllaceae). Three species, Dendromecon rigida (Papaveraceae), Dicentra chrysantha, and Trichostema lanatum (Lamiaceae), failed to germinate unless smoke treatment was coupled with prior treatment of 1 yr soil storage. Smoke-stimulated germination was found in 25 chaparral species, representing 11 families, none of which were families known for heat-shock-stimulated germination. Seeds of smoke-stimulated species have many analogous characteristics that separate them from most heat-shock-stimulated seeds, including: (1) outer seed coats that are highly textured, (2) a poorly developed outer cuticle, (3) absence of a dense palisade tissue in the seed coat, and (4) a subdermal membrane that is semipermeable, allowing water passage but blocking entry of large (molecular mass > 500) solutes. Tentative evidence suggests that permeability characteristics of this subdermal layer are altered by smoke. While the mechanism behind smoke-induced germination is not known, it appears that smoke may be involved in overcoming different blocks to germination in different species. For example, in Emmenanthe penduliflora, NO2 in smoke was sufficient to induce germination, and most forms of physical or chemical scarification also induced germination. For Romneya coulteri, NO2 alone failed to induce germination, and scarified seeds required addition of gibberellic acid. In Dicentra chrysantha, none of these treatments, nor smoke alone, induced germination, but germination was triggered by a combination of soil burial followed by smoke treatment. Smoke-stimulated species differed substantially in the duration of smoke exposure required to induce germination, and this was inversely correlated with tolerance to smoke exposure. We suggest that such differences in response may affect postfire community structure.",206,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,"California chaparral | Fire | Germination, smoke-induced | Gibberellin | Hard-seeded plant taxa | Imbibition | NO 2 | Scarification | Seed coat | Smoke, stimulation of germination",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,166,NA,NA

Concentration discontinuities in several water chemistry parameters delineated the chemical boundary between the true groundwater and hyporheic habitats.

Differences in water chemistry between the hyporheic and groundwater zones persisted throughout the year, though no single variable differed quantitatively between these two zones on all occasions.

Diving activity and position of the birds were determined via externally attached logging units. Feeding behavior was detected using stomach temperature sensors. All calculated positions of the birds occurred south of Possession Island. The area most frequented was situated 250 km south of the island (48.5°S), where birds stayed for 40 h during a foraging trip, on average. The overall swim speed differed with time into the foraging trip, being lowest during the central part and highest (10 km/h) during the last night at sea, when birds were returning to the colony. Diving activities showed a clear diurnal pattern, with maximum dive depth being dependent on ambient light levels.

Three explanations have been proposed for this pattern. First, sexual size dimorphism (SSD) may result in sexes having different nutritional requirements to achieve the same viability, and males are more commonly the larger sex. Second, reduced performance of males could result from possession of an unguarded sex chromosome combined with environmental dependence in expression of deleterious recessives. Third, the observed difference may be a consequence of possession of a male phenotype, for example, due to higher circulating levels of androgens associated with development of male reproductive organs acting antagonistically on other systems. We used experimental manipulations of rearing conditions, coupled with a molecular genetic technique for gender identification, to test these hypotheses in a population of Collared Flycatchers, Ficedula albicollis, a migrant, hole-nesting passerine bird. Nestlings of that species exhibit sexual size monomorphism, and as with other birds, females are heterogametic. As a consequence, the three hypotheses make different predictions about the way in which gender and the environment will interact. Comparisons of brothers and sisters in a split-brood, partial cross-fostering design revealed no evidence of gender x environment interaction on body size, wing length, body mass, or recruitment to the breeding population in this size monomorphic species. Our results therefore support the first hypothesis, namely, that sex differences in performance in sexually dimorphic species are most likely to be caused by different nutritional requirements. Our experiments allow us to investigate the existence of sex-specific fitness differences across an environmental gradient; such data are important for generating and testing hypotheses relating to adaptive sex allocation. The absence of gender x environment interactions demonstrated here supports recent studies of this species indicating a lack of sex ratio adjustment in response to a related, natural, environmental gradient.

Within these fragments, Argentine ants were more abundant near developed edges and in areas dominated by exotic vegetation. The number of native groundforaging ant species at any point declined from an average of >7 to <2 species in the presence of the Argentine ant. Among fragments, a stepwise multiple regression revealed that the abundance of Argentine ants, the size of the fragment, and the number of years since it was isolated from larger continuous areas of scrub habitat best predict the number of remaining native ant species. The Argentine ant was found in every fragment surveyed as well as around the edges of larger unfragmented areas. Fragments had fewer native ant species than similar-sized plots within large unfragmented areas; and fragments with Argentine ant-free refugia had more native ant species than those without refugia.

Seeds in Low Concentration fruits were not defecated more quickly than those in Control fruits, but seeds in Extract fruits were. Thus, ripe S. americanum fruits contain a chemical or chemicals with a laxative effect. Also, seeds from Control fruits were deposited in more defecations and at lower densities in each defecation than those from Extract fruits.

Resprout growth arising from the stumps and roots of beaver-cut trees contained twice the level of defensive chemicals as normal juvenile growth. However, rather than being repelled by these defenses, leaf beetles were attracted to resprout growth, resulting in a strong positive association between beavers and beetles. Why? Cottonwoods contain phenolic glycosides, chemicals that are defensive against mammalian herbivores, but are sequestered and used by the beetles for their own defense. Experiments showed that beetles fed resprout growth were better defended against their predators than those fed nonresprout growth. There also may have been a nutritional benefit, because the conversion of the plant's defense, salicin and other phenolic glycosides, to salicylaldehyde releases glucose. Also, resprout growth contained more total nitrogen than did nonresprout growth. Transfer experiments showed that, in apparent response to these increased nutritional benefits, beetles fed resprout growth developed faster and weighed more at maturity. Although indirect interactions are much less studied than direct interactions, our work suggests that the indirect interactions resulting from beaver cutting of cottonwoods have important consequences for other organisms and could represent an important component of community structure. The habitat mosaics created by beaver herbivory increase arthropod biodiversity and may benefit other organisms such as birds and mammals.

A total of 18 studies were located in which species occurrence was studied in relation to such soil properties. Several of these report clear trends with soil physical properties, mainly drainage as affected by topographic position. Only three offer evidence for correlations with soil chemical properties. In all three, the study area spanned soils of very widely differing age and thus soil fertility. Failure to find correlations with chemical properties may be due to: lack of range in soil fertility across the sites studied, failure of soil test methods to measure availability of nutrients to plants, or temporal and spatial variability in soil properties. Existing soil classification systems do not provide enough information on any particular soil to help establish relations between its chemical properties and plant distribution. Nonetheless, soils at ecological study sites must be classified if their nature and properties are to be made clear to others working worldwide. Traditional, largely subjective, soil-mapping techniques may reduce sampling needs by allowing stratification of soil and plant sampling by broad soil types. The mapping must be done, however, at a scale similar to the patchiness of the plant community (usually finer than 1:5000), something done in only 3 of the 18 studies located.

This species shows a consistent northern orientation of its pseudocephalium (a nonphotosynthetic hairy structure where flowers are produced) and stem tilting in the same direction. Analysis of pseudocephalium orientation was made on field data gathered from subpopulations of C. columna-trajani from slopes with different exposures. Additionally, from morphometric characteristics measured in the field, a model cactus was constructed with the purpose of simulating radiation interception by different morphologies. Variations of this model cactus allowed the simulation of irradiance on erect and tilted cacti, as well as on plants with varying pseudocephalium orientation. Results of irradiance interception by different morphologies were related to actual data of growth rates, flowering period, and rainfall and temperature patterns on the study zone. Sampled individuals of C. columna-trajani showed a significant north-northwest pseudocephalium orientation (angular mean = 339°± 22°). Simulations showed that tilted cacti with pseudocephalia facing northwards increase yearly interception of direct solar radiation by the whole plant compared to erect cacti with or without a pseudocephalium (2 and 7% increase, respectively), and with tilted cacti with the pseudocephalium facing away from the north (9-10% increase). Additionally, the observed morphology decreases radiation interception during the hottest and driest period of the year. From our results, pseudocephalium orientation and stem tilting in C. columna-trajani appear to be morphological adaptations that allow the fine-tuning of a columnar morphology to its thermal and radiation environment. However, the cost of tilting in this giant columnar cactus is that branching (which increases photosynthetic area and reproductive output) appears to be almost impossible without serious risk of stem breakage.",22,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Adaptation | Functional morphology | Growth rate | Irradiance | Mexico | Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) | Pseudocephalium | Semiarid lands | Thermal regulation | Tilting | Zapotitlan,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,179,NA,NA

Two mechanisms have been advanced by which a decrease in growth may increase the mortality of young predators: (1) increased time during which juvenile predators are susceptible to gape-limited predation and (2) increased susceptibility to starvation. To study the effects of competition from a prey fish (roach, Rutilus rutilus) on the recruitment of a piscivorous fish (perch, Perca fluviatilis), roach were introduced in two of four small adjacent unproductive lakes inhabited by natural populations of perch. We thereafter studied the diet, growth, and survival of the new-born cohorts of perch during a 13-mo period. Growth and survival of larval perch were not affected by roach whereas during the latter part of the growing season, growth and condition of young-of-the-year (YOY) perch were negatively affected by roach. The growth retardation of YOY perch in roach-treatment lakes coincided with a shift in diet from free-swimming zooplankton to benthic cladocerans and chironomids, which in turn was related to a stronger decline in pelagic zooplankton resources in these lakes. The small size and poor condition of YOY perch in the roach-treatment lakes resulted in almost all these perch dying from starvation during the winter and subsequent spring. There was a tendency for there to be higher densities of YOY perch in the roach-treatment lakes, possibly due to a strong die-off of adult perch in these lakes that in turn may have reduced cannibalism in these lakes. The results from an enclosure experiment on intra-cohort competition among YOY perch, however, suggested that the discrepancy in growth of YOY perch between the lakes was mainly due to direct competition from roach for the zooplankton resource. Temporal variation in competition intensity and in duration of periods for growth and energy gain (e.g., summer) vs. periods of only energy loss (e.g., winter) are suggested to have major effects on juvenile predator growth and subsequent recruitment to the adult stage through competitive juvenile bottlenecks, and thus to affect overall community dynamics. The relative importance of size-dependent winter starvation mortality compared to mortality caused by gape-limited predators as a mortality agent on juveniles is hypothesized to increase with latitude. Whole-lake experiments lend themselves both to testing the importance in natural systems of mechanisms previously identified at small spatial and short temporal scales, and also to identifying important mechanisms that cannot be studied at smaller scales.",123,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Competition | Juvenile bottlenecks | Ontogeny | Perca fluviatilis | Perch | Predator recruitment | Roach | Rutilus rutilus | Swedish lakes | Temporal variation in competition | Whole-lake experiments | Winter mortality and starvation,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,180,NA,NA

Tree communities were assessed in 39 permanent, 1-ha plots in forest fragments of 1, 10, or 100 ha in area, and in 27 plots in nearby continuous forest. Repeated censuses of >56 000 marked trees (≤10 cm diameter at breast height) were used to generate annualized estimates of tree mortality, damage, and turnover in fragmented and continuous forest. On average, forest fragments exhibited markedly elevated dynamics, apparently as a result of increased windthrow and microclimatic changes near forest edges. Mean mortality, damage, and turnover rates were much higher within 60 m of edges (4.01, 4.10, and 3.16%, respectively) and moderately higher within 60-100 m of edges (2.40, 1.96, and 2.05%) than in forest interiors (1.27, 1.48, and 1.15%). Less-pronounced changes in mortality and turnover rates were apparently detectable up to ~300 m from forest edges. Edge aspect had no significant effect on forest dynamics. Tree mortality and damage rates did not vary significantly with fragment age, suggesting that increased dynamics are not merely transitory effects that occur immediately after fragmentation, while turnover rates increased with age in most (8/9) fragments. These findings reveal that fragmentation causes important changes in the dynamics of Amazonian forests, especially within ~100 m of habitat edges. A mathematical 'core-area model' incorporating these data predicted that edge effects will increase rapidly in importance once fragments fall below ~100-400 ha in area, depending on fragment shape.

Analytical and simulation studies of the model lead to several general results. Grazing optimization requires that (1) the proportion of nutrient lost along the herbivore pathway be sufficiently smaller than the proportion of nutrient lost throughout the rest of the ecosystem; and that (2) inputs of nutrient into the system be greater than a threshold value, which depends on the sensitivity of plant uptake rate to an increase in soil mineral nutrient. An increase in nutrient turnover rate is not sufficient to explain grazing optimization in the long term. When a nutrient is the single limiting factor, plant biomass and productivity at equilibrium are determined only by the balance of ecosystem inputs and outputs of nutrient. Processes that do not have an impact on these inputs or outputs have no effect on primary producers. On the other hand, turnover rates are important for the transient dynamics of the system, and the equilibrium analysis is relevant only if it can be reached in a reasonable time scale. The equilibrium is not reached by a compartment with a very slow turnover rate, such as the resistant soil organic matter, before several centuries. On a small time scale, such a compartment can be considered constant, and the trend of the system is predicted with a simplified system. The results at equilibrium are insensitive to the functional form used to describe herbivore consumption: the results obtained for simple, linear, donor-controlled herbivory also apply to most forms of more realistic, recipient-controlled herbivory. We conclude that grazing optimization is most likely to occur in systems with large losses of the limiting nutrient during recycling of plant detritus, or where herbivores bring nutrient from outside the ecosystem considered (which acts to reduce, or even make negative, the fraction of nutrient lost along the herbivore detritus pathway).",206,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Detritus pathway | Grazing optimization | Herbivory | Input-output balance | Nutrient cycling | Primary production | Turnover rate,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,184,NA,NA

However, very few studies have considered the consequences of such a pattern for the recruitment of offspring as subsequent breeders. We recorded nestling survival and fledgling body mass in experimentally synchronous and asynchronous broods of the Great Tit, Parus major. Using six different juvenile survival models, taken from published studies of the species, we calculated the expected number of offspring recruited with each hatching pattern and survival function. The sex of fledglings was included in the analysis. When comparing the estimates of surviving juveniles between synchronous and asynchronous broods, we found no significant difference in the means with any of the six models. However, the distributions of recruitment were different: the expected number of recruits was more variable with synchrony than with asynchrony. This suggests that hatching asynchrony in the Great Tit may serve as a bet-hedging strategy. A larger proportion of asynchronous broods than of the synchronous broods experienced brood reduction, but fledgling body masses for the reduced synchronous broods were lower than those for the reduced asynchronous broods. This suggests that synchronous hatching inhibits adaptive brood reduction in the Great Tit. There was considerable individual variation in the level of brood reduction within the same area and season. We argue that conditions also may be unpredictable at a small scale (parental abilities, territory quality, or parasite load). In consequence, high-quality parents may benefit from synchrony, but low-quality parents benefit from asynchrony, within the same year.",46,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Asynchronous hatching | Bet-hedging | Brood reduction | Geometric mean fitness | Great Tit | Parus major | Recruitment | Survival,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,185,NA,NA

It has been proposed that some animals cue on the reproductive success of conspecifics to select breeding habitats. We tested this hypothesis with demographic and behavioral data from a 17-yr study of the Black-legged Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla), a cliff-nesting seabird. As the hypothesis assumes, the Black-legged Kittiwake nesting environment was patchy, and the relative quality of the different patches (i.e., breeding cliffs) varied in time. The average reproductive success of the breeders of a given cliff was predictable from one year to the next, but this predictability faded after several years. The dynamic nature of cliff quality in the long term is partly explained by the autocorrelation of the prevalence of an ectoparasite that influences reproductive success. As predicted by the performance-based conspecific attraction hypothesis, the reproductive success of current breeders on a given cliff was predictive of the reproductive success of new recruits on the cliff in the following year. Breeders tended to recruit to the previous year's most productive cliffs and to emigrate from the least productive ones. Consequently, the dynamics of breeder numbers on the cliffs were explained by local reproductive success on a year-to-year basis. Because, on average, young Black-legged Kittiwakes first breed when 4 yr old, such a relationship probably results from individual choices based on the assessment of previous-year local quality. When breeders changed breeding cliffs between years, they selected cliffs of per capita higher reproductive success. Furthermore, after accounting for the potential effects of age and sex as well as between-year variations, the effect of individual breeding performance on breeding dispersal was strongly influenced by the average reproductive success of other breeders on the same cliff. Individual breeding performance did not appear to influence the probability of dispersing for birds breeding on cliffs with high local reproductive success, whereas individual breeding performance did have a strong effect on dispersal for birds that bred on cliffs with lower local reproductive success. This suggests that the reproductive success of locally breeding conspecifics may be sufficient to override an individual's own breeding experience when deciding whether to emigrate. These results, which are supported by behavioral observations of the role of prospecting in recruitment, suggest that both first breeders and adults rely on the reproductive success of conspecifics as 'public information' to assess their own chances of breeding successfully in a given patch and to make settling decisions. A corollary prediction is that individuals should attempt to breed near successful conspecifics (a form of social attraction) in order to benefit from the same favorable local environmental conditions. Such a performance-based conspecific attraction mechanism can thus lead to an aggregative distribution of nests and may have played a role in the evolution of coloniality.",417,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Breeding habitat selection | Conspecific reproductive success | Dispersal | Ectoparasitism | Environmental predictability | Evolution of coloniality | Metapopulation | Performance-based conspecific attraction | Public information | Rissa tridactyla,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,186,NA,NA

Following a peak in the microscopic charcoal accumulation rate (CHAR), there is a sequence of peaks in sediment thickness and in 14 of the 21 common pollen and spore taxa. The general pollen sequence is an initial peak in herbs, then shrubs, then deciduous trees, and finally conifers and Sphagnum.

Field experiment 1 tested which species has a competitive advantage as larvae developing in water-filled tires. Densities and availability of resources (leaf litter, which is a substrate for microorganisms fed upon by larvae) were manipulated in a factorial design. Contrary to previous laboratory experiments, A. albopictus was clearly the superior competitor in this tire environment, maintaining positive population growth at higher combined density and lower per capita resource availability than did A. aegypti. The primary determinant of success in this experiment was survivorship to adulthood, and A. aegypti only survived well in this environment when raised alone at low density, with high resource availability. Field experiment 2 tested whether this advantage for A. albopictus resulted from apparent competition mediated by shared protozoan parasites in the genus Ascogregarina. In field experiment 2, A. albopictus larvae had moderate to high levels of parasitism, but A. aegypti larvae were virtually free from Ascogregarina in all experimental tires, implying that Ascogregarina played little or no role in producing the advantage for A. albopictus in field experiment 1. Thus, apparent competition does not appear to be necessary to account for the replacement of A. aegypti by A. albopictus. As a first step toward understanding variation in the outcome of this invasion, numbers of Aedes immatures and masses of adults from field collected pupae (indicators of the intensity of competition) were compared for three sites with known histories of invasion by A. albopictus and decline of A. aegypti. Differences among sites in both number of Aedes per container and masses of adults of both species were consistent with the hypothesis that intensity of competition varies among sites, and suggest that A. aegypti persists only at sites where interspecific competition is less intense.

But the factors responsible for tree mortality are poorly understood, particularly for trees in relatively healthy forests. I evaluated a conceptual model of the tree-mortality process that attributes tree death to a sequence of environmental stresses: long-term stresses that predispose trees to injury by short-term, inciting stresses. Tree-ring growth data from 63 dead overstory oaks (Quercus spp. L.) from seven Midwestern (USA) oak-hickory forests were employed as long-term records of tree vigor. Tree-ring growth data from surviving oaks from the same sites were utilized for comparison and as an indicator of year, to-year variations in environmental stress at each site. Utilizing time-series regression analysis, evidence of the action of inciting stresses was sought in the form of sudden and permanent declines, or interventions, in individual tree growth rates coincident with environmental stresses. Utilizing hierarchical regression analysis, evidence of the action of the predisposing stresses was sought in the form of reduced growth rates prior to the interventions. Three-fourths of the dead trees had growth patterns prior to mortality that included growth declines indicative of inciting stress. The median intervention resulted in a 38% decline in basal-area growth rate. The interventions were more likely to occur during environmentally stressful years, with five drought years accounting for 40% of the interventions experienced by the dead trees. Prior to experiencing interventions, the now-dead trees were growing an average of 18% slower than comparable surviving trees, indicating the action of predisposing stresses. After interventions occurred, two decades typically passed before the trees died.

We used natural variation in maternal habitat to test this hypothesis, using laboratory growth experiments. In the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, mothers from greater depth (100 m) had smaller ovaries and smaller eggs than mothers from shallower depth (<6 m), which indicated poorer maternal nutrition at depth.

The feeding ecology of two species of flying fox, Pteropus samoensis and Pteropus tonganus on the Samoan archipelago, was examined in detail by direct observation and by examining feeding refuse. P. samoensis and P. tonganus fed on over 78 plant species from 39 families throughout their range and on over 69 plant species in Samoa alone. Flying foxes interacted with 59% of the forest tree species in Amalau Valley for fruit or flower resources. Twenty-eight percent of the forest trees were commonly used, and 79% of forest canopy trees were used. Broad overlap in resource use was noted between P. samoensis and P. tonganus with over 22 shared plant species. Seasonal variation in fruit resource use was quantified with a preference index. Flying foxes ate a taxonomically nonrandom subset of fruit species and generally preferred primary forest fruits to those in the secondary forest. Six plant families (Sapotaceae, Mrytaceae, Moraceae, Combretaceae, Fabaceae, and Sapindaceae) were particularly important to flying foxes in Samoa.

Plant responses that change the level of physical or biotic defense are less well documented and poorly understood. Many Azteca spp. ants are obligate inhabitants of Cecropia spp. trees. In such ant-plant associations the ants are thought to be analogous to chemical defenses; previous experiments have demonstrated that ant occupation of C. obtusifolia reduced herbivory and plant competition and increased growth. Experiments, conducted over two years, on the dynamics of ant defense demonstrate that leaf damage caused a fivefold increase in the number of Azteca spp. ants on damaged leaves of C. obtusifolia compared to that on disturbed but undamaged control leaves. Ant activity peaked 8-12 min after damage, and differences between damaged and control leaves remained evident for 24 h. Such rapid induction of ant recruitment is likely to be particularly effective against unpredictable and mobile herbivores. The magnitude of the induced ant response to damage was strongly correlated with the number of ants patrolling the leaves before damage occurred. Ant responses to disturbance were not influenced by the presence of damage that had been applied 24 h previously. However, ant responses to subsequent damage, 24 h after initial damage, resulted in greater recruitment than to previously undamaged leaves. Ant recruitment to several other cues associated with herbivory was also tested. Presence of pyralid caterpillars that naturally feed on C. obtusifolia induced a low level of ant recruitment, and most larvae were removed from leaves by the ants within 10 min. Exposure to plant sap collected from damaged conspecifics and a commercially available green leaf volatile (hexanal) commonly released by plants after damage, both resulted in a doubling of ant numbers relative to controls. However, the levels of recruitment in response to these stimuli were insufficient to account for the high numbers of ants and persistence of recruitment observed on experimentally damaged leaves. Experimental wounding of leaves with minimal leaf tissue removal (using pin pricks) revealed that leaf wounds per se can only partially explain the induced ant recruitment following leaf damage. The type of herbivory and size of leaf wounds may be important cues for ant recruitment. Severed C. obtusifolia leaves that were freshly damaged failed to elicit an induced ant response when held adjacent to conspecific leaves with ants. However, induction of ant recruitment on damaged plants did significantly induce a low level of ant recruitment on neighboring conspecifics, providing evidence for interplant communication. Induced ant responses in the Cecropia-Azteca system are the result of multiple physical and chemical cues associated with herbivory.

To determine whether development, survival, pupal size, fecundity, or sex ratio varied among offspring of gypsy moths from high- and low-density populations, we collected eggs from three sites where moths had been at low density and three sites where moth density had been high for several years. We reared caterpillars hatching from these eggs in the laboratory under controlled conditions. Sex ratio was the only characteristic to vary in a consistent way with the density of the maternal population. Egg masses from low-density sites produced significantly more females than those from high-density sites, for which the numbers of males and females were equal or slightly in favor of males. The female bias of the sex ratio of low-density populations increases the potential rate of increase of the population and may arise from local mate competition when populations are sparse.

Removal of cached seeds was monitored on two Jeffrey pine foraging grids (each with 100 caches of five seeds buried 5 mm deep) and on two bitterbrush foraging grids (each with 100 caches of 15 seeds buried at the same depth). Under dry conditions, soil typically contained <0.5% water, whereas Jeffrey pine and bitterbrush seeds contained 4.37 ± 1.46% water (mean ± 1 SD) and 7.45 ± 1.83% water, respectively. Under these conditions, rodents found a mean of 0.33% of available Jeffrey pine seed caches each day and 0.14% of available bitterbrush seed caches each day. After rains, soil moisture increased to as much as 8.5%, and Jeffrey pine and bitterbrush seeds contained 17.50 ± 12.04% water and 28.04 ± 16.35% water, respectively. When seeds and soil were moistened, the rate at which rodents removed caches increased dramatically; 8.8% of available Jeffrey pine seed caches and 2.1% of available bitterbrush seed caches were removed each day. Similar results were obtained when other foraging grids were artificially watered during a summer drought. Seeds are very hygroscopic, rapidly absorbing water whenever the environment around them becomes moistened. This moisture appears to trigger the release of odorant molecules from the seeds, which rodents can readily detect. Under dry conditions, release of odorant molecules is apparently reduced to the point that some rodents have difficulty detecting buried seeds. These results may have important implications for rodent-seed interactions, but more generally, they suggest that, for terrestrial animals inhabiting arid environments, variation in environmental water level may modulate olfactory sensitivity in many other contexts where olfaction is important, such as assessing food patch quality, social behavior, predator-prey relations, and interspecific competition.",133,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Granivory | Olfaction | Peromyscus maniculatus | Pinus jeffreyi | Purshia tridenteta | Scatter hoarding | Seed water | Tamias amoenus,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,196,NA,NA

We investigated links between predator distributions, predation intensity, rainfall, the depth of the LSL, and sessile invertebrate community structure at two sites in Doubtful Sound, New Zealand. Sessile invertebrate communities living on the rock walls of the fjord showed striking patterns of vertical zonation corresponding to the depth of the LSL. Barnacles and mussels, Mytilus edulis galloprovincialis, were most abundant at the 1-3 m depth range commonly bathed by the LSL, while sponges, bryozoans, and ascidians dominated space below it (6-18 m depth). Mussel abundance declined sharply with depth at both sites, from maxima of 52-80% cover in the LSL (3 m) to <2% cover just below the LSL (6 m). To test the hypothesis that the LSL influences the lower limit of the mussel zone by excluding predators and reducing predation from mobile invertebrates living below it, we measured predator densities and tracked predation on transplanted mussels, M. e. galloprovincialis, in the LSL (2.5 m depth) and at 3-4 depths below. Predators were most abundant just below the lower boundary of the LSL during February and April 1993. No transplanted mussels were consumed in the LSL at 2.5 m, but 20-80% of them were consumed in experiments conducted below it, indicating that the LSL represents a spatial refuge from predation. The shallowing of the LSL to 1.5 m depth during low rainfall in November 1993 provided an additional opportunity to evaluate the influence of the LSL on predation. Repeated predator surveys showed that sea stars and urchins moved up with the ascending LSL to create a pattern of high predator abundance at 2.5 m depth in November, suggesting that the shallow zone previously buffered from predation by the LSL was not a predation refuge in November. Rainfall and salinity at 2.5 m depth were inversely related. A significant regression of rainfall one day prior to salinity profiling and the depth of the LSL boundary (30 mg/g salinity) explained 61.5% of the variation in the depth of the boundary, which represented the maximum depth of the predation refuge. The regression enabled us to predict the depth of the predation refuge over a 1.5-yr period beginning in October 1992. The average depth of the refuge was 2.35 m, ranging from 1.5 to 5.6 m as a function of rainfall. Daily tidal variation increased the vertical excursion of the refuge by 0.9-1.7 m. Distinguishing between a partial predation refuge where the LSL occurred at a given depth for a part of a day, and a complete refuge where a depth occurred in the refuge for the entire day, we estimated that the 2.5-m habitat was a complete refuge during 10% of the 18-mo period and a partial predation refuge 90% of the time. The close correspondence between the average depth of the predation refuge (2.35 m) and the depth of maximum mussel cover (3.0 m) suggests that the mussel zone is restricted to the LSL by high predation at the lower boundary of the layer. The alternative hypothesis, that the lower limit of the mussel zone (6 m depth) was determined by a failure of mussel recruitment to this depth, was tested by a 1-yr recruitment experiment. Mussels recruited to the lower edge of the mussel zone at 6 m, although overall levels of mussel recruitment during May 1993-April 1994 were too low to maintain the observed zonation pattern. By increasing the spatial extent of the low-salinity layer, we speculate that changes in climatic conditions leading to increased freshwater runoff may alter salinity gradients, bathymetric distributions of predators, and the structure of shallow subtidal communities, especially in fjords.",96,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Climate | Environmental variability | Epifauna | Fjords | Freshwater runoff | Mussels | Mytilus edulis galloprovincialis | Predation refuges | Sea stars | Subtidal communities | Urchins,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,197,NA,NA

Ungulates also can influence soil dynamics; however the relative contribution of large herbivores to controlling grassland soil processes remains largely unknown. In this study, we compared the effects of native migratory ungulates and variable site ('landscape') conditions, caused by combined climatic and topographic variability, on grassland of the northern winter range of Yellowstone National Park by determining soil C and N dynamics inside and outside 33-37 yr exclosures at seven diverse sites. Sites included hilltop, slope, and slope bottom positions across a climatic gradient and represented among the driest and wettest grasslands on the northern winter range. We performed two experiments: (1) a 12-mo in situ net N mineralization study and (2) a long-term (62-wk) laboratory incubation to measure potential N mineralization and microbial respiration. Results from the in situ experiment indicated that average net N mineralization among grazed plots (3.8 g N · m-2 · yr-1) was double that of fenced, ungrazed plots (1.9 g N · m-2 · yr-1). Mean grazer enhancement of net N mineralization across sites (1.9 g N · m-2 · yr-1) approached the maximum difference in net N mineralization among fenced plots (2.2 g N · m-2 · yr-1), i.e., the greatest landscape effect observed. Furthermore, ungulates substantially increased between-site variation in mineralization; grazed grassland, 1 SD = 2.2 g N · m-2 · yr-1, fenced grassland, 1 SD = 0.85 g N · m-2 · yr-1. In the long-term incubation, potential microbial respiration and net N mineralization were positively related to total soil C and N content, respectively. There was greater variation in potential respiration and net N mineralization early in the incubation, when labile material was processed, compared to late in the incubation, when more recalcitrant substrate was processed, suggesting that between-site variation in labile organic matter was greater than that of recalcitrant material. Herbivores improved the organic matter quality of soil, increasing the labile fractions and reducing the recalcitrant fractions. Grazers reduced C respired/N mineralized ratios, an index of microbial N immobilization, by an average of 21%. However, the largest landscape influence on the immobilization index was 13-fold greater than the grazer effect. Given that the greatest landscape influence on in situ net mineralization (2.2 g N · m-2 · yr-1) was similar to the average grazer impact on that rate (1.9 g N · m-2 · yr-1), we hypothesize that the landscape effect on field N availability was primarily caused by variation in microbial immobilization, while the grazing effect was primarily due to stimulation of gross mineralization. These results indicate that the relative importance of ungulates in controlling soil N cycling may be more important than previously suspected for grasslands supporting large herds of migratory ungulates, and that the dominant mechanisms underlying the landscape and ungulate influences on soil mineral fluxes may differ.",277,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Carbon | Grassland | Grazing | Herbivory | Large herbivores | Nitrogen | Yellowstone National Park,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,198,NA,NA

However, a rather counterintuitive larger-fish-upstream pattern has recently been documented for Arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus) in Alaska and brown trout (Salmo trutta) in New Zealand, and habitat selection theory cannot explain these observations. My goal in this paper is to improve this situation by developing a model that predicts the distribution of a population of fish both within single pools and over the length of the entire river, as well as the behavioral mechanism responsible. The model uses information on invertebrate drift density and water temperature to predict the growth rate of different sizes of fish at the positions available in the stream. Fish then distribute themselves so that each individual occupies the most profitable position it can defend, with the largest fish winning any disputes. The model suggests that streams can. be classified into categories based on the way temperature and drift density vary with the passage downstream. Each of these categories favors a different combination of size gradient and behavioral mechanism. A larger-fish-upstream pattern due to size-dependent habitat preference is predicted for streams with cool temperatures and low drift densities, conditions found in Arctic grayling streams. A larger-fish-upstream pattern due to competition between fish of different size is predicted in warm streams, irrespective of drift density, conditions found in many New Zealand trout streams.

The analysis shows that a floral surplus with subsequent selective abortion can generate large increases in mean female fitness. However, marginal fitness returns always diminished as the floral surplus increased (i.e., the fitness gain curve was always saturating), and imperfect selectivity of abortion could severely mute the advantages of surplus flowers. If the mating environment creates low variance in quality among developing fruits, then little benefit is derived from surplus flowers, while a high variance allows large fitness gains but with rapidly saturating benefits.

The ontogenetic reaction norms of defensive spines were also found to differ in natural populations with and without fish. A detailed analysis of the growth trajectories showed that this differentiation was primarily due to ontogenetic acceleration in environments with fish, leading to relatively exaggerated spine shape in these environments. However, while the ontogenetic trajectories of shape in some spines diverged at the onset of ontogeny in the two environments, those of others remained parallel until a given phase of ontogeny.

Individual Elymus clones were planted in large bins together with one of three neighboring grass species, Agropyron desertorum, Pseudoroegneria spicata, or Bromus tectorum, which differ in rooting density and growth activity. The position of Elymus clones was manipulated so rhizomes encountered a short-duration nutrient patch and subsequently root systems of the neighboring plants. Unexpectedly, the morphological plasticity of the perennial grass Elymus lanceolatus ssp. lanceolatus was influenced by the presence of the neighboring species much more than by the local nutrient enrichments, although nutrient patches did amplify some of the foraging responses. Elymus rhizomes branched readily and initiated large daughter plants as they encountered the low-density root systems of Pseudoroegneria.

We found that at large scales, in this case movement over hundreds of meters and several seasons, diffusion is a good approximation for population spread. At small scales of around one meter, BRW describes movement accurately. At intermediate scales we need both BRW, resting, and changes between these behaviors to describe motion effectively in the model. The area covered by the beetles increases linearly over time, while the maximum distance moved does not, indicating an approximately circular expansion and a thorough search of area traversed. Seasonal range and estimated rate of movement differed among species depending on prey availability but was not correlated to body size.",66,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Carabidae | Computer simulation | Diffusion | Individual-based model | Random walk | Range | Spatial scale,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,204,NA,NA

Current theory predicts that fish primarily influence periphyton communities by controlling herbivore densities. But fish may also influence algal communities by increasing available nutrients via nutrient recycling. To separate these effects and to determine their relative importance, we made a number of specific predictions based on the literature and tested these predictions by manipulating the presence and absence of the molluscivorous redear sunfish, Lepomis microlophus, and snails, Physella heterostropha, in a replicated factorial experiment. We examined the effects of fish on nutrient concentrations in the water and on snail grazing activity and life history traits. We also evaluated the effect of fish and snails on cell number, biovolume, cell size, and growth form of all periphyton, green algae, diatoms, and blue-green algae. Concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen in the water were significantly higher in the presence of fish, but this had little effect on total periphyton. Although fish had only visual and waterborne (olfactory) contact with snails, their presence inhibited snail reproduction and/or increased mortality of small snails such that twice as many snails were produced in the absence of fish. Snail grazing activity was six times higher in the absence of caged fish than in their presence. In the absence of fish, snails reduced periphyton cell number and increased the average size of the periphyton cells, primarily through effects on green algae. Snails reduced the biovolume of diatoms and blue-green algae. Fish also reduced diatom biovolume by decreasing the average cell size of diatoms. Snails increased the proportion of gelatinous colonies in the periphyton. Previous research suggests that fish have a positive indirect effect on algae by removing grazers. Fish can augment this effect by negatively affecting snail life history traits and by reducing grazing activity. In addition, fish may have an important but less obvious direct effect on algae via changing nutrient concentrations and possibly altering competitive outcomes among taxa and growth forms.",86,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Algae | Direct effects | Fish | Grazing | Indirect effects | Lepomis | Littoral zone | North Carolina | Nutrient recycling | Periphyton | Physella | Predation | Snails,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,205,all,All Open Access

Prior work established that desert trees have lower leaf: sapwood area ratios than montane trees (0.104 and 0.201 m2/cm2, respectively) and proportionally greater stem respiration. Sapwood: leaf mass ratios are also greater and increase more as a function stem diameter in desert than in montane trees. We hypothesized that this increased allocation of carbon to stem sapwood and stem respiration in large trees could decrease growth rates in the desert compared to the montane environment, in addition to any growth reduction imposed by drought on physiology and growth processes. Trees of all diameters (dbh) in the desert environment had lower relative growth rates (RGRs) than montane trees (e.g., for a 30 cm dbh tree, RGR = 0.012 vs. 0.021 kg · kg-1 · yr-1, respectively). However, growth rates of desert and montane trees declined similarly with increasing dbh and did not reflect diverging sapwood: leaf mass ratios. Alternatively, we hypothesized that desert trees may increase rates of photosynthetic carbon accumulation (per unit leaf area) with diameter, thereby compensating for increased sapwood respiration. Leaf nitrogen (N) concentration and stable-carbon isotope composition (δ13C) were measured to examine size-dependent and seasonally integrated photosynthetic capacity within desert and montane environments. Nitrogen concentration was correlated with photosynthetic capacity.

In desert trees, leaf nitrogen concentration in 1-yr-old through 5-yr-old needles increased with dbh, and carbon isotope composition in 1-yr-old needles increased with dbh, suggesting increased photosynthetic capacity and photosynthetic rates with increasing tree size. Needle nitrogen concentration and δ13C values decreased or remained constant with dbh in montane trees. Desert trees had greater light extinction coefficients and retained fewer needle cohorts.

Our working hypothesis is that grizzly bears structure plant communities and influence nitrogen availability when they selectively dig for preferred plants. In this paper, we report on differences found in recently disturbed digs (<5 yr old) when compared to adjacent, undisturbed meadow. We used ion exchange resin bags to determine the availability of mineral nitrogen in grizzly bear digs compared to undisturbed meadow. Soil in digs contained significantly more ammonium-N and nitrate-N than adjacent, intact meadow. Glacier lily bulbs revegetating bear digs had higher tissue nitrogen and water-soluble carbohydrate concentrations than lilies in undisturbed meadow. Mature glacier lilies in digs produced twice as many seeds as did those in adjacent meadow. Glacier lily seedlings establish best on bare mineral soil, which in these meadows is found primarily in bear digs. Therefore, grizzly bear digging may benefit old, deeply seated plants that survive digging and reproduce. Digs overlapped spatially, meaning that grizzly bears were returning to dig in patches disturbed in previous years, perhaps in response to easier digging conditions and more nutritious glacier lily bulbs. To test the idea that the observed increase in mineral nitrogen was due to the physical disturbance of grizzly bear digging and not bear choice of sites already high in nitrogen or bear excretion, we created experimental digs. Ammonium-N and nitrate-N levels increased significantly following our digging treatment, just as we had observed in the natural bear digs.

We also monitored the seasonal development of pistillate aments in 1995. These Carpinus species are known to show highly synchronized, fluctuating annual seed production. Total seed production (the sum of sound seeds, seeds suffering predation, empty seeds, and immature seeds) was proportional to the quantity of staminate aments and was synchronized among the four species during the observation period. The percentage of mature seeds (the sum of sound seeds and seeds suffering predation) out of the total seed production was positively correlated with annual staminate ament production. This result supports the pollination efficiency hypothesis. The observation that most ovaries in this study did not fall after the pollination season and grew into normal, mature-sized seeds irrespective of fertilization (empty or not) also supports the hypothesis. The percentage of seeds suffering predation by insects significantly decreased in relation to sound seed production, suggesting that predator satiation also operated for these Carpinus species.

We took an experimental approach to evaluating the importance of toughness, secondary chemistry, silica, salt, and protein in determining feeding preferences. Consumption of plants by Armases in two experiments was correlated with decreasing toughness. Consumption was more equitable when plants were ground up and reconstituted in agar discs, with reduced differences in toughness. In four pairwise choice tests, Armases always preferred the softer plant of the pair, but in three of four cases exhibited no preference when the same plants were presented in reconstituted discs. Several plant extracts significantly stimulated or deterred feeding by Armases, but these effects were not consistent with and could not be used to predict overall preferences for fresh plants. Salt in artificial diets stimulated feeding by Armases. Silica had no effect on feeding in two experiments and stimulated feeding in a third. Armases was mildly stimulated to feed by high levels of protein in artificial diets, but these levels were above those found in plants, and the protein content of plants did not correlate with feeding preferences. Our results point towards plant toughness as most important in determining feeding choices of Armases.

All five daphnids exhibited reduced growth and reproduction on pure diets of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus or a P-deficient green alga, Scenedesmus acutus, in comparison to the same concentration (0.5 mg C/L) of high-quality resources. Growth rates on Synechococcus declined markedly over time in 6- and 7-d trials. D. magna fared the best on the cyanobacterium and S. vetulus the worst. In agreement with stoichiometric models, D. pulicaria, the species with the lowest specific P content of body tissues (i.e., highest C:P ratio), was the best species on P-deficient Scenedesmus, whereas S. vetulus, the species with the lowest C:P ratio, was the worst. No evidence was found for a trade-off between maximal growth rate and sensitivity to P limitation. The outcome of competition among daphnids could be influenced by their abilities to utilize the poor-quality resources. All five species showed improved growth and reproduction when small quantities (520%) of Synechococcus were mixed with P-deficient Scenedesmus. Since Synechococcus is rich in P, these results support the mineral-limitation hypothesis. Moreover, these results are contrary to both the fatty-acid-limitation hypothesis and the digestion-resistance hypothesis. The addition of a phosphate-rich medium rapidly increased the specific P content of P-deficient Scenedesmus, but growth rates of the five daphnids remained 15-23% lower than growth rates with P-sufficient Scenedesmus. Thus, mineral limitation may not entirely account for reduced growth with P-deficient Scenedesmus. Experiments with dual-labeled (14C/32P) P-sufficient and P-deficient Scenedesmus revealed no effect of food quality on the ingestion rates of D. pulicaria or S. vetulus. However, in agreement with stoichiometric models, P deficiency enhanced the incorporation of P relative to C. The importance of resource C:P ratios was tested directly by labeling one resource, P-rich Synechococcus or P-deficient Scenedesmus, and altering the C:P ratio of the diet with the alternative, unlabeled resource. P-deficient diets again enhanced P incorporation, whereas mixed diets enhanced C incorporation.

This study investigated leaf-level ecophysiological variation in seedlings of nine sympatric, pioneer tree species of Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae) from Borneo, grown at three light levels (high: ~19 mol/d; medium: ~7 mol/d; low: ~3.6 mol/d). A multivariate analysis of traits associated with species' successional status was used to rank species according to life history variation, and then to investigate patterns of covariation in seedling ecophysiological and life history traits. Ecophysiological traits varied significantly among the nine species. On a leaf area basis, dark respiration (R(d)-area) in high-light seedlings ranged from 0.51 to 0.90 μmol CO2 · m-2 · s-1, and light saturated net photosynthesis (A(max)-area) ranged from 7 to 13 μmol CO2 · m-2 · s-1. A(max)-mass and R(d)-mass were strongly negatively correlated with leaf mass per unit area (LMA). Among species, A(max)-mass and R(d)-mass were strongly positively correlated for high-light grown seedlings, reflecting a trade-off between high assimilation rates and respiratory costs. Within species, A(max)-area, R(d)-area, g(s), LMA, and photosynthetic light compensation point were significantly greater in high-light grown plants for all species. Due to the high plasticity of LMA, A(max)-mass and R(d)-mass were only weakly influenced by light growth conditions, suggesting that resource allocation patterns that maximize photosynthetic ability are critical to survival and growth in low light for these species. Principal components analysis (PCA) of ecophysiological traits for the nine species revealed a continuum of variation from species with relatively low A(max) low g(s), and high LMA to species with the opposite traits. The primary axis of the PCA of life history traits was strongly related to variation in shade tolerance and seed mass. The second life history axis distinguished among the more shade-intolerant species.

Populations isolated on four islands were censused by monthly live-trapping and served as unmanipulated controls, while populations isolated on four additional islands were provisioned with fruit at 315.2 kg/ha and censused by similar methods. Natural fruit abundance was concurrently censused by counting numbers of fruiting trees and lianas to account for naturally available resources. Means of overall spiny rat density and density of known births were compared between treatment groups using repeated-measures analysis of covariance, with the density of fruiting trees and lianas as the covariate. Both variables showed a treatment effect, with higher-than-expected densities and densities of births within experimental populations based on natural resource abundance. Numbers of known births per adult female were compared between treatment groups by constructing a log-linear model. This model also revealed a treatment effect, with per capita production of young being higher within all experimental populations. Monthly survival rates of young and adults were compared between treatment groups by constructing separate linear models for young and adults, and no treatment effect was evident. Adult male body mass was compared among islands by analysis of variance and similarly showed no treatment effect.

In this paper, replicated laboratory microcosms containing planktonic rotifer predators and phytoplankton prey were used to explore the effects of enrichment on predator population dynamics. Prey enrichment was accomplished by increasing the input concentration of prey into predator chemostat flasks, which is equivalent to increasing prey carrying capacity and growth rate. Enrichment stabilized predator dynamics, reducing population variability and reducing the occurrence and strength of population cycles. This is the first experimental demonstration of a reversal of the paradox of enrichment. Rotifers produced an autotoxic compound that reduced population growth rate and individual survival.

We tested the two principal predictions deduced from these theories: trophic cascades of (1) biomass regulation and (2) productivity regulation occur in food webs. We created three food webs with either one, two, or three trophic levels in soil microcosms containing a sterilized mixture of leaf litter and humus. Twenty species of bacteria and fungi formed the first trophic level, a bacterivorous nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans) and a fungivorous nematode (Aphelenchoides sp.) the second level, and a predatory nematode (Prionchulus punctatus) the third level. We sampled the microcosms destructively four times during a 5-mo experiment for estimations of the biomass of each of the trophic levels. CO2 evolution was analyzed once or twice a week, and NH4+-N concentration in the soil was measured at the end of the experiment. Glucose was added to the microcosms every second week to provide energy for the microbes. The biomass of microbivores was clearly regulated by the predator. The abundance of bacteria was not affected by the food chain length, and the abundance of fungi was higher in the presence of nematodes than in the pure microbial community. Net mineralization of N and C was highest in the food chains with two trophic levels, at an intermediate level in the presence of predators, and lowest in the pure microbial communities. Microbial production (estimated on the basis of microbial respiration) was higher in the food webs with two and three trophic levels than when the microbes were growing alone. Whether the biomass of the second trophic level was reduced by the predator or not had no effect on microbial biomass or microbial productivity. Therefore, although the microbivore biomass and mineralization of both C and N were regulated by the predator, our experiment did not provide evidence of cascading trophic interactions regulating the microbial biomass and productivity in decomposer food webs. The facts that microbes were able to compensate totally for the consumed biomass by increasing their turnover rate and that the microbes did not behave as a uniform trophic level prevented a trophic cascade of biomass regulation from occurring in our soil food web. Similarly, since microbial productivity did not depend on the biomass at the second trophic level, neither did a trophic cascade of productivity regulation take place.",182,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Biomass regulation | Bottom-up vs. top-down regulation | Microbes | Microbial productivity | Microcosm | Mineralization | Nematodes | Soil food web | Trophic cascade | Trophic level,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,220,NA,NA

In this study we analyzed the plasticity of the developmental response to water volume reduction in the western spadefoot toad, Scaphiopus hammondii. Also, we attempted to identify the environmental cue(s) that may signal a desiccating larval habitat. We spawned adults in the laboratory and raised tadpoles in aquaria in a controlled environmental chamber. Water levels of aquaria were gradually reduced by removing water at the rate of 0.5-1 L/d; water in control aquaria was similarly disturbed but not removed. Tadpoles subjected to water volume reduction showed significant acceleration of metamorphosis. The developmental acceleration depended on the rate of reduction of the water level; i.e., tadpoles exhibited a continuum of response. This developmental response did not result from thermal differences between treatments. Furthermore, the response was reversible in that refilling of the aquaria to the starting water level at various times following the onset of volume reduction resulted in restoration of body mass and a tendency to decelerate metamorphosis. Several lines of evidence suggest that the developmental response is due neither to the concentration of compounds in the water nor to chemical or physical interactions among conspecifics. Rather, the response appears to be related to the reduced swimming volume and perhaps the proximity to the water surface. When the water level is reduced, tadpoles reduce foraging, and food restriction of prometamorphic tadpoles maintained in a constant high water environment accelerated metamorphosis.

This pattern has important implications for studies of morphology, physiology, reproduction, and interactions with other organisms. Using cottonwoods, we test two major hypotheses about their developmental streams. First, within a tree, the developmental stage expressed by a shoot is dependent on its growth distance from the ground. Second, the distribution and fitness of Pemphigus betae, an aphid that is sensitive to host maturity, are positively related to increasingly mature shoot phenotypes within a tree. We show that the developmental variation in plant morphology and reproductive output within a tree are as great as that found among different-aged trees within a clone. In addition, we show that within-tree patterns of variation are stable from year to year and that P. betae responds to this variation by preferentially colonizing branches expressing more mature phenotypes. This pattern of branch selection is adaptive; aphids transferred to branches with shoots expressing mature phenotypes have expected fitnesses >80% higher than those transferred to branches expressing juvenile phenotypes. These findings have several general implications. First, a within-tree series of developmental stages provides a heritable mechanism for creating mosaics of variability in host quality within plants that create host selection problems for herbivores. Second, herbivores sensitive to developmental changes in their hosts will be concentrated in areas of high quality where they will be subject to the detrimental effects of competition, predation, and parasitism. Third, simulation models of plant growth based on the behavior of repeating plant parts (e.g., shoots) must be sensitive to developmental changes in these parts during plant development. Fourth, the developmental streams of plants may affect the evolution of such herbivore traits as territoriality, deme formation, and virulence.

Studies of 16 sites in or near the Kadashan River basin demonstrated nonlinear, unimodal relations between flood frequency and SR, productivity and SR, and linear relations between SR and the spatial variation of flood frequencies (SVFF) within a site. SVFF is caused by microtopographic variation in elevation. A nonlinear regression model relating SR to flood frequency and SVFF explained much of the variation in SR between wetland communities. Sites with intermediate flood frequencies and high SVFF were species-rich, while sites frequently, rarely, or permanently flooded and with low SVFF were species-poor. The data suggest that small-scale spatial variation can dramatically alter the impact of disturbances. The data also support Michael Huston's dynamic-equilibrium model of species diversity, which predicts the effects of productivity and disturbance on diversity patterns.

We hypothesized that the species composition of AMF communities could have the potential to determine plant community structure if the growth response to different AMF species or to communities of AMF species varies among plant species. To test the existence of such a differential response we conducted a pot experiment where each of three plant species, Hieracium pilosella, Bromus erectus, and Festuca ovina were inoculated with each of four AMF species, or with a mixture of these four AMF species, or were uninoculated. The AMF species originated from a calcareous grassland in which the three plant species also coexisted. We obtained three pieces of evidence suggesting that AMF have the potential to determine plant community structure. First, plant species differed in their dependency on AMF, thus varying in degree of benefit received. Second, specific AMF species and a mixture of these AMF species had significantly different effects on several plant growth variables, and these effects were not the same on each plant species. Third, the amount of variation in the growth response of a plant species to four AMF species and to the mixture of AMF species differed among the plant species. Hieracium differed greatly in its growth response to several AMF species while Bromus did not exhibit much variation in its response to different AMF species. The varying mycorrhizal dependency of different plant species has previously been proposed as a mechanism determining plant community structure. However, we found that the mycorrhizal dependency of a plant species can vary greatly because of differential growth responses to specific AMF species compared to the growth of the uninoculated plants. Consequently mycorrhizal dependency, as a measure indicating how much a plant depends on AMF for its growth, is not necessarily a fixed value and therefore cannot be used as a definitive term. In addition, those plant species with highly variable responses to single AMF species or to combinations of AMF species (AMF communities) will be strongly affected by the specific species of AMF that occupy their roots, in contrast to plant species that do not respond differently to different AMF species. We conclude that, through their differential effects on plant growth, AMF species that co-occur as natural AMF communities have the potential to determine plant community structure, and that future studies on plant population and community structure need to consider the strength of their role as a determinant.",576,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal diversity | Bromus erectus | Community structure | Festuca ovina | Hieracium pilosella | Mutualism | Mycorrhizal symbiosis and dependency | Plant-fungi interactions | Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhiza (VAM),20308,undefined,0,FALSE,225,NA,NA

Foraging groups may form via different mechanisms depending on the absolute levels of at least two relative spatial scales. I present four group size models for environments composed of two nested patch scales. Second-order patches contain first-order patches that correspond to food patches. Individuals within a given second-order patch are able to monitor their conspecifics' behavior, and the number of individuals attending a first-order patch defines group size. I then test the models' predictions with Parasitic Jaegers (Stercorarius parasiticus) kleptoparasitizing fish from Common Terns (Sterna hirundo). In this context, tern fishing grounds and flying terns that carried fish correspond to the jaegers' second and first-order patches, respectively. The Dispersion and Aggregation models assume that foragers have perfect knowledge of the spatial distribution of food and form groups in conformity to an ideal free distribution. The Producer-Scrounger (PS) and Information-Sharing (IS) models, however, assume that foragers are unaware of the food patches' location and form groups as some foragers join and exploit the food discoveries of others. I used four fitness currencies: probability of obtaining a fish, PF; gross and net rates of energy intake; and energy efficiency. All currencies decreased with group size except the PF currency, which did not vary for group sizes of one and two. Because fitness never increased with group size, the Aggregation model was ruled out. Fish-securing rates of jaegers that initiated and joined chases did not differ. Assuming that initiating and joining a chase correspond to a producing and a scrounging event, respectively, both the PS and IS model then predict that group size should match jaeger abundance. Because group size leveled rapidly with jaeger abundance, both models were discarded. The Dispersion model predicts that group size should decrease with an increase in tern availability when the latter is limiting. Otherwise, jaegers should not form groups unless there is no cost to do so, such as with the PF currency in which solitary jaegers and pairs experience equal fitness. The facts that group size did not reach 1.0 at high tern availability and that it averaged 1.5 when it did not decrease further with tern availability suggest that jaegers may form groups according to the Dispersion model with the PF currency.

Increasing plant productivity may increase herbivore diversity by: increasing the abundance of rare resources ('resource rarity hypothesis'), increasing herbivore abundance and local persistence ('consumer rarity hypothesis') or increasing intraspecific density dependence ('density dependence hypothesis'). Increasing plant diversity may increase the diversity of herbivores because herbivores specialized on these new plant species can persist locally. Increasing the diversity of herbivores could likewise increase the diversity of predators and parasites, although parasite and predator diversity may also respond directly to changes in vegetation. Here I use data from a well-replicated grassland experiment at Cedar Creek, Minnesota, to analyze the responses of arthropod diversity to independent manipulations of (1) plant productivity and (2) plant diversity and composition.

Short-term nitrogen addition ('modern treatment') increased plant productivity without appreciably changing plant diversity or plant composition.

Total arthropod species richness and abundance, as well as species richness and abundance of every trophic group (detritivores, herbivores, parasites, and predators), were significantly greater in plots with higher levels of modern fertilization and greater plant productivity. Path analysis supported the consumer rarity hypothesis, because modern fertilization increased herbivore species richness only indirectly by increasing herbivore abundance. Surprisingly, higher levels of historical fertilization that lowered plant species richness (but did not change plant productivity) significantly increased total arthropod species richness, did not affect detritivore or herbivore species richness, and significantly increased parasite and predator species richness. Direct and indirect effects of historical fertilization on the species richness of trophic groups were separated statistically using block regression chain modeling. Herbivore species richness was decreased through the direct pathway, but this was offset through indirect effects so that there was no overall response to historical fertilization.

The intensity and direction of the interaction were determined by comparing the combined and individual impacts of both predators. In a laboratory mesocosm, the combined predation rate of both predators was nearly double the sum of their individual predation rates. The mechanism for the interaction was the aphid 'dropping' behavior elicited by C. septempunctata, which rendered the aphids susceptible to predation by H. pennsylvanicus on the ground.

However, the factors underlying fluctuating asymmetry, especially in plants, remain poorly understood. We sampled leaf fluctuating asymmetry among and within three species of even-aged birch (Betula pubescens, B. nana, and B. pendula) and their interspecific hybrids growing in common gardens of northern Finland to determine whether hybridization and environmental stress are associated with increased developmental instability. Our predictions were that: (1) interspecific hybrids among B. pubescens, B. nana, and B. pendula would have enhanced leaf FA compared to the parent groups because of a possible disruption of coadapted genomes; (2) intermediates between Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa and B. pubescens ssp. pubescens would have a slight decrease or no difference in leaf FA compared to the parent group; and (3) fluctuating asymmetry would increase between a low-elevation and a tree-line-elevation site, and this increase would be greater in B. pubescens, which forms the major subarctic community below the tree line, than in B. nana, which is common above the tree line. As predicted, leaf FA was higher in the tree-line common garden than in the lower elevation garden, but the amount of increase was not significantly different between B. pubescens and B. nana. Leaf asymmetry was also higher in hybrids than in parental taxa, and this response was fairly consistent among the three crosses. This suggests that interspecific hybridization resulted in higher developmental instability. Furthermore, in the intraspecific studies with B. pubescens, there was no relationship between tree height (an intraspecific hybrid index) and leaf asymmetry. Thus, these data support the ideas of Markow (1995) that the changes in asymmetry observed from hybridization will be a function of how closely related parental taxa are. Since leaf FA in Betula pubescens increased with elevation and hybridization, and both are important in tree-line dynamics, FA might be a useful indicator of stress and distributional limits in this and possibly other plant species.",84,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Betula | Developmental instability | Environmental stress | Fennoscandia | Fluctuating asymmetry in leaves | Hybridization | Subarctic ecology,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,231,NA,NA

We also tested whether the Rapoport-rescue hypothesis (emigrants from higher elevation populations inflate the species richness of lower-elevation sites) could explain the species richness patterns we observed. In addition, we predicted whether global climate change is likely to perturb current elevational gradients in butterfly species richness. Species presence data were collected from 105 100-m vertical elevational bands in 17 canyons.

However, the Rapoport-rescue hypothesis cannot fully explain the elevational gradient in species richness. Environmental severity at either end and favorable conditions near the middle of the elevational gradient likely contributed to high species richness at intermediate elevations. Our models indicated that few butterfly taxa will be lost from the Toiyabe Range in the face of climate change.

At this colony, murres bred at varying densities on broad and narrow cliff ledges. Under calm wind conditions (<10 km/h), aerial search and attack activity by gulls' was low. At wind speeds >15 km/h, gulls searched more actively and focused their aerial attacks on nest sites on narrow ledges. Aerial attacks on narrow ledges were less successful (in number of eggs or chicks taken per attack) than attacks made on foot on broad ledges. However, aerial attacks also had a lower incidence of contact with defending murres because: (1) gulls could approach ledges readily by gliding; (2) murres on narrow ledges could not turn to fend off attacking gulls without dislodging their eggs or chicks; and (3) dense groups of murres on broad ledges defended their eggs and chicks communally. Gulls foraged successfully on foot on broad ledges despite communal defense by murres, although they suffered a greater risk of being struck on the head by defending murres.

I assayed male gain curves in experimental populations of a colonial ascidian in which I manipulated the intensity of sperm competition to test the hypothesis that gain curves would saturate in the absence of competitors, but remain linear when males competed for fertilizations. Allozyme markers were utilized for paternity assignment. Results supported theoretical predictions, with the gain curve becoming progressively more linear as the intensity of sperm competition increased. Increased levels of sperm competition also had the effect of decreasing male fertilization success at all sperm production levels. These results have a number of evolutionary implications. First, the existence of a saturating gain curve under some experimental conditions provides support for the hypothesis that diminishing gains in fertilization success via male function may favor the evolution of hermaphroditism. Secondly, the changing shape of this function with ecological conditions suggests that increased allocation to sperm production should be favored in high-density populations, where sperm competition is more intense. Finally, since male fertilization success only continued to increase with sperm production when competitors were present, this suggests that high levels of sperm production in some free-spawning marine invertebrates may be in part due to the selective pressures imposed on allocation patterns by sperm competition.",49,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Ascidian | Botryllus schlosseri | Evolutionary ecology | Fertilization ecology | Hermaphroditism | Local adaptation | Male gain curve | Paternity | Sex allocation,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,236,NA,NA

Using the same sets of variables, the ability to predict which plots were invaded in any year increased from 1970 to 1993. This supports our hypothesis that in early invasion stages, with dispersal limitation, an invader may occur in only a subset of suitable sites giving a weak relationship with site variables.

Our results support the hypothesis that herbivores indirectly decelerate N cycling by decreasing the abundance of plant species with nitrogen-rich tissues. However, other factors, such as disturbance from fire, may mediate herbivore effects on long-term changes in N and C pools. Herbivores may therefore indirectly control productivity, N cycling, and succession by consuming nitrogen-fixing and woody plants that have strong effects on plant resources (e.g., nitrogen and light).",390,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Herbivores | Legumes | Nitrogen | Plants | Positive feedback | Savanna,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,245,NA,NA

We used miniature radio collars to determine whether mobility affects the risk of predation on breeding field voles (Microtus agrestis) and sibling voles (M. rossiaemeridionalis) by their main predators, small carnivores, in a population with cyclically fluctuating numbers and predation risk. There was a significant association of mobility with predation risk: voles killed by small carnivores moved more than did voles that survived. An experimental reduction of predation risk significantly affected vole mobility: voles moved more under reduced predation risk. Sex, season, and phase of the vole cycle explained a similar or larger proportion of the observed variation in the number of killed voles than did mobility. Carnivores killed more female than male voles, predation risk was higher in the decline phase than in the increase phase of the cycle, and predation risk was also higher in spring than in early summer. However, voles cannot change sex, season, or the phase of their cycle, whereas they can alter their mobility. These results offer novel observational and experimental support for the hypothesis that animals may increase their survival prospects by reducing mobility. The female-biased prey choice of small carnivores implies that they have a stronger impact on prey population dynamics than avian predators, which have previously been shown to kill more males than females.",171,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Microtus agrestis | Microtus rossiaemeridionalis | Mobility | Mustela erminea | Mustela nivalis | Natural selection | Population dynamics | Predation risk | Selective predation,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,246,NA,NA

These basins were subsequently fertilized with nitrogen and phosphorus for two years. We tested three predictions about the response of heterotrophic flagellates, ciliates, and rotifers (collectively, microzooplankton) derived from prior studies. We predicted that (1) microzooplankton would increase with lake fertilization, (2) lakes with abundant Daphnia would have lower increases in microzooplankton, and (3) both increases in resource availability and suppression by Daphnia would determine microzooplankton dynamics. Contrary to the first prediction, microzooplankton did not increase with fertilization relative to the reference lake, except in the low-Daphnia system. The second prediction was supported, as Daphnia prevented microzooplankton from increasing in the fertilized lakes with the strength of the Daphnia effect being greater than anticipated. Because of this strong effect, microzooplankton dynamics were in all but one case most strongly related to suppression by Daphnia rather than to a combined effect of resources and suppression. The microzooplankton communities were differentially affected by the trophic cascade. Heterotrophic flagellates appeared to be limited by a variety of predators. Even in the low-Daphnia fertilized lake, mortality was apparently high. Ciliates and rotifers increased in the low-Daphnia fertilized lake and were strongly suppressed otherwise. These experiments indicate that small-scale, short-term experiments and larger-scale comparative analyses may be inadequate for assessing the strength of trophic interactions.

Here, we separate effects of natural densities of diurnal fishes and nocturnal shrimps in structuring the benthic community of a stream draining Costa Rica's Atlantic slope. We experimentally manipulated the spatial and temporal access of fishes and shrimps to benthic resources, in Situ, using electric 'fences' powered by solar-powered fence chargers. Both fishes and shrimps significantly reduced inorganic sediment mass, organic ash- free dry mass (AFDM), densities of larval Chironomidae, and total insects: their combined effects were greater than effects of either group alone, and there was no significant interaction. Fishes shifted algal community composition from diatoms to green and blue-green algae and benthic insect communities towards chironomids, while shrimps had no significant effect on community composition. Effects of fishes were generally greater: than those of shrimps, and this is due, in part, to higher natural densities and foraging pressures of fishes. Furthermore, shrimps foraged for significantly longer periods of time in the treatment where fishes were excluded than in the combined fish and shrimp access treatment, suggesting that diurnally feeding fishes are strong 'interactors,' mediating resource availability to nocturnally feeding shrimps. Natural erosion and sediment-mediated effects of macroconsumers (both direct and indirect) also affected algal communities: a manual sediment removal experiment resulted in significant reductions of diatom biovolume and increases in the filament length of green and blue-green algae. Our results show the importance of: (1) assessing macroconsumer effects in a relatively natural depositional environment subject to background erosion and sloughing (i.e., in this case by using electric exclosures); (2) evaluating effects of natural densities of both diurnal and nocturnal macroconsumers through time in the context of these abiotic effects; and (3) distinguishing between the response of different types of algal resources (e.g., diatoms vs. green and blue-green algae), which are differentially affected by sedimentation and erosion. Cage experiments, short-term observations, or one-time sampling of undifferentiated 'algae' may artificially overestimate trophic effects and underestimate abiotic effects. We found no evidence of a trophic cascade. Our findings are in agreement with the theoretical prediction that large-sized omnivores have strong direct trophic (feeding) effects, both on smaller primary consumers (insects) and basal resources (algae).",135,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Algae | Deposition | Electric exclusion | Fish | Intraguild predation | Omnivory | Periphyton | Sediments | Shrimp | Stream community | Succession | Tropical stream,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,248,NA,NA

We studied regeneration of northern red oak in oak and pine stands on moderately productive sites in northern Lower Michigan. Our objectives were (1) to investigate the hypothesis that regeneration of northern red oak is more successful in pine than in oak stands and (2) to test whether removal of potential overstory and understory competitors increases regeneration success on moderately productive sites. Northern red oak acorns and 2-yr-old nursery seedlings were planted in spring 1991 in three natural oak stands and three red pine (Pinus resinosa) plantations on comparable, moderately productive sites. Each stand contained four canopy cover treatments: clearcut, 25% cover (50% the first year), 75% cover, and uncut. Each canopy cover treatment contained four understory treatments: herb-layer removal, shrub-layer removal, litter removal, and control. Seedling survival, performance, and damage due to deer and late spring frosts were quantified along with vegetation characteristics, light, soil moisture, air temperature, soil temperature, and precipitation during the 1991 and 1992 growing seasons. Survival of seedlings was significantly lower in the pine than in the oak stands; the pine stands had a higher incidence of white-tailed deer browsing and lower levels of belowground resources than the oak stands. Canopy cover treatments produced a gradient from high stress (low light and soil moisture) and low disturbance (slight browsing and frost damage) in uncut plots to low stress (high light and soil moisture) and high disturbance (high browsing and frost damage) in clear-cut plots. Understory vegetation development and soil temperature were low in uncut plots, high in clear-cut plots, and intermediate in plots with partial overstory removal. Despite poor growth, the mortality of seedlings planted in uncut plots was low. In contrast, mortality was high and surviving seedlings exhibited good growth in clearcuts. Understory treatment effects were slight compared with overstory treatment effects.

On any one mountain, with increase in altitude foliar N decreases, and P and K usually decrease, but Ca and Mg show no consistent trend. However for a wide range of sites N, P, K, Mg, and Ca show no trends. Litterfall contents of N and P and often K, Ca, and Mg are lower in montane forests than in lowland forests, mainly because of reduced litterfall mass, but N and P concentrations are also lower in forests above 1500 m. Tropical montane soils usually have more soil organic matter per unit ground area; N mineralization levels are lower at higher altitudes in Costa Rica, and extractable and total soil P are lower in sites with lower litterfall P concentrations. We speculate that many lowland forests are limited by P and many montane forests by N. Fertilization studies on ash-derived montane soils in Hawai'i showed a trend for a switch from N limitation on young soils to P, or N and P, limitation on soils over older substrates. Jamaican montane trees were limited by N and by P separately. Venezuelan montane trees were limited by N. The sites in Jamaica and Venezuela have soils of indeterminate age. Taken together these results show that nutrient limitation is widespread in montane soils (all sites have responded to at least one nutrient) and that the particular nutrient(s) that limit(s) production may differ for explicable reasons. First results from lowland forests on sandy soils in Kalimantan show N or simultaneous N and P limitation. Many more experiments, especially in lowland forests, are needed to test our speculation that P usually limits productivity in tropical lowland rain forests and that N limits productivity in tropical montane rain forests.",431,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,"Fertilization experiments | Forests in Hawai'i, Jamaica, and Venezuela | Growth limitation | Montane cf. lowland forests | Nitrogen | Nutrient limitation of forest growth | Nutrients | Phosphorus | Soil age and nutrient limitation | Tropical montane rain forest productivity",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,250,NA,NA
