An evolutionary tendency to floral reduction has led to anemophily, with pollens ranging from large (e.g. corn, Zea mays) to very small (e.g. tribes Poae and Avenae). This family produces a large number of pollens per panicle. The early morning production of free pollen (before 8 am) enhances allergic problems. In contrast, in rice (Oryza sativa) most pollen is liberated near mid day, which favours long range dispersal because of more appropriate environmental temperature and humidity. This can explain why rice is the first cause of allergic sensitivization in the asthmatic patients of the Costa Rican driest provinces (Guanacaste and Puntarenas).

The single dose treatment with 10%, 50% or 100% latex and the multiple dose treatment with dilutions between 5% and 10%, have a healing effect but only on males.

Their reproductive behaviour consequently is governed by the ability to conceive, spontaneous intrauterine mortality and child spacing (due to prolonged breast-feeding and sexual abstinence).

The amplitude of the blood pressure rise was dose dependent. The increase was statistically significant (p < or = 0.01) at a concentration of 220 mOsm/l, and was associated with a significant heart rate decrease (p < or = 0.01) probably secondary to barorreceptor stimuli. The application of 130 mOsm/l of the extract did not produce a significant increase in blood pressure, which was followed by a rapid pressure normalization.
