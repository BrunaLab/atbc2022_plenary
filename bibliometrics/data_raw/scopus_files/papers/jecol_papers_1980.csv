Hedges were aged using maps dating back to 1630 AD. The number of woody species increased by approximately one a century. It is concluded that the number of woody species in hedges is of less value in dating than has been assumed, and should only by used for dating groups of hedges when a local relationship has been established empirically between age and number of species.- from Author",16,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,1

Results showed that concentrations of lead and copper were high in the shoots and roots and in the lake sediments, but were low in the lake waters. Positive correlations were found between the metal concentrations in submerged shoots and in the underlying sediments from a range of sample sites; no correlations were found between concentrations in shoots and in lake-water samples, however. The findings are discussed and interpreted in the light of recent experimental data on translocation of metals by submerged water plants. It is concluded that the enrichment of metals in the shoots is largely derived from the high metal concentrations in the sediments. Two pathways for the transfer of metals from the sediments to the shoots are apparent. Lead accumulation in the shoots is considered to be the result of adsorption from the water. Copper accumulation, on the other hand, is considered to be due mainly to absorption by the roots and translocation within the plant to the shoots; direct adsorption from the water into the shoots can also occur.",85,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,2
