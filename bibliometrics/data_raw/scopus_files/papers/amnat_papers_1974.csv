In the fouling community at Beaufort, North Carolina, the order of larval recruitment determined which species monopolized the available space during initial community development. In other systems, community structure could be explained only by referring to the specific historical events which determined the presence or absence of important consumers. Since history was relevant to the observed community structure, multiple stable points are an undeniable reality in space and time in these systems."

The model analytically incorporates effects of any differential fecundity and viability associated with different primary sex ratios. Computer simulation based upon the model confirms, for the most part, MacArthur's prediction that evolution will produce a sex ratio that maximizes the product of the number of daughters in the population times the number of sons in the population. Some exceptions to MacArthur's principle are noted, arising from certain kinds of dominance relations at the modifier locus. Analysis of the effects of differential viability shows that the stage in the life cycle to which MacArthur's principle applies is that stage at which male mortality and female mortality both cease to differ between families possessing different sex ratios. In particular, as previously shown by Shaw and Mohler, differences in viability that depend solely upon an individual's sex have no effect upon the primary sex ratio and cannot, by themselves, be invoked as an explanation for non one to one primary sex ratios. Some possible sources of differential fecundity and viability capable of producing unequal primary sex ratios are discussed."

BALB/c and C57BL were usually extreme and C3H intermediate. This applies to open field activity, exploratory activity, open field emotionality, and temperature preference. The same was found for weight, skeletal divergence, body temperature, and abdominal hair density. Since skeletal variants must be associated with variants of the muscular, nervous, and vascular systems, associated behavioral variants leading to overall behavioral phenotypes are likely. None of these traits showed heterosis, and they are probably controlled by stabilizing selection. For learning as measured in a conditioned avoidance apparatus, the above sequence of strains was not found, and sequences varied according to the mode of assessing learning. Heterosis was found, indicating directional selection for higher fitness, that is, greater learning ability. Heterosis was also found for long tails, there being little difference between inbred strains for tail length. Hence the two traits showing a component of directional selection as shown by heterosis are exceptional for the ordering of the inbred strains."

These results explain the observed equilibria of frequencies of SR in natural populations, and suggest that, at least in the case of D. pseudoobscura, male fertility may be partly limited by the number of sperm males can produce."

The theory is deterministic and is based on the implicit assumption that all genes are so numerous that sampling fluctuations need not be considered. It is shown that if heterozygotes carrying a new mutant gene differ in viability from the wild type in at least one subpopulation, conditions for survival of this gene are the same as those that have been given for instability of the trivial equilibrium associated with the gene being absent in all subpopulations. It is also shown for a model of Levene (1953), that the condition for survival of a recessive gene is the same as the condition for instability of the equilibrium associated with the absence of the gene from all subpopulations. The survival probability in a large population is of a much smaller order of magnitude than it would be if the mutant gene showed some dominance. This difference is not evident in deterministic treatments of the problem."

Under the premise that genes evolve in correlated blocks, a matrix of correlations in heterozygosities among loci for each study was analyzed by varimax rotated principal components to discern independent trends of variation. Step wise multiple regression was used to relate these trends to measures of within year environmental variability, computed from climate summaries of the United States Weather Bureau. Over the eight sets of data analyzed, including both poikilotherm and homeotherm data, approximately 70% of the geographic variation in heterozygosities could be accounted for by these measures of temporal variation. Therefore, patterns of geographic variation in heterozygosities, for statistically correlated ensembles of loci, may represent adaptive shifts in response to changes in variability of specific components of the environment."
