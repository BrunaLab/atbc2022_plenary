Fire temperatures and energy release were reduced by grazing. In the absence of burning, mowing (simulating heavy grazing) increased the likelihood that a patch would be regrazed and caused persistent reductions in the residual biomass remaining in a patch at the end of the growing season. Mowing did not influence patch utilization or residual biomass when pastures were burned. Thus, the effects of fire on grassland N budgets were modified by grazing, and the effects of grazing on the patch structure of grasslands were modified by fire. -from Authors",198,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Plants were subjected to light grazing pressure by a generalist-feeding North American grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes. Pregrazing net C-fixation rates, translocation rates, and C-storage pools were identical for the two ecotypes. After grazing, overall C-fixation rates were 39% higher for GA plants, and remained higher than NGA rates throughout the experiment. Removal of <10% of initial green-leaf biomass by grazing at each grazing period produced major differences in carbon flux between the samples. Throughout the experiment GA plants produced and stored more C in leaves, stored less C in stem sinks, had higher phloem activity, and translocated more of the labile C to roots where it was stored in higher quantities. This suggests that storage of labile C reserves in sinks or pools readily accessible to the plant, which allows rapid mobilization after grazing, is an important element of adaptation to grazing. More storage of labile reserves in stems, characteristic of the NGA plants, may be advantageous in ungrazed habitats where there is vertical growth due to canopy closure and competition for light, but such storage makes those reserves accessible to grazers. -from Authors",90,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,11,NA,NA

Dated fire scars revealed 82 fire years, with the earliest dated to 1593. Islands experienced more fire years (56) than the lakeshore (37), and fire years were uncorrelated. Most (72%) of the lakeshore stands were initiated by a few large fires (eight), whereas fire size on islands was variable, ranging from <10% to 100% of the total surface of the island. Fire occurrence and fire frequency decreased concurrently on the islands and the lakeshore starting c120 yr ago. The lakeshore fire cycle was 63 yr before 1870 and 99 yr since 1870, whereas the fire cycle on the islands was slightly longer (74 yr and 112 yr) during the same intervals. The long-term decrease in fire frequency of both the lakeshore and the islands was possibly driven by climatic change. Fire frequency was generally similar for all surficial deposits and fuel types on the lakeshore, whereas fires were more abundant in pine woodland growing on bedrock on the islands. Lakeshore fires were generally of lethal intensity, whereas both a long cycle of lethal fires and a shorter cycle of non-lethal fires were observed on 50% of the islands. The morphology and location of islands with both types of fires suggest that a higher frequency of lightning strikes resulted in a regime characterized by more frequent fires and fires of variable intensity. The specific fire regime observed in the island landscape may be the cause of the abundance of pines, whose presence may contribute, in turn, to the continuation of this regime of less intense and more frequent fires. It is suggested that fire regime in the boreal forest is controlled by long-term climate change at the regional scale, and by a strong interaction with landscape at the local scale. -from Author",243,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,13,NA,NA

However, the relationship between reproductive success and age, after statistically controlling for previous experience, showed instead that success increased linearly throughout an animal's lifetime. After statistically controlling for age, reproductive success was related to experience in a parabolic fashion; success increased with experience for the first few breeding attempts, but declined later in an animal's reproductive lifetime. Among young animals experience was apparently beneficial, but among old animals greater experience was deleterious. Timing of breeding was related to experience, rather than age, in a curvilinear fashion; arrival and parturition dates were later for inexperienced and very experienced females, and were earliest for moderately experienced animals. Young animals that gave birth later in the season experienced reduced reproductive success; no such decline was noted in older animals. Thus, among young females, arriving and giving birth earlier each year was adaptive. Age-related senescence may be due to reproductive ""burn-out'.

A common explanation for this morphology-microhabitat association is that species differing in morphology also differ in vulnerability to predators, that microhabitat structure affects predation risk, and that animals preferentially forage in the safest microhabitats. This was tested for two bipedal and three quadrupedal species (matched by body size) by quantifying effects of habitat and illumination on activity and on risk of predation by great horned owls Bubo virginianus. Capture frequencies were lower for all heteromyid species than for the cricetid Peromyscus maniculatus. Heteromyid activity was lower in open habitat and under bright illumination. Illumination had no significant effect on risk, perhaps because rodents changed activity patterns under full moon to compensate for a potential increment in risk. All species were attacked and captured more frequently in the open. Bipedal species were attacked relatively more in the open than were quadrupeds. Bipedal heteromyids, however, escaped owl attacks more frequently than did quadrupeds of equivalent size. They may experience lower overall risk if owls preferentially attack more easily captured prey species when given a choice.

SMW is a simple yet sensitive method for locating discontinuities that may exist within multivariate, serial data (ordered in one dimension) at various scales relative to the length of the data series. However, SMW is subjective and relative, and therefore locates apparent discontinuities even within random, serial data. The authors present two nonparametric methods for determining the statistical significance of discontinuities detected by SMW, a Monte Carlo method for determining the statistical significance of scale-dependent discontinuities (significant relative to only one scale), and a nonparametric, scale-independent method (also dependent upon scale size, but to a much lesser degree) that is more appropriate for locating statistically significant discontinuities that separate different, relative homogeneous groups of varying size along a series.

A. longimana was more abundant on Dictyota and Sargassum (both unpalatable to omnivorous fishes), than on Hypnea, Chondria and Calonitophyllum (all of which are palatable to fishes).

Increasing the number of donor Palicourea flowers significantly increased the absolute amount of pollen transferred but did not overcome the negative effect of Cephaelis. Pollen transfer among Besleria flowers also declined with the intervention of Cephaelis flowers; the decline was less strongly significant than for Palicourea, perhaps because pollen loads on stigmas of some female Besleria flowers can contain self pollen left over from their male phase. Despite its demonstrability in the laboratory, however, competition among individual plants varies in its ability to explain density dependence in pollination among plant populations in the field.

During the study, the Pacific Northwest experienced precipitation extremes, with the driest bioyear (October-April) in 65 yr of records (1976-1977) followed by one of the wettest. Within each breeding season daily temperature and precipitation fluctuated widely and in most cases unpredictably over a scale of a few days. Both species achieved significantly greater final reproductive success (number of fledglings produced) in wetter, presumably more biologically productive years. In Brewer's sparrows this was achieved through higher clutch sizes in wetter years, whereas sage sparrows had higher hatching rates. For sage sparrows, within-year weather variables accounted for a significant amount of variation in reproductive parameters beyond that statistically explained by bioyear precipitation alone, but in Brewer's sparrows addition of within-year weather variables was not significant, and thus this species appeared buffered from the effects of short-term variation in abiotic conditions. Clutch-size variation in Brewer's sparrows may represent adaptive flexibility, the ability to assess potentially favorable environmental conditions and adjust reproductive investment accordingly. In sage sparrows the association between bioyear precipitation and final reproductive success seemed most likely to be a proximate consequence of resource availability at the time of oogenesis, and to be further modified by the effects of weather that each nest experienced. -from Authors",90,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,91,NA,NA

A benefit of higher tempo (enhanced ability to provision brood) is better realized owing to the greater brood-rearing capacity of their nests.

This equalization of mean profitabilities of floral rewards results from the actions of nectar-collecting foragers. Risk-sensitive diet choice can therefore be based solely on the variances of the foraging alternatives. The author manipulated the energy requirements of bumble bee colonies (Bombus melanopygus, B. mixtus, B. sitkensis) by draining or enhancing their honey pots, then censused foragers from these colonies on the 2 flower species. If bees were risk sensitive in their diet choice, they should have increased their relative use of the more variable flower type (dwarf huckleberry) when their colonies were nectar depleted compared to when their colonies were nectar enhanced. This was indeed the case. Wild-foraging bumble bees thus appear to be sensitive to both the mean and the variance of the energy rewards offered by alternative flower species, and this sensitivity is affected by colony energy requirements. Results suggest that wild foragers may change their risk sensitivity. -from Author",61,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,127,NA,NA

Pollinator visitation rates were influenced more by differences in petal length than by differences in flower number per inflorescence.

For P. rugelii, the performance (leaf biomass) of the 2 neighboring progeny depended on maternal background nutrient levels. -from Authors",48,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,145,NA,NA

Probability distributions of age and density are derived from the distribution of regeneration niches on a landscape and the thinning rates of cohorts on patches created by adult mortality or larger disturbances. The theory is extended to different types of disturbances that operate at different scales and are interdependent, eg treefalls that only become important as the early-successional trees that initially colonize an area affected by a larger scale disturbance become mature. In general, landscapes that provide frequent regeneration niches support high-density young stands. Density distributions are negatively skewed. Decreasing frequency of regeneration niches results in lower mean density, higher variance, and increased (less negative) skewness. When regeneration niches are rare, density is low, variance is low, skewness is positive, and the age classes are highly variable. In more complex cases, regeneration niches may depend on the time since the last large disturbance; eg canopy gaps can become more frequent as postfire cohorts become senescent.

Some 42% of plants occurred on dead, decaying wood (mostly standing dead trees); the remainder occurred on live trees. Substrate type and canopy openness are correlated because dead trees present no canopy to shade epiphytes on them. Differences in sex ratio due to forest type resulted from a more frequent occurrence of plants on standing dead trees in the young forest. C. viridiflavum on dead, decaying wood flowered more often than those on live trees, but no significant effect due to canopy openness was detected. The influence of substrate and light availability on estimated rates of vegetative growth varied from year to year, but increased rates were associated with either dead, decaying wood or high light intensities in at least 1 yr. Thus, explanations for the evolution of environmental sex deternmination in C. viridiflavum must include potential effects of both substrate type and light environment on male and female reproductive success. Plants growing on dead, decaying wood in an open habitat that produced fruit exhibited reduced vegetative growth compared to nonfruiting plants, indicating there is long-term cost to fruit production. In forest habitats, females setting fruit on live trees did not flower in the following year.

The author analyzed the regional distribution and temporal dynamics of plant species across 19 sites in tallgrass prairie (Kansas) over an 8-yr period. Spatial patterns of species regional distribution were bimodal each year, a pattern in accord with the core-satellite hypothesis. Temporal patterns of species distribution within a site were also bimodal. The dynamics of the core-satellite hypothesis are driven by patterns of immigration and extinction. Extinction was positively related to richness, but in contrast to the theory of island biogeography, immigration was not related to species richness. The variances in the differences in species frequencies from one year to the next were greater than 3 × the mean, a condition necessary for bimodality in the core-satellite model, for 88 of 135 (65.1%) species. Results provide strong support in favor of the core-satellite hypothesis and imply that stochastic factors may be the primary determinant of plant species dynamics and plant community structure in grasslands at the scale of several kilometres.

These populations apparently continue to grow well, since the greatest rhizome and aerial stem biomass occurred in 13- to 18-yr-old clearcuts with no overstory trees. Rhizome density of salmonberry populations, as well as rhizome and aerial stem biomass, was significantly and negatively related to the basal area of overstory trees. Salmonberry clones in alder stands were larger (18 m total rhizome) than those in conifer stands and on riparian sites (5-6 m rhizome). Clones in alder stands also produced more ramets and more aerial stems than those in conifer and riparian stands. -from Authors",87,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,167,NA,NA

Spawning in the littoral zone continued throughout the year, but larvae survived only when rotifer densities exceeded 100 individuals/L, which occurred predictably during late seasonal mixing. Steady mortality (15%/mo) of spawning fish occurred through predation. Catastrophic mortality of all fish occurred through anoxia during early seasonal mixing (57%/mo for 2 months). Xenomelaniris showed a strong ontogenetic shift in diet from rotifers during early development to copepods and Chaoborus. Daily rations ranged from 28% of dry body mass in the smallest fish to 10% in the largest. Although Xenomelaniris was the only planktivore and was capable of consuming all major zooplankton taxa, it consumed only 3.6% of zooplankton production because it was never sufficiently abundant to exploit its food resource fully. Total growth of adult Xenomelaniris conformed to the same equation as somatic growth of juveniles; growth potential was diverted increasingly to reproduction as the fish aged. Young adult fish showed 66% assimilation efficiency and 11% growth efficiency. The annual ratio of production to biomass was high (4.0), reflecting food sufficiency, a long growing season, and continuous loss of older fish to spawning mortality. Annual fresh-mass production of Xenomelaniris (31 kg/ha) is a small proportion of primary production (<0.03%) and of zooplankton production (3.6%); energy budgets show that actual Xenomelaniris production is only 1/3 of potential production given the observed zooplankton production and the measured growth efficiency of Xenomelaniris. The explanation of this trophic bottleneck is larval mortality, which prevents the population from reaching carrying capacity and thus blocks energy flow between zooplankton and pelagic fish. -from Authors",7,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,170,NA,NA

Plants that had ψ1 flowers removed by herbivores grew significantly larger and produced significantly more flowers than plants that lost no flowers, regardless of treatment. -from Authors",60,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,188,NA,NA
