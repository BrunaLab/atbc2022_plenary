We determined male-specific fitness consequences of floral phenotype in andromonoecious Solanum carolinense, examined the relationship between male and female reproductive success within plants, and evaluated the distribution of functional gender among plants. A maximum likelihood-based paternity analysis, based on multilocus allozyme phenotypes of parents and offspring from four experimental plots, was used to determine male reproductive success and its relationship to floral phenotype. Male success was enhanced by an increase in the proportion of male flowers produced but not by an increase in total flower number, even though all flowers contain male parts. Larger flower size increased male success in only one plot. Male and female reproductive success were negatively correlated, and plants varied in functional gender from completely female to completely male. This gender specialization may occur because hermaphroditic and male flowers differ in their ability to contribute to male and female success. Although sex allocation theory predicts a positive relationship between the size or number of plant parts and reproductive success, this study indicates that aspects of floral morphology that affect gender specialization should also be considered.",75,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Andromonoecy | Bateman's principle | Functional gender | Paternity analysis | Sex allocation | Solanum carolinense,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,1

To understand how ecological specialization evolves, we must know the particular characters that cause organisms to be specialized. For example, most theories of specialization in herbivorous insects emphasize physiological trade-offs in response to toxic plant chemicals. However, even in herbivores, it is likely that other characters are also involved in resource specialization. Knowing the causes of ecological specialization is also crucial for linking specialization to speciation. When the same character(s) that cause specialization also influence assortative mating, speciation may occur particularly rapidly because specialization and reproductive isolation become coupled in a positive feedback that speeds the evolution of both. Indeed, a central hypothesis in the study of ecological speciation is that specialization in recently diverged taxa may often be due to characters that also produce assortative mating. We test this hypothesis by evaluating the causes of ecological specialization among host-associated populations of an herbivorous insect, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum). These populations are highly specialized on different host plants (alfalfa or clover; ""alternate hosts""), and the races are partially reproductively isolated. Here, we identify key characters responsible for host plant specialization. Our results suggest that the major proximal determinant of host specialization is the behavioral acceptance of a plant rather than the toxicity of the food source. Pea aphids rapidly assess alfalfa and clover and reject the alternate host based on chemical cues that are perceived before the initiation of feeding. This rapid behavioral rejection of the alternate host by a given race has two consequences. First, unrestrained aphids quickly leave the alternate host and search for other plants. Because pea aphids mate on their host plants, divergence in host acceptance among ecologically specialized races leads to congregation on the favored host. This results in de facto assortative mating when sexual forms are produced in late summer. Second, specialized aphids that are held on the alternate host will not feed in a 7.2-h trial, even in the face of starvation. Thus, a complex trait, behavioral acceptance of a plant as host, influences both reproductive isolation (through host-associated assortative mating) and ecological specialization (because of low nutritional uptake on the alternate host). This dual influence of feeding behavior on both assortative mating and resource specialization is central to the maintenance of these divergent races, and it may also have been involved in their origin.",185,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Ecological speciation | Host races | Insect-plant interactions | Local adaptation | Sympatric speciation | Trade-offs,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,2

Legumes are unable to consistently recognize parasitic rhizobia that, once established inside plant cells, use plant resources for their own reproduction rather than for N2 fixation. Evolution of parasitism in rhizobia, driven partly by competition among multiple rhizobial strains infecting the same plant, may be countered by post-infection legume sanctions. Both the biochemical options for rhizobial cheating and the evolutionary effect of legume sanctions depend on differences in rhizobial life history associated with nodule type. In legumes with determinate nodule growth, rhizobia typically retain the ability to reproduce after differentiating into N2-fixing bacteroids. Sanctions against individual bacteroids (e.g., acid hydrolases) would therefore select for cooperative rhizobia. In nodules with indeterminate growth, bacteroids generally lose the ability to reproduce, so legume sanctions against bacteroids would have no effect on rhizobial evolution. Whole-nodule sanctions (e.g., decreased nodule O2 permeability) could be effective, via kin selection of undifferentiated rhizobia that persist in indeterminate nodules and replenish soil populations after nodule senescence.

Overall group size and productivity affect each of the measures somewhat differently depending on their formulation. Some of the differences are due to whether the index is intended to measure skew relative to a random distribution or relative to the maximum possible skew. Sampling errors, however, will tend to make smaller and less productive groups seem more skewed than they actually are. Differential survival or residence times of group members add a second factor that can result in skew independent of behavioral mechanisms. Thus, significant biases can result in indices that do not account for random processes or differential survival within groups. Seven published skew indices plus a new index (B) that combines observed variance with the expected binomial variance were tested across simulations that compared groups varying in resource distribution probabilities, size, or productivity. Only the B index always avoided error through correctly adjusting for group size, productivity, and differential residence times. Thus, the B index has the best potential to be a benchmark value that can be used for identifying evolutionary patterns in social behavior, both across and especially within species.

Two prevailing thoughts are that such incompatibilities often result from epistatically interacting genes that act as loss-of-function alleles in hybrid backgrounds or from chromosomal rearrangements that result in mis-segregation during meiosis in hybrids. However, it is unclear how genes that cause a radical breakdown in hybrids arise without reducing fitness within species, and numerous cases of speciation appear to be unassociated with obvious chromosomal rearrangements. Here we suggest that duplicate genes, and more generally any kind of genomic redundancies, provide a powerful substrate for the origin of genomic incompatibilities in isolated populations. The divergent resolution of genomic redundancies, such that one population loses function from one copy while the second population loses function from a second copy at a different chromosomal location, leads to chromosomal repatterning such that gametes produced by hybrid individuals can be completely lacking in functional genes for a duplicate pair. Under this model, incompatibility factors accumulate with essentially no loss of fitness within populations as postulated under the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) model of speciation and despite the fact that they arise from degenerative mutations. However, unlike the situation often envisioned under the BDM model, no change in the mode of gene action in hybrid backgrounds need be invoked. The plausibility of this model derives from a number of recent observations, including the fact that most genomes harbor substantial numbers of gene duplicates whose turnover is common and ongoing process and the fact that many genes have complex regulatory regions that facilitate their divergent resolution in sister taxa.",246,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Complementation | Gene duplication | Gene expression patterns | Genomic redundancy | Reproductive incompatibility | Speciation,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,7

The growth trajectories of competing individual plants were depicted by logistic difference equations that incorporated basic costs (lowered growth rate) and benefits (lowered damage) of defense. Analytical results showed that when competition is absent, resistance is favored by high damage, low cost, and slow growth rate. Competition makes selection more complex. When herbivore damage reduces the size of a susceptible plant, resistant neighbors can usurp its resources and thus suppress its regrowth. This competitive interaction amplifies the relative fitness of the resistants. Numerical simulations explored a broader range of conditions. Three factors were varied: competition mode (symmetric vs. asymmetric), resistance type (damage avoidance vs. damage reduction), and timing of attack (early, mid, or late season). We found that competition mode had drastic effects on outcomes. Under symmetric competition, increased plant density intensified the selective advantage of resistance, damage avoidance was more strongly favored than damage reduction, and resistance to late attack was more favored than to early attack. Asymmetric competition had opposite effects: selection acted against resistance at high density, damage reduction was more strongly favored, and resistance against early attack was more favored. Interestingly, the two competition modes induced opposite patterns of density-dependent selection. The difference between the symmetric and asymmetric cases is explained by the fact that resistance costs during the preattack phase are more strongly amplified by asymmetric competition. When resistance is induced, so that pre-attack costs of resistance are zero, asymmetric competition more strongly amplified the benefits during the postattack phase. The prediction that selection on resistance will be plant density-dependent has complex implications for the evolutionary dynamics of defense evolution.",43,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Competition | Costs of resistance | Herbivory | Model | Plants | Resistance,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,12

Using a dynamical model where grazers adjust their foraging activity and emigration rate to the densities of predators and producers, we explored how changes in control variables (predator density, grazer immigration, and producer immigration and carrying capacity) affect the dynamics of producers and grazers at temporal scales shorter than consumer and predator reproduction. The model predicts that producer biomass increases and that both the density of foraging grazers and the feeding rate of predators decrease with predator density. These predictions hold although total (foraging + nonforaging) grazer density may actually increase with predator density. The latter will occur whenever the benefit of higher resource density outweighs the increased risk of predation. In this case, per capita grazer emigration decreases with predator density, which might be misinterpreted as a direct 'freezing' response to predators. Increased grazer immigration is predicted to result in decreased producer density and increased densities of both foraging and total grazers, as well as increased grazer emigration and predator feeding rates. Increased producer immigration or carrying capacity should increase producer and grazer densities and predator feeding rate but decrease per capita grazer emigration. Manipulation of predator (trout) densities in a set of nine large (50 m2) stream channels produced results in broad agreement with model predictions.

However, their effects remain localized because initially high rates of reinvasive spread were short lived, despite widespread habitat availability. We experimentally tested whether insect herbivores, by reducing plant growth and fecundity at the edge of the expanding lupine population, could curtail the rate of reinvasion and whether those herbivores had comparable impacts in the older, more successionally advanced core region. We found that removing insect herbivores increased both the areal growth of individual lupine plants and the production of new plants in the edge region, thereby accelerating the lupine's intrinsic rate of increase at the front of the lupine reinvasion. We found no such impacts of herbivory in the core region, where low plant quality or a complex of recently arrived natural enemies may hold herbivores in check. In the context of invasion theory, herbivore-mediated decreases in lupine population growth rate in the edge region translate into decreased rates of lupine spread, which we quantify here using diffusion models. In the Mount St. Helens system, decreased rate of lupine reinvasion will result in reductions in rates of soil formation, nitrogen input, and entrapment of seeds and detritus that are likely to postpone or alter trajectories of primary succession. If the type of spatial subtleties in herbivore effects we found here are common, with herbivory focused on the edge of an expanding plant population and suppressed or ineffective in the larger, denser central region (where the plants might be more readily noticed and studied), then insect herbivores may have stronger impacts on the dynamics of primary succession and plant invasions than previously recognized.",106,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Colonization | Herbivory | Invasion | Lupine | Mount St. Helens | Primary succession,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,19

Within treatments, rate of egg production and egg size are negatively correlated among females in the low-temperature groups but not in the high-temperature groups; the correlations among females are also characterized by a decrease in egg size, with an increase in total egg mass production.

However, host-parasitoid systems in the field show a range of patterns in percent parasitism, while behavioral studies indicate that hosts and parasitoids can exhibit contrary choices (i.e., hosts avoid patches favored by the parasitoid). We extend previous theory by permitting life-history traits of the parasitoid as well as the host to vary among patches. Our analysis implies that in coevolutionarily stable populations, hosts preferentially select patches that intrinsically support higher host equilibrium numbers (i.e., the equilibrium number achieved by hosts when both populations are confined to a single patch) and that parasitoids preferentially select patches that intrinsically support higher parasitoid equilibrium numbers (i.e., the equilibrium number achieved by the parasitoids when both populations are confined to a patch). Using this result, we show how variation in life-history traits among patches leads to contrary or congruent choices or leads to direct density dependence, inverse density dependence, or density independence in the distribution of percent parasitism.

The main goal is to determine the conditions under which competition for resources results in disruptive selection (i.e., selection favoring a polymorphism) since it is this form of selection that will give rise to the evolutionary diversification of resource exploitation strategies. In particular, comparing the conditions giving rise to disruptive selection when the two patches are identical to the conditions when they contain different resources reveals the effect of spatial resource heterogeneity. Results show that when the patches are identical, the conditions giving rise to disruptive selection are identical to those that give rise to character displacement in previous models. When the patches are different, the conditions giving rise to disruptive selection can be either more or less stringent depending upon demographic parameters such as the intrinsic rate of increase and the migration rate. Surprisingly, spatial resource heterogeneity can actually make forms of evolutionary diversification such as character displacement less likely.

We study the interplay between cannibalism and competition using a size-structured population model in which all individuals consume a shared resource but in which larger ones may cannibalize smaller conspecifics. In this model, intercohort competition causes single-cohort cycles when cannibalism is absent. Moderate levels of cannibalism reduce intercohort competition, enabling coexistence of many cohorts. More voracious cannibalism, in combination with competition, produces large-amplitude cycles and a bimodal population size distribution with many small and few giant individuals. These coexisting 'dwarfs' and 'giants' have very different life histories, resulting from a reversal in importance of cannibalism and competition. The population structure at time of birth determines whether individuals suffer severe cannibalism, with the few survivors reaching giant sizes, or whether they suffer intense intracohort competition, with all individuals remaining small.

We investigated effects of enrichment (increasing carrying capacity, K, of the resource) on a system consisting of a resource (R), an intermediate consumer (N), and an omnivore (P) using a general mathematical model and tested the relevance of some of its predictions to a laboratory system of mixed bacteria (=R) and the ciliates Tetrahymena (=N) and Blepharisma (=P). The model produced six major predictions. First, N may facilitate or inhibit P. Enrichment may revert the net effect of N on P from facilitation to inhibition. Second, along a gradient of K, up to four regions of invasibility and stable coexistence of N and P may exist. At the lowest K, only R is present. At somewhat higher K, N can coexist with R. At intermediate K, either N and P coexist, or either consumer excludes the other depending on initial conditions. At the highest K, N may be excluded through apparent competition and only R and P can coexist. The pattern of persistence of Tetrahymena and Blepharisma along an enrichment gradient conformed fairly well to the scenario allowing coexistence at intermediate K. Third, for stable equilibria of the omnivory system, R always increases and N always decreases with K. The abundances of bacteria and Tetrahymena were suggestive of such a pattern but did not allow a strict test because coexistence occurred at only one level of enrichment. Fourth, an omnivore can invade an R-N system at a lower K than an otherwise identical specialist predator of N. Fifth, an omnivore can always invade a food chain with such a specialist predator. Sixth, over ranges of K where both omnivory systems and otherwise identical three-level food chains are feasible, N is always less abundant in the omnivory system, whereas the relative abundances of R and P in omnivory systems compared to food chains may change with K. It is thus possible that total community biomass at a given K is lower in an omnivory system than in a food chain.

The two types, designated L and S, differ conspicuously in the size of the colonies they form on agar plates as well as the size of their individual cells, and these differences are heritable. The S type reached a detectable frequency (>1%) at generation 6,000, and it remained above that frequency throughout the subsequent generations. In addition to morphological differences, L and S diverged in important ecological properties. With clones isolated at 18,000 generations, L has a maximal growth rate in fresh medium that is ~20% higher than that of S. However, experiments with conditioned media demonstrate that L and S secrete one or more metabolites that promote the growth of S but not of L. The death rate of L during stationary phase also increases when S is abundant, which suggests that S may either secrete a metabolite that is toxic to L or remove some factor that enables the survival of L. One-day competition experiments with the clones isolated at generation 18,000 show that their relative fitness is frequency dependent, with each type having an advantage when rare. When these two types are grown together for a period of several weeks, they converge on an equilibrium frequency that is consistent with the 1-d competition experiments.

For the digestion problem of hydrolysis and absorption in series, I suggest as a first approximation that a tubular gut of length L and diameter D comprises n = L/D tanks in series. For n ≥ 10, there is little difference between performance of the nCSTR model and an ideal PFR in the coupled tasks of hydrolysis and absorption. Relatively thinner and longer guts, characteristic of animals feeding on poorer forage, prove more efficient in both conversion and absorption by restricting axial mixing. In the same total volume, they also give a higher rate of absorption. I then asked how a fixed number of absorptive sites should be distributed among the n compartments.

In the case of simple plant-herbivore interactions, such an effect can result from recycling of a limiting nutrient. However, in more complex cases, herbivory can also lead to species replacement in plant communities, which in turn alters how primary production is affected by herbivory. Here we explore this issue using a model of a limiting nutrient cycle in an ecosystem with two plant species. We show that two major plant traits determine primary production at equilibrium: plant recycling efficiency (i.e., the fraction of the plant nutrient stock that stays within the ecosystem until it is returned to the nutrient pool in mineral form) and plant ability to deplete the soil mineral nutrient pool through consumption of this resource. In cases where sufficient time has occurred, grazing optimization requires that herbivory improve nutrient conservation in the system sufficiently. This condition sets a minimum threshold for herbivore nutrient recycling efficiency, the fraction of nutrient consumed by herbivores that is recycled within the ecosystem to the mineral nutrient pool. This threshold changes with plant community composition and herbivore preference and is, therefore, strongly affected by plant species replacement. The quantitative effects of these processes on grazing optimization are determined by both the recycling efficiencies and depletion abilities of the plant species. However, grazing optimization remains qualitatively possible even with plant species replacement.",45,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Boreal forests | Grazing optimization | Nutrient cycling | Nutrient inputs and outputs | Primary production | Turnover rates,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,47

By placing this alga on its carapace, the crab behaviorally sequesters the defensive chemicals of the plant and gains protection from omnivorous consumers. However, Dictyota is absent north of North Carolina, whereas Libinia occurs as far north as New England. Crabs from three northern locations where Dictyota is absent (Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Jersey) camouflaged to match their environment, rather than selectively accumulating any one species. When D. menstrualis was offered to crabs from northern sites, they did not distinguish between it and other seaweeds for camouflage, whereas crabs from Alabama and two locations in North Carolina used D. menstrualis almost exclusively. In addition, in winter and spring, when Dictyota was seasonally absent in North Carolina, Libinia selectively camouflaged with the sun sponge Hymeniacidon heliophila, which was chemically unpalatable to local fishes. Thus, southern crabs were consistent specialists on chemically defended species for camouflage, while northern crabs were more generalized. The geographic shift in crab behavior away from specialization coincides with a reported decrease in both total predation pressure and the frequency of omnivorous consumers.

The studies covered a wide range of taxa in various terrestrial systems with varying degrees of species diversity. We quantified the average magnitude of direct effects of carnivores on herbivore prey and indirect effects of carnivores on plants. We examined how the effect magnitudes varied with type of carnivores in the study system, food web diversity, and experimental protocol. A meta-analysis of the data revealed that trophic cascades were common among the studies. Exceptions to this general trend did arise. In some cases, trophic cascades were expected not to occur, and they did not. In other cases, the direct effects of carnivores on herbivores were stronger than the indirect effects of carnivores on plants, indicating that top-down effects attenuated. Top-down effects usually attenuated whenever plants contained antiherbivore defenses or when herbivore species diversity was high. Conclusions about the strength of top-down effects of carnivores varied with the type of carnivore and with the plant-response variable measured. Vertebrate carnivores generally had stronger effects than invertebrate carnivores. Carnivores, in general, had stronger effects when the response was measured as plant damage rather than as plant biomass or plant reproductive output. We caution, therefore, that conclusions about the strength of top-down effects could be an artifact of the plant-response variable measured. We also found that mesocosm experiments generally had weaker effect magnitudes than open-plot field experiments or observational experiments. Trophic cascades in terrestrial systems, although not a universal phenomenon, are a consistent response throughout the published studies reviewed here. Our analysis thus suggests that they occur more frequently in terrestrial systems than currently believed.

Diversity is described by species number S and the variance of frequency or log abundance q(~). The frequency distribution of abundance is very generally lognormal, skewed to the left by immigration and resembling descriptions of natural communities. Increased immigration and community size always cause S to increase. Their effect on q(~) is more complicated, but given biologically reasonable assumptions, S and q(~) will be positively correlated in most circumstances. Larger samples contain more species; the graph of log S on log individuals, equivalent to a species-area curve, is generally convex upward but becomes linear with a slope of about +0.25 when immigration is low and births exceed deaths. When individuals invade a new, vacant environment, both S and q(~) increase through time.

Each population consisted of two demes inhabiting equal-sized habitat patches imbedded in a barren matrix area. We used a neutral two-allele allozyme marker to monitor gene flow. Initially, the two demes were genetically distinct and had different densities so that the size of a high-density deme (genotype bb) was four times larger than that of a low-density deme (genotype aa). The sex-specific dispersal pattern was in accordance with our prediction. Male dispersal was unconditional on deme-specific densities, and the majority of the first-generation males became dispersed from both demes, whereas female dispersal was strongly density dependent, so that dispersal took place exclusively from the high-density to the low-density deme. The demographic implication of this dispersal pattern was that the initial density difference between the demes was quickly canceled out. We built a mathematical model that predicted that the initially rare allele (a) would increase in frequency given the dispersal pattern, and this was supported by our experimental data. This result relies mostly on the density-independent male-dispersal strategy, which presumably stems from inbreeding avoidance.

Haldane argued that species' ranges could be set intraspecifically when gene flow from a species' populous center overwhelms local adaptation at the periphery. Recently, Kirkpatrick and Barton have modeled Haldane's process with a quantitative genetic model that combines density-dependent local population growth with dispersal and gene flow across a linear environmental gradient in optimum phenotype. To address Darwin's ideas, we have extended the Kirkpatrick and Barton model to include interspecific competition and the frequency-dependent selection that it generates, as well as stabilizing selection on a quantitative character. Our model includes local population growth, movements over space, natural selection, and gene flow. It simultaneously addresses the evolution of character displacement and species borders. It reproduces the Kirkpatrick and Barton single-species result that limited ranges can be produced with sufficiently steep environmental gradients and strong dispersal. Further, in the absence of environmental gradients or barriers to dispersal, interspecific competition will not limit species ranges at evolutionary equilibrium. However, interspecific competition can interact with environmental gradients and gene flow to generate limited ranges with much less extreme gradient and dispersal parameters than in the single species case. Species display character displacement in sympatry, yet the reduction in competition that results from this displacement does not necessarily allow the two species to become sympatric everywhere. When species meet, competition reduces population densities in the region of overlap, which, in turn, intensifies the asymmetry in gene flow from center to margin. This reduces the ability of each species to adapt to local physical conditions at their range limits. If environmental gradients are monotonic but not linear, the transition zone between species at coevolutionary equilibrium occurs where the environmental gradient is steepest.

Sutherland (American Naturalist 152:354-366), who consider evolutionarily stable territory acceptance rules for animals that face the decision between settling on a poor territory now (which is then retained for life) or waiting for better habitat to become available later (taking a chance of dying before reproducing). In contrast to these authors, we argue that the evolutionarily stable threshold quality above which territories are acceptable does depend on whether individuals compete for a single territory (queuing) or for multiple territories (floating) and also on whether access to territories is determined by a hierarchy among waiting individuals. More specifically, we show the following: First, if the choice is between floating and settling, the evolutionarily stable acceptance threshold is such that threshold territories yield an expected lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of 1 - μ(F), the survival probability of a floater. Second, if the choice is between queuing and settling, the evolutionarily stable threshold may correspond to any LRS between 1 - μ(F) and unity. Third, the number of nonbreeding individuals in the population is maximized at a threshold of unity. In other words, the evolutionarily stable threshold does not maximize the nonbreeding fraction of the population. We argue that models of territory choice should carefully specify the mechanism of choice because some choice processes (e.g., indiscriminate habitat use above the threshold) do not admit an evolutionarily stable acceptance rule.",34,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Evolutionarily stable strategy | Floating | Queuing | Seasonality | Small habitat selection | Territory acquisition,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,55

The joining decision has been modeled as a producer-scrounger game where the producer strategy consists of searching for one's food and the scrounger strategy consists of searching for food discovered by others. Previous models revealed that the evolutionarily stable proportion of scrounging mostly depends on the fraction of each food patch available only to its producer. These early models are static and state independent and are therefore unable to explore whether the time of day, the animal's state, and the degree of predation hazard influence an individual's decision of whether to use the producer or scrounger strategy. To investigate these issues, we developed a state-dependent dynamic producer-scrounger game model. The model predicts that, early in the day, low reserves promote a preference for the scrounger strategy, while the same condition late in the day favors the use of the producer strategy. Under rich and clumped food, the availability of scrounging can improve the daily survival of any average group member. The model suggests only weak effects of predation hazard on the use of scrounging.

As R. esculenta has to backcross constantly with R. lessonae in order to produce viable offspring, this coexistence is obligatory for R. esculenta. Since R. esculenta has a higher primary fitness than R. lessonae, a mechanism is required that prevents the hybrid from driving the parental species, and hence itself, to extinction. Here, we present an analytical model and a computer simulation that investigate whether assortative mating can operate as a such a control mechanism. Our results show that assortative mating is very effective in regulating coexistence in such a hybrid-host system. This is particularly true when choice is affected by the proportion of the two male types in the population. Furthermore, we could show that even if the species composition in a mixed hybrid-host population may be largely influenced by differences in life-history parameters, assortative mating still plays a very important role by stabilizing coexistence.

The hypothesis of exploitation ecosystems (EEH) belongs to the latter category and focuses particularly on the consequences of the high energetic costs of maintenance of endotherms. Carnivorous endotherms require relatively high prey densities in order to break even. Moreover, they are dependent on folivorous prey during the limiting season, at least at high latitudes. The endotherm branch of the grazing web is thus predicted to collapse from three-link trophic dynamics (carnivores → folivores → plants → inorganic resources) to two-link dynamics (folivores → plants → inorganic resources) along gradients of decreasing primary productivity. Consequently, the vegetation of cold and unproductive areas is predicted to be under intense winter grazing pressure, which prevents the accumulation of aboveground plant biomass and excludes erect woody plants. In the most extreme habitats (e.g., polar deserts and their high alpine counterparts), even folivorous endotherms are predicted to be absent, and the scanty vegetation is predicted to be structured by preemptive competition. Within temperature-determined productivity gradients, EEH is corroborated by biomass patterns, by patterns in the structure and dynamics of carnivore, folivore, and plant communities, and by experimental results. The general idea of top-down trophic dynamics is supported for other autotroph-based systems, too, but the relevance and sufficiency of the energy constraint in explaining patterns in trophic dynamics appears to be variable. Moreover, critical empirical evidence for or against the capacity of folivorous insects to regulate plant biomass has not yet been obtained. Another open question is the ability of boreal and temperate browsers, evolved in productive environments with intense predation pressure and abundance of forage, to prevent the regeneration of the least palatable tree species.

However, this view may overlook the potential for ocean flows themselves to generate distributional pattern. Here we explore this possibility in more detail using an extension of a coupled population dispersal model developed previously for benthic marine species with dispersing larvae. Results suggest that simple, common flow fields often observed in association with biogeographic boundaries worldwide may have the potential to constrain a species' geographic range, even when suitable habitat outside that range is abundant.

Predictions are that foods requiring a single hydrolytic step (e.g., disaccharides) yield ingestion rates that vary inversely with the concentration of food substrate ingested, whereas foods that require multiple hydrolytic and absorptive reactions proceeding in parallel (e.g., proteins) yield maximal ingestion rates at intermediate substrate concentrations. Counterintuitively, then, animals acting to maximize their absorption rates should show compensatory ingestion (more rapid feeding on food of lower concentration), except for the lower range of diet quality for complex diets and except for animals that show purely linear (passive) uptake. At their respective maxima in absorption rates, the PFR and BR yield only modestly higher rates of gain than the CSTR but do so at substantially lower rates of ingestion. All three ideal reactors show milder than linear reduction in rate of absorption when throughput or holding time in the gut is increased (e.g., by scarcity or predation hazard); higher efficiency of hydrolysis and extraction offset lower intake. Hence adding feeding costs and hazards of predation is likely to slow ingestion rates and raise absorption efficiencies substantially over the cost-free optima found here.",66,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Compensatory feeding | Digestion | Optimal foraging | Reactor theory | Symmorphosis,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,73

Mating systems have the potential to favor strong sex biases in dispersal because sex differences in potential reproductive success affect the balance between local resource competition and local mate competition: No bias is expected when local competition equally affects males and females, as happens in monogamous systems and also in polygynous or promiscuous ones as long as female fitness is limited by extrinsic factors (breeding resources). In contrast, a male-biased dispersal is predicted when local mate competition exceeds local resource competition, as happens under polygyny/promiscuity when female fitness is limited by intrinsic factors (maximal rate of processing resources rather than resources themselves). This bias is reinforced by among-sex interactions: female philopatry enhances breeding opportunities for related males, while male dispersal decreases the chances that related females will inbreed. These results meet empirical patterns in mammals: polygynous/promiscuous species usually display a male-biased dispersal, while both sexes disperse in monogamous species.

I construct a formal theory of intragroup conflict within the framework of transactional models by determining the maximum extent to which colony members can be selfish without destabilizing the group. The difference between the maximum value of the subordinate's fraction of group reproduction that the dominant can tolerate before ejecting the subordinate and the minimum value required by the subordinate to stay and cooperate peacefully in the group defines the 'window of selfishness,' which in turn predicts the frequency of within-group conflict. The window of selfishness tends to increase with increasing group reproductive output, increasingly harsh ecological constraints on solitary breeding, and, counterintuitively, increasing relatedness between subordinate and dominant. Increasing fighting ability of the subordinate can either widen or narrow the window of selfishness, the latter being most likely when ecological constraints on group living are strong. Although increasing relatedness is predicted to increase the rate of within-group aggression, the mean intensity of an aggressive act should decline, as predicted by the general theory of honest signaling between relatives and the tug-of-war models of within-group selfishness. In the bidding game, in which multiple dominants bid for the services of a subordinate, the window of selfishness is predicted to have zero width. A zero-width window of selfishness and low conflict also are predicted for saturated N-person groups, that is, groups whose total output is a concave function of group size and in which the dominant is not favored to admit additional subordinates.

Their analysis suggested that such testing should be more probable in groups that feature high skew and, hence, perhaps among closer relatives (because high relatedness favors high skew). Here we explore in more detail the possibility of dominance testing. Three models that differ in the outcome of fights over dominance are presented: in the first model, the loser of the challenge is killed; in the second model, the loser is evicted from the nest; and, in the third model, the loser becomes (or remains) subordinate. In each case we consider the independent effects of the parameters that determine skew (namely, relatedness, group productivity, and ecological constraints) on the predicted level of dominance testing. We then construct an amalgamated model to examine situations where fights may lead to any one of the three outcomes. Our analysis reveals that, in the majority of cases, higher relatedness will in fact lead to lower levels of aggression. Moreover, dominance testing need not be associated with high skew.

It is not always clear, however, if spatial and temporal variability leads to instability in communities. Instability may result from strong biotic interactions or from stochastic processes acting on small populations. 1 used 10-15 yr of annual data from the Konza Prairie Long-Term Ecological Research site to examine whether plant, breeding bird, grasshopper, and small mammal communities in tallgrass prairie exhibit stability or directional change in response to different experimentally induced fire frequencies. Based on ordination and ANOVA, plant and grasshopper communities on annually burned sites differed significantly from plant and grasshopper communities on less frequently burned sites. Breeding birds and small mammals differed among sites as well, but these differences were not clearly related to disturbance frequency. A modified time series analysis indicated that plant communities were undergoing directional change (unstable) on all watersheds, regardless of fire frequency. Contrary to expectations, directional change was greatest on the annually burned sites and lowest on the infrequently burned sites. Unlike the plant communities, breeding bird, grasshopper, and small mammal communities were temporally stable, despite high-compositional variability from 1 yr to the next. Stability among the consumer communities within these dynamic plant communities occurs because three-dimensional vegetation structure does not change over time, despite changes in plant species composition. Evidence suggests that instability in the plant community results from strong biotic interactions among temporally persistent core species and stochastic dynamics among infrequent satellite species. Overall, community stability cannot be assessed if the pattern of temporal dynamics is unknown.

When a secondary female abandons a nest, she creates an asymmetry in parental care between herself and the host. While models of asymmetry in reproductive allocation have focused directly on relatedness between females, we lack an appropriate theoretical framework that addresses the effects of relatedness on parental care asymmetry. Here, I present an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) model that predicts the conditions under which IBP is favored over cooperation and solitary breeding. Intraspecific brood parasitism is less likely to evolve (relative to cooperation and solitary breeding) as the relatedness between a host and parasite increases. It can evolve, however, if parasites achieve a high overall fecundity relative to solitary females. Constraints on solitary breeding can further promote IBP under some circumstances.

Subsequent treatments have challenged this view by pointing out that high environmental and nonadditive genetic contributions to phenotypic variation may also explain the low heritability of fitness traits. Analysis of a large data set from the collared flycatcher Ficedula albicollis confirmed a previous finding that traits closely associated with fitness tend to have lower heritability. However, analysis of coefficients of additive genetic variation (CV(A)) revealed that traits closely associated with fitness had higher levels of additive genetic variation (V(A)) than traits more distantly associated with fitness. Hence, the negative relationship between a trait's association with fitness and its heritability was not due to lower levels of V(A) in fitness traits but was due to their higher residual variance. However, whether the high residual variance was mainly due to higher levels of environmental variance or due to higher levels of nonadditive genetic variance remains a challenge to be addressed by further studies.

We instead present a model built from experimental data on the gypsy moth and its nuclear polyhedrosis virus, which has been extensively tested with epidemic data. These data have identified key details of the gypsy moth-virus interaction that are missing from earlier models, including seasonality in host reproduction, delays between host infection and death, and heterogeneity among hosts in their susceptibility to the virus. Allowing for these details produces models in which annual epidemics are followed by bouts of reproduction among surviving hosts and leads to quite different conclusions than earlier models. First, these models suggest that pathogen-driven outbreaks in forest defoliators occur partly because newly hatched insect larvae have higher average susceptibility than do older larvae. Second, the models show that a combination of seasonality and delays between infection and death can lead to unstable cycles in the absence of a stabilizing mechanism; these cycles, however, are stabilized by the levels of heterogeneity in susceptibility that we have observed in our experimental data. Moreover, our experimental estimates of virus transmission rates and levels of heterogeneity in susceptibility in gypsy moth populations give model dynamics that closely approximate the dynamics of real gypsy moth populations. Although we built our models from data for gypsy moth, our models are, nevertheless, quite general. Our conclusions are therefore likely to be true, not just for other defoliator-pathogen interactions, but for many host-pathogen interactions in which seasonality plays an important role.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of delayed plumage maturation, but testing them usually has involved interspecific comparisons that are hard to interpret. Mute swans (Cygnus olor) exhibit two phenotypes that differ in whether the birds have a gray subadult plumage (SAP phenotype) or molt immediately into an all white adult plumage (AP phenotype). The AP phenotype results from a recessive allele on the X chromosome; both phenotypes occur in the same population and even in the same brood. We compared costs and benefits of both phenotypes in mute swans on the Chesapeake Bay in 1972-1980 and on Long Island Sound in 1982-1989. Swans with the SAP phenotype had higher survival rates from hatching on fledging than AP swans. In the fall, when AP cygnets began to molt into their white plumage, their parents often attacked and drove them off while allowing SAP cygnets from the same brood to remain on their territories for several more months. SAP males had higher survival rates during their first 2 yr of life than AP males, but AP swans bred at a younger age than SAP swans. The only proposed hypothesis for the evolution of delayed plumage maturation that can explain its occurrence in mute swans is the status-signaling hypothesis. This hypothesis argues that males with subadult plumage honestly advertise their age and subordinate status while AP swans are cheaters and engaging in dishonest communication.

This prediction is contradicted, however, by the empirical observation of wide, continuous variation in egg size between these extremes. The prediction of dichotomy rests on the assumption of a negative linear relationship between egg size and development time. Here, I present a simple model in which development time is inversely proportional to egg size. Incorporating this relationship into an optimality model produces predictions of intermediate rather than extreme egg size. Modeled variations in mortality, food availability, fertilization rates, and temperature all produce continuous shifts in the value of the intermediate optimal size, in direct contrast to those produced by previous models, which predict shifts between two extreme optima. Empirical data on echinoid egg size and development time strongly support the model's assumption of an inverse proportional relationship between egg size and development time. A composite phylogeny is constructed of the 37 species for which egg size, development time, water temperature, and phylogenetic relatedness are known. Independent contrasts are made of the evolutionary changes in egg size and development time. This analysis indicates that evolutionary shifts in development time are correlated with the inversely proportional shifts in egg size assumed in the model. The assumption of a negative linear relationship used in previous models is rejected.

Our analyses consider mutualistic and antagonistic interspecific interactions and a variety of gene flow patterns between hot and cold spots. We found that hot and cold spots together with gene flow influence coevolutionary dynamics in four important ways. First, hot spots need not be ubiquitous to have a global influence on evolution, although rare hot spots will not have a disproportionate impact unless selection is relatively strong there. Second, asymmetries in gene flow can influence local adaptation, sometimes creating stable equilibria at which species experience minimal fitness in hot spots and maximal fitness in cold spots, or vice versa. Third, asymmetries in gene flow are no more important than asymmetries in population regulation for determining the maintenance of local polymorphisms through coevolution. Fourth, intraspecific allele frequency differences among hot and cold spot populations evolve under some, but not all, conditions.

It asks how the antipredator adaptations of a focal prey species are likely to evolve following the introduction of a second prey species that shares one or more of the same predator species. The interactions are represented by differential equation models of homogeneous populations, and evolutionary change occurs in a single quantitative trait within each prey species. Models differ in assumptions about the number of predator types, the costs of antipredator traits, and in how predator and prey traits combine to determine a per capita capture rate. Parallel change in the antipredator characteristics of two species usually occurs when the general risk of predation is changed by the introduction of the second prey. This may be a parallel increase or decrease, depending on whether the ecological interaction is apparent competition or apparent mutualism. Divergence in trait values is most often associated with the presence of two or more distinct types of predators with some form of trade-off in the prey's ability to avoid different predators. Divergence may also occur with a single predator type, when two or more strategies exist for reducing predation risk. Convergence is a possible outcome when there are two or more predator types. Coevolution may also produce trait and population cycles in models, and the nature of character displacement is often changed markedly by such instability.

Consequently, a male can gain through the imposition of mating costs, even though this may reduce female fitness because by doing so he minimizes the chances that his mate will copulate again.

We show that toxicity as a means of inhibiting remating is phenotypically stable over a broad range of conditions (although, under some circumstances, it may be necessary to invoke other selective pressures to account for the initial evolution of toxicity).

In mutualisms, such diversification can take the form of evolution of parasites that exploit the resources needed for maintenance of the mutualism. Mutualistic associations often have associated parasitic species, and in some cases, parasitic species have indeed evolved from the mutualists. For example, obligate mutualisms, such as those involving seed-eating pollinators, have on a few occasions given rise to nonmutualist species. These systems are relatively simple and provide models for identifying factors that facilitate the stable reversal of a mutualistic interaction. We used ecological data in a phylogenetic framework to analyze the origins of two nonmutualist cheater yucca moths. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the evolution of cheating may be preceded by a change in oviposition behavior. Two different modes of oviposition among moth species cause density-dependent moth egg mortality through flower abscission in one case (locule-ovipositing species) but density-independent mortality in the other (superficially ovipositing species). A mtDNA-based phylogeny indicated that cheating and superficial oviposition have evolved twice each and that the cheater clades are sisters to the superficially ovipositing species clades. Consideration of the fitness consequences of two trait changes - loss of pollination and phenological delay in oviposition - in which cheaters have diverged from ancestral pollinators suggest that the shift to oviposition into fruit may have occurred first and that loss of pollination behavior was a secondary event. We suggest that secondary coexistence of two pollinator species of opposite oviposition modes may facilitate the shift to fruit oviposition and cheating and that this is applicable in the best documented of the cheater yucca moths. Superficially ovipositing species suffer dual sources of egg mortality when in coexistence with locule-ovipositing species. Shift to fruit oviposition under this circumstance can be facilitated by access to a seed resource not available to the copollinator, preadaptations in ovipositor morphology, and pollinator phenology late relative to the copollinator. Thus the adaptive radiation of nonmutualists from mutualists may have taken place in specific ecological contexts through few trait changes, and the reversal of mutualism would be a by-product of a shift to reliance on a previously inaccessible seed resource.",90,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,2,2,Indirect effects | Life-history evolution | Macroevolution | Obligate mutualism | Prodoxidae,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,108

Adaptive radiation in seasonal environments can arise because of demographic trade-offs and excretion of metabolites. Resource partitioning can occur even in the absence of temporal or spatial heterogeneity. Spatial heterogeneity arising via growth is sufficient to generate microenvironments and subsequent adaptive radiation.

Sixty-one published cases of character displacement involving closely related species (congeners) make up the observational data set. All cases involve divergence, even though parallel and convergent displacement are theoretically possible. Character ratios in sympatry were greatest when displacement was symmetric (mean 1.54) and least when asymmetric (mean 1.29), perhaps because the most symmetric resource distributions are also the broadest. Carnivores are vastly overrepresented in the data compared with other trophic groups, with herbivores the next most common category. I consider five hypotheses to explain this pattern, including the possibility that the likelihood of divergence via competition depends on position in food webs. Overall, the quality and completeness of observational data has improved in recent years, as judged by the extent to which individual cases satisfy six standard criteria. All but one of the criteria are met in over half the cases. Most often lacking is independent evidence that the species involved compete for resources. For this reason, we cannot be sure that divergence in sympatry is usually the result of resource competition rather than some other interaction. Field experiments on character displacement, which explore how interaction strength changes per unit change in phenotypic traits, are only just beginning. I summarize research on threespine sticklebacks that used experiments in ponds to test three predictions: that presentday differences between sympatric species are a 'ghost' of competition past; that adding a competitor alters natural selection pressures on a species already present, favoring divergence; and that divergent natural selection stemming from resource competition is frequency dependent. In total, the evidence suggests that character displacement occurs frequently in nature, and it probably plays an important role in the evolution of diversity in many adaptive radiations.",452,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,1,1,Adaptive radiation | Character displacement | Coevolution of competitors | Divergence | Interspecific competition,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,110

A prerequisite for evolutionary branching is that directional selection drives the population toward a fitness minimum in phenotype space. This article demonstrates that selection regimes leading to evolutionary branching readily arise from a wide variety of different ecological interactions within and between species. We use classical ecological models for symmetric and asymmetric competition, for mutualism, and for predator-prey interactions to describe evolving populations with continuously varying characters. For these models, we investigate the ecological and evolutionary conditions that allow for evolutionary branching and establish that branching is a generic and robust phenomenon. Evolutionary branching becomes a model for sympatric speciation when population genetics and mating mechanisms are incorporated into ecological models. In sexual populations with random mating, the continual production of intermediate phenotypes from two incipient branches prevents evolutionary branching. In contrast, when mating is assortative for the ecological characters under study, evolutionary branching is possible in sexual populations and can lead to speciation. Therefore, we also study the evolution of assortative mating as a quantitative character. We show that evolution under branching conditions selects for assortativeness and thus allows sexual populations to escape from fitness minima. We conclude that evolutionary branching offers a general basis for understanding adaptive speciation and radiation under a wide range of different ecological conditions.",420,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,2,2,Adaptive dynamics | Competition | Evolutionary branching | Mutualism | Predation | Quantitative genetics | Sympatric speciation,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,111

We test the hypothesis that among-population variation in blossom morphology is due largely to local adaptation to avoid competition from other species of Dalechampia that utilize the same restricted set of pollinators. Because direct phylogenetic and historical information are unavailable for these populations, we develop a novel comparative method for the study of adaptation to a spatially distributed selective factor in spatially correlated populations. In addition to providing spatially, or phylogenetically, corrected estimates of selective effects, the method assesses the local specificity of adaptations. We find evidence for moderately strong local specificity of adaptation among our populations, and furthermore we find that the effects of putative competitors are in accordance with predictions from a hypothesis of character displacement.

These historical features complement environmental selection pressures. They imply that, if the history of the species' radiations are very different, ecological communities are unlikely to be completely convergent even when placed in identical environments. We compare the adaptive radiation of the Dendroica warblers of North America with that of the Phylloscopus warblers of Asia. We consider the ecology of the species in two localities where species' diversity is very high (New Hampshire, U.S.A., and Kashmir, India, respectively) and contrast the history of the two radiations on the basis of a molecular (mitochondrial cytochrome b) phylogeny. By comparison with the Phylloscopus, the Dendroica are on average larger and morphologically more similar to one another. Although there is some similarity between the Dendroica and Phylloscopus communities, they differ in foraging behavior and in associations of morphology with ecological variables. The Dendroica likely reflect an early Pliocene radiation and are two to four times younger than the Phylloscopus. They probably had a colorful sexually dichromatic ancestor, implicating sexual selection in the production of the many ecologically similar species. The Phylloscopus are much older and probably had a drab, monomorphic ancestor. Given the difference in ages of the two radiations, it is plausible that the close species' packing of the Dendroica warblers is a transient phenomenon. If this is the case, community structure evolves on the timescales of millions of years. Differences in ancestry and timing of the species' radiations can be related to the different biogeography of the two regions. This implies that the historical imprint on adaptive radiations could be predicted on the basis of the attributes of ancestors and biogeographical context.",84,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Ancestral reconstruction | Community convergence | Dendroica | Phylloscopus | Phylogeny | Sexual selection,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,113

Interestingly, the temporal stability of entire communities is predicted to increase fairly linearly, without clear saturation, as diversity increases. Species composition is predicted to be as important as diversity in affecting community stability and productivity. The greater temporal stability of more diverse communities is caused by higher productivity at higher diversity (the 'overyielding' effect), competitive interactions (the 'covariance' effect), and statistical averaging (the 'portfolio' effect). The relative contribution of each cause of temporal stability changes as diversity increases, but the net effect is that greater diversity stabilizes the community even though it destabilizes individual populations.

In the absence of confounding variables, home range size should therefore scale with body mass according to Kleiber's exponent for metabolic rate of 0.75. Comparative studies in a wide range of taxa have failed to confirm this prediction: home range size has commonly been found to scale with an exponent significantly >0.75. We develop a comparative measure of metabolic needs that incorporates both mass-specific metabolic rate and social-group size. We test the prediction that home range size in primates scales isometrically with this measure when an appropriate linear model is applied to data corrected for phylogenetic bias. Analyses using species values as data points indicate an exponent consistent with Kleiber's law. This result is misleading, however, because ecological factors confound the analysis, and the slopes within some ecologically homogeneous taxa are steeper. Accordingly, in analyses based on independent contrasts with reduced major axis, slopes are significantly greater than predicted by Kleiber's law. We examine the effects of other variables, and we find that systematic variation in substrate use, home range overlap, and diet account for the steeper than expected relationship between home range size and metabolic needs based on Kleiber's law. We therefore conclude that the scaling of home range size is subject to Kleiber's law but in combination with other factors.

Under this scenario, we study the effects of different regimes of patch dynamics upon metapopulation persistence.

We show that metapopulation persistence and extinction are strongly influenced by the rate at which the landscape changes, in addition to the amount of habitat destroyed. We derive MF analytical expressions for extinction thresholds related to landscape properties such as habitat suitability and patch average lifetime.

Epidemiological models suggest that variable effects of parasites on individual hosts can explain this variability on the population level. Here, we aim to support this hypothesis with a specific epidemiological model using a cross-parasite species approach. We compared the effect of six parasites on host fecundity and survival to their effects on density and risk of extinction of clonal host populations. We contrast our empirical results of population density with predictions from a deterministic model and contrast our empirical results of host and parasite extinction rates with those predicted by a stochastic model. Five horizontally transmitted microparasites (two bacteria: white bacterial disease, Pasteuria ramosa; two microsporidia: Glugoides intestinalis, Ordospora colligata; ofie fungus: Metschnikowiella biscuspidata); and six strains of a vertically transmitted microsporidium (Flabelliforma magnivora) of the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna were used. In life table experiments, we quantified fecundity and survival in individual parasitized and healthy hosts and compared these with the effect of the parasites on host population density and on the likelihood of host population extinction in microcosm populations. Parasite species varied strongly in their effects on host fecundity, host survival, host density reduction, and the frequency with which they drove host populations to extinction. The fewer offspring an infected host produced, the lower the density of an infected host population. This effect on host density was relatively stronger for the vertically transmitted parasite strains than for the horizontally transmitted parasites. As predicted by the stochastic simulations, strong effects of a parasite on individual host survival and fecundity increased the risk of host population extinction. The same was true for parasite extinctions.

If mating is promiscuous or polygynous, sexual selection favors larger males when resources are sufficient. But if male reproductive behavior is energetically costly, smaller males may have an advantage when resources are limiting, producing a pattern of allometry for sexual size dimorphism that conforms with Rensch's rule.
