In addition, the neutralizing ability of three antivenoms (bothropic polyvalent, bothropic bivalent and lachetic) was studied by preincubation-type experiments. B. pictus venom had the highest lethality by the intraperitoneal route whereas B. atrox venom had the highest lethality when tested by the intravenous route. The three antivenoms were effective in neutralizing lethality of the homologous venoms. Bivalent antivenom was more effective than polyvalent antivenom in the neutralization of B. pictus venom. On the basis of these findings, the use of bivalent bothropic antivenom is recommended in the Pacific coastal regions of Perú, whereas polyvalent bothropic antivenom is recommended in the oriental jungle regions of the country.",6,7701074,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,1

Latin American genetic composition is a function of ethnic composition in each country (mainly Africans and Spaniards, and the ""indians"" or native peoples). For this reason the distribution of hemoglobin variants has been greatly affected by the individual and population movements, specially as a result of the 18th and 19th century African slave trade. Scientific, sanitary, social and cultural factors explain (at least for Latin America and Portugal), a quantitative and qualitative subestimation of the structural variants of hemoglobin. In Spain, which has extensive research on the subject, the Caucasian variant number is known to be high, compared with Latin America and Portugal. Concerning origin and prevalence of hemoglobin polymorphism, the only established positive selection force is malaria falciparum. In Iberoamerica, the Hb S, as the major polymorphism and the HbC, have the greatest clinical and anthropological importance.
