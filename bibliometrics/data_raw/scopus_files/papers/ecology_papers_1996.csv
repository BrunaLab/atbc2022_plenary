The purpose of this article is to show how recent theoretical advances may reverse this situation. We first discuss four issues that have arisen in the development of theory for biological control. (1) Recent work has clarified and resolved earlier disagreements concerning the effect of aggregation of the parasitoid to local host density on the stability of parasitoid-host models; this work emphasizes that such aggregation increases the ability of the parasitoid to reduce pest density. (2) There has been disagreement over the conditions under which stability, in the mathematical sense and on a local spatial scale, is an appropriate goal for classical biological control of insect pests, and whether a metapopulation may sometimes provide a more appropriate framework. We also comment on (3) relative size of refuges, which has been proposed as a unifying concept, and (4) density dependence and ratio dependence. We then discuss recent models using a stage-structured approach, particularly those that compare potential biological control agents or agents that have been differentially successful in practice. We argue that this approach has already produced valuable insights into the factors operating in several field situations. It demonstrates the importance of identifying which pest stages are most injurious to the crop, since the natural enemy that wins in competition may not be the most effective at suppressing the crucial pest stage(s): in general, the winning parasitoid reduces the density of the host stage attacked by its competitor below the level at which the latter can maintain a positive growth rate when at low density. A useful criterion is that pest equilibrium density is suppressed most by the parasitoid species that needs the fewest host individuals to allow a female parasitoid to replace herself in the next generation. Caveats are that this may apply only under equilibrium conditions and that the pest stage most suppressed is the one we wish to control. We discuss the connection between successful biological control and evolutionary considerations.",172,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,10,10.2307/2265696,"Biological control of insect pests | Competition between natural enemies | Effects on biocontrol | Evolution and ecology | Insects, stage-structured models of | Parasitoid aggregation and stability | Parasitoid behavior",NA,NA,NA

We undertook a study of the community ecology of irrigated tropical rice fields on Java, Indonesia, as a supporting study for the Indonesian National Integrated Pest Management Programme, whose purpose is to train farmers to be better agronomists and to employ the principles of integrated pest management (IPM). Two of our study objectives, reported on here, were (1) to explore whether there exist general and consistent patterns of arthropod community dynamics related to natural or intrinsic levels of biological control, and (2) to understand how the existing levels of biological control are affected by insecticide use, as well as by large-scale habitat factors relating to differing patterns for vegetational landscapes, planting times, and the length of dry fallow periods. We performed a series of observational studies and two experimental studies. Abundant and well-distributed populations of generalist predators can be found in most early-season tropical rice fields. We took samples from plants and water surface using a vacuum-suction device, and from the subsurface using a dip net. Our results show that high populations of generalist predators are likely to be supported, in the early season, by feeding on abundant populations of detritus-feeding and plankton-feeding insects, whose populations consistently peak and decline in the first third of the season. We hypothesize that since this abundance of alternative prey gives the predator populations a ""head start"" on later-developing pest populations, this process should strongly suppress pest populations and generally lend stability to rice ecosystems by decoupling predator populations from a strict dependence on herbivore populations. We experimentally tested our hypothesis of trophic linkages among organic matter, detritivores and plankton feeders, and generalist predators and showed that by increasing organic matter in test plots we could boost populations of detritivores and plankton-feeders, and in turn significantly boost the abundance of generalist predators. These results hold for populations found on the plant, on the water surface, and below the water surface. We also demonstrated the link between early-season natural enemy populations and later-season pest populations by experimentally reducing early-season predator populations with insecticide applications, causing pest populations to resurge later in the season. Overall, these results demonstrate the existence of a mechanism in tropical irrigated rice systems that supports high levels of natural biological control. This mechanism depends on season-long successional processes and interactions among a wide array of species, many of which have hitherto been ignored as important elements in a rice ecosystem. Our results support a management strategy that promotes the conservation of existing natural biological control through a major reduction in insecticide use, and the corresponding increase in habitat heterogeneity.",515,Journal,ar,Article,100,9,9,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,12,10.2307/2265694,"Agroecosystems, tropical rice | Biological control | Chironomidae | Community dynamics | Detritivores and plankton feeders | Field experiment | Green revolution | Insecticide use and pest outbreaks | Integrated pest management | Java, Indonesia | Rice-field ecology",NA,NA,NA

The purpose of my study was to investigate experimentally the differential and/or interactive effects of two predator guilds on herbivore densities. I performed my experiments on 24 creosotebushes at each of three sites within the Jornada Long-Term Ecological Research Site in the Chihuahuan Desert of southwestern New Mexico, USA. At each site the experiment consisted of: six creosotebushes from which birds were excluded with nylon mesh cages; six creosotebushes from which arthropod predators were removed by hand or aspirator; six creosotebushes from which both birds and arthropod predators were removed; and six control creosotebushes from which neither birds nor arthropod predators were removed. I conducted nondestructive nocturnal visual censuses of herbivores on each creosotebush at the beginning of the experiments in mid-May, 6 wk after the start of the experiment in late June, and 12 wk after the start of the experiment in early August. I conducted these experiments and censuses in 1993 and again in 1994. In both years the herbivore densities became significantly higher in experimental than in control creosotebushes. The effects of bird and arthropod predation on herbivore densities were additive in 1993, but they were compensatory in 1994. In 1994 arthropod predator densities became lower in creosotebushes from which birds had been removed than in creosotebushes from which birds had not been removed, but this result did not obtain in 1993. These results may be due to a combination of factors including: avian and arthropod predation on herbivores, ""intraguild"" predation of birds on arthropod predators, and competition within the herbivore community. The relative numerical impacts of the predator-removal experiments varied among seasons and among sites within either year, but temporal and spatial variation in predator impacts did not correlate strongly with known gradients of climatic or bottom-up heterogeneity in this system.

I tested the degree to which the variance in local insect variables (species richness, ratio of specialist to generalist chewers, abundance, and biomass) for leaf chewers associated with different species of tropical trees was accounted for by local and regional host-related variables and by local abundance of potential enemies. Leaf-chewing insects feeding externally on ten species of forest trees were collected over a 1-yr field study in a submontane area in Papua New Guinea. The tree species were taxonomically distant, and the list included species of different successional status, different patterns of leaf production, and different heights. The affinity of chewing insects with particular tree species was ascertained by feeding trials in the laboratory. Local insect species richness varied greatly among tree species by more than four-fold between the poorest (18 species) and the richest (94 species) tree species. The proportion of specialist insect species associated with particular tree species was significantly different among tree species and ranged from 16 to 72%. Trees supporting a rich fauna usually also supported a high proportion of specialists. The abundance and biomass of leaf-chewing insects per host species was difficult to predict. However, path analyses showed that most of the causal variance in insect species richness and in the ratio of specialist to generalist chewers was accounted for by five properties of the tree species: numbers of young leaves available throughout the year, ant (i.e., enemy) abundance leaf palataility, leaf water content, and altitudinal range. Most of the variation in local species richness could be predicted from local processes (i.e., food resources and abundance of enemies), not from regional processes. This study and others suggest that in complex environments, such as tropical rain forests, local processes may be comparatively more important in maintaining the local species richness of insect herbivores than in less complex ones such as temperate woodlands. The implications of these findings are evident: the effects of moderate habitat fragmentation and ecological stress may be more pronounced in tropical systems than in temperate systems and may result in a greater proportional loss of local biodiversity in the former.",76,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,15,10.2307/2265794,Ants | Host specificity | Insect-plant interactions | Insects | Leaf production | Papua New Guinea | Species richness,NA,NA,NA

The results showed that parental genotypes altered offspring traits in response to particular resource limits, such that offspring quality was maintained or enhanced despite parental resource deprivation. By maximizing the probability of offspring success, resource-deprived parental plants may partly offset the reduction in their fitness due to lower offspring number.

They have been applied extensively to study the impacts of climatic change on ecosystems although they originally were not built for this purpose. The objectives of this study were (1) to develop a new forest gap model, FORCLIM, that includes only a minimum number of ecological assumptions but robust parameterizations of the effects of climate on plant population dynamics; (2) to test the realism of FORCLIM as compared to its predecessor model, FORECE; and (3) to examine the behavior of FORECE and FORCLIM systematically along climate gradients in Europe. FORCLIM is composed of three modular submodels: FORCLIM-P for plant population dynamics, FORCLIM-S for soil carbon/nitrogen turnover, and FORCLIM-E for providing reliable parameterizations of the abiotic environment. For the core model, FORCLIM-P, it was found that only four factors are sufficient to model tree growth, another four factors are required to model tree establishment, and only two factors are required to model tree mortality. The behavior of FORCLIM was tested at a large number of sites in the European Alps. The model yields tree species compositions that conform to field data and are very similar to those of the predecessor model. Based on this evaluation alone, it would not be possible to favor one of the models over the other. The behavior of both models then was examined systematically in a parameter space spanned by the annual mean temperature and the annual precipitation sum. From this exercise it became evident that both the pattern of aboveground biomass and the realized niches of the dominating tree species are simulated realistically by FORCLIM. Extremely steep gradients are characteristic of FORECE, and many ecotones are simulated to occur in the wrong places in FORECE. Thus, some of the current forest gap models can be simplified without reducing the realism of their behavior, and models other than FORECE should be scrutinized in this respect as well. The present study also suggests that the evaluation of model behavior at scattered sites is insufficient to show their validity for simulating forest dynamics along climate gradients.

Nectar-robbing bumble bees do not reduce female or male success of bluebells,Morris W.,Ecology,00129658,77,5,1451-1462,1996-01-01,1996,"Although mutualisms are often viewed as fragile constructs, subject to invasion by ""cheaters"" that gain from the mutualism without providing compensating benefits, few studies have explored whether or not apparent cheating behavior by one player actually denies benefits to the other species. Panicled bluebells (Mertensia paniculata) experience high rates of nectar robbery by bumble bees (Bombus mixtus and B. frigidus) in the Wrangell Mountains of southcentral Alaska. Nevertheless, experimental prevention of nectar larceny in two seasons did not enhance components of female reproductive success (nutlet initiation, seed-set, and seed mass) or male success (pollen removal). Observational data show that the absence of a negative impact of nectar robbery is a consequence of bumble bee behaviors; the two bee species that rob mature flowers buzz-pollinate the same flowers at an earlier stage in floral development. The shift in bee behavior is driven by the presentation of different rewards at different times in the flowering period; young flowers contain pollen and older flowers produce nectar. Although flowers typically receive and donate pollen before most nectar is produced, the mature flowers producing a robbed nectar reward may nonetheless contribute to the reproductive success of bluebell plants. Flowers sequestered from pollinators in the early stage were still capable of initiating nutlets, demonstrating that older flowers can enhance female reproduction if pollinators are rare (when many early-stage flowers may go unvisited). Moreover, the removal of mature flowers reduced the visitation rate to early-stage flowers on the same plant.

Few studies, however, have tested the importance of individual variation to factors affecting population dynamics (e.g., average individual growth rates, developmental rates, survivorship, etc.) using natural populations. We conducted a field experiment designed to test effects of larval density and individual variability in body size on growth and development of larval tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum). We performed our experiment in a natural sinkhole lake in central Arizona; experimental populations differing in density and initial variability in body size were held in nylon mesh enclosures. Effects of individual variability in size were examined independently of any effects due to mean body size of the population or total population biomass. Density affected growth rates and development to metamorphosis of experimental larvae in a manner consistent with other studies. Initial variability in body size did not affect larval growth rates or diets but did interact with density to affect survivorship and development: experimental larvae held with similarly sized individuals experienced lower survivorship and were metamorphosing earlier than experimental larvae held with variably sized individuals. These effects did not appear to be mediated by size-specific competitive abilities but may have been mediated by individual behavioral responses to size structure.

In previous studies with the montane plant Ipomopsis aggregata, we documented pollinator-mediated selection on several aspects of floral form, including flower width. This character varies continuously within natural populations of I. aggregata, and individuals with wider flowers export more pollen per flower to surrounding plants. We previously showed that this component of phenotypic selection is due primarily to the pervisit effectiveness of hummingbirds, the most important pollinator in our study populations. Here we investigate mechanisms of differential visit effectiveness in greater detail. First, counts of pollen in unvisited flowers showed that pollen production itself increases with width. In aviary experiments, hummingbirds also removed a greater proportion of available pollen as width increased. We next videotaped visits to flowers that varied in width either naturally, or by experimental treatment, and found that hummingbirds inserted their bills more deeply into wider flowers. Finally, we directly manipulated how deeply birds could insert their bills, and found that more pollen was removed after deep insertion. Thus, several mechanisms appear to underlie selection on corolla width via visit effectiveness in pollen export. One involves a phenotypic correlation with pollen production; this underscores the value of experiments for untangling indirect from direct selection. Another mechanism involves direct selection due to the depth of insertion of a hummingbird's bill; this is rare evidence for one form of selection involving the ""fit"" between pollinator and flower.",143,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,21,10.2307/2265543,Flower shape and size | Hummingbird | Ipomopsis | Morphology | Phenotypic correlation | Pollen export and production | Pollinator effectiveness | Selection,NA,NA,NA

Parasitic plants obtain water, sugar, nitrogen compounds, and a variety of secondary metabolites from their host plants. In a greenhouse study, I examined the direct interactions of a parasitic plant, Castilleja wightii (Scrophulariaceae), with three plant hosts and the indirect effects of this parasitism on the performance of a parasite-feeding herbivore. The three host species, Lupinus arboreus, Artemisia pycnocephala, and Eriophyllum staechadifolium, directly and differentially affected C. wightii flower production, although parasite biomass was not affected by host species. Surprisingly, parasite performance was weakest when attacking a leguminous host, although parasite total nitrogen was highest when growing on a legume. Parasites also exerted a strong direct effect on host performance: host dry mass was negatively correlated with parasite mass for all three host species tested. However, this effect differed among hosts: for E. staechadifolium, proportionately larger parasite mass was correlated with smaller overall biomass of the host and parasite combined, while for the other two hosts, overall host-parasite mass was not correlated with parasite mass, indicating that E. staechadifolium was more affected by parasite attack than were the other host species. Finally, host plant chemistry had strong indirect effects on the performance of an aphid, Nearctaphis kachena, that feeds on C. wightii. Aphids feeding on C. wightii that were parasitizing L. arboreus (alkaloid-producing, high nitrogen), A. pycnocephala (alkaloid-free, intermediate nitrogen), and E. staechadifolium (terpenoidproducing, low nitrogen) experienced 68.2, 65.3, and 49.5% survival, respectively. Further, aphids feeding on parasites using L. arboreus and A. pycnocephala produced 2.43 and 1.77 times more offspring on average than those feeding on parasites using E. staechadifolium.

Sward dry green biomasses and protein densities were estimated regularly throughout the study site. Changes in protein densities with season and locale were strongly correlated with underlying changes in grass physiognomy: sward height and dry green bulk biomass density were particularly important and were found to vary inversely. The relationship between bite rates and underlying sward parameters varied with season: gazelle bite rates in the dry season were positively correlated with underlying dry green biomass and protein densities, as predicted by either the Process 1 or Process 2 foraging model of Spalinger and Hobbs. Nonlinear regressions of within-bout bite rates on these model equations significantly explained 21.8 and 23.7% of the dry season variance, respectively. In contrast, bite rates in the early wet season showed significant negative correlations with underlying protein densities: the fit of the within-bout bite rate data to Spalinger and Hobbs' Process 3 model explained 18.4% of the overall variation. The late wet season showed a flat (insignificant) relationship between bite rates and protein levels and was thus intermediate between early wet- and later dry-season patterns. Logistic regression of the type of correlation between bite rate and protein density (positive, flat, negative) on two principal components of grass physiognomy suggested that a component heavily weighting sward height was the major correlate of foraging process, whereas a second major component heavily weighting bulk density and other grass quality measures was less critical. At least during this single annual cycle, shorter swards were associated with Processes 1 or 2, whereas taller swards showed Process 3 foraging. One interpretation of these results is that sward height modulates bite mass, which in turn plays the major role in controlling foraging process.

Monitoring of 14 natural nests throughout most of the incubation period revealed considerable differences among nests in both means and variances of thermal regimes. Laboratory experiments on this species show that both the mean and the variance of incubation temperatures profoundly influence developmental rates (and hence, incubation periods) as well as the body shape, activity levels thermoregulatory behavior, and running speeds of the hatchlings. Hence, a female's selection of a particular nest site can substantially modify both the time of emergence of the hatchlings, and the morphology and behavior of her offspring.

The unpalatable brown seaweed Dictyota ciliolata produces the diterpenoid secondary metabolites pachydictyol A, dictyol B acetate, and dictyodial. At natural concentrations, pachydictyol A deterred the sea urchin Arbacia punctulata but did not inhibit feeding by the pinfish Lagodon rhomboides or the amphipod Ampithoe longimana until concentrations were 2.5-5 times natural levels. Dictyol B acetate deterred the urchin, amphipod, and pinfish at, or far below, natural concentrations. Dictyodial was too unstable to assay directly, but indirect experiments suggested that natural concentrations deterred the urchin, but not the pinfish or amphipod. Mild desiccation of D. ciliolata reduced concentrations of the different secondary metabolites by 7-38% and plants became 2.6-3.4 times more susceptible to urchin and amphipod grazing. The combined concentrations of pachydictyol A and dictyol B acetate found in undesiccated Dictyota ciliolata deterred feeding by urchins, but this deterrent effect was lost at concentrations found in the desiccated plants. Desiccated and undesiccated plants did not differ in nutritive value (as measured by protein and total N content) or toughness. Thus, desiccated plants became more palatable because chemical defenses were lost, not because nutritive value was increased. The stress of near-surface ultraviolet radiation also caused significant physiological changes in Dictyota ciliolata. UV-exposed blades bleached, senesced, and grew 84% less than blades protected from UV radiation. Tissue loss and minimal growth of UV-stressed plants constrained our sample sizes, but the limited assays that could be run suggested that UV stress may lower chemical defenses and increase plant susceptibility to herbivores. Because many previous investigations of herbivore feeding patterns used animals that had been starved for days before an assay, we tested the effects of this commonly used procedure on feeding discrimination. Recently fed urchins always avoided food containing natural concentrations of pachydictyol A during separate feeding trials performed on each of four consecutive days. In contrast, urchins deprived of food for 3 d before this assay did not avoid the treated food on days 1 and 2 of feeding trials, but did avoid it on days 3 and 4 after their hunger was reduced by feeding during days 1 and 2. If we had used only starved urchins (a common procedure in previous investigations), we could have concluded, with apparent justification, that urchins were unaffected by pachydictyol A (if the assays were run for only 1-2 d) or that they needed 2 d of exposure to the compound in order to learn to avoid it.

Food concentrations were changed during specific larval stages of the freshwater copepod Mesocyclops edax Forbes (Copepoda: Cyclopoida) to examine whether age and size at metamorphosis remain flexible or become fixed during the larval period. Results were compared to predictions of both flexible (the Wilbur-Collins model) and fixed (Leips-Travis model) rate models for the timing of amphibian metamorphosis Age and size at metamorphosis were variable in all treatments, and age was always more variable than size. Changes in food concentration early in larval development resulted in significant differences in age at metamorphosis among treatments, but changes initiated when 60% of the larval period had passed had no effect on age at metamorphosis. Development appeared to become fixed later in the larval period, before the ultimate larval stage was reached. These results support predictions of the Leips-Travis model. Early changes in food concentrations had significant effects on size at metamorphosis, but changes initiated during the penultimate larval stage (50-60% of larval development) had no effect on metamorph size. Size at metamorphosis in M. edax also appeared to be fixed before the ultimate larval stage was reached. Fixation of size at metamorphosis during development is not predicted by either model and may be unique to organisms with rigid exoskeletons that constrain growth within any stage. Patterns of covariation between age and size at metamorphosis suggest that food conditions early in larval development exert a large effect on metamorphic traits, in contrast to patterns observed in several amphibian species. The Wilbur-Collins model places a fitness premium on delaying metamorphosis to achieve a maximum size, when growth conditions are favorable; it thus may not apply to crustaceans.

However, this fact is not evidence that biological control is safe, because monitoring of non-target species is minimal, particularly in sites and habitats far from the point of release.

Mayfly drift dispersal behavior, use of high vs. low food (periphyton or detritus) patches, microhabitat use, positioning, and activity periodicity were observed in the presence and absence of predators in circular flow-through chambers using natural stream water. Also, distances from predators at which prey initiated escape responses were compared among prey and predator species. Costs of predator avoidance behavior were assessed by measuring short-term (24 h) feeding rates of mayflies in the presence or absence of predatory stoneflies whose mouthparts were immobilized (glued) to prevent feeding. The intensity and associated costs of predator avoidance behavior of mayfly species were consistent with their relative rates of predation by stoneflies. Megarcys consumes overwintering generation Baetis bicaudatus > Epeorus longimanus > Cinygmula = Ephemerella; Kogotus consumes summer generation Baetis > Epeorus deceptivus = Cinygmula; Megarcys eats more mayflies than Kogotus. While Megarcys induced drift by Baetis, Epeorus, and Cinygmula, this disruptive predator avoidance behavior only reduced food intake by Baetis and Epeorus. The morphologically defended mayfly species, Ephemerella, neither showed escape behavior from Megarcys, nor any cost of its antipredatory posturing behavior. Only Baetis responded by drifting from Kogotus. No mayfly species shifted microhabitats or spent less time on high-food patches in the presence of foraging stoneflies. However, predators enhanced the nocturnal periodicity of Baetis drift, which was negligible in the absence of stoneflies as long as food was abundant. Lack of food also caused some microhabitat and periodicity shifts and increased the magnitude of both day and night drift of Baetis. Thus, Baetis took more risks of predation by visual, drift-feeding fish not only in the presence of predatory stoneflies, but also when food was low or they were hungry. All other mayflies were generally nocturnal in their use of rock surfaces, as long as food was abundant. Finally, the distances at which different mayfly species initiated acute escape responses were also consistent with relative rates of predation. This study demonstrates alternative predator avoidance syndromes by mayfly species ranging from an initial investment in constitutive morphological defenses (e.g., Ephemerella) to induced, energetically costly predator avoidance behaviors (e.g., Baetis). Although the costs of Ephemerella's constitutive defense are unknown, experiments show that prey dispersal is the mechanism underlying fecundity costs of induced responses by Baetis to predators, rather than microhabitat shifts to less favorable resources or temporal changes in foraging activity. A conceptual model suggests that contrasting resource acquisition modes may account for the evolution and maintenance of alternative predator avoidance syndromes along a continuum from Baetis (high mobility) to heptageniids (intermediate mobility) to Ephemerella (low mobility). Prey dispersal (swimming) to avoid capture results in reduction of otherwise high fecundity by Baetis, which trades off morphological defense for enhanced ability to acquire resources. Thus, improved foraging efficiency is the selection pressure maintaining the highly mobile life style in Baetis, which increases resource acquisition and fecundity, offsetting the high mortality costs associated with this behavior.",120,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,33,10.2307/2265793,Adaptive syndromes | Drift | Induced defenses | Mayflies | Periodicity | Predator avoidance | Prey vulnerability | Resource acquisition | Stoneflies | Streams,NA,NA,NA

The gradient was achieved by adding different amounts of fuel to small plots that were burned in 1988 and 1989. Temperature was recorded at four soil strata during burning. We analyzed survival of seeds and rhizomes in the soil immediately after fire, and followed vegetation cover and seedling establishment until 1993. During fire, there was a steep decline in maximum temperature with increasing depth below the char, irrespective of the depth of burn in the mor layer, indicating that burn depth can be used as a general indicator of heat impact below ground. Lethal temperature was not recorded deeper than 20-30 mm under the burn boundary. Plant survival was determined both by depth of burn and by depth distribution of regenerative structures in the soil. Three rhizomatous species, the dwarf shrubs Vaccinium myrtillus and Vaccinium vitis-idaea and the grass Deschampsia flexuosa, were dominant in the prefire vegetation. For all three species, the bulk of the soil bud bank was located within the mor layer, but was more superficial for D. flexuosa. Initial mortality in the bud bank was progressively higher with increasing depth of burn, and this determined the regrowth over the following years. After fires that consumed only the moss layer, cover of the Vaccinium species returned to prefire levels within 2-4 yr, and D. flexuosa showed a dramatic increase in cover as well as in fruiting. Fires that burned slightly deeper nearly eliminated D. flexuosa, and the deepest burning fires also eliminated Vaccinium spp. In contrast to regrowth from rhizomes, colonization from seed was better after relatively deep-burning fire, both for species with a soil seed bank and for species dispersing seed onto the burnt soil. However, after fires consuming most of the organic soil layer, seed bank species were also badly affected, whereas dispersers showed progressively better establishment with increasing depth of burn. Differences between treatments were still great after 5 yr, indicating that variation in depth of burn will have a long-lasting impact on the vegetation. These results from experimentally burned plots were corroborated by an analysis of depth distribution of viable plant rhizomes and seeds, and the initial colonization at a site newly burned in a wildfire. The precise response patterns of boreal vegetation to variation in burn depth will depend on characteristics of the species present. However, we assume that these results have a high degree of generality, since, in podzolized soils, most rhizomatous species are predominantly located in the mor layer, since the dormant seed bank typically is concentrated at the interface of mor and mineral soil, and also since a thick organic soil layer is a poor seedbed for incoming seeds. The results indicate that in boreal forest, depth of burn is a more important variable than fire front intensity for the understory vegetation, in contrast to the situation in ecosystems with little accumulation of organic material on the mineral soil.",292,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,34,10.2307/2265541,Boreal forest | Burn depth | Deschampsia flexuosa | Disturbance | Fire intensity | Regenerating strategies | Seed bank | Vaccinium myrtillus | Vaccinium vitis-idaea,NA,NA,NA

Although predator and prey behaviors are known to influence the impact of stream predators on local prey populations, no study has simultaneously addressed how predator impacts, and behavioral mechanisms contributing to those impacts, vary with prey density. I assessed the effect of a stream invertebrate predator (stonefly) on local prey (baetid mayfly) density across a gradient of six prey densities in in situ channels with natural substrata. Calculations of predator foraging rates and prey responses were based, in part, on an empirically based model assuming an exponential decline in prey densities. Total predator impact (measured as the negative natural log of the ratio of prey remaining in predator vs. predator-free channels) across prey densities followed a unimodal curve, with reduced predator effects at high and low, relative to intermediate, prey densities. Although direct predator consumption was more important than predator-induced emigration in explaining overall prey losses across all prey densities (65 vs. 35%), the relative importance of each loss process varied across individual prey densities. Total baetid drift increased with, and per capita drift was independent of, baetid benthic density in all predator treatments. Total and per capita drift rates of baetids were increased at least 3.5 times in the presence of predatory stoneflies. Few baetids were observed on the tops of rocks in either control or predator treatments during the day; however, baetid numbers on upper rock surfaces increased substantially at night and were significantly reduced by stonefly presence. The proportion of baetid populations on surface substrata was low and unaffected by predator presence during the day (0.3%) but was reduced in predator relative to predator-free channels at night (4 vs. 14%). Predatory stoneflies exhibited a type III functional response, and stonefly emigration decreased as initial baetid density increased.

Cuscuta was common in the middle marsh zones. The abundance of Cuscuta was positively correlated with the abundance of Limonium californicum at two sampling scales (0.25- and ≈40-m2 quadrats). Sampling at the scale of individual plants indicated that the dominant plant in the marsh, Salicornia virginica, was preferred by Cuscuta as a host over Arthrocnemum subterminale, Limonium californicum, and Frankenia salina. This result was confirmed with host-choice experiments in the field. Based on spatial correlations and host-choice experiments, we hypothesized that Cuscuta indirectly facilitated Limonium and Frankenia, increasing plant diversity and initiating vegetation cycles. This hypothesis was supported by sampling patches with different histories of Cuscuta infection. Patches with recent heavy Cuscuta infection had reduced Salicornia biomass and increased Limonium and Frankenia biomass relative to controls. This effect was most pronounced at higher elevations and in larger, older patches. The hypothesis was also supported by sampling permanent quadrats repeatedly over time. The probability that Cuscuta would invade a quadrat increased with increasing cover of Salicornia. Quadrats containing Cuscuta increased in Limonium and Frankenia cover between censuses relative to quadrats lacking Cuscuta.

For many populations, it may be more plausible to assume that the effects of density set in at a maximum rate around some characteristic density K > 0: that is, the per capita rate of increase of the population has an inverted sigmoidal form as a function of population density. In the model discussed here, the rate at which density dependence sets in around K is governed by a parameter γ, which I refer to as the ""abruptness"" parameter: the larger the parameter γ, the weaker the effects of density dependence are for population densities below K, the more rapidly density dependence sets in around K, and the more severe the effects of density dependence are beyond K. Results obtained from an Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) analysis of the abruptness parameter γ suggest the hypothesis that populations with a density-independent growth rate of <100% from one generation to the next (i.e., a reproductive value of <2) will exhibit a relatively high level of abruptness in their response to density, while the reverse will be true for populations with a density-independent growth rate of >100%. Further, if true, this hypothesis suggests that females with high reproductive rates who deposit young on resources and provide no further maternal care should clump their young to reduce the level of abruptness in density dependence. Also, this hypothesis, together with the fact that high levels of abruptness promote oscillations in populations, implies that we are more likely to observe cyclic and chaotic behavior in relatively slower growing populations than previously thought.",115,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,38,10.2307/2265697,Abruptness parameter | Density dependence | Discrete-time population model | Evolutionary state strategy analysis | Population growth rate | Population models,NA,NA,NA

We examined the effects of solar radiation, wind speed, and their interaction on metabolic rates in the Verdin, Auriparus flaviceps. Daytime resting metabolic rates and evaporative water loss rates as a function of air temperature, as well as basal metabolic rate, were also measured to allow estimation of water and energy flux rates in diverse microclimates. In the absence of solar radiation, as wind speed was increased from 0.4 to 3.0 m/s, metabolic rate increased 14%. Exposure to simulated solar radiation significantly reduced metabolic heat production at all wind speeds measured except 3.0 m/s. Solar heat gain (SHG) was estimated for an irradiance of 1000 W/m2, similar to that commonly observed in nature. At 0.4 m/s wind speed and 1000 W/m2 irradiance, SHG may reduce metabolic rate by 46%. SHG declines precipitously as wind speed is increased, and at 3.0 m/s, metabolic rate is only reduced by 3%. Analyses of changes in thermostatic costs associated with microclimate selection in winter suggest that Verdins may reduce metabolic rate by as much as 50% by shifting from a shaded, windy site to one protected from the wind and exposed to 1000 W/m2 solar radiation. Similar analyses for Verdins during the summer suggest that microsite selection can result in significant water savings.

Stolonal growth and asexual recruitment of new colonies (by budding) were enhanced by experimentally reducing local density. Within unmanipulated aggregations of Efflatounaria, per-capita rates of asexual recruitment were higher at low density, but colony survivorship was lower. Furthermore, the effect of density on stolonal growth and dispersal of daughter colonies varied as a function of a colony's history of disturbance. Disturbance was simulated by detaching from the substrate a newly budded colony that was still connected by a stolon to the parent colony. At low density, these pairs of partially detached colonies moved apart, while at high density, stolonally connected colonies moved closer together. Our results suggest that Efflatounaria employs a plastic life-history strategy that promotes recovery from injuries and the formation of dense aggregations.

Biogeographical processes that influence speciation and extinction rates determine the size and composition of this regional species pool. Community ecologists are beginning to recognize the importance of these biogeographical processes in influencing diversity patterns among local communities, but the potential for local interactions to influence biogeographical processes, especially speciation, has been little considered. In this paper I discuss one mechanism by which variation in the strengths of local interactions can influence the potential for population differentiation and thus for influencing speciation rates in the allopatric model of speciation. When more than one selective agent acts on the phenotype, the shape of the overall fitness surface depends critically on the relative strengths of the various selective agents. If one selective agent, which imparts strong selection, acts in all populations of a species, population differentiation via adaptation to local ecological conditions or via differentiation of sexual systems is retarded because the overall fitness surface in all populations strongly resembles the shape of the strongest selective agent. Consequently, the potential for speciation is reduced. Alternatively, if selective agents in various populations impart relatively equitable strengths of selection, the potential for differences in the overall fitness surfaces among populations is enhanced, which will enhance the potential for population differentiation and thus speciation. Analogous results obtain when multiple selective agents impact genetically correlated characters. Because the strength of selection generated by a species interaction should increase with the strength of the interaction, and because fewer species can usually coexist when the strengths of interactions are greater, the number of coexisting species and the potential for speciation in component taxa may covary among communities. This analysis indicates that the relative strengths of interactions can be as important to diversification in communities as the number of niche dimensions along which differentiation can occur.",58,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,43,10.2307/2265533,Biogeographic processes | Multiple selective agents | Natural selection | Population differentiation | Speciation | Species diversity,NA,NA,NA

Marrubium plants under Retama had greater specific leaf area, leaf mass, shoot mass, leaf area, more flowers, a higher nitrogen (N) concentration in leaf tissue, and more N per plant than isolated plants, suggesting a facilitative effect of Retama on Marrubium including increased availability of resources. Biomass of 1-yr-old cladodes, total biomass, total nitrogen content of 3-yr-old branches, and shoot water potential at midday were higher for Retama shrubs with Marrubium beneath them than in shrubs without Marrubium.

Similarly, analyses of the effect that variance in each demographic parameter had on variability in subsequent adult population size also showed a disproportionate effect of adult survivorship on adult population sizes. In other words, high variability in a demographic estimate did not always result in high variability in population size.

This hypothesis was tested for the moose (Alces alces) by comparing regional variation in life history characteristics in four Norwegian study areas, chosen to represent a gradient both in summer and winter range conditions. The rate of body growth was most rapid in the northern study area with the best summer ranges. Lowest body growth occurred in the population living under the poorest winter conditions. After snow-free winters the rate of body growth increased substantially, leading to large annual variations in yearling body masses. These differences in growth lead to significant age-specific differences between populations in female carcass masses in autumn. Probability of maturing as a yearling increased with body mass in the three southern populations. In contrast, in the northern study area no such relationship was found, leading to a delayed age at maturity in the population with the largest females. This shows that the relationship between age at maturity and body mass differs regionally, suggesting different selective regimes. The peak timing of ovulation of old females in the autumn showed a latitudinal delay. Females in the alpine population, with the poorest winter conditions, had significantly later mean calving dates and produced fewest calves per year. Gestation length appears to be dependent on nutritional condition of females during pregnancy. Mortality was highest in the northern study area where most of the deaths occurred during the summer. Very few calves died during the winter. These results suggest that a stable high-density equilibrium between moose and their food resources as expected from the food limitation hypothesis is unlikely. The decrease in fecundity and the increase in mortality under poor nutritional conditions during the winter has only a small effect on the population growth rate and is therefore unlikely to have a strong regulatory effect.

This paper shows that the mite pierces Drosophila integument and ingests haemolymph while attached to the abdomen of its host. Among field-caught flies, there was a strong negative relationship between mite load and wet mass of adult flies of both sexes. Thus, M. subbadius is an ectoparasite of D. nigrospiracula, contrary to the widespread belief that macrochelids form only phoretic associations with adult flies. The parasite harms its host in many ways. Under laboratory conditions, there was a significant negative effect of mite load on survivorship. In the field, there was a significant negative relationship between mite load and number of eggs carried by sexually mature females, suggesting that infested females resorb their oocytes to compensate for nutritional stress imposed by feeding mites. Likewise, in the laboratory, infestation lengthened somewhat the period prior to onset of oviposition, and decreased the number of eggs laid by females over their life. However, mite-infested females maintained on a yeast-supplemented diet overcame the potentially debilitating effects of mites, and were actually slightly, but not significantly, more fertile than uninfested females. Since the dietary conditions of flies influenced the degree to which fecundity was affected, the debilitating effect of mites is comparable to that of starvation. This conclusion derives support from the observation that laboratory females infested for 4 d, but whose mites were subsequently removed, produced fewer progeny than uninfested females. Although this effect was significant only among old females, it nevertheless indicates that the observed effects of mites on fecundity are not the result of mechanical constraints on oviposition behavior.

The utility of morphological variables as ecological indicators depends upon our understanding of how the variable affects the ability of the organism to perform a particular task. Functional morphological analyses identify those features that can be directly related to behavioral performance and help to distinguish causal functional relationships from spurious correlations. The behavioral abilities of the individual, in turn, shape patterns of resource use and fitness by placing limits on the range of resources that can be utilized and by shaping the cost/benefit curve for resource choices. Examples from research on the feeding biology of North American sunfishes are discussed to illustrate how functional morphology can be used to provide explanations for differences between species in patterns of prey use, patterns of habitat use, ontogenetic diet switches, and population size. Trends from analyses of the evolution of fish feeding mechanisms suggest specific functional features that are most likely to vary among taxa and underlie differences in feeding performance and diet. Included in this group of predictive variables are the organization of lever arms in the jaw opening and closing systems, the size of the mouth, and the size of muscles used in prey-crushing behaviors.

The other set of eight enclosures was located in a shallow area of the lake (3.5 m) where the water does not thermally stratify.

However, fish additions increased the number of algal cells in both the shallow and deep enclosures, independently of nutrients, because of an increase in small cells: the proportion of nanoplankton cells was significantly greater in the presence of fish. Fertilization increased the large nanoplankton fraction (10-20 μm) in the deep enclosures, but had no significant effect on the size distribution of algal biomass in the shallow enclosures.

However, no studies have unequivocally demonstrated the asynchrony among patches, low dispersal rates, and rescue effects that prove metapopulation dynamics extend persistence. We used a protist predator-prey pair to show that spatial subdivision lengthens persistence through metapopulation dynamics. The pair comprised the predaceous ciliate, Didinium nasutum, feeding on the bacterivorous ciliate, Colpidium cf. striatum. A replicated experiment assessed how habitat subdivision affects persistence. Undivided habitats were of four volumes: 30, 180, 270, and 750 mL. Subdivided microcosms, or ""arrays,"" were groups of nine or 25 linked 30-mL bottles (270 or 750 mL total volume). In arrays, predators and prey persisted for 130 d (602 prey and 437 predator generations), at which point the experiment ended. Predators went extinct in undivided microcosms of equivalent volumes within a mean of only 70 d. Predators persisted for a mean of just 19 d in isolated 30-mL bottles (equivalent to isolated patches of arrays). In a separate experiment, prey were driven extinct in four of 15 isolated 30-mL bottles, and persistence times of predators were broadly similar. We documented the following hallmarks of metapopulation dynamics: (1) asynchronous fluctuations in different subpopulations; (2) frequent local prey extinctions and recolonizations; (3) persistence of protists in arrays, despite extinction of isolated local populations; and (4) rescue effects in predator populations. Other experiments measured dispersal rates and the effects on local dynamics of immigrant predators and prey, and initial predator : prey ratios. Only a small fraction of protists dispersed within a generation, consistent with metapopulation dynamics. Immigration of predators increased the frequency of local extinctions of prey, and immigration of prey increased the persistence of both predators and prey. Higher initial predator : prey ratios decreased the persistence of prey in undivided volumes. Although the pair persisted regionally in arrays, data indicated that local extinctions of prey were common.

Field metabolic rates (FMR) and feeding rates (estimated from rates of water influx and rates of change in dry mass) were highly variable. This variability was manifested at several levels, including seasonal changes within populations, year-to-year differences within populations, and differences between populations. Underlying observed patterns and contrasts was considerable variation among individuals. Much of the variation in energetic variables was associated with a single climatic variable, rainfall. Seasonal, annual, and interpopulation differences in FMR and foraging rates corresponded to differences in availability of free-standing water from rainstorms. At least some of the differences among individuals were apparently due to differences in proclivity or ability to drink. Tortoises had very low FMRs relative to other reptiles, which allowed them to tolerate long periods of chronic energy shortage during a drought. Calculations suggested that tortoises experienced a net loss of energy on their spring diet of succulent annual plants. If so, tortoises require drier forage to accrue an energy profit, which emphasizes their reliance on drinking rainwater (which can be stored in the bladder and resorbed later to hydrate dry forage). Further, it suggests that growth (as protein deposition) and net acquisition of energy may be temporally decoupled in desert tortoises, which has potential consequences for geographic variation in life history traits. Energy acquisition and expenditure in desert tortoises are thus strongly constrained by the contingencies of rainfall, both indirectly through effects on availability and quality of food, and directly through reliance on free-standing water for drinking, which is apparently necessary for achieving a net annual energy profit.",89,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,52,10.2307/2265787,Desert herbivore | Field energetics | Gopherus agassizii | Individual variation | Population differences | Rainfall regime | Seasonal effects | Tortoise,NA,NA,NA

We caught 34 entire fish shoals in a lake, and for each shoal member, we identified the species, measured its body length, and counted the number of black spots (indicating the presence of a parasitic trematode worm) visible through their skin. We also recorded two habitat characteristics, water depth and distance to cover, at the location where each of the 34 shoals was caught to ascertain whether (and to which degree) the spatial distributions of different fish species and fish size classes were determined by certain habitat characteristics. A comparison between the observed and the randomly assorted shoals (obtained through computer simulations) revealed that fish at our study site exhibited a significant association with conspecifics and with individuals of similar body size (within and across species); that is, shoals were assorted by species and by individual body size. Parasite-assortative shoaling was not observed. Different species (and to a lesser degree different size classes within species) showed a tendency to occur in different microhabitats. Nevertheless, despite some degree of habitat segregation, there remained considerable spatial overlap between the different species and fish body size classes.

Throughout the study, sport shooting was stopped on the area where the main work was done. During 1979-1982, before the experimental removal of cocks began, numbers over the whole moor rose from a trough at the start of the study.

The removal of cocks resulted in similar numbers of hens being lost from the breeding population. The main demographic cause of population change on control (cycling) and experimental (cycle broken) areas was variation in the recruitment of young cocks to the spring population.

At intermediate elevations in the Great Basin Artemisia and P. monophylla are restricted to unaltered desert soils, whereas P. ponderosa is restricted to acidic, nutrient-poor altered andesite.

Here, and in other semiarid and arid regions, channel recovery after a flood may take several decades. As a result, flood history strongly influences spatial and temporal variability in bottomland vegetation. Interpretation of these patterns must be based on understanding the long-term response of bottomland morphology and vegetation to specific floods. A major flood in 1965 on Plum Creek, a perennial sandbed stream, removed most of the bottomland vegetatiqn and transformed the single-thread stream into a wider, braided channel. Channel narrowing began in 1973 and continues today. In 1991, we determined occurrences of 150 vascular plant species in 341 plots (0.5 m2) along a 7-km reach of Plum Creek near Louviers, Colorado. We related patterns of vegetation to elevation, litter cover, vegetative cover, sediment particle size, shade, and year of formation of the underlying surface (based on age of the excavated root flare of the oldest woody plants). Geomorphic investigation determined that Plum Creek fluvial surfaces sort into five groups by year of formation: terraces of fine sand formed before 1965; terraces of coarse sand deposited by the 1965 flood; stable bars formed by channel narrowing during periods of relatively high bed level (1973-1986); stable bars similarly formed during a recent period of low bed level (1987-1990); and the present channel bed (1991). Canonical correspondence analysis indicates a strong influence of elevation and litter cover, and lesser effects of vegetative cover, shade, and sediment particle size. However, the sum of all canonical eigenvalues explained by these factors is less than that explained by an analysis including only the dummy variables that define the five geomorphically determined age groups. The effect of age group is significant even when all five other environmental variables are specified as covariables. Therefore, the process of postflood channel narrowing has a dominant influence on vegetation pattern. Channel narrowing at Plum Creek includes a successional process: annual and perennial plants become established on the channel bed, sediment accretes around the vegetation, and increasing litter cover, shade, and scarcity of water eliminate species that are not rhizomatous perennials. However, successional trajectories of individual surfaces are modified by flow-related fluctuations of the bed level; surfaces deposited by the 1965 flood have had distinct sediment and vegetation since their formation. Species richness is highest on surfaces dating to 1987-1990; the many species restricted to this transitory assemblage are perpetuated by flood-related fluctuations in channel width. Since the 1965 flood, seedling establishment of the dominant trees (genus Populus) has occurred only on low surfaces formed during channel narrowing. Thus, the flood has indirectly promoted Populus establishment over a 26-yr period.",134,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,59,10.2307/2265710,Bottomland vegetation | Channel narrowing | Colorado | Cottonwood | Dendrochronology | Disturbance | Flood | Patch dynamics | Succession,NA,NA,NA

Selective exclusion of Prochilodus resulted in striking changes in community structure as measured by patterns of sediment accrual and the composition of algal and invertebrate assemblages. Highly significant increases in total dry mass and in ash-free dry mass of sediments accruing on stream-bottom substrates were observed almost immediately following the exclusion of Prochilodus. Moreover, the composition of algal and invertebrate assemblages was significantly modified by Prochilodus.

Our ability to quantitatively predict these impacts is, in part, limited by the absence of suitable plant-spread models and by inadequate parameter estimates for such models. This paper explores the effects of model, plant, and environmental attributes on predicted rates and patterns of spread of alien pine trees (Pinus spp.) in South African fynbos (a mediterranean-type shrubland). A factorial experimental design was used to: (1) compare the predictions of a simple reaction-diffusion model and a spatially explicit, individual-based simulation model; (2) investigate the sensitivity of predicted rates and patterns of spread to parameter values; and (3) quantify the effects of the simulation model's spatial grain on its predictions. The results show that the spatial simulation model places greater emphasis on interactions among ecological processes than does the reaction-diffusion model. This ensures that the predictions of the two models differ substantially for some factor combinations. The most important factor in the model is dispersal ability. Fire frequency, fecundity, and age of reproductive maturity are less important, while adult mortality has little effect on the model's predictions. The simulation model's predictions are sensitive to the model's spatial grain. This suggests that simulation models that use matrices as a spatial framework should ensure that the spatial grain of the model is compatible with the spatial processes being modeled. We conclude that parameter estimation and model development must be integrated procedures. This will ensure that the model's structure is compatible with the biological processes being modeled.

In these experiments, glucose was the sole source of carbon provided, and its concentration was limiting to population density. Thus, the stable polymorphism did not conform to a simple model of competitive exclusion. In similar experiments also with glucose as the sole resource, we considered two hypotheses that might explain the observed coexistence: (1) a strictly demographic trade-off, such that one genotype is competitively superior when glucose is abundant whereas the other genotype is the better competitor for sparse glucose; and (2) a cross-feeding interaction, whereby the superior competitor for glucose excretes a metabolite that acts as a second resource for which the other genotype is the better competitor. Although there was a demographic tradeoff, the advantage to the superior competitor at high glucose concentrations was too large (given the initial concentration of glucose used in these experiments) to allow the second genotype to invade when rare at the observed rate. Therefore, the second genotype must have had some other advantage that allowed it to readily invade a population of the superior competitor for glucose. Indeed, the second genotype could increase in abundance after glucose was depleted, but only in the presence of the superior competitor for glucose, thus implicating a cross-feeding interaction.

We examined the reproductive success of Thick-billed Murres breeding at Coats Island, Northwest Territories, Canada to assess the extent to which a seasonal decline in success could be accounted for by correlations between the age of the birds and their date of laying. In 1990 and 1991 reproductive success declined with date of laying: this decline was due mainly to a decline in the proportion of eggs that hatched. No corresponding decline was found in the proportion of hatchlings that reached fledging age. Pairs containing at least one young (4- or 5-yr-old) bird laid later and hatched a lower proportion of eggs than those containing at least one older (>7-yr-old) bird. The two groups did not differ in the proportion of hatchlings reared. When looked at separately, the proportions of young and older birds that succeeded in hatching their egg were not affected by date of laying. When the two age groups were combined, the trends with date were similar to those found for a large sample, mostly birds of unknown age. To correct for differences in timing of laying, a sample of early breeders was induced to lay replacement eggs 14 d later. These experimental pairs were as successful as early control breeders. A greater proportion of the experimentally delayed pairs hatched chicks than birds laying for the first time at a similar date. The experimental pairs were also more successful than young birds that bred earlier. The growth of experimental and control chicks did not differ. However, the 14-d-old chicks of young pairs were lighter than those of experienced breeders, suggesting poorer provisioning by the young breeders.

Use of a correlated random walk as a null hypothesis for movement suggests that the fractal dimension should grade smoothly from near 1 at very small spatial scales to near 2 at very large spatial scales. Several empirical data sets exhibit a qualitative pattern in agreement with this prediction.

However, epidemiological models indicate that increased contact among populations enhances the spread of disease and can trigger epidemics. I have synthesized elements of mathematical epidemiology with metapopulation models. An analytic model showed that highly contagious diseases of moderate severity spread widely, increasing the probability of metapopulation extinction. I also used a simulation model to examine four spatial arrangements of populations: island, necklace, loop, and spider. When infected individuals were allowed to move freely among populations, all of the arrangements exhibited qualitative behavior similar to that exhibited by the analytic models. The most dangerous diseases were those for which infected populations grew large enough to produce dispersers that infected other populations, but which also reduced the geometric rate of increase for infected populations to near unity. Under those conditions, random demographic and environmental events caused metapopulation extinction. Major differences among the spatial arrangements emerged when a quarantine population was established. A centralized quarantine in the spider and necklace arrangement yielded the most dramatic reductions in metapopulation extinction probability. A single quarantine patch was of little value in an island arrangement. These results have several implications for managing metapopulations. Most notably, some spatial arrangements of populations are more amenable to disease control than others, and establishing a quarantine population can increase the probability of detecting new diseases and reduce the impact of diseases that do appear.",267,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,69,10.2307/2265556,Conservation corridor | Disease | Epidemiology | Extinction | Metapopulation | Quarantine | Translocation | Wildlife management,NA,NA,NA

Alternatively, predation cannot be responsible for habitat partitioning if all species rank the safety of habitats similarly. I developed predictions to test these two hypotheses, using data on the rates at which animals scan the environment for predators while they forage. Preliminary results suggest that predation is unlikely to be responsible for the habitat preferences of sparrow species wintering along an elevational gradient in the Sonoran Desert of southern California, USA. Two predictions can be tested using vigilance behavior. (1) If species differ in which habitats they are safest from predation, some species will experience increased risk when moved from one habitat to another, whereas other species will experience decreased risk; changes in vigilance levels between habitats will be inconsistent among species. (2) If species are safest in the same habitat, they will experience similar changes in risk between habitats, and should exhibit similar changes in vigilance levels between habitats. Sage Sparrows (Amphispiza belli) and Black-throated Sparrows (A. bilineata) spend the winter in different habitats. I recorded vigilance levels in each habitat while birds foraged on naturally occurring seeds in a portable aviary. Sage Sparrows and Black-throated Sparrows exhibited similar changes in vigilance between habitats, suggesting that these two species are safest in the same habitat, and that predation is unlikely to explain their habitat preferences. Also, I tested and found support for the prediction from vigilance theory that food abundance affects vigilance level.

There was no significant correlation between population size and plant size in terms of number of floral shoots or number of flower-producing leaf nodes per shoot. However, there was a positive relationship between population size and seed production per flower and between population size and total seed number per plant. In contrast, there was no significant correlation between population size and seed production of flowers that had received supplemental pollination. In both years, the difference in mean seed production per flower between hand-pollinated flowers and controls decreased with increasing population size. In two of five populations, the effect of supplemental pollination differed significantly among morphs. Seed production was more likely to be pollinator limited in long-styled than in short-styled plants, but this difference could not be attributed to a preponderance of the long-styled morph in the studied populations. Results of the supplemental hand-pollinations indicate that the positive correlation between population size and seed production is a function of insufficient pollen transfer in small populations.

If both bacteria and phytoplankton are mineral nutrient limited, this should provide the mixotrophs with the double benefit of combining removal of their competitor with ingestion of the limiting nutrient in pelleted form. It is the objective of this study to expand the classical theories of competition and predation to explore the effect on the microbial food web of one trophic group possessing both strategies. In a chemostat scenario, we analyzed the two-species situation of a mixotroph preying on mineral-nutrient-limited bacteria, and also the situations when the mixotroph in addition has to compete with specialized photoautotrophic and phagotrophic protists, each superior to the mixotroph in their specialized nutritional modes. In the mixotroph-bacteria relationship, somewhat paradoxically, high predatory abilities will reduce the quantitative importance of predation in the mixotroph's nutrition. The reason is a strong reduction in prey abundance, allowing the mixotroph to survive as a photoautotroph despite its low competitive ability. In the three-species case with mixotrophs, bacteria, and specialized phagotrophs, it is shown that the mixotroph can compensate for a ""price"" paid in reduced affinity for bacterial prey by a sufficiently high affinity for mineral nutrients. In the other three-species case where the mixotroph has to compete with a specialized photoautotroph, the situation is more complex; there is an optimum value for the mixotroph's predatory ability at which mixotroph biomass is maximized. In the general situation with all four species (bacteria, mixotrophs, and specialized auto- and phagotrophs) potentially present, different mixotrophic strategies will alter the equilibrium composition of the consortium, with the mixotroph being most successful with a high affinity for nutrients and an intermediate affinity for bacteria.

Seedlings were followed in nearby plots to estimate the density of germinated seedlings and their reproductive success. Long-term data collected from permanent plots over a 10-yr period were used to calculate temporal variation in reproductive success for each species. Species with higher temporal variation in reproductive success had lower germination fractions and smaller seeds, consistent with the theory that seed dormancy and large seed size are partially substitutable bet-hedging strategies.

The amphibian fauna may provide an important indicator of the impact of anthropogenic disturbance to wetland ecosystems. We assessed the status of 11 amphibian species in southwestern Ontario, Canada, by estimating species richness, changes in presence and absence, and incidence at 97 ponds from 1992 to 1994. We detected a significant reduction in amphibian species richness in one of three regions. This loss of diversity relative to the historical species complement is a consequence of the land use history. We observed surprisingly high turnover of species at ponds, with increased incidence varying from 0.07 to 0.29 species per pond per year, and decreased incidence ranging from 0.16 to 0.30 species per pond per year. The incidence of common species across years included both declines (leopard frog, Rana pipiens) and increases (American toad, Bufo americanus). For eight relatively rare species, losses exceeded gains between 1992 and 1993, but this pattern was reversed between 1993 and 1994. Understanding environmental factors that determine the status of species will require an expanded, large-scale view of groups of populations (metapopulations) and their spatial dynamics.",167,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,77,10.2307/2265703,Amphibian status | Colonization | Community dynamics | Extinction | Local vs. Regional scale | Metapopulations | Population dynamics | Species incidence | Species persistence | Species richness,NA,NA,NA

Changes in peak and background charcoal suggest that changes in fire regime have accompanied the principal vegetation and climatic changes of the last 10400 yr. A distribution of return times (50-200-yr intervals) similar to parts of modern boreal Canada prevailed when late-Glacial spruce woodland dominated the site. Expansion of Pinus banksiana appears to have altered the fire regime to one of crown fires with high particulate emissions, but return intervals similar to those of the preceding Picea forest. Expansion of Pinus strobus might be linked to change in fire occurrence, but the broad dispersal of Pinus pollen makes interpretation difficult. If Pinus strobus expansion around the site is reflected in its pollen curve, then that expansion coincides with a time of frequent fire. Alternatively, if increasing pollen abundance precedes the local expansion of trees, as has been observed elsewhere, then local expansion might correspond to an abrupt decline in fire frequency and in regional importance of fire. An abrupt decline in background charcoal follows a fire and coincides (±100 yr) with the expansion of hardwood taxa such as Fagus. The decline in background charcoal occurs over several years, suggesting that it may be linked to effects of hardwood expansion on fuels. Fires do not appear to have occurred during the time of hardwood dominance, suggesting that fire may not be an explanation for maintenance of species diversity in this deciduous forest.

In two populations of Aquilegia caerulea, both fruit and seed set decreased significantly between early and late flowers. Low fruit and seed set of late flowers was not due to pollen limitation. Fruit and seed set of late flowers remained low when extra pollen was added to these flowers (pollen quantity), or when all flowers on an inflorescence received self or outcross pollen (pollen quality). While competition for resources occurred among flowers, resource limitation was not responsible for the low fruit and seed set of late flowers. Indeed, preventing pollination of late flowers significantly increased both fruit and seed set of early flowers, but fruit and seed set of late flowers remained low when early flowers were prevented from setting fruits. Late flowers were not just smaller or larger replicates of early flowers, as they allocated more reproductive resources to male function relative to early flowers. Neither herbivory nor architectural constraints could explain the low fruit and seed set of late flowers. While previously published adaptive explanations proposed to explain the low fruit and seed set of late flowers have emphasized a positive aspect to female reproductive success, it is suggested here that both male and female functions should be considered.

Previous studies indicated that frequently associated aquatic shredders strongly prefer yellowed-senescent leaves over fresh-green foliage, because the latter releases much more isothiocyanate than senescent watercress. When the action of myrosinase was blocked by heating the tissue, the shredders' preference shifted to heated-green tissue, which contains much more nitrogen than that found in senescent tissue. Here we report a series of no-choice experiments on various tissue types designed to determine intermediate and long-term consumption rates and associated impacts on growth and survival of shredders associated with watercress. The amphipod Gammarus pseudolimnaeus, the caddisflies Pycnopsyche sp., Hesperophylax designatus, and Limnephilus sp., and the snail Physella gyrina, all consumed much more senescent than fresh-green tissue. In long-term tests with G. pseudolimnaeus, H. designatus, and Limnephilus sp., growth was negative or zero on the defended fresh-green tissue and often highest on heated-green tissue. Reaction to glucosinolates differed among shredders. For the caddisflies, growth and survival were positively correlated with bulk tissue and nitrogen consumption, which were highest for heated-green tissue. However, amphipod survival was significantly lowered on heated-green watercress, although it was readily consumed. Therefore, consumption of high-glucosinolate tissue was detrimental to the amphipods but not to caddisflies. Our results indicate that the glucosinolate-myrosinase system defends live green watercress against herbivory by an array of aquatic invertebrates. These generalist herbivores forgo eating high-quality fresh-green leaves because of plant defenses and instead settle for lower quality senescent leaves. When the defense system was experimentally shut down, these herbivores readily consumed young green tissue and frequently showed higher growth rates than those achieved on the senescent, but undefended, leaves they typically consume.

This view is implicit in many discussions of angiosperm evolution and plant-pollinator coevolution and in the long-standing concept of ""pollination syndromes."" But actual pollination systems often are more generalized and dynamic than these traditions might suggest. To illustrate the range of specialization and generalization in pollinators' use of plants and vice versa, we draw on studies of two floras in the United States, and of members of several plant families and solitary bee genera. We also summarize a recent study of one local flora which suggests that, although the colors of flowers are aggregated in ""phenotype space,"" there is no strong association with pollinator types as pollination syndromes would predict. That moderate to substantial generalization often occurs is not surprising on theoretical grounds. Plant generalization is predicted by a simple model as long as temporal and spatial variance in pollinator quality is appreciable, different pollinator species do not fluctuate in unison, and they are similar in their pollination effectiveness. Pollinator generalization is predicted when floral rewards are similar across plant species, travel is costly, constraints of behavior and morphology are minor, and/or pollinator lifespan is long relative to flowering of individual plant species. Recognizing that pollination systems often are generalized has important implications. In ecological predictions of plant reproductive success and population dynamics it is useful to widen the focus beyond flower visitors within the ""correct"" pollination syndrome, and to recognize temporal and spatial fluidity of interactions. Behavioral studies of pollinator foraging choices and information-processing abilities will benefit from understanding the selective advantages of generalization. In studies of floral adaptation, microevolution, and plant speciation one should recognize that selection and gene flow vary in time and space and that the contribution of pollinators to reproductive isolation of plant species may be overstated.

Because young larvae of this species interact at very high densities after hatching asynchronously from clumps of egg masses, our efforts focused on these early stages. In one experiment, we varied the combination of sizes (instars) and the presence of food for 233 pairs of early-instar larvae. Cannibalism was uncommon if larvae were of the same instar (only 2.4% of such pairs exhibited cannibalism), frequent (53%) if larvae differed by one instar, and certain (100%) if a two-instar size difference was present. The rate at which cannibalism increased with size differences between larvae was greater when food was absent than it was when food was provided. In a second experiment, we subjected replicate cohorts of newly hatched dragonflies to manipulations of hatching synchrony, initial density, and food availability. Asynchronous hatching over 25 d produced a broad size distribution apparently conducive to cannibalism, whereas synchronous hatching over 3 d initially precluded cannibalism. As a result, strong density-dependent mortality only appeared following the asynchronous hatch. For high-density, asynchronous treatments, cannibalism significantly reduced size variation and tightened size distributions over the course of development. Survivors from high-density treatments were significantly larger than were low-density survivors. More abundant food allowed larvae to reach larger sizes, but did not improve survival. Survival was affected mainly by the density and size distribution of larvae. These results suggest that cannibalism was more important than exploitative competition for food in determining the size and survival of dragonflies in the laboratory.

In order to study the generality of hypotheses about the effect of morphology on foraging ecology, I investigated the foraging decisions of Chilean sigmodontine rodents (Muridae) in the laboratory, experimentally manipulating nocturnal illumination (a surrogate of predation risk) and food distribution. Three coexisting rodent species from the Chilean matorral were compared: two quadrupeds, one with large body size (Phyllotis darwini) and another with small body size (Abrothrix olivaceus), and one small species with bipedal escape behavior (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus). The species did not differ in patch utilization and food consumption in response to different food distributions. However, there was an overall significant effect of illumination on food consumption. When illumination was higher, A. olivaceus and P. darwini increased food transportation to the refuge and decreased patch consumption and total food consumption. They also increased significantly the number of trips between food patch and refuge. P. darwini showed the most cautious foraging behavior. O. longicaudatus was insensitive to different conditions of illumination. It is argued that a large body size and quadrupedal locomotion seem to confer higher sensitivity to nocturnal illumination. Bipedality may confer less vulnerability to predation, and quadrupedal species show facultative central-place foraging, diminishing a possible greater vulnerability to potential risk.

(2) Conflicting processes: one source of mortality may act to decrease mortality over time (e.g., group size effects), while another acts to increase it (e.g., degenerative senescence). Age-specific data, measures of intrinsic quality that are independent of mortality, and exposure of sources of heterogeneity and of conflicting processes allow us to demonstrate a clear pattern of actuarial senescence in an unmanipulated, natural population of long-lived birds. The slow rate of increase in mortality is consistent with the hypothesis that mortality increases more slowly with age in birds than in mammals.",54,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,92,10.2307/2265739,Actuarial senescence | Age-dependent mortality | Demography | Florida Scrub Jay | Heterogeneity | Life history | Mortality | Senescence | Vertebrate | Weibull model,NA,NA,NA

Colonies live for 15-20 yr, reaching reproductive age and a stable size at ≈ 5 yr. Spatial distributions were measured for 6 yr (1988-1993) in a population of ≈ 250 colonies of known age. The probability that a 1-yr-old colony occurs in a given location is related to the distance to, and ages of, its five nearest conspecific neighbors. One-year-old colonies are most likely to occur near small, 2- and 3-yr-old colonies. Neighboring colonies encounter each other when foragers of both colonies search the same area on the same day. The probability of an encounter between two colonies decreases with the distance between their nests. For colonies of all ages, encounters are most likely with their larger neighbors, ≥5 yr old. Encounters are more likely if there was an encounter the previous day, and this effect can overwhelm the effect of distance. Two-yr-old colonies are more likely than colonies of other ages to lose ground in repeated encounters with a particular neighbor. Though encounters are frequent, their costs are low: few of the foragers on a trail that meets a neighbor's actually encounter an ant of the neighboring colony, and interaction with a neighboring colony does not increase the typical duration of a foraging trip. If foragers of two colonies do meet, most fights are brief, with few resulting in injury or death.

The density of ant-nest entrances and the number of pitfall-trap captures of ant foragers were significantly lower in the ant lion zone than in the adjacent forest or grassland.

Over a 24-h period, ants foraged continuously at tuna-fish baits placed on the forest floor, but never utilized baits placed within the ant lion zone. Field behavioral tests with individual ant foragers confirmed that the risk of predation from ant lions was high for common ant species in the assemblage. Among species, predation risk was negatively correlated with worker body mass. Manipulative field experiments tested whether ants use biotic or abiotic cues to avoid ant lion aggregations. Ants foraged readily at baits on the forest floor and baits placed in the center of experimental sand patches, but they avoided baits placed in sand patches that contained ant lions. Ant foraging was also substantially lower in patches from which ant lions had been removed 3 h prior to the start of the experiment.

We tested predictions about the landscape mosaic at three levels of resolution: the forest as a whole, gaps, and gapmakers. In addition to canopy gaps arising from the patchy mortality of dominant trees (developmental gaps), we described the prevalence and characteristics of gaps arising from edaphic and topographic features. Roughly 56% of the forest area is influenced to some degree by canopy openings (canopy gap + expanded gap), with 30% of forest area in canopy gaps averaged over all sites (14% developmental canopy gaps and 16% in edaphic canopy gaps). Within the most intensively sampled biogeoclimatic subzone, 73% of gaps were developmental in origin. The majority of edaphic gaps result from streamcourses. Though percent area in developmental canopy gaps was similar across stand age classes, gaps and gapmakers were more common in old growth than in mature stands. Most developmental gaps resulted from the mortality of more than one tree: 96% of the developmental gaps had more than one gapmaker, and 50% had three or more. Mature stands had a significantly higher number of gapmakers per gap than old-growth stands. Old-growth forests were thus dominated by many small gaps and mature forests by fewer larger gaps. Drier and wetter sites had more gapmakers per gap than did stands on mesic sites. The number of decay classes of gapmakers in developmental gaps increases with number of gapmakers per gap, indicating that larger gaps represent the combined effects of distinct mortality events separated in time, rather than single large events. Gapmakers in developmental gaps were distributed broadly and evenly over the range of decay classes, suggesting a continuous pattern of recruitment of gapmakers rather than larger episodic mortality events. The snapping of boles and standing death were the most common modes of gapmaker mortality, together accounting for 76% of the mortality of all gapmakers. Uprooting was the least common mode of gapmaker mortality in both mature and old-growth forests (23.6% and 15.6%, respectively; 20.6% of all gapmakers) and uprooting was more common in drier and wetter sites than in mesic sites. These general trends in gap-phase structure and gap formation processes are consistent with data on gaps and forest age structure collected elsewhere on the British Columbia coast, suggesting that a regime of small-scale, low-intensity disturbance is common in the old-growth forests of coastal British Columbia. We estimate that, in the absence of large-scale disturbances, turnover time for this forest is between 350 and 950 yr, resulting in ubiquitous late successional character throughout the landscape mosaic.

Spatial patterns of distribution were consistent within seasons and between years at both spatial scales. Although recruitment showed a seasonal pattern, there were few inter-annual differences at any spatial scale. At the largest scale, recruitment varied significantly among sites around the island, and a unique pattern of distribution was observed. On the windward shore, recruitment ranged from high on the eastern (upcurrent) end to low on western end of the island. Recruitment showed the opposite pattern on the leeward shore, ranging from low on the eastern end to high on the western end. At the transect scale, certain features of the habitat significantly predicted recruitment density. None of the microhabitat features that predicted recruitment at the small scale could explain patterns of recruitment observed at the large scale. In contrast, physical processes affecting larval availability or transport were more important than habitat in determining the spatial patterns of recruitment at this scale. Thus, physical occanographic processes appeared to be responsible for patterns of recruitment to the two shores of St. Croix, and to sites along those shores.

The purpose of this paper is to report on field and laboratory experiments that link this pattern of abundance to biotic interactions among larvae. In the first field experiment, growth and survival were compared in single and mixed species treatments in littoral enclosures. Larvae, which eat mainly vascular plant detritus, grew at similar rates among treatments in both temporary and permanent habitats suggesting that exploitative competition is not important under natural food levels and caddisfly densities. However, the survival of Limnephilus larvae was reduced in the presence of Asynarchus larvae. Subsequent behavioral studies in laboratory arenas revealed that Asynarchus larvae are extremely aggressive predators on Limnephilus larvae. In a second field experiment we manipulated the relative sizes of larvae and found that Limnephilus larvae were preyed on only when Asynarchus larvae had the same size advantage observed in natural populations. Our data suggest that the dominance of Asynarchus larvae in temporary habitats is due to asymmetric intraguild predation (IGP) facilitated by a phenological head start in development. These data do not explain the dominance of Limnephilus larvae in permanent basins, which we show elsewhere to be an indirect effect of salamander predation. Behavioral observations also revealed that Asynarchus larvae are cannibalistic. In contrast to the IGP on Limnephilus larvae, Asynarchus cannibalism occurs among same-sized larvae and often involves the mobbing of one victim by several conspecifics. In a third field experiment, we found that Asynarchus cannibalism was not density-dependent and occurred even at low larval densities.

We examined the effects of three tomato allelochemicals (chlorogenic acid, rutin, and tomatine) and two thermal regimes (21°:10°C and 26°:15°C, representing spring and summer respectively) on three insect herbivores: a Solanaceae specialist, Manduca sexta, and the polyphagous Helicoverpa zea and Spodoptera exigua. The alkaloid tomatine slowed development of the polyphagous H. zea, but the two phenolics had little effect. Development of the polyphagous S. exigua was faster with tomatine at the cool thermal regime, and slower with the two phenolics together at the warm thermal regime. All three of the tomato allelochemicals slowed development of the specialist M. sexta. Values of approximate digestibility (or assimilation efficiency) for the two polyphagous species spanned a range twice that of the Solanaceae specialist, increasing when allelochemicals were added to diet. Our techniques permitted us to separate pre- and post-ingestive effects of allelochemicals on mass gained, but we found complex interaction of allelochemicals and of temperature and allelochemicals. The effects of an allelochemical on larval performance often depended on the combination of other allelochemicals in the diet. But the allelochemicals did not always have a negative effect, and multiple allelochemicals did not always have a more negative effect than a single allelochemical. Interaction between thermal regime and the allelochemicals was also common. For example, whether rutin had a negative, neutral, or positive effect on relative growth rate of S. exigua depended on thermal regime and presence or absence of chlorogenic acid. Often the negative effect of an allelochemical was greater at the warm regime than at the cool regime, but not consistently so. Another experiment showed that thermal regime did not affect allelochemical concentration in the diets. Over time (7 d), only tomatine concentration declined. Therefore, the interactive effects of thermal regime and allelochemicals on the insect herbivores were not an artifact of the experimental procedures. Overall, the results indicated that insect performance is not a simple function of temperature and food quality because interactions occur between these factors.

The pyrethroid insecticide, fenvalerate, was applied to experimental plots in an old field near Ithaca, New York, on staggered schedules so as to produce sets of plants that had experienced different levels of herbivory over different combinatons of years. By comparing the performance of plants in the different treatments, I was able to measure both the contemporaneous and cumulative effects of insect herbivores on the growth and flowering of goldenrods. This protocol also provided the basis for estimating herbivore pressure (defined as the loss in plant performance that is associated with the presence of herbivores) by two independent procedures, the ""experimental suppression"" approach and the ""correlation with herbivore load"" approach, which served as checks on various potential sources of error. I have taken this opportunity to illustrate the pitfalls and advantages of the two approaches within the context of a concrete example. The experiment demonstrated that goldenrods order their response to herbivory so as to favor maintenance of established individuals over seed production; both the proportion of stems that bloomed and the size of individual inflorescences were reduced during years when herbivore loads were too low to produce a measurable impact on the length and density of stems. Herbivore loads never reached levels sufficient to have detectable effects that carried over to influence plant performance in the following year. In addition, there was no evidence that insects were attracted to lush plants that had escaped herbivore attack the previous year. Relatively small loads, however, had effects that accumulated slowly over a period of years. Interestingly, ramets exhibited a different ordering in their response to the contemporaneous and cumulative effects of herbivory; the mass of inflorescences, the plant attribute that was most sensitive to contemporaneous herbivory, never responded to the effects of herbivory that accumulated over the 6 yr of the experiment. The experiment provided a means for inferring the impact of the herbivore loads that were obtained from censuses of 22 different goldenrod stands over the 6-yr period. These results show that goldenrod stands in central New York can be expected to experience relatively low herbivore loads (<50 mg of herbivore dry mass per metre of stem) over 75% of the time. At these chronic levels herbivores cause a moderate reduction in the production of flowers but exert no measurable influence on stem growth. Infrequently (on the order of 5% of the time), herbivore loads can be expected to exceed 200 mg per metre of stem. At such loads herbivores can completely inhibit flowering and severely stunt vegetative growth. Such damaging loads are caused by population outbreaks of a few dominant insect species whose numbers usually wane before their cumulative impact threatens the goldenrod's persistence in the community.

If food limits distributions, species should forage most successfully in their preferred habitats and should experience poorer food intake rates elsewhere. These same predictions hold if species distributions are shaped by exploitative competition. We tested the foraging success hypothesis and exploitative competition hypothesis as explanations of the habitat distributions of Sage Sparrows (Amphispiza belli), Black-throated Sparrows (A. bilineata), and Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis), which spend the winter in different habitats along an elevational gradient in the Sonoran Desert of southern California. Individuals of each species were transplanted between habitats in a portable aviary and observed while foraging on naturally occurring seeds. Predictions of the foraging success hypothesis and exploitative competition hypothesis were not confirmed. Only Dark-eyed Juncos achieved their highest foraging success in their preferred habitat. Black-throated Sparrows experienced nearly identical foraging success in all three habitats, yet are confined to only one of them naturally. Sage Sparrows foraged more successfully in habitats other than that in which they naturally occur.

Several statistical methods to identify a key factor have subsequently been proposed in the literature. These are, in terms of the familiar relationship, K = K1, + k2 + . . . + kn′ to correlate K with a k, regress K on a k, or regress a k on K, the last method being currently most frequently used.

We studied disappearance of Pied Flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) during four breeding seasons in a woodland area in Norway provided with nest boxes. The main cause of disappearance was probably predation by the European Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus). Disappearance was nonsignificantly higher in females (10% per season, n = 305) than in males (7% per season, n = 269). Female disappearance peaked during egg-laying (0.53% per day), but was also high during the nest-building (0.42% per day) and nestling (0.36% per day) stages. It was low during incubation (0.05% per day), probably because less time was spent outside the nest. Low risk of predation during incubation may help to explain why female body mass remains high during this stage of breeding but drops soon after hatching. Females with selected flight feathers experimentally removed to simulate molt suffered a much higher disappearance per season (24%; n = 109) than did control females (10%, n = 305). This may help to explain why breeding and molt usually are temporally segregated activities in birds. Variation in female body mass and size (wing length, tarsus length), age, previous breeding experience, mating date, laying date, clutch size, and mating status could not account for the variation found in female disappearance. Disappearance was lower in males than in females during the nest-building period, despite the more conspicuous plumage color of males. This may be explained by the fact that only the female builds the nest.

However, few studies have quantitatively linked these approaches to the patch structure of foods in the field. We developed an individual-based model that relates field measurements of the dispersion of benthic foods to search costs and foraging profitability of diving ducks. On Lake Mattamuskeet, North Carolina, Canvasback ducks (Aythya valisineria) eat only the belowground winter buds of the submerged plant Vallisneria americana. We measured and modeled the patch structure of winter buds at the level of potential foraging ""loci,"" defined as contiguous circles l m in diameter. In the field and in the model, Canvasbacks make repeated vertical dives in such loci, foraging in the sediments by touch, before surface-swimming to another locus. We quantified first-order patchiness by fitting a negative binomial distribution to core samples taken at 50-m intervals along transects, to yield the frequencies of loci with different bud densities. Second-order patchiness was measured by taking cores at 1-m increments radiating from each sampling point, and regressing bud density at each sampling point on densities at these increments. No significant correlations were found, indicating that Canvasbacks could not predict food densities based on densities in nearby foraging loci. For the model, we generated food grids from the negative binomial distributions of core samples. Energy costs of diving were calculated by applying aerobic efficiencies (mechanical power output÷aerobic power input) to biomechanical models. Unlike respirometry alone, this method accounts for effects on dive costs of varying water depth and dive duration. We used measurements of Canvasback intake rates at different bud densities to calculate profitability (energy intake minus expenditure) for each dive. Multivariate uncertainty analyses (Latin hypercube) indicated that profitability for Canvasbacks foraging on Vallisneria buds is determined mainly by food-item size and locomotor costs of descent. Bud metabolizable energy, water temperature, bud dispersion, and search and handling time coefficients of the functional response for intake rate have relatively minor influence. Individual-parameter perturbations indicated that to maintain the same foraging benefits, the total area of Vallisneria habitat would have to increase by 1.4-fold if dry mass per bud decreased from 0.10 to 0.03 g, and by 2.1-fold if water depth increased from 0.5 to 2 m. Our method allows study of interactions between patch structure and foraging energetics without detailed spatial mapping of foods, which is not feasible at appropriate scales for highly mobile benthivores. The model yields estimates of energy balance, contaminant intake, and amount and quality of foraging habitat required to sustain diving duck populations under varying environmental conditions.

Showy, flower-like pseudoflowers caused by the rust fungus Puccinia monoica on Arabis holboellii (Brassicaceae) commonly co-occur with flowers of Anemone patens (Ranunculaceae). I evaluated the effects of pseudoflowers and anemone on each other's visitation, and the effect of pseudoflowers on the seed set of anemone. I expected that at low overall ""flower"" densities visitation would be facilitated in patches containing a mixture of these species. At low densities, pseudoflowers or flowers alone may be too rare to attract sufficient visitors, but the addition of the other species could make mixtures more attractive and thus increase visitation rates. At high densities I expected that ""flowers"" in mixtures would compete for pollinators because it is more energy efficient for pollinators to concentrate visits on the most rewarding species. I used artificial arrays to separate the effects of ""flower"" density and relative frequency on visitation. Local density was not a good predictor of the influence of one species on the other. Instead, visitation patterns depended most strongly on the kind of visitor (flies vs. bees). Visitation to A. patens by flies was facilitated by the presence of pseudoflowers at both high and low densities, whereas visitation to pseudoflowers was not significantly influenced by A. patens at either density. Local density affected visitation by bees, but relative frequency did not. In addition to observing visitation, I also quantified the effects of interspecific movement of both pollen and spores on the reproductive success of A. patens. Although the presence of pseudoflowers sometimes facilitates visitation to A. patens, this effect could be counterbalanced by competition through interspecific insect movement: sticky pseudoflowers remove pollen from visiting insects, and fungal spermatia deposited on flower stigmas reduce seed set.",40,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,111,10.2307/2265745,Anemone patens | Arabis holboellii | Competition | Facilitation | Floral mimicry | Fly pollination | Halictid bees | Puccinia monoica | Pulsatilla patens | Rust fungi,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, we examine the impact of history on the species composition of intertidal reef corals, by comparing simulation models that incorporate four different levels of knowledge about the recent past (over a time scale of 1-27 yr). The models are Markov or semi-Markov transition probability matrix models, based on rates of colonization, persistence, and species replacement measured from a long-term study spanning three decades at Heron Island, Great Barrier Reef. Rates of colonization (transitions from free space) varied 20-fold for different species groups, while mortality (transitions to free space) ranged fivefold, reflecting a wide range of life histories among the coral assemblage. Virtually all species groups could undergo reciprocal transitions (e.g., from A to B, and B to A) in a single time interval, indicating the lack of a single competitive dominant that was capable of outcompeting all or most other species. Transition probabilities changed markedly as a function of history. For most species groups, the probability of persisting (i.e., ""transitions"" from A to A) increased with time. Thus, a colony that had occupied space for some time was generally more likely to continue to do so than a new arrival. This result is consistent with an escape in size for older colonies from mortality agents such as competition and predation. However, three species groups showed the opposite pattern. Algae, Pocilloporid corals, and fragile tabular Acropora showed marked increases in transitions to free space after 3-5 yr, reflecting a more ephemeral suite of life history traits. Similarly, free space that had recently been generated had a higher rate of colonization than substratum that had been unoccupied for some time. These results falsify a major assumption of standard first-order models, i.e., that transition probabilities are constant, and that history is irrelevant. Although the changes in transition probabilities as a function of history were often striking, the four different models we employed show only minor variation in community composition in both transitory and climax (equilibrium) phases. Thus, while recent history was important in determining transition probabilities, it had little effect on community dynamics and structure in this system. This discrepancy is due to the rapid turnover of corals and algae on shallow reef crests, where only a small proportion of colonies survive long enough to display effects of history. All models agreed that the length of time required for this system to reach an equilibrium community structure is far longer than the observed interval between recurrent disturbances from tropical cyclones.",71,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,112,10.2307/2265660,Community dynamics | Competition | Coral reefs | Disturbance | Great Barrier Reef | History | Matrix models | Scleractinians | Semi-Markov model | Simulations | Succession,NA,NA,NA

Gall densities were varied in field rosinweed populations, while gall densities, water, and nutrients were varied for rosinweed in an experimental garden. Field plants grew under prevailing resource and competitive conditions, but garden plants grew free from competition, so gall-insect impacts, rosinweed regrowth, and gall-insect performance were observed under widely different growing conditions. Seasonal measures of rosinweed growth and leaf physiology, and end-of-season measures of biomass, reproduction, gall-wasp emergence, growth, sex ratios, and parasitism were made for both experiments. Rosinweed poorly tolerated Antistrophus gall damage in the field. Galls reduced plant height, leaf area, and inflorescence production. Rosinweed diverted biomass to stems, but produced no regrowth from axillary meristems. In the garden, rosinweed was much more tolerant of Antistrophus gall damage. Galls initially reduced plant height and leaf area, but axillary meristems grew profusely after gall formation, producing nearly all galled plant inflorescences and more than replacing leaf area initially lost to gall formation. Water- and nutrient-supplemented rosinweed were most tolerant of gall damage, experiencing little loss of total biomass or reproductive output. Field rosinweed failed to mount a toleranceenhancing regrowth response because galls, resource availability, and competition combined to constrain axillary meristem growth. Gall-wasp performance was largely independent of rosinweed tolerance. Emergence, growth, sex ratios, and parasitism were comparable in field and garden, and only slightly affected by resource availability.

DIR is associated with increase in concentrations of foliage phenolics and decrease in nitrogen. The growth-differentiation balance hypothesis, and the carbon-nutrient balance (CNB) hypothesis contained in it, claim that DIR is caused by nutritional stress after defoliation of trees growing on nutrient-poor soils. In these environments, nutrient uptake limits plant growth more strongly than does photosynthesis; that is, carbon-based secondary metabolites (e.g., phenolics) are prone to accumulate. According to the CNB hypothesis, an excess of limiting nutrient(s) or reduced photosynthetic rate should lead to elimination of DIR. We tested this using same-aged Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa trees of five open-pollinated families growing in a common arboretum in northernmost Finland. In addition to unmanipulated control trees, we had three nutritional treatments during three successive growth seasons: N-fertilization, PK-fertilization adding all nutrients except N, and shading to decrease carbon assimilation. Half of the trees in each treatment were artificially defoliated (50% leaf area) in the second study year, one year before the growth trial with geometrid (Epirrita autumnata) larvae. Tree growth measurements showed that N is the growth-limiting nutrient in our study area. N-fertilization and shading of the trees affected foliage chemistry generally as proposed by the CNB hypothesis. For example, they reduced foliar concentrations of total phenolics and condensed tannins. The birch families differed significantly in foliage chemistry, suggesting genetic differences, but the differences were not associated with fertilizations, shading, or defoliation of the trees. Contrary to fertilizing-shade treatments, changes in leaf chemistry and E. autumnata performance caused by defoliation were not consistent with the CNB hypothesis. For example, defoliation caused significant DIR irrespective of N-fertilization or shading. There were no significant differences among the birch families in performance of the moth larvae or in effects of fertilization, shade, or defoliation on larval performance. These responses to defoliation contrast with those of some other studies, especially those on the Betula resinifera-Rheumaplera hastata system in Alaska, which provide clear support for the CNB as an explanation of DIR.

Three populations were compared: tall, short, and short with nitrogen fertilization in spring (short/N). Tall and short S. alterniflora populations had different demographic characteristics. The short population had a shorter leaf longevity (49 vs. 72 d) and a higher leaf turnover than the tall population, which may be due to high salinity and nitrogen limitation in the high marsh. Although the average ramet longevities of tall and short populations were similar (231 and 204 d, respectively), cohorts of the tall population that emerged early in the growing season had a significantly longer average life-span than those of the short population, probably because they had more support from belowground reserves that led to a higher initial survival rate. Leaf number, leaf area, shoot density, and biomass production of the short population were greatly increased by spring nitrogen fertilization, but the longevity of leaves and ramets was little affected. Using the demographic data and phytometric equations (nondestructive method), new growth was found throughout the year in S. alterniflora populations at Sapelo Island. The average dry mass NAPP was estimated to be 1105, 2244, and 1520 g·m-2·yr-1 for the short, short/N, and tall populations, respectively.

Logs buried in peatlands, charcoal in the organic soil layers on well-drained sites, and dry peat underlying stunted clonal spruce were sampled across a 60-km transect south and north of the modern forest limit. Of 146 spruce logs sampled south of the modern forest limit, 34 were 14C dated between 4580 and 1540 yr BP, and 34 additional logs were cross-dated with 14C-dated spruces (3010-1540 yr BP) using diagnostic tree rings.

No spruce logs or charcoal were found in all the surveyed sites north of the forest limit. The residence time of humified peat confined to the area occupied by tundra clonal spruces ranged between 3040 and 630 yr BP. The absence of spruce macrofossils in the tundra zone, together with the geographic coincidence of the charcoal limit and forest limit, strongly suggests that the forest limit remained stable during the last 2000-3000 yr BP. Old-aged peat produced by tundra spruces is additional evidence for the stability of the forest limit. Because only spruce is able to accumulate such a thick organic layer, the 14C dates of basal peat indicate that spruce clones developed continuously in the absence of external disturbance at least over the last 3000 yr BP. The stability of the forest limit during warm (≈2000 yr BP, medieval times, and this century) and cold (≈3000 and 1300 yr BP, and the Little Ice Age) periods of the late Holocene demonstrates that mechanisms allowing forest limit advance or retreat are not easily triggered by climatic change.",39,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,116,10.2307/2265591,Climate change | Fire | Forest limit | Holocene | Paleoecology | Palsa peatland | Picea mariana | Subarctic Québec | Tree line,NA,NA,NA

We designed a field experiment to test how differences in the aerial extent of disturbance affected macrofaunal recolonization on a sandflat. Three different plot sizes (0.203 m2, 0.81 m2, and 3.24 m2) were defaunated, and samples were collected to assess recovery over a 9-mo period. As the sandflat used for the experiment was prone to disturbance by wind-driven waves, we also measured changes in sediment bed height (an indicator of sediment stability) over the course of the experiment. Most common species revealed significant relationships between density and disturbance plot size. Scale-dependent recovery was also demonstrated by differences in species assemblage structure over the course of the experiment. Relative rates of colonization varied by ≈50% between large and small experimental plots. However, these differences were not related to specific species, particular functional groups, or potential modes of colonization. The results revealed an unusually slow rate of faunal recovery following defaunation. Both increasing numbers of colonists and density changes in ambient sediments made an important contribution to recovery. The relationship found between changes in sediment bed height and wind velocity indicated that wind-driven wave disturbance was an important factor influencing sediment instability. Sediment instability was higher in all experimental plots than in the ambient sediments, due to the initial removal of a dense spionid polychaete tube mat characteristically found at the study site. Sediment instability also increased with increasing plot size. Thus in this dynamic sandflat habitat, faunal emigration from recovering disturbed patches of sediment may significantly slow rates of recolonization. These results demonstrate that incorporating patch size, emigration, recovery time, and interactions between hydrodynamic conditions and habitat stability (particularly where colonists influence sediment stability) are crucial to generating a general understanding of recovery processes in soft-sediment habitats. While our results demonstrate the need for caution in scaling-up from small-scale studies, they do indicate that larger scale disturbances that destroy organisms with a role in maintaining habitat stability are likely to result in very slow recovery dynamics, particularly in wave-disturbed soft-sediment habitats.",184,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,117,10.2307/2265747,Disturbance | Habitat stability | Macrobenthic community | New Zealand | Patch size | Recolonization | Sandflat,NA,NA,NA

In Slatkin's pioneering model (Slatkin 1980), the genetics of the quantitative character determining the competitive interactions are modeled by assuming that the character is normally distributed in each generation. Only the mean and the variance of the character distributions change over time. With symmetric ecological assumptions for the two competing species, and with normally distributed resources that are equally used by both species, this model did not yield significant displacement. This has led to the belief that ecological asymmetries or constraints on resource use, e.g., by constraining the phenotypic variances, are necessary for character displacement. I argue that the reason for the negative result in Slatkin's original model is that the genetics are modeled too rigidly. With a more flexible genetic model, obtained by explicitly modeling many loci with additive effects, character displacement occurs as a rule even for symmetric ecological assumptions and without constraints on the phenotype distributions. The model can also be used in other contexts than competition for resources. For example, character displacement in a host-parasite system can lead to parasite specialization. The results suggest that more detailed genetic models yield a finer resolution of the interaction between population genetics and ecological dynamics.

P. algirus mainly inhabits broad-leaved forests, whereas A. erythrurus prefers open, sandy areas with sparsely distributed vegetation. These habitat preferences parallel differences between the areas in which both genera presumably originated: Eurosaharian xeric steppes with high operative temperatures (7e) for Acanthodactylus, and Mediterranean open forests with lower Te for Psammodromus. Field observations showed that percentage of time spent basking and basking rate (number of basks per minute) were negatively related to Te, although average bask duration was not. Percentage of time spent moving, moving rate (number of moves per minute) and the average duration of individual moves were inversely related to 7e and were higher in P. algirus. The percentage of total locomotion time that was spent moving in the shade was also higher in P. algirus. Behavioral thermoregulation strategies differed in a laboratory thermogradient, where P. algirus basked more often and for shorter periods and selected warmer patches than did A. erythrurus.

One widely cited analysis of data from the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), the only continental-scale monitoring program for land birds in the breeding season, indicates declining populations in eastern forests in the 1980s, but other analyses conclude that most species have had stable or increasing populations in the last 25 yr. These conflicting results call for a new perspective. Here, we propose two approaches to the analysis of BBS data that emphasize the detection of temporal and geographic variation in population trends. The first approach uses nonlinear regression to detect temporal changes in population trends, and permits the construction of graphs that compare nonlinear trends among regions. The second approach provides statistical tests of multispecies patterns of geographic variation in population trends. We report analyses of BBS data for 1966 to 1992 for the 26 species of wood warblers (Parulinae) for which the most data are available and the chance of obtaining reliable estimates is best. Using pooled data for all 26 species for eastern and central North America, nonlinear regression indicated declining populations in the Appalachian Mountains and the Eastern Foothills in the 1970s, and stability elsewhere. As examples of the use of this first approach in single-species analyses, we give maps, graphs, and statistical tests to illustrate variation in population trends by physiographic strata in the Blue-winged Warbler (Vermivora pinus) and the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus). As an example of the second approach, we applied a probit-normal model to a matrix of increases and decreases in the 26 species in 37 geographic strata. The analysis identified specific highland areas as having unusually high proportions of declining populations. These results suggest that correlates of elevation should be considered as factors possibly regulating populations of warblers and other land birds.

(3) Hemidactylus frenatus depletes insect resources to lower levels than L. lugubris, which results in reduced rates of resource acquisition in L. lugubris.

This cursorial spider is a common generalist predator in the leaf litter of forests of the eastern United States. In our study site in Maryland, densities of recently dispersed young 5. ocreata can reach 60-90 individuals/m2, but decline to <15 spiders/m2 by early autumn. We investigated the cause of this rapid decline in spiderling density. We first performed a predator-exclusion field experiment to determine if natural enemies contributed significantly to spider mortality. Replicated enclosures with lip barriers to prevent emigration were stocked with newly dispersed S. ocreata spiderlings at either 0.75× or 3× mean field density, or had no S. ocreata added (0×). Before spiderlings were introduced, we reduced potential enemies in half of the plots by sifting the litter and removing other spiders, centipedes and predaceous beetles, and by installing 3-mm mesh netting to exclude birds, wasps and other predators of S. ocreata. Over a period of 2.5 mo we measured effects of natural enemies and spider density on prey (Collembola), spider growth, and spider survival. Spider mortality was high (≈80%) and strongly density dependent (DD). Survival in the 3× field-density plots was 50% lower than in the 0.75× plots. Increasing spiderling density did not significantly reduce Collembola density and resulted only in a minor DD reduction in spiderling growth (≈10%). Although overall spider mortality was high, excluding natural enemies did not significantly improve spider survival. The absence of emigration and the high spider mortality rates in the predator-reduction treatment strongly implicate cannibalism as the major DD mortality factor. We then conducted two laboratory experiments in order to obtain direct measurements of the rates of cannibalism. Rates of cannibalism were measured in 0.3-m2 arenas stocked with S. ocreata at densities equivalent to those used in the field experiment. In Experiment 1, habitat complexity and prey availability were manipulated in arenas stocked with 5. ocreata at 3× mean field densities. In Experiment 2, we manipulated spider density (0.75× and 3×) and prey density to evaluate the DD component of cannibalism. The laboratory experiments confirmed the importance of cannibalism as a DD mortality factor. DD mortality from cannibalism was influenced by both prey abundance and habitat complexity. The presence of prey significantly reduced rates of cannibalism, and there was a significant interaction between habitat complexity and prey availability. When prey were present, rates of cannibalism were higher in the complex habitat than the simple habitat. In the absence of prey, increasing habitat complexity had no effect on rates of cannibalism. Rates of cannibalism in the treatment that most closely mimicked field conditions-complex leaf-litter with prey at natural densities-did not differ significantly from the rate of mortality of S. ocreata in the field experiment. Considered together, the results of our field and laboratory experiments lead to the conclusion that cannibalism can act as a strong DD mortality factor for young instars of S. ocreata, with the potential to regulate densities of this abundant cursorial spider.",125,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,124,10.2307/2265637,"Cannibalism | Density-dependent mortality | Field experiment | Habitat complexity | Laboratory experiment | Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Maryland | Population regulation | Predator exclusion | Rates of cannibalism | Schizocosa ocreata",NA,NA,NA

To investigate the hypothesis that chemical defenses are more potent in tropical than in temperate seaweeds, we conducted 38 feeding assays involving seven genera of algae. We offered tropical and temperate sea urchins the choice of a temperate alga from North Carolina or a closely related tropical alga from the Bahamas. Plants were freeze-dried, ground to a fine powder, embedded in agar, and presented in congeneric pairs (North Carolina species vs. Bahamian species), or same-species pairs, to the temperate urchin Arbacia punctulata and the tropical urchin Lytechinus variegatus. For the genera we tested (the red alga Amphiroa, the green alga Udotea, and the brown algae Dictyopteris, Dictyota, Lobophora, Padina, and Sargassum), we documented a general pattern in which the mean amount of North Carolina seaweeds eaten was approximately twice that of their Bahamian congeners. Dictyota was an exception to the overall pattern, in that mean consumption of temperate and tropical species was equivalent. In addition to showing a latitudinal difference in seaweed palatability, we found that some species exhibited significant, between-population variation in herbivore resistance on a local scale. The most notable example was Dictyota menstrualis from North Carolina. When collected from a shallow inshore site, this species was significantly more palatable than tropical species of Dictyota in four of six contrasts. When collected from a deeper offshore site, it was significantly less palatable than the tropical species in four of six contrasts. Thus, for this species, the between-population variance in palatability within a geographic region (North Carolina) bracketed the variance in palatability that we found among species and between regions. Feeding assays with both temperate and tropical urchins produced similar results, indicating that choices were made based on fundamental characteristics of the algae rather than on greater familiarity with local prey species. To see if chemical defenses could explain the differences in herbivore resistance that we noted using freeze-dried algae, we tested the effects of lipid-soluble and water-soluble extracts from each alga on urchin feeding by incorporating extracts into a standard palatable food. We also measured protein content and percent ash-free dry mass of the seaweeds in order to correlate urchin feeding preferences with these measures of food quality. Lipophilic chemical extracts explained urchin preferences in 9 of 15 (60%) North Carolina-Bahamas contrasts. Water-soluble extracts, protein content, and percent ash-free dry mass generally did not account for feeding patterns seen in the original assays. Our results support the general hypothesis that tropical seaweeds have stronger chemical defenses than temperate seaweeds.

As a result, pollen is often transferred among heterospecific flowers. The ""Sexual Architecture Hypothesis,"" a paradigm of pollination ecology and angiosperm evolution, suggests that the severity of such interspecific pollen transfer should reflect the similarity in the architecture of sexual structures (specifically, placement of stigma and anthers) among the flowers involved. We evaluated the hypothesis with six species of Costa Rican cloud-forest plants varying greatly in sexual architecture but all pollinated by the same hummingbird, Lampornis calolaema. Captive Lampornis visited five long-styled, ""pollen-donor"" flowers of distylous, self-incompatible Palicourea lasiorrachis (Rubiaceae), then 20 short-styled recipient flowers of Palicourea, with or without five flowers of a second species intervening. We assessed intraspecific pollen transfer from Palicourea donors by counting pollen tubes in styles of the recipients. We examined interspecific pollen transfer between Palicourea and each of the five other species by counting heterospecific grains deposited on stigmas of Palicourea recipients, and Palicourea grains deposited on stigmas and anthers of the heterospecific flowers. In a separate experiment, we examined how mixed-species flower visits modified the pollen loads actually carried by birds. Results did not uphold the Sexual Architecture Hypothesis. A single visit to any heterospecific flower greatly affected the hummingbird's prior load of Palicourea pollen, regardless of where the second species placed its own pollen on the bird. Interspecific pollen transfer occurred consistently, but (1) heterospecific grains usurped little space on stigmas of Palicourea recipients and had no discernible effect on pollen-tube growth, whereas (2) few Palicourea grains landed specifically on anthers and stigmas of heterospecific flowers. Instead, numerous Palicourea grains apparently were scraped off on other floral structures such as the corolla. Consequently, every species of intervening flowers, regardless of its sexual architecture per se, strongly reduced pollen transfer from donor to recipient Palicourea flowers, on average by 76%. In fact, the most drastic reductions resulted from the two species whose sexual architectures least resembled that of Palicourea. Results imply that ""pollen scraping"" by floral structures other than anthers and stigmas may be important and widespread among some animal-pollinated flowers. Thus, except in cases where no other floral structures contact pollinators, the positions of anthers and stigmas alone may have little bearing on the severity of interspecific pollen transfer and competitive interactions among plants sharing pollinators.",81,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,129,10.2307/2265629,Character displacement | Cloud forest | Competition for pollination | Costa Rica | Flower mixtures | Heterostyly | Hummingbirds | Interspecific pollen transfer | Pollen carry-over | Pollen placement | Pollen Scraping Hypothesis | Sexual Architecture Hypothesis,NA,NA,NA

Defoliating branches after fruit initiation significantly increased subsequent fruit abortion. Flowers that matured fruit had significantly more pollen tubes per style than those that initiated but then aborted fruit, but greater levels of pollen competition did not result in the production of larger seeds.

I found that >90% of ingested pollen was digested during passage through the gut of adult and nestling G. scandens and adult G. fortis. This value is twice as high as the maximum reported for birds, and comparable to the most efficient digestion known for specialist marsupials. Nectar is ingested with pollen by the finches and may stimulate germination of pollen in the crop, facilitating digestion. Opuntia pollen grains germinated in vitro in a nectar and water solution. Breeding of finches typically follows shortly after the arrival of the first heavy rains of the year. In 6 of 12 years, however, some G. scandens pairs bred and successfully fledged young before onset of the rains. At these times, Opuntia flowers were abundant, arthropods were scarce, and the diet of G. scandens was predominantly Opuntia pollen and nectar. As a result of breeding early, pre-rains breeders produced more clutches and fledged more young per year than post-rains breeders. Although G. fortis take pollen and nectar from Opuntia flowers and efficiently digest pollen grains, they feed on flowers to a much lesser extent than G. scandens, and did not breed before the rains. These results have implications for similar vertebrate pollinator and plant systems in arid tropical regions.",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,132,10.2307/2265624,Darwin's finches | Early breeding | Geospiza fortis | Geospiza scandens | Nectar feeding | Opuntia echios | Pollen digestion | Pollen feeding,NA,NA,NA

Adult American shad (Alosa sapidissima), an introduced species, and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a native species, migrate up the Columbia River (northwestern United States) in late spring and early summer to spawn. Based on records from Bonneville Dam, the river's spring warming has occurred progressively earlier since ≈1950, coinciding with a reduction in spring discharge. The date when 50% of the shad migrated past the dam is correlated with this shift in thermal and flow regimes; they now ascend the river ≈38 d earlier than they did in 1938. However, the mean temperature that they experience has actually decreased by 1.8°C in 45 yr, indicating that the change in their migratory timing has outstripped the rate of environmental change. The upriver migration of sockeye salmon is also earlier than in past years, but their change in timing (≈6 d since 1949) lags behind the rate of environmental change, and they are now experiencing ≈2.5°C warmer temperatures than in past years. We hypothesize that the differences in response to changing environmental conditions between these species arise from differences in their migration patterns and early life histories. Shad spawn soon after they enter the river in its main stem where environmental conditions of the larvae will closely mirror those experienced by upstream-migrating adults. They may therefore have evolved a migratory pattern that allows greater behavioral response to environmental fluctuations than sockeye salmon, which spawn in distant locations many months after their upriver migration. Sockeye salmon migration may be more strongly controlled by innate responses to photoperiod, migrating at the time of year which is best on average because conditions in the lower river will not be indicative of those to be experienced by incubating embryos and juveniles.",234,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,133,10.2307/2265584,Adaptation to environmental change | American shad | Anadromous fish | Behavioral plasticity | Columbia river | Migratory timing | River discharge | Sockeye salmon | Spawning | Temperature,NA,NA,NA

Preferred pathways for dispersal (i.e., corridors), as well as dispersal barriers, are difficult to identify when the landscape matrix is composed of a complex mixture of land cover types. We developed an individual-based dispersal model to measure immigration and emigration rates between habitat islands within heterogeneous landscapes. Dispersing individuals of a model organism were simulated as selfavoiding random walkers (SAW) traversing a digital land cover map, with each habitat type assigned a priori a probability that the SAW would enter that habitat type. Each individual began the dispersal process on a random site at the edge of a deciduous forest patch and was allowed to move until it reached a different deciduous forest patch. Visualization of the movement patterns across the landscape was achieved by tabulating the frequency of visitation of successful dispersers to each grid cell on the map. The model was used to estimate the probabilities of disperser transfer between patches by varying the a priori probabilities of movement into each habitat type in order to: (1) estimate the effect of changing landscape heterogeneity on the transfer probabilities, and (2) visualize dispersal corridors and barriers as perceived by model organisms operating by specific movement rules and at specific scales. The results show that 89% of the variability in dispersal success can be accounted for by differences in the size and isolation of forest patches, with closer and larger patches having significantly greater exchange of dispersing organisms. However, changes in the heterogeneity of the landscape matrix could significantly enhance or decrease emigration success from an individual patch, depending on the landscape. Changes in emigration success from an individual patch resulting from changes in matrix heterogeneity were not predictable, and transfer rates between patches were not symmetrical due to differences in the proximity of neighboring patches, and differences in the funneling attributes of certain landscape patterns. Visualizations showed that corridors are often diffuse and difficult to identify from structural features of the landscape.

Consequently, perennial organisms that reproduce continuously are generally restricted to tropical regions with relatively aseasonal climates. The temperate marine alga Macrocystis pyrifera is a rare exception in this regard, as most individuals reproduce throughout the year in a seasonally variable habitat. Here we measure reproductive responses of the giant kelp Macrocystis during a period in which resources and environmental conditions fluctuated greatly and contrast these responses with those of the palm kelp, Pterygophora californica, a sympatric species that exhibits strictly seasonal reproduction. The quantity and quality of spore production tracked resource availability within and among years for Macrocystis, but not for Pterygophora. Reproductive allocation and spore standing stock in Macrocystis were negatively correlated with seawater temperature and positively correlated with the nitrogen content of adult plants. Macrocystis generally displayed two seasonally distinct peaks in spore production per year (winter and spring). The only disruption of this pattern coincided with a warmwater El Niño event. Although seawater temperature and the nitrogen content of adults were inversely related in Pterygophora, neither variable was significantly correlated with the quantity or quality of spore production in this species. Unlike Macrocystis, Pterygophora exhibited a well-defined reproductive season in which plants displayed a single broad peak in spore production that varied little in timing and magnitude among years, even during El Niño conditions. Spore C/N ratios remained relatively constant over time in both species, despite large seasonal fluctuations in C/N ratios of vegetative tissue of adults plants. Nonetheless, spore C/N ratios were positively correlated with seawater temperature in Macrocystis, but not in Pterygophora. Spore viability (swimming and germination) varied considerablyoften unpredictably, over time for both species. Our results support the general idea that environmental conditions and resources exert a much greater influence on the quantity and quality of reproduction in species that reproduce continuously than on the majority of species that are strictly seasonal in onset of reproduction. The differential responses of Macrocystis and Pterygophora may reflect their different morphologies and life-spans. Macrocystis is relatively short lived and may ""hedge its bets"" by reproducing continuously rather than risk delaying reproduction. Conversely, since Pterygophora lives much longer, plants can afford to release spores only during times when the chances for reproductive success are predictably greatest because these plants are likely to reproduce again in subsequent years.",71,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,136,10.2307/2265679,Algae | C/N ratio | El Niño | Germination | Kelp | Macrocystis pyrifera | Pterygophora californica | Reproductive allocation | Resource availability | Seasonality | Spore production | Viability,NA,NA,NA

A behavioral experiment demonstrated that an individual of either species was less likely to feed on a recently grazed patch when the prior forager was T. aureotincta. Both snails responded only to the amount of food available on a patch, and, except at very low food levels, the likelihood that a snail would remain to feed was identical for the two species across microalgal densities. Where food was scarce, T. eiseni was more likely than T. aureotincta to feed in that patch. Density-dependent effects on microalgal standing stock differed between the snails; at low grazer densities, T. aureotincta depressed food levels to a comparatively greater degree, whereas at high grazer densities, T. eiseni had a relatively greater effect. The relative growth performance of the snails differed as a function of available food: T. aureotincta had superior body growth at high resource densities, while T. eiseni grew comparatively better at low microalgal densities. Differences in effects on and growth responses to microalgae arose from dissimilar foraging characteristics of the snails. Compared with T. eiseni, T. aureotincta moved more rapidly while feeding, harvested twice as great an area per unit time, but was unable to crop microalgae as close to rock surfaces. While T. eiseni grazed a smaller area per unit time, it removed relatively more microalgae per area grazed. These differing suites of foraging attributes may represent a trade-off to harvest food at different densities: cropping closer to the substratum (area intensive grazing) yields more food when microalgae are scarce, but precludes grazing a larger area per unit time (area extensive grazing) through fast movement, which provides a greater food intake when microalgae are abundant. If an area extensive (moves faster)-intensive (digs deeper) trade-off is a common feature of benthic grazer systems, knowledge of this aspect could provide great predictive insight into the patterns and causes of density dependence arising from exploitation.",49,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,137,10.2307/2265618,Consumer-resource interactions | Exploitation | Food limitation | Foraging behavior | Interference | Interspecific competition | Intraspecific competition | Marine gastropods | Patch use | Resource competition | Tegula | Trade-offs,NA,NA,NA

Consequently, overall population dynamics are affected both by processes operating within individual stages and by factors that influence transitions between stages. In largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides), there is a diet shift from littoral invertebrates to fish that typically occurs sometime in their 1st yr. I examined factors that influenced this shift by tracking diet and growth trajectories of young-of-year (YOY) bass cohorts in several Michigan lakes over 2 yr. Cohorts differed in consumption rates of invertebrate prey, which led to an early divergence in bass growth among lakes. This variation in early growth had dramatic consequences for the timing of the shift to piscivory. In lakes with rapid growth in the invertebrate feeding stage, bass were able to gain a size advantage over YOY bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), their primary fish prey, which facilitated a shift to piscivory as soon as these bluegill became available as food. In contrast, slow growth during the invertebrate feeding stage reduced the size advantage of bass over bluegill and delayed or even prevented the shift to piscivory in the 1st yr. Niche shifts in bass were also sensitive to environmental conditions early in the growing season. In 1992, low temperatures caused a reduction in growth rates that prevented the establishment of a size advantage over bluegill in all but one lake. Bass grew much faster after switching to piscivory; thus the shift from invertebrates to fish strongly influenced sizes attained by YOY bass by autumn. Because survivorship of YOY bass is strongly size dependent (particularly through the first winter), the timing of the shift to piscivory may be important in determining survival and recruitment rates. Therefore, processes that operate on bass in the invertebrate feeding stage can influence the shift to piscivory, and this can potentially have important effects on the dynamics of the population as a whole.",275,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,138,10.2307/2265667,Environmental effects | Lepomis macrochirus | Michigan | Micropterus salmoides | Piscivory | Size-structured predation | Stage structure | Vulnerability,NA,NA,NA

I examined whether or not trade-offs for future fecundity or offspring survivorship could explain why tropical birds lay smaller clutches than their temperate relatives. I studied a tropical population (in Monteverde, Costa Rica) of the House Wren (Troglodytes aedon), a species that ranges in average clutch size from 6 in the temperate zone to 3.5 in the tropics. Three years of brood manipulation experiments showed weak effects of brood size on both future fecundity and offspring survivorship. Females that raised broods enlarged by two nestlings laid subsequent clutches, in the same breeding season, that were one-third of an egg smaller than those of females that did not raise enlarged first broods. Clutches in the year following brood manipulation were about a half an egg smaller for females raising enlarged broods than for females raising control or reduced broods. However, brood manipulation had no effect on male or female survivorship in any year of the study, despite the observation that both sexes increased their foraging rate to compensate for rearing larger broods. In two of three years. House Wrens were able to raise enlarged broods just as successfully as control and reduced broods, as measured by fledgling mass and survivorship of nestlings and fledglings. In one year, nestlings in enlarged broods fledged lighter and had lower fledgling survival than those in control or reduced broods. Predation of broods was unrelated to brood size, so food limitation appeared to be the mechanism causing the trade-off between brood number and offspring production. The pattern in tropical House Wrens is similar to that found in many studies of temperate passerines: in most years, brood sizes larger than the modal brood size appear to produce the most offspring. Thus, the same mechanism that controls clutch size in temperate birds may be at work in the tropics, but the level at which clutch size is controlled is lower in tropical birds, resulting in smaller clutches. A population model based on demographic parameters measured in the study population showed that the trade-off for offspring survivorship had a greater influence on fitness than the trade-off for future fecundity. Also, the clutch size strategy accruing the highest fitness depended on temporally varying conditions for reproduction. A strategy of laying 5-6 eggs had higher fitness than laying smaller clutches in years when conditions were favorable for reproduction, but clutch sizes of 3-4 (the observed clutch sizes in Monteverde) were most productive during less favorable years. Depending on the frequency of favorable years, House Wrens may be responding to a ""bad-years effect"" by lowering variance in reproductive success to maximize fitness over the long term. Alternatively, tropical birds may lay fewer eggs so that they can invest more care in each offspring, enhancing the chance that their offspring will survive and compete successfully in social contests for breeding territories. This offspring-quality hypothesis is supported by the observation that tropical House Wrens devote more time to the different stages of the reproductive cycle than do temperate House Wrens.",45,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,139,10.2307/2265623,Brood manipulation | Clutch size | Food limitation | Future fecundity | Nest predation | Offspring quality | Population model | Survivorship | Trade-off | Troglodytes aedon | Tropics,NA,NA,NA

This is significant because these species swim away from attacking predators, whereas species in the ancestral habitat (habitats with fish as the top predators) do not swim from attacking predators. We quantified swimming speed over a large ontogenetic size range for larvae of seven Enallagma species, two in dragonfly lakes and five in fish lakes. Results of analysis of covariance and a modification of FeJsenstein's method of evolutionary contrasts indicate that a large evolutionary increase in the slope of the ontogenetic relationship between swimming speed and loge(body length) is associated with invasions into dragonfly lakes, and this shift results in larvae of dragonfly-lake species being faster swimmers, especially in larger size classes, than larvae of fish-lake species. We also present experimental results demonstrating that damselflies with larger lamellae are faster swimmers and have higher survival when exposed to dragonfly predation.

Consequently, mean fecundity decreases, and no relationship is expected between density and variance in fecundity.

We have used a spatially explicit simulation model (JASPER) of a serpentine grassland to examine the importance of some of these relationships, focusing primarily on the role of disturbance. The model JASPER is hierarchical in design and was developed to simulate the population dynamics of three interacting plant species: Bromus mollis, Calycadenia multiglandulosa, and Plantago erecta. Population dynamics were modeled as occurring within local sites, which were then arranged in a square array to form a landscape. Connections among sites within a landscape were made primarily through seed dispersal. Several components of disturbance architecture were varied systematically among model runs to determine their impact on population dynamics at the scale of the landscape. We considered three levels of organization in modeling disturbance: (1) overall rate of disturbance, (2) size of individual disturbances, and (3) temporal and spatial autocorrelation among individual disturbances. The results demonstrate that the impact of disturbance depends upon a complex interaction between the life history characteristics of the species making up the community and the spatial and temporal structure of the disturbance regime. For example, we found that the biggest impact on species abundance occurred in response to a shift in the temporal autocorrelation structure of the disturbance regime. Also, species diversity was found to increase at intermediate levels of disturbance (as has been shown in several other studies). However, what can be considered an intermediate level of disturbance depends as much upon the temporal autocorrelation structure of the disturbance regime as it does upon the absolute rate of disturbance.

(2) Population densities of the specialized species may be limited (e.g., by predation) below levels where the specialists can competitively exclude habitat generalists. 1 evaluated these ideas in a community of small mammals occupying mesic and xeric habitats at nine different locations in the Rocky Mountains of southern Alberta, Canada. A chipmunk generalist coexists with two specialists, one with a distinct preference for xeric habitat (deer mouse), and another with a similar preference for mesic habitat (red-backed vole). Habitat selection appeared to depend primarily on the density of conspecifics. The generalist coexisted by responding to habitat at a larger scale than did the specialists. Shared predators, whose habitat selection operates on a larger scale than that of their prey, may augment coexistence of all species by reinforcing habitat selection by the specialists.",136,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,146,10.2307/2265737,"Alberta | Apparent competition | Clethrionomys | Coexistence | Habitat selection | Isodar | Isoleg | Peromyscus | Predators, shared | Tamias",NA,NA,NA

We assessed measurable pools of SOM that are thought to correspond to active, intermediate, and passive SOM based upon turnover characteristics in three separate experiments. In a first, we evaluated SOM pools along a spatial gradient in plant inputs, from locations under individual bunch grasses to natural areas of plant removal (ant mounds). In a second experiment we assessed SOM pools across a temporal gradient in ant mounds ranging from ≈5 to 60 yr old. Finally, we compared our results from the second experiment to a single human-induced plant-removal experiment. We found that reduced root biomass accounted for up to 90% of the variation in SOM across our spatial gradients. In our examination of temporal dynamics of SOM, we found that locations with little or no plant inputs for ≈45 yr had 28% less total soil C than in native areas with average plant cover. We measured the greatest proportional losses (48-78%) of SOM in response to reduced plant inputs (over 30-60 yr) in the active SOM as indexed by C and N mineralization and microbial biomass C and N. The range of losses from intermediate organic matter as indexed by particulate organic matter (POM) ranged from 38 to 73%, and losses from the passive pool were proportionately lower (57%). Though this general pattern follows the course predicted by theory, and our measurements of turnover of intermediate SOM agree closely with models, results indicate a considerably slower turnover rate for the active pool and a considerably faster rate for the passive pool than expected. We compared our field estimates of plant-removal-induced SOM losses to simulation modeling results and cultivation studies. Our comparison of field results to Century model simulations indicated a possible model overestimation of the impact of plant removal on SOM loss.

Root nicotine production is activated by an endogenously produced signal, jasmonic acid (JA), which is synthesized in response to leaf damage and either directly through transport or indirectly via another signal, increases JA pools in the roots. The addition of JA or its methyl ester (MJ) to the roots of hydroponically grown plants stimulates nicotine production in the same way that leaf damage does. In this paper we use MJ to stimulate the induced defense without damaging plants in order to examine the hypothesis that these plants have an immunological ""memory"" of prior inductions. Such a ""memory"" can be measured as a change in either the speed or the amount of induced nicotine production or accumulation that results from prior inductions. ""Memory"" is an important component of the induced defenses of animals and is predicted to evolve in systems where an initial attack is a reliable predictor of future attacks. We induced 200 plants 1, 2, or 3 times during an 18-d period of rosette growth, allowed 6 d between inductions for the relaxation of the response between inductions and quantified changes in biomass, whole-plant nicotine pools and de novo rates of nicotine production from 15N-labeled nitrate acquired at the time of induction. Induced changes in nicotine pools and the rates of nicotine production varied across the three induction periods: the highest rates and induced pools occurred during the second induction period, but the highest concentrations were found during the first induction period. The rates of de novo nicotine production from 15N-labeled nitrate were dramatically increased by MJ stimulations during all three induction periods. We found no evidence for alterations in the rates of nicotine production in plants not currently exposed to MJ; 6 d after an induction, plants had relaxed their rates of nicotine production to levels that were not significantly different from those found in plants without a prior induction history. Moreover, the maximum pools of 15N-labeled nicotine were equivalent among all induced plants regardless of prior induction history. In summary, one or two prior inductions did not markedly affect nicotine production from recently acquired nitrate as measured in either induced or uninduced plants. However, the ecologically more relevant measure of the speed of induction is the change in whole-plant nicotine pools, and plants with one and two prior inductions increased their whole-plant nicotine pool significantly faster during the third induction period than did plants not previously induced. Plants with two prior inductions attained significant increases in their nicotine pools 2 d earlier than did plants with one or no prior inductions. Moreover, the effect was additive: plants with two prior inductions were faster than plants with one. The effects of prior inductions on the speed of the induced response did not translate into increases in the magnitude of the response at the end of the 18-d experiment. The lack of change in the magnitude of the induced response may reflect the methods used in our experiment more than the plant's capabilities. The whole-plant induced response is limited by the amount of signal transported to the roots, and since we used the same amount of MJ in all stimulations, our experiment would not detect ""memory"" in the production of the signal in the damaged leaf or its transport to the roots.

Our goal was to distinguish among four hypotheses: autogenic succession, allogenic succession, autogenic coexistence, and allogenic coexistence. We could discern neither successional change toward increasing dominance by sugar maple or beech nor beech self-replacement by root sprouts. In the forest as a whole, from 1933 to 1980, sugar maple remained dominant in small understory size classes, and beech remained dominant in larger understory size classes and in the canopy. We could identify no plausible species-specific canopy influences or consistent responses of understory individuals that could be the basis for autogenic succession or autogenic coexistence. No significant differences existed below canopy beech or below canopy maple in: (1) beech root influence as measured by Epifagus root parasites; (2) light intensity as measured by extension growth of 0.2-0.8 m tall sugar maple; (3) leaf litter as measured by densities of beech and sugar maple leaves just after autumn leaf fall; or (4) inhibition as measured by death of sapling beech and sugar maple. Comparisons under single canopy trees and under monospecific patches showed that understory beech were larger than maple, and this pattern was accentuated below monospecific canopy patches both of maple and beech. This suggested autogenic succession, but coring data were not consistent with this hypothesis, because the largest subcanopy stems of beech and maple were established less often after conspecific or after heterospecific canopy individuals existed above them than before or at the same time. We could not falsify an allogenic coexistence hypothesis that beech or maple advantage changes as light levels fluctuate with frequencies and sizes of treefall gaps. Maples that had recently reached canopy height had been suppressed for an average of only 20 yr, but most had undergone multiple cycles of suppression and release associated with multiple treefall gap events. In contrast beech that had recently reached canopy height had been suppressed an average of 121 yr despite having a similar number of suppression-release cycles as maple. Differences between paired individuals, matched for light microenvironments and height, confirmed our hypothesis that the strong apical dominance of maple led to an advantage in fast upward growth in vertical light gradients of gaps and the long lateral branches of beech led to an advantage in an understory with light flecks and in horizontal light gradients from nearby gaps. Beech's better performance in the understory and maple's better performance in gaps led us to predict that beech would decrease in dominance in the canopy if treefall rate increased. From 1949-1974 treefall gaps averaged 0.16 trees per hectare per year and consisted of mostly single treefalls; we projected that in these gaps beech to maple ratios in the canopy would become 1 to 1. From 1975 to 1994 treefall gaps averaged 1.64 trees per hectare per year and consisted of mostly multiple treefalls; we projected that in these gaps the ratio of beech to maple winners will become 1 to 2.5.

Following the exceptionally severe El Nino event of 1982-1983, hybrids survived as well as, and in some cases better than, the parental species during dry seasons of potential food limitation. They also backcrossed to two of the parental species. This study was undertaken to compare the diets of hybrids with the diets of the parental species in order to assess possible reasons for the high hybrid survival. Diets of F1 hybrids and first generation backcrosses to G. fortis were intermediate between the diets of the respective parental species. Distinctiveness of the hybrid diets was most pronounced where the diets of the parental species differed most. A strong determinant was beak morphology; hybrids inherit beak traits from both parents, and, on average, have intermediate beak sizes. Among the combined groups of species and hybrids, and among the hybrids alone, dietary characteristics covaried with beak morphology. Hybrids that differ most from G. fortis in beak morphology, the G. fortis X G. scandens F1 hybrids, experience a feeding efficiency advantage when feeding on Opuntia echios seeds, commonly consumed in the dry season. These findings are used to interpret the higher survival of hybrids after 1983 than beforehand. The El Niño event that year led to an enduring (10-yr) change in the habitat and plant composition of the island. A decrease in absolute and relative abundance of large and hard seeds apparently caused relatively high mortality among G. scandens and the largest G. fortis individuals. Hybrids were favored by an abundance of small seeds. The high survival of G. fortis × G. scandens F1 hybrids may have been due, additionally, to a broad diet and to efficient exploitation of Opuntia seeds.

To quantify the hindrance of dispersal caused by habitat fragmentation, landscape ecologists have invented the notion of habitat connectivity. Indices of landscape pattern are frequently used to estimate habitat connectivity, but whether they actually do so remains undocumented. If indices of habitat pattern do indeed estimate habitat connectivity, then these indices should correlate well with predictions of dispersal success.

In pelagic marine ecosystems, where prey is often patchily distributed, predators must be able to adapt quickly to changes in the spatial patterning of prey. Antarctic fur seals feed primarily on krill, which is patchily distributed. When combined with information about swimming speed on the surface, the time taken for a fur seal to locate a new patch after leaving an old one is an indication of the distance between patches. The frequency distribution of intervals between bouts of foraging showed that fur seals foraged at two spatial distributions: (1) a fine-scale (median distance 0.18-0.27 km) represented by short (<5 min) travel durations between patches; and (2) a coarser or mesoscale (median distance 1.3-1.6 km) represented by longer (>5 min) travel durations. In a study lasting 5 yr, the distributions of travel durations between bouts of feeding changed between years. These changes suggested that the structure and/or the spatial distribution of krill swarms varied between years.

Only in 1 yr of the study (1990/1991) were there indications that fur seals had difficulty in finding enough food.

Live sponges transplanted onto otherwise bare roots increased root growth rate two- to fourfold relative to controls. Roots fouled naturally by these and other massive sponges produce adventitious fine rootlets that ramify throughout sponge tissue; these rootlets structurally resemble underground rootlets that function in nutrient uptake.

The presence of Anax depressed both growth and survivorship of small bullfrogs and green frogs. In contrast, the presence of Anax had positive effects on growth rates and size at metamorphosis of the large bullfrogs. Increasing density of competitors also decreased survivorship of small classes, and growth rates of all classes. The per-unit-biomass competitive effects of the small bullfrogs on target classes were much greater than those of large bullfrogs. The presence of Anax significantly altered the per-unit-biomass competitive effects of small bullfrogs but not large bullfrogs, presumably because individuals in the small class reduced their activity rates in the presence of Anax. Overall production of new tadpole biomass was quite similar across experimental units, with decreases in production of small size classes in the presence of Anax compensated for by increases in production of the large size class. Thus the non-lethal presence of Anax had substantial effects on the nature of competitive interactions in this system, and we discuss the implications of such behavioral indirect effects in the study of ecological communities.

Our primary objective was to assess whether annual variation in abundances and persistence of populations within woodlots was related to variation in reproductive success. Nesting success of migrants was so low in the woodlots where we sampled that it is unlikely that these populations are self-sustaining. Moreover, populations frequently disappear from and recolonize these woodlots. These data suggest that the source-sink metaphor for population dynamics within spatially structured populations is applicable to migratory birds in Illinois. The scale of this dynamic is unknown, but may be regional (i.e., midwestern U.S.). An important implication of this result is that census data must be interpreted carefully. For one woodlot, we detected no systematic trend in the overall abundances of migratory birds over much of the 20th century. Yet the viability of populations within that woodlot likely decreased dramatically over that time owing to increasing rates of nest predation and brood parasitism.

Although A. longimana preferentially consumes D. menstrualis, its feeding rates can be reduced significantly by high concentrations of diterpenoid dictyols produced by the alga. In 1991, D. menstrualis from sites with high numbers of A. longimana had higher levels of grazing scars, higher concentrations of dictyols, and were less palatable to A. longimana than plants from sites with few amphipods. Among-site differences in palatability to amphipods did not correlate with plant differences in protein, nitrogen, or carbon content. Within a site, plants that had apparent amphipod grazing scars were significantly less palatable to A. longimana than neighboring undamaged plants. Controlled field experiments manipulating A. longimana densities supported the hypothesis that feeding by this amphipod induced elevated chemical defenses in the alga. Compared to undamaged control plants, amphipod-damaged plants had 19-34% more of three diterpenoid secondary metabolites and were 50% less palatable to amphipods. Soluble protein and thallus toughness were unaffected by amphipod grazing and thus could not have caused the differences in palatability. High-pressure liquid chromatography evaluation of adventitious branches growing from blade margins at sites of amphipod grazing scars showed that these branches had significantly elevated levels of two diterpenoids relative to normal blade apices or middles. Thus, the amphipod-induced resistance to further attack occurs through an increase in chemical defenses, and these defenses are, to some extent, localized within the plant thallus. Among-site differences in amphipod densities, grazing scars, seaweed defensive chemistry, and plant palatability that we documented in 1991 varied considerably during 1992 and 1993, suggesting that these interrelationships may be complex. In 1992, A. longimana densities did not differ between sites, and there were no between-site differences in palatability or concentrations of deterrent secondary metabolites. In 1993, however, A. longimana densities did differ between sites, but between-site differences were less dramatic than in 1991. Some secondary metabolites were slightly, but significantly, increased at the site with higher densities of A. longimana, but this had no effect on A. longimana feeding. It has been long recognized that marine herbivores are active participants in seaweed-herbivore interactions and can greatly influence the structure of benthic algal communities. Our findings suggest that seaweeds are not passive participants in these interactions, but can actively alter their susceptibility to herbivores in ecological time.

A particularly robust prediction is that the number of mature eggs that a female carries (her ""egg load"") should influence behavior. As egg load decreases, females are predicted to exhibit increasingly selective host use patterns. We tested the hypothesis that egg load and host size influence the behavior of the parasitoid wasp Aphytis aonidiae attacking the armored scale insect Quadraspidiotus perniciosus. Aphytis females can use hosts either for oviposition or for adult ""host feeding,"" which is the consumption of host material by adult parasitoids. Theory predicts that host feeding should be (i) favored by low egg loads and (ii) more prevalent on lower-quality (smaller) hosts. We conducted observations of individual females foraging freely in the field to determine whether hosts were used for oviposition or for host feeding. As predicted by theory, the likelihood that a host was used for oviposition (as opposed to host feeding) increased with both parasitoid egg load and host size. Thus, parasitoids exhibited higher host-selectivity at lower egg loads. Since egg load and a parasitoid's experience with hosts were not experimentally separated, the egg load effect could in principle have been either direct or indirect and operating through a correlation with experience. In either case, this result constitutes the first demonstration of a link between physiological state and oviposition behavior by a parasitoid in the field. Parasitoid age, as measured using a wing wear index, did not influence behavior. A laboratory study revealed that the relationship between a host's size and the size and initial egg load of the parasitoid developing on that host was positive, but that it followed a pattern of diminishing returns.

This structure allows for improved estimation of individual parameters by considering them in the context of a group of related parameters. Individual estimates are differentially adjusted toward an overall mean, with the magnitude of their adjustment based on their precision. Consequently, Bayesian estimation allows for a more reliable ranking of parameters and, in particular, a more credible identification of extreme values from a collection of estimates. In Bayesian models, individual parameters are regarded as values sampled from a specified probability distribution, called a prior. The requirement that the prior be known is often regarded as an unattractive feature of Bayesian analysis and may be the reason Bayesian analyses are not frequently applied in ecological studies. Empirical Bayes methods provide an alternative approach that incorporates the structural advantages of Bayesian models while requiring a less stringent specification of prior knowledge. Empirical Bayes methods require only that the prior be in a certain family of distributions, indexed by hyperparameters that can be estimated from the available data. This structure is of interest per se, in addition to its value in allowing for improved estimation of individual parameters; for example, hypotheses regarding the existence of distinct subgroups in a collection of parameters can be considered under the empirical Bayes framework by allowing the hyperparameters to vary among subgroups. We describe the empirical Bayes approach in application to estimation of proportions, using data obtained in a community-wide study of Brown-headed Cowbird parasitism rates for illustration. Empirical Bayes estimates identify those species for which there is the greatest evidence of extreme parasitism rates. Subgroup analysis of our data on cowbird parasitism rates indicates that parasitism rates for neotropical migrants as a group are no greater than those of resident/short-distance migrant species in this forest community.

We tested this prediction by examining the compositional similarity of 1000-tree samples in four types of comparisons: (1) between nearby (potentially spatially correlated) and remote (presumably uncorrelated) plots of mature floodplain forest, (2) between real and synthetic forests generated by scrambling the relative abundances of the species, (3) between successional stages and the ""mature phase"" of floodplain forest, and (4) between mature floodplain forest and adjacent upland forest on a different soil type.

We investigated possible landscape effects on Neotropical migrant bird populations for the eastern United States by linking two large-scale inventories designed to monitor breeding-bird abundances and land use patterns. The null hypothesis of no relation between landscape structure and Neotropical migrant abundance was tested by correlating measures of landscape structure with bird abundance, while controlling for the geographic distance among samples. Neotropical migrants as a group were more ""sensitive"" to landscape structure than either temperate migrants or permanent residents. Neotropical migrants tended to be more abundant in landscapes with a greater proportion of forest and wetland habitats, fewer edge habitats, larger forest patches, and with forest habitats well dispersed throughout the scene. Permanent residents showed few correlations with landscape structure and temperate migrants were associated with habitat diversity and edge attributes rather than with the amount, size, and dispersion of forest habitats. The association between Neotropical migrant abundance and forest fragmentation differed among physiographic strata, suggesting that landscape context affects observed relations between bird abundance and landscape structure. Finally, associations between landscape structure and temporal trends in Neotropical migrant abundance were counter to those observed in space. Trends in Neotropical migrant abundance were negatively correlated with forest habitats.

The third process can interact with either of the first two to produce distinct effects. Each process can lead to a different distribution of genotypes and phenotypes between active and dormant subpopulations. We compared the phenotypic distributions of an important fitness character for individuals collected from active and diapausing subpopulations of a freshwater copepod, Diaptomus sanguineus, with a long-lived egg bank. The character, seasonal timing of the switch from production of immediately hatching eggs to diapausing eggs, determines the relative representation of copepods with different switch dates in future generations and is subject to fluctuating selection due to year-to-year changes in the timing and intensity of the seasonal onset of fish predation. The mean timing of diapause is significantly later in the season for copepods reared from long-lived diapausing eggs than it is for copepods reared from individuals collected from the water column.

The four taxa with moderate-to-extreme shade tolerance varied considerably in responses of individual characters to R:FR and PPFD. The patterns of morphological responses to reduced PPFD and R:FR help explain how the shade tolerances of the seedlings of rain forest trees vary in a continuous manner.

This paper provides a brief introduction to the ecology and epidemiology of brucellosis in Yellowstone National Park. Observed patterns of infection for brucellosis in bison in national parks in the United States suggest that Brucella has a relatively sharply defined threshold for establishment and that the proportion of the host population infected increases as a relatively simple function of population density. Unfortunately, the threshold population for Brucella establishment in bison is low, a herd of at least 200 individuals; this makes it very hard to eradicate Brucella from wild populations. Simple calculations based on observed prevalence and recruitment data for the Yellowstone bison herd suggest that unacceptably high levels of culling would be required to eradicate brucellosis in the park. A simple mathematical model is used to describe aspects of the population dynamics of Brucella. The analyses suggest that an understanding of infectious disease dynamics is crucial to the management and conservation of wild and domestic ungulate species in and around national parks and other nature reserves.

An alternative, complementary hypothesis is that PSMs may influence herbivore forage selection at subtoxic levels by imposing high detoxication costs post absorption. Many studies of insect herbivores have been undertaken to measure the metabolic load of detoxication as it relates to host-plant specialization, but results have been equivocal and the subject of much debate. Some recent studies of vertebrate herbivores indicate that metabolism of PSMs can impose a cost by increasing nutrient losses due to conjugation of PSMs to endogenous materials, and by upsetting pH homeostasis. In this study, we demonstrate that detoxication costs in Ruffed Grouse are substantial, and are reduced by selective foraging. In winter, Ruffed Grouse feed preferentially on quaking aspen with relatively low levels of coniferyl benzoate (CB) in staminate flower buds. We collected aspen buds with low-and high-CB levels and conducted feeding trials with captive Ruffed Grouse that had been acclimated to an aspen bud diet. We measured nutrient utilization efficiencies and excretion of detoxication conjugates. Grouse assimilated 24% less energy from high- vs. low-CB buds. Using a nutritional model, we determined that the reduction of energy utilization efficiency was mainly due to dilution of the diet by CB, and not by digestive inhibition. As CB intake increased, grouse excreted more glucuronic acid and ornithine (two major detoxication conjugates), resulting in an energetic cost of 10% to 14% of metabolizable energy intake for low- and high-CB buds, respectively. Conjugation with the amino acid ornithine increased minimum nitrogen requirement by 68% to 90% for low- and high-CB buds, respectively. Ammonium excretion also increased with CB intake, indicating an upset of pH homeostasis. Thus, detoxication costs were relatively high and increased with higher CB intake. Ruffed Grouse preference for low-CB, high-protein aspen buds in nature appears to be related to lower utilization efficiency and higher detoxication costs associated with high CB concentrations. The importance of detoxication cost to herbivores must be more thoroughly evaluated and integrated into existing models of herbivore foraging behavior.",89,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,175,10.2307/2265579,Acidosis | Coniferyl benzoate | Detoxication | Digestion | Energetics | Foraging | Herbivory | Metabolic load | Plant secondary metabolite | Quaking aspen | Ruffed grouse,NA,NA,NA

Systemic fungal parasites differ from nonsystemic fungi in ways that affect plant-pathogen interactions. Many systemic fungal parasites castrate their host plants, which reduces the potential for production of genetically variable, resistant progeny. Moreover, host genotypes susceptible to infection by the maternal pathogen are perpetuated through parasite-induced asexual reproduction or enforced selfing.

Changes in the experimental channel following commencement of the manipulation included: (1) decreased total animal densities, particularly Chironomidae (Diptera); (2) earlier onset of adult insect emergence; (3) increased growth rates and precocious breeding in Hyalella azteca (Amphipoda); (4) smaller size at maturity for Nemoura trispinosa (Plecoptera) and H. azteca; and (5) altered sex ratios for Lepidostoma vernale (Trichoptera).

La Solana drains a calcareous watershed, whereas Riera Major drains a siliceous watershed. Within each stream we defined two reaches (50 m) differing in channel form and canopy cover: bedrock and sand-cobble. The bedrock reaches were characterized by a dominance of bedrock outcrop and a sparse canopy, while the sand-cobble reaches had sand, cobble, and boulder substrata and a dense canopy. Phosphate and ammonium uptake length and uptake rate were measured in each reach by performing several short-term additions (2 h) of phosphate and ammonium. Releases were conducted from summer 1990 to spring 1992 to encompass seasonal changes in environmental conditions. We examined temporal trends in nutrient uptake length to test the influence of watershed geomorphology and local channel form on nutrient retention in these two Mediterranean streams. Because both nutrients were added simultaneously, we were able, by using the ratio of each nutrient's uptake length, to compare ammonium and phosphate retention in each reach. Results of a two-way ANOVA indicated that both stream and reach type had significant effects on phosphate and ammonium uptake lengths. However, channel form had a different effect depending on the stream. In La Solana, shortest phosphate uptake lengths (highest efficiency in phosphate retention) were measured in summer, whereas shortest ammonium uptake lengths were measured in winter in the two reaches. In this stream, both nutrients were retained with greater efficiency in the bedrock reach than in the sand-cobble reach (mean uptake length was 59 ± 12 m for phosphate and 59 ± 14 m for ammonium in the bedrock reach, means ± 1 SE, n = 13 for both nutrients; and 119 ± 19 m for phosphate and 182 ± 51 m for ammonium in the sand-cobble reach, n = 12 for each nutrient). In Riera Major, only the bedrock reach exhibited a seasonality in nutrient uptake length that was similar to that found in La Solana reaches. The sand-cobble reach in Riera Major showed higher efficiency in ammonium retention than the bedrock reach (85 ± 16 m, n = 14; and 189 ± 28 m, n = 10, respectively); but phosphate uptake lengths did not differ between reaches to a statistically significant extent (163 ± 26 m in the sand-cobble reach, n = 14; and 191 ± 32 m in the bedrock reach, n = 10). When the two streams were compared, La Solana exhibited higher nutrient retention efficiencies (shorter uptake lengths) than Riera Major. However, nutrient uptake rates for both nutrients were higher in Riera Major because of greater nutrient loadings. Mean phosphate uptake rates at ambient levels for the whole study period were 45.4 ± 10.8 μg P·m-2·min-1 in La Solana (n = 25) and 175.5 ± 68.6 μg P·m-2·min-1 in Riera Major (n = 24); and mean ammonium uptake rates at ambient levels were 103.3 ± 27.4 and 186.7 ± 48.6 μg N·m-2·min-1, respectively. Finally, nutrient uptake lengths from this study are within the range reported for other streams of similar order.

Grazing pressure was relatively low in the more productive parts. We argue that this pattern is due to a low foraging efficiency of these herbivores in dense vegetation. In order to investigate this hypothesis, we examine a plant-herbivore model where grazing becomes less efficient in dense vegetation, and analyze the behavior of this model along a gradient of primary productivity. In systems of intermediate productivity, the model predicts that a plant-herbivore system may have two stable states. In one state, the herbivore maintains a low standing crop. The other state is dominated by a dense vegetation unsuitable for herbivore grazing. In systems of high productivity, the herbivore is unable to keep plant growth in check and a dense vegetation develops.

Therefore, it is likely that small biological differences between species interact with habitat characteristics to produce distinct patterns of distribution and abundance throughout a new range. In this study we test the hypothesis that differences in the distribution and abundance of species sharing an identical set of ""ideal weed characteristics"" are explicable in terms of species-specific responses to environmental variation within their new range. Using multifactor experiments, we investigated some of the ecological interactions influencing reproductive success in two very closely related species of annuals having invaded the French Mediterranean region for <150 yr and showing marked differences in their local distribution and abundance patterns. We transplanted seedlings of Conyza canadensis (a species restricted to recently disturbed areas) and C. sumatrensis (a species colonizing early- to mid-successional old fields) at equal densities in three contrasting old fields (6 mo, 4 yr, 17-yr abandonment, respectively) during 1991-1992, a growing season with average rainfall. Individual performances (measured as survivorship, reproductive timing, and reproductive output) were evaluated with respect to: (1) competition with plant neighbors (tested with a weeding treatment), (2) resource availability (tested with nutrient and water addition), and (3) herbivory (tested with chemical limitation). Manipulated factors interacted in a rather complex fashion to influence survivorship and reproduction in both species. However, patterns of relative performance were consistent with relative distribution patterns across Mediterranean landscapes: C. sumatrensis performed better than C. canadensis in all fields, including the youngest one (6 mo old). Herbivory only slightly affected transplant performances. In contrast, competition with plant neighbors had substantial effects on either Conyza species and may be the most important determinant of performance in Mediterranean old fields. The experiment showed unambiguously that the two species differ markedly in their competitive ability, with C. sumatrensis performing better than C. canadensis in the presence of neighboring vegetation. In addition, C. sumatrensis displayed a superior ability to take up and/or to use water and nutrient resources when they become available in competitive environments.

Nitrogen pools in the rhizome and shoot were measured in fertilized and nonfertilized plants over two growing seasons (3-4 growing seasons after fertilization began). Fertilized plants stored more N in the rhizome throughout both seasons than did nonfertilized plants. Inflorescence, foliar, and preformed bud N concentrations and biomass production rate did not increase in response to fertilization. The increased storage of N without a concomitant influence on biomass production demonstrates that luxury uptake occurs in this species. Increased N storage in fertilized plants was accommodated by an increase in the amino acids arginine, the nonprotein amino acid, δ-acetylornithine, glutamine, and glutamate. Luxury uptake was accommodated entirely through filling of existing rhizome cells; no increased cell proliferation was found Sucrose concentration was significantly lower in the recently produced rhizome tissue of fertilized plants, possibly reflecting the carbon costs of storing the additional N. During the first half of the season, fertilized plants relied more on stored N to drive growth, with translocation from reserves accounting for 56% and 100% of the aboveground N requirement in nonfertilized and fertilized plants, respectively. In fertilized plants the complete reliance on stored N indicates a decrease in current-season uptake of N during the period normally associated with net N uptake in this species. This is interpreted as either (1) a seasonal shift in N uptake, or (2) a negative feedback between stored N and uptake that would constrain the continued accumulation of excess N and eliminate any long-term benefits of luxury N uptake in this species.",46,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,189,10.2307/2265597,"Alpine tundra | Bistorta bistortoides | Growth vs. Storage | Luxury uptake | Nitrogen, availability | Nitrogen, costs and benefits | Nitrogen, fertilization | Nutrient uptake | Resource storage | Rhizome physiology",NA,NA,NA

We examined the fecundity of modules (polyps) and colonies of six reef-building corals (Acropora hyacinthus, A. nana, A. gemmifera, A. millepora, Goniastrea retiformis, and Stylophora pistillata) to explore how modularity influences reproductive strategies and the evolution of life histories in clonal animals. In unitary, aclonal organisms, fecundity often reaches a plateau or declines in old age. In contrast, we found that fecundity of colonies was indeterminate because vegetative growth can lead to an indefinite number of repeated, reproductive modules. However, colony fecundity was not a simple linear function of the number of modules. The species ranking of polyp fecundities (G. retiformis > the Acropora species > S. pistillata) was very different from the ranks of size-specific colony fecundities (A. hyacinthus, A. millepora, A. gemmifera > A. nana and G. retiformis). Colony fecundity for small S. pistillata was the lowest of all, but large colonies were more fecund than any of the other species at a comparable colony size (despite Stylophora having the lowest polyp fecundity). This contrast highlights clearly the effects of modularity on the reproductive biology and life histories of clonal organisms. The volume of eggs and testes, and the number of eggs and testes per polyp varied greatly among species (20-, 13-, 17-, and 3-fold, respectively). Egg volume was smallest for S. pistillata (the only brooder in the study) and for G. retiformis (which also had the most eggs per polyp, indicating a trade-off between egg size and number). The total reproductive volume per polyp (egg and testes combined) varied three-fold among the six species, and was correlated with a similar range of polyp diameters. In some cases, components of polyp fecundity depended on colony size; egg size in A. hyacinthus and A. nana and the number of planulae per polyp in S. pistillata increased by two- to fourfold with a one to two order of magnitude change in colony size. However, egg size was constant for the other species. Similarly, colony size had no effect on egg or testes number per polyp or testes volume per polyp for any species. We also found striking differences in sex allocation, which may relate to the fertilization biology of these hermaphroditic species. The ratio of total egg volume to testes volume per polyp varied fivefold, and was lowest for S. pistillata (a brooder) and G. retiformis (which produced the most and smallest eggs). The ratio increased with colony size for all species, especially A. hyacinthus. An early investment predominantly in testes allows sex to commence without the initial expense of egg production, perhaps so that colony growth can continue to a larger, safer size. All species had a characteristic colony size at maturation, which varied ninefold among taxa, corresponding to a minimum puberty age of 1-3 yr.

However, little is known about interspecific differences in the traits responsible for shade tolerance. Is shade tolerance due to the ability to grow or survive in deep shade, or both? How do plant morphology and photosynthesis relate to growth in shade? Is low light the sole critical stress determining differences in ""shade tolerance"" or do belowground resources interact with low light to affect growth and survival? In this study we address these questions for seedlings of Betula papyrifera Marsh., Betula alleghaniensis Britton, Ostrya virginiana (Mill.) K. Koch, Acer saccharum Marsh., and Quercus rubra L. grown for 2 yr in outdoor shade houses in a complete factorial of low light (2 and 8% open sky) and nitrogen (forest soil and forest soil plus 200 kg N·ha-1-yr-1). For these seedlings we examined effects of light and nitrogen on the interrelationships among survival, growth, and shade tolerance and explored the physiological bases of shade tolerance by examining the relationship of plant morphology and photosynthesis to growth. Nitrogen amendments did not have a significant effect on any plant trait at either light level. In 8% light, growth and survival were highest for shade-intolerant Betula papyrifera and mid-tolerant Betula alleghaniensis, lower for shade-tolerant Ostrya and Acer, and lowest for disturbance-adapted Quercus. In 2% light, species rankings reversed as Ostrya and Acer had higher growth and survival than the other species. Second-year survival was strongly related to 1st-yr growth (P < 0.001), whereas relationships with 1st-yr plant mass and 1st-yr absolute growth rates were weak. Therefore, survival of shade-tolerant species at 2% light was related to their maintenance of positive growth, whereas intolerant species had growth near zero and high rates of mortality. In both 2 and 8% light photosynthetic rates on mass (but not area) bases and the proportion of the plant in leaves (leaf area ratio and leaf mass ratio) were positively related to growth. Greater rates of growth and survival for shade-tolerant species in very low light, and for intolerant species in higher light, suggest that there is a species-based trade-off between maximizing growth in high light and minimizing the light compensation point for growth.

Lizard Tbs were substantially closer to the species' selected temperature range (the target Tbs for thermoregulation, estimated by the central 80% of the temperatures selected in a laboratory photothermal gradient) than were a random sample of Tcs, indicating that this population thermoregulates both accurately and effectively. We compared observed behaviors and Tbs to the predictions of two hypotheses. The ""no thermoregulation"" null hypothesis predicted that lizard activity and microsite use would be unaffected by thermal constraints. The ""only thermoregulation"" hypothesis predicted that lizards would be active only at those times and in those places where Tcs fell within the selected temperature range. To evaluate the contributions of various behavioral adjustments (activity times, use of microhabitats and sun-shade patches, basking, and shuttling) to temperature regulation, we combined results from direct behavioral observations with information on the Tcs available at different times of day and in different microsites (combinations of structural microhabitats and sun-shade patches). Lizard activity patterns did not match the predictions of either hypothesis, but the observed pattern of activity produced Tbs that were, on average, 1.0°C closer to the selected temperature range than were Tbs predicted by the ""no thermoregulation"" hypothesis. The lizards' use of microsites (combinations of structural microhabitats and sun-shade patches) was more similar to predictions of the ""no thermoregulation"" hypothesis than to those of the ""only thermoregulation"" hypothesis. Nevertheless, the lizards' use of specific microsites produced Tbs that were, on average, 1.9°C closer to the selected temperature range than were randomly available Tcs. The relative contributions of different behavioral mechanisms varied with time of day. In the early morning, low movement rates, selection of sunny microsites, and most notably, adoption of a basking posture contributed to temperature regulation. In the late morning and early afternoon, no thermoregulatory behaviors were necessary, as indicated by randomly positioned models that achieved mean Tcs within the selected temperature range. At midday, frequent movements between sunny and shaded microsites probably reduced heat loads on lizards, preventing Tbs from exceeding the selected temperature range.

Some spatial patterns in marsh plant communities suggest interspecific facilitative interactions, but there is little experimental evidence for interplant facilitation via soil oxygenation. We investigated the capability of the widespread, highly aerenchymous wetland plant, Typha latifolia, to aerate sediments and affect the growth of two non-aerenchymous neighbors, Salix exigua and Myosotis laxa, both in greenhouse experiments and in a natural pothole pond in western Montana.

At soil temperatures of 18°-20°C, DO in the Typha treatment was lower than in the low-temperature experiment and did not differ significantly from DO in the pots without Typha. At substrate temperatures of 11°-12°C, all rooted Salix cuttings survived when planted with Typha, whereas none survived when planted alone. At the same substrate temperature, Myosotis transplants grew significantly larger when planted with Typha than when alone, also indicating that facilitation occurred. When grown with Typha at soil temperatures of 18°-20°C, however, Myosotis root mass was significantly less than when grown alone, suggesting that competition occurred. At the pond margins where Typha and Myosotis coexist in water-saturated soils, naturally occurring Myosotis plants adjacent to transplanted Typha had significantly larger shoot and fruit mass than did control Myosotis without nearby Typha.

Presumably, this transition is associated with critical environmental conditions that regulate the ecologies of trees vs. grasses. We developed and tested a new method to estimate the critical cover value of woodlands on complex terrain. The method was based on multiscale assessments of the associations between local tree coverage and two types of patch edge. Tests on artificial gradient percolation maps revealed an interaction between the type of edge used (""hull edge,"" which is based on only the orthogonal connections between canopy-occupied cells, vs. ""accessible edge,"" which is based on both orthogonal and diagonal connections beween canopy-occupied cells) and the neighborhood rule used to define a cluster (von Neumann 5-cell or Moore 9-cell). When applied to digitized, geographically referenced aerial photographs, the method indicated that areas ≤6.6 ha exhibited the theoretical critical value of 59.3% cover predicted for square lattices and the 5-cell neighborhood. Construction of both edge types on a given map can reveal locations of steep environmental gradients that may be buffered against modest climate fluctuations.

Here, we emphasize the role that avian dispersers play as agents of mistletoe seed transmission to plant hosts. We describe the patterns of transmission of the seeds of Tristerix aphyllus, an endophytic Chilean mistletoe, on two of its columnar cacti hosts (Eulychnia acida and Echinopsis skottsbergii) by the Chilean Mockingbird Mimus thenca. In north-central Chile, these cacti grow in relatively discrete subpopulations on north-facing slopes. We measured variation in seed transmission within 10 subpopulations varying in species composition, host density, parasite density, parasite prevalence (defined as the percentage of hosts infested in a given population), and disperser abundance. Seed transmission was independent of species, but was strongly dependent on prior parasitism. Parasitized individuals received seeds much more frequently than expected from their relative abundance. We found no correlation between the density of hosts and seed transmission. We found strong positive correlations, however, between parasite prevalence and seed transmission to both parasitized and nonparasitized hosts. Seed transmission of T. aphyllus seeds by M. thenca appeared to be frequency- rather than density-dependent. Seed transmission was also tightly and positively correlated with the abundance of seed-dispersing birds at each site. Because bird abundance and parasite prevalence were correlated, we conducted path analysis to disentangle their relative effect on seed transmission. A model including only the direct effect of bird abundance and the indirect effect of parasite prevalence through bird abundance explained roughly the same variance as a full model including both the direct and indirect effects of bird abundance and prevalence on seed transmission. Apparently, variation in bird abundance was the main determinant of variation in transmission. We suggest that mistletoes, host plants, and the birds that disperse mistletoe seeds are systems well suited for studies of the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of disease transmission.",77,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,209,10.2307/2265511,Cacti hosts | Disease transmission | Echinopsis skottsbergii | Eulychnia acida | Mimus thenca | Mistletoes | Parasitism | Seed dispersal | Tristerix aphyllus,NA,NA,NA

Forbs exhibit morphological, life history, and ecophysiological characteristics that contrast sharply with those of the dominant C4 grasses. Success of the subdominant forbs varies strongly with topographic position and burning regime, and landscape scale patterns of abundance are well documented. But comparatively little is known about the mechanisms determining these patterns in persistent tallgrass prairie forbs. To elucidate these mechanisms, (1) leaf-level physiological characteristics of the dominant C4 grass, Andropogon gerardii. and four co-occurring C3 forbs were measured in response to natural and experimentally manipulated gradients of N availability, and (2) seasonal light environments of forbs in contrasting topographic positions and burning regimes and their morphological and physiological responses in these environments were compared to determine whether resource availability and utilization patterns contributed to patterns of forb distribution and abundance. The effects of burning regime and topographic position on maximum rate of photosynthesis (A) and stomatal conductance to water vapor (g) measured at the leaf level were not consistent with patterns of forb abundance. Nitrogen did not appear to limit forb physiological processes, even though increased N availability resulted in higher tissue N concentrations and greater biomass. There was no consistent increase in A or decrease in g in response to fertilization. However, A at low light levels was as much as 67% higher in fertilized Vernonia baldwinii and A. gerardii compared to unfertilized plants. Greater light availability to forbs in the canopy was associated with lower grass biomass production in uplands compared to lowlands and in unburned compared to burned sites. Forbs did not appear to adjust morphologically (leaf area and plant height) to different light environments at different sites. As a result, as much as 90% of forb leaf area in the burned lowland was displayed in low light, whereas as little as 30% of forb leaf area was in low light in the uplands at midseason. Estimates of potential whole-plant carbon uptake, based on leaf area distribution relative to available light and A as a function of light availability, agreed well with patterns of forb abundance and production. Differences in light availability may account for much of the variability in forb abundance related to burning regime and topographic position by limiting carbon gain in forbs more in burned lowlands than in other sites.",82,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,210,10.2307/2265779,Abundance and distribution of forbs | Burning regime | Forb ecophysiology | Forb morphological responses | Forb topographic position | Nitrogen and light availability | Photosynthesis | Seasonal light environments | Stomatal conductance | Tallgrass prairie,NA,NA,NA

We examined five species across a successional sere near San Carlos de Río Negro, Venezuela, to test whether plasticity was associated with successional status and to determine whether changes in foliar properties during secondary succession can be attributed to shifts in species composition, in resource availability, or both. Average leaf N concentration was high (nearly 3%) for a pioneer species (Cecropia ficifolia) early in succession (1-3 yr after abandonment) but was always lower for the other early and mid- to-late succession species, especially later in succession (1-2% at 5-10 yr after abandonment). Net photosynthetic capacity (Pmax/area and Pmax/mass) varied as much as sixfold, being higher in pioneer species such as Cecropia and Vismia on recently abandoned sites and lower in late successional species such as Miconia and Licania on 10-yr abandoned agricultural sites. Total daily light availability also varied widely (14-fold) from its peak 1 yr after farm abandonment to low levels 9 yr into succession. During the first 5 yr of secondary succession, there were significant (P < 0.05) differences in Pmax and leaf N concentration among species in any given year. In most species, Pmax values declined with increasing time since abandonment within any given site. There were important differences in photosynthetic plasticity among species: Pmax tended to be much greater in earlier than later successional species soon after abandonment. Also, the difference in Pmax among species narrowed (or reversed) over time since abandonment, largely because of decreasing Pmax in pioneer species. The results suggest that changes in both species composition and in resource availability combine to produce the common pattern of decreasing leaf N concentration and photosynthetic rates during early rain forest succession after agriculture. Early successional species showed strong (r2 ≥ 0.57, P = 0.0001) mass-based photosynthesis-N relationships but weak (r2 = 0.40 or lower, P = 0.0001) area-based relationships both across the secondary successional sere after agriculture and across sites varying in types of disturbance. Both mass- and area-based photosynthesis-N relationships were poorer or not significant (P > 0.05) for mid- to late-successional species. Higher instantaneous Pmax/N and greater slopes of the photosynthesis-N relationships in early than late successional species suggest that pioneer species may show greater carbon assimilation capacity with elevated leaf N concentration on early successional sites than co-occurring species.

This paper analyzes the factors controlling the initial phase of the resulting invasions within the plots subject to gap creation. The susceptibility of the indigenous community to invasion was strongly related to the availability of bare ground created, but greatest success occurred where disturbance coincided with eutrophication. Disturbance damage to the indigenous dominants (particularly Festuca ovina) was an important determinant of seedling establishment by the sown invaders.

This study, in Caribbean Panama, examined whether a common territorial damselfish, Stegastes planifrons, limits the abundances of adults of four ecologically similar congeners in S. planifrons' primary habitat: S. partitus and 5. variabilis, which commonly occur in that habitat, and S. diencaeus and S. leucostictus, which rarely do. When 5. planifrons was nearly eliminated from 16 natural patch reefs for 4-6 yr, adult populations of 5. partitus, which is less aggressive and half the size of S. planifrons, doubled and expanded their range into a microhabitat previously used almost exclusively by adults of S. planifrons. Population increases by S. partitus occurred within 1 yr of the removal of S. planifrons, were persistent, but only reached their maximum ≈4 yr (and about four generations) after the initial removal. Adult populations of S. variabilis, which is less aggressive and 20% smaller than S. planifrons, also doubled following the removal of 5. planifrons. Combined populations of S. partitus plus S. variabilis increased most on reefs where S. planifrons previously had been most dense. However, increases by those two species reached only ≈70% of the population density and =40% of the biomass density that 5. planifrons had before the removals. Removal of S. planifrons had no effect on the abundances of S. diencaeus and S. leucostictus. Removal of S. partitus from eight reefs for 3 yr did not affect the abundances of S. planifrons or S. variabilis. Eleven years monitoring of adult populations and juvenile recruitment by S. partitus before and during the experiment show that its population increase after the removal of 5. planifrons occurred while its overall abundance was gradually increasing, but was not associated with a period of unusually high juvenile recruitment. Thus asymmetric competition among closely related, ecologically similar, territorial coral reef fishes does sometimes control both abundances and microhabitat use in shared habitat. Interspecific territoriality and differences in body size and aggressiveness that lead to asymmetric competitive ability occur commonly among reef fishes in various trophic groups. Interspecific interactions within such groups of species often affect their patterns of habitat use.

In two of the lakes, perch were the only fish species present and piscivory was restricted to cannibalism. In the other two lakes, perch co-occurred with piscivorous pike (Esox lucius). Pike grow to larger sizes and can capture larger prey than piscivorous perch. Therefore, perch reach a size refuge earlier in the lakes without pike. Perch in the lakes lacking pike used both the epilimnion and hypolimnion habitats of the lakes, and a high proportion of the perch occurred below the thermocline. In contrast, perch in the lakes with pike were mainly captured along the littoral zone and were never captured below the thermocline. This difference in habitat use was reflected in different diets of perch in the different lakes. Perch in the lakes with pike were also less abundant than those in the lakes lacking pike and the growth rates of individual perch and the densities of predator-sensitive prey (pelagic and littoral) were higher, indicating that the presence of pike resulted in decreased intraspecific competition in perch. Evidence for a behavioral response to predation risk was found in 1 + (1 yr old) perch, which was suggested to be due to predation risk from both larger perch and pike. It is hypothesized that the use of the cold-water hypolimnion habitat by perch in the lakes lacking pike was a response of perch to reduce metabolic demands under conditions of severe resource limitation.

Through multiple regressions, we found that female age and wing length were the only significant predictors of laying date and that female age and laying date were the only significant predictors of clutch size. Thus, when the effects of laying date were held constant, there was no detectable effect of condition on clutch size in this species.
