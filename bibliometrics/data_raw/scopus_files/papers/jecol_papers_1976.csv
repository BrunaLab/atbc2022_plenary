Samples of the shoots of a range of species from various serpentine sites including the spoil heaps of chromite mining showed that concentrations of nickel and chromium were species specific. This specificity was confirmed by the results of the analyses of plants of eight species growing on a single site. The mean nickel concentration in shoots of Silene acaulis was five times that for S. maritima. Positive correlations between chromium and nickel levels in the shoots of the plant were established for five of the eight species examined and other inter element correlations were observed in some species. Roots of individuals of three species were analyzed and the nickel concentrations (ash weight basis) were shown to approach or even to exceed the soil concentrations, whereas the chromium concentrations in the roots were well below soil values. The 'availability' of chromium and nickel in serpentine and non serpentine soils was studied using a range of extractants. It was concluded that all the chemical methods of extraction tested were unsatisfactory. The concentrations of the elements present in the plants were considered to give the best measure of 'availability'. Addition of 51CrO42- or 51Cr3 to soils showed that both forms were strongly bound and not readily solubilized using a variety of extractants.",44,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,1
