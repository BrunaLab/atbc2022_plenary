In Mesozoic mammals, other than multituberculates, this movement always has a transverse component, which varies in amount, being least in supposedly carnivorous forms and greatest in herbivorous forms. When seen in the direction of relative movement, the molars of all pre Cretaceous mammals (except the docodontids and multituberculates) appear as purely shearing structures. Opposition between upper and lower teeth arose among Theria in the Creataceous with the development of the tribosphenic pattern. In herbivorous groups during the Tertiary, opposition formed the basis of a grinding action involving movement in directions different from the shearing stroke."

It is pointed out that this model can be constructed in 2 ways, either by conforming to the biological controls inferred by the Zahnreihe theory of Edmund (1960, 1962) or to the biological inhibitions postulated by Osborn (1971) following a study of the ontogeny of the dentition of L. vivipara. It is argued that the latter theory incorporates biological possibilities and an economy of speculation which far outweigh the number and improbability of the speculations inferred by the Zahnreihe theory. It is noted that both the rate of tooth replacement in a tooth position and the rate of addition of tooth families at the back of the dentition are probably exponentially determined whereas the model constructed here, like that used to construct the Zahnreihe theory, is based on arithmetic progressions."

Selection for a posteriorly directed line of muscle action was the primary cause for the initial development of this process, and such selection occurred in conjunction with the predatory habits of the advanced sphenacodontids. In sphenacodontids, the height of the coronoid process was raised past a threshold and eventually allowed selection for a higher moment arm by further rise in the process to become effective. Cynodont evolution is characterized by extensive development of the coronoid process which then migrated posteriorly. The model shows that these are understandable events. Other events in cynodonts include the development of the masseter muscle, first as an extension of the external adductor, and later with an added superficial component acting anterodorsally. Selection for the development of the masseter muscle and for the rise of jaw articulation in advanced cynodonts may have involved the use of the cheek teeth in rudimentary chewing. The technique of solving functional and evolutionary problems by using mathematical models to explore possible evolutionary pathways has been used previously in coiled shells, in tooth replacement, and in a few other situations. This technique promises to be used more often in the future."

Modern columella systems, for example in birds, have independently evolved to be as sensitive. An improvement noted in high frequency transmission in modern mammal middle ears is unlikely to have been a selective pressure in Mesozoic reptiles. In the inner ear, selective pressure favoured the development and maintenance of higher endocochlear potentials for greater sensitivity at the hair cell level. With regard to the basilar membrane, elongation from the elliptical condition brought about consistent frequency analysis, and further elongation extended the range of frequencies the membrane could analyze. Physical restrictions have limited this elongation in some birds, but coiling in the mammals has permitted elongation which in some cases allows analysis of very high ultrasonic frequencies."
