Small mammals were surveyed in four habitat types along a disturbance gradient (unlogged forest, selectively logged forest, cultivated areas and areas abandoned after cultivation) within and around the Sinharaja rain forest in south-west Sri Lanka. Twenty 90-m×40-m plots were live trapped in each of these habitat types. Twelve taxa: nine rodents (Srilankamys ohiensis, Rattus rattus kelaarti, R. r. kandianus, Mus mayori, M. cervicolor, Bandicota indica, Funambulus layardi, F. sublineatus and F. palmarum) and three insectivores (Crocidura miya, Suncus zeylanicus and Feroculus feroculus) were recorded. Of these, five were endemic to Sri Lanka at the species level (species confined to the island) and six at subspecies level (subspecies confined to the island; other subspecies occurring on the Indian subcontinent). Species richness of small mammals decreased with the magnitude of forest disturbance. The endemic species selectively utilized sites within the forest whilst the majority of the other taxa used both forest and non-forest habitat types or were restricted to the latter. Bird surveys were carried out in the same plots, using sightings and calls. Sixty-six bird species were recorded, of which 21 were endemic species. Twenty endemic bird species preferentially used sites within the forest. The findings suggest that the forest-dwelling endemic species of both small mammal and bird encounter difficulties in tolerating modified landscapes, whilst other taxa are less affected. This highlights the vulnerability of endemic species to forest conversion.

The physical condition of bearded pigs (Sus barbatus) that were captured, observed or photographed by camera traps also revealed that the pigs were in various stages of emaciation and starvation. We surmise that the famine resulted from prolonged scarcity of fruit during an intermast interval in the study area. These phenomena of emaciated animals and fruit scarcity have also been reported from other areas of Borneo. Lowland tropical rain-forest trees of Borneo display supra-annual synchronized general fruiting. We believe that the starvation we observed and the generally low density of large animals in Borneo forests is a consequence of a history of prolonged food scarcity during non-general-fruiting years, but may be accentuated by anthropogenic factors such as forest fragmentation, selective logging, and reduced density of fig trees in logged forests.

We applied fractal analysis, circular, and conventional statistics to published and newly recorded trail maps of seven Atta colonies focusing on three aspects: permanence, spatio-temporal plasticity and colony life stage. In the long term, trail patterns of young and mature Atta colonies revealed that foraging activities were focused on distinct, static sectors that made up only parts of their potentially available foraging range. Within these foraging sectors, trails were typically ephemeral and highly variable in space and time. These ephemeral trails were concentrated around permanent trunk trails in mature and around nest entrances in young colonies. Besides these similarities, the comparison of trail systems between the two life stages indicated that young colonies exploited fewer leaf sources, used smaller and less-complex systems of foraging trails, preferred different life forms as host plants, and switched hosts more often compared with mature colonies. Based on these analyses, we propose a general hypothesis which describes the foraging pattern in Atta as a result of initial foraging experiences, spatio-temporal distribution of suitable host plants, energetic constraints, and other factors such as seasonality and interspecific predation.

Larval host plants were inferred from adults emerging from the soil containing the roots of known tree species. In total, 2495 chrysomelids from 100 species were reared from the roots. Almost 90% of adults in the forest canopy recruited from the species with root-feeding larvae, while species with leaf-feeding larvae represented 1% of individuals (the feeding guild for the remaining 9% was unknown). The root-feeding larvae were thus more important in tropical than temperate forests, possibly because of predation pressure by ants on tropical vegetation. The number of chrysomelids emerging annually from the soil in 1 ha of the forest was approximately 0.2 million. Root-feeding larvae were polyphagous as their modal host range included three or four from the six plant families studied. The lack of correlation between the phylogenetic distance of tree species and the similarity of their chrysomelid assemblages indicated that host choice was not constrained by plant phylogeny. The host range of larvae feeding on roots was as wide as that of the conspecific adults feeding on the foliage. The density and species composition of larval and adult assemblages on the studied trees were not correlated. These results suggest that even studies restricted to adult assemblages, which represent a majority of chrysomelid studies, can be informative, as the composition of adult assemblages is not necessarily constrained by larval host-plant selection.

Giraffe, kudu and impala mainly browsed the same species and plant parts but browsed at different heights. There was no difference in resource use overlap between seasons with different resource availability.

Both types of species are present in flocks of a Sri Lankan rain forest: orange-billed babblers (Turdoides rufescens Blyth) are highly gregarious, whereas greater racket-tailed drongos (Dicrurus paradiseus Linnaeus) are less so, but more sensitive and reliable alarm-callers. We hypothesized that flock participants would be attracted to the playback of both species more than to the clearly non-nuclear yellow-fronted barbet (Megalaima flavifrons Cuvier). Further, we hypothesized that insectivores would prefer babbler vocalizations, as babblers could facilitate their foraging in several ways. We found that the response of insectivores was three times greater during babbler or drongo playback, and eight times greater during playback of these two species together, than during barbet playback or silence. Insectivores did not show, however, any difference in their response to babbler as compared to drongo playback; omnivores and frugivores responded relatively equally to all treatments. Our results show that birds with high propensity to flock, such as insectivores, use the vocalizations of nuclear species to locate flocks and that a sentinel species may be as attractive as a highly gregarious species.

A total of 55 epiphyte species and 910 individuals were found on the 27 host species. On hosts with a dbh range of 5-10 cm, epiphytes were significantly more diverse (4.3±0.9 species per host) and more abundant (12.5±2.2 individuals per host) on tree ferns than on angiosperm trees (1.9±0.2 species per host and 3.9±0.6 individuals per host). However, these differences were not significant for the dbh class of 10-20 cm, because epiphyte numbers increased on angiosperm trees with larger host size, but not in tree ferns. Most epiphyte species had no preference for any host group, but four species were significantly more frequent on tree ferns and two species on angiosperm trees. The higher epiphyte diversity and abundance on tree fern trunks of the smallest dbh class is attributed to their presumably greater age and to two stem characteristics, which differed significantly between host groups, the thicker root mantle and higher water retention capacity of tree ferns. These bark characteristics may favour germination and establishment of epiphytes.

The analyses were based on sixty-nine 0.1-ha plots in which all woody plants with a diameter at breast height (dbh) ≥2.5 cm were inventoried (19 775 individuals and 1729 species in total). The plots were located at two Yasuní and five Madidi sites, with an average of 10 plots per site. Overall, oligarchic dominance was pronounced at all the spatial scales investigated, although decreasing with increasing scale. Cross-scale relative abundance ranks were more consistent in Yasuní than in Madidi, while no such difference was apparent within single sites. Quantitative dominance and consistency of relative abundance ranks increased with taxonomic rank, being stronger at the family level than at genus and species levels. Species-level dominance was somewhat stronger within the 10 most common families in either region, than in other families. Dominance was similarly strong for canopy (dbh ≥10 cm) and understorey trees (dbh <10 cm), and less pronounced among lianas. In conclusion, our results provide strong evidence that western Amazonian forests can be dominated by limited oligarchies of species, genera and families over large expanses.

Positive associations may result when one species ameliorates overall hostile conditions, such as the shade and moisture provided the seedlings of long-leaf pine by the canopy of the saw palmetto (Allen 1956).

Biomass accumulation was accompanied by a rapid decrease in woody plant density and an increase of the positive skew of plant size distribution. Liana biomass share declined from 5.0% in young to 1.9% in old regrowth, and 1.3% in mature forest, whereas the share of palms was low (0.5%) in young regrowth and high in old regrowth (1.8%) and mature forest (2.2%). 25-y-old regrowth was similar with mature forest in respect to woody plant density and growth-form composition, but both the plant size distribution and the number of stems per plant differed strongly from mature forest. A moderate increase in land use had only minor effects on biomass accumulation, but profoundly changed structural characteristics of regrowth, pointing to a high vulnerability to degradation.

Leaf litter mass decreased to less than a third (862 to 263 g m-2 y-1) with increasing elevation (1890 m to 3060 m), whereas fine-root litter production increased by a factor of about four (506 to 2084 g m-2 y-1).

Fine-root litter production was not synchronized with leaf litterfall and was seasonal only at 3060 m with mortality peaks in the drier and the wetter periods. We conclude that dying fine roots represent a very important fraction of total litterfall in tropical montane forests that can exceed the quantity of leaf litter. At 3060 m, the largest part of the organic material on top of the soil must originate from dying fine roots but not from fallen leaves.

This paper describes an anomalous forest just 6 km south of the equator in lowland Ecuador that is structurally mature, surrounded by hyperdiverse forest, but strikingly poor in species. To investigate the anomaly, a 1-ha tree inventory and soil analysis were carried out and compared with 15 similar surveys of upland forest in the same region. The anomalous forest contains only 102 tree species ha-1, compared with a regional mean of 239 ± 28 species ha-1. It is structurally indistinguishable from richer forests, and closest in composition to upland forest, but lacks the uplands' typically rich understorey tree community. Three hypotheses for its origin are examined: recovery from anthropogenic disturbance, unique soil conditions and recovery from a large-scale natural catastrophe. The third hypothesis is the best supported. Mineralogical, geological and remote-sensing evidence, and 14C-dating suggest that the forest grows on a vast debris plain left by a catastrophic flooding event roughly 500 y ago. The forest's low diversity today is most likely due to the failure of a full complement of the region's tree species - especially understorey taxa - to recolonize the outwash plain in the time since the disaster.

Seeds placed on top of the soil rarely germinated, while seeds covered with elephant dung or buried under the soil surface had a germination success between 23-43%. On bare soil 39% of both the dung-covered and buried seeds germinated, in perennial grass swards 24-43%, and under tree canopies 10-24% respectively. In laboratory experiments, seed water absorption correlated positively with temperature up to 41°C, while subsequent germination was optimal at lower (21-23°C) temperatures. Seeds that had absorbed water lost their viability when kept above 35.5°C. The absence of light did not significantly influence germination success.

Tetragastris trees attracted opportunistic frugivore species available in the area, the most productive trees attracting more consumer species. Only primates, which are more susceptible to forest disturbances than birds and have low abilities to cross a non-forested matrix, were more frequent at Tetragastris on the mainland than on islands. Only opportunistic frugivorous primate species acting as low-efficiency seed dispersers were recorded. As a result, seed removal was equally low among habitats (nearly 26%), high percentages of seeds dropping below tree crowns. The scarcity of large-bodied specialist frugivorous primates throughout the landscape probably explained this low removal. Our results underline how difficult it is to generalize the cascading effects of disruptions in a frugivore community on tree seed fate, these effects likely varying according to the tree species and animal community involved.

Two experiments were conducted on Mantidactylus bicalcaratus and M. punctatus, two sympatric frog species from Madagascar that live and breed in rain-forest plants (Pandanus spp.), to test for interspecific competition. The first experiment examined larval growth rates and survivorship with and without conspecifics. While survivorship did not differ among treatments, mean growth rates for M. bicalcaratus were significantly reduced in the presence of M. punctatus larvae. The second experiment manipulated the presence and density of adults in Pandanus plants. Emigration from and immigration to experimental plants tended to be higher and lower, respectively, for M. bicalcaratus in the presence of M. punctatus, but these differences were not significant. These results demonstrate asymmetric competition (at least as larvae) and indicate that M. punctatus is the superior competitor. Field data showed that M. bicalcaratus was found significantly more frequently in the absence of M. punctatus. Also, M. bicalcaratus populations were significantly more likely to go locally extinct in the presence of M. punctatus.

Maximum photosynthesis (A max) and stomatal conductance (gmax) were significantly higher during the wet season; however, the physiological response to drought was not a clear function of growth light environment. For some species, such as Psychotria sp. growing in the mid-canopy, internal leaf CO2 concentration (Ci) was > 30% lower during the dry season suggesting that declines in Amax were caused in part by stomatal limitations to CO2 diffusion. For other species, such as Brosimum lactescens growing at the top of the canopy, Tovomita schomburgkii growing in the mid-canopy, and Dinizia excelsa growing in the understorey, dry season Ci declined by < 20% suggesting that factors independent of CO2 diffusion were more important in limiting Amax.

Small-island howlers were thus predicted to consume fewer resources, in particular less fruit, and to be less selective in diet choice than large-island howlers. As predicted, small-island howlers consumed fewer resources and obtained a smaller fraction of their intake from rare tree species (those contributing < 1% of basal area).

Geostatistical techniques as well as univariate statistics were used to quantify the spatial autocorrelation and variability of selected nutrients (N, P and K), carbon and standing leaf litter. Most variability in this forest was spatially dependent at a scale of 30 m or less. However the average range of autocorrelations varied greatly between properties and sites. Burning altered soil heterogeneity by decreasing the range over which soil properties were autocorrelated. Overall the average patch size (range) for nitrogen was reduced by 7%, phosphorus by 52%, potassium by 60% and carbon by 43%. While phosphorus and leaf litter increased in the burned plots compared to unburned plots, potassium was not different. Nitrogen and carbon did not display a consistent pattern between burning regimes and this may be explained by variation in fire intensity. Leaf litter measurements did not correlate with measured soil nutrients within plots. Observed changes in the burned forest were likely a result of both the intensity of burning and change in vegetative cover between the time of the fires and soil sampling.

As plots were long and thin, and followed altitudinal isoclines, we were able to avoid the trade off between plot size and precision of measurement of topographical variables. The minimum distance between plots (1 km) was sufficient to avoid spatial autocorrelation in topographical variables. However, indices of plot similarity based on species composition were spatially autocorrelated to distances of at least 4 km. Although Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) indicated significant effects of altitude, slope, and watershed on species composition within plots, topographical variables were generally poor surrogates for species distributions. Differences between eastern and western watersheds within the reserve were not due to distance effects, and most species occurred in both watersheds, indicating that differences in species assemblages between watersheds are determined by ecological factors. Habitat specialization and local density were not clearly associated with rarity. At scales of 1-10 km, both distance and habitat affect the distribution of understorey shrubs of the genus Psychotria, but much of the variation in species abundances remains unexplained.

Under well-watered conditions, mycorrhizal colonization resulted in an increase of net photosynthesis, growth and phosphorus uptake. When submitted to water stress, no growth reduction of mycorrhizal seedlings was observed. Mycorrhizal seedlings were more sensitive to drought than non-mycorrhizal ones in terms of carbon assimilation, but not with regard to stomatal closure. In contrast to previous studies on temperate tree seedlings, this result precludes a mycorrhizal effect on the hydraulic properties of this species. Furthermore, our results suggest that below a specific threshold of soil moisture, carbon assimilation of D. guianensis seedlings was decreased by the mycorrhizal symbiosis. This is probably related to the competition between the plant and its host fungus for carbon allocation under low light intensity, even though it did not seem to have a significant effect on mortality in our experiment.

Foraging patterns were studied in a population of Heliconius charitonia butterflies having three phenotypes (females and two male phenotypes) which differ in their wing morphology and reproductive behaviour. As in previous studies, intersexual differences in foraging patterns were found; more interestingly, intrasexual differences were found between alternative male mating strategies. Using morphological and behavioural data, as well as data from previous flight analyses in Heliconius butterflies, we show that intrasexual differences may be explained by the energetic demands of each phenotype. Energetic expenditure is partially related to phenotypic variability in flight morphology and efficiency, and at least in both male phenotypes, differences may also be related to the energetic demands of alternative mating strategies.

Mean foliar concentrations of phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium decreased with increasing precipitation, whereas foliar carbon:nitrogen increased with increasing precipitation. Mean foliar nitrogen:phosphorus varied from 16.4-23.8 suggesting that plant productivity at these sites is limited by phosphorus. Total soil nitrogen increased as a function of foliar litter lignin:nitrogen, whereas net nitrogen mineralization rates decreased with increasing lignin:N indicating that as litter quality decreases, more soil nitrogen is held in soil organic matter and the mineralization of that nitrogen is slower. Extractable phosphorus in soil was negatively correlated with foliar litter lignin:phosphorus, illustrating effects of litter quality on soil phosphorus availability. Overall, the results suggest that variation in plant community composition along this precipitation gradient is tightly coupled with soil nutrient cycling. Much of our understanding of effects of precipitation on nutrient cycling in tropical forest is based on precipitation gradients across montane forest in Hawaii, where species composition and soil parent material are constant.

Directed deterrence has been criticized as being unlikely in natural systems, but has rarely been explicitly tested. We evaluated the potential for directed deterrence to explain the double-layered viscous fruit morphology and fruiting phenology of Terminalia impediens, a common canopy tree endemic to New Guinea. The large fleshy fruits of this tree are consumed and dispersed by cassowaries (Casuarius spp.) and are consumed and killed by palm cockatoos (Probosciger aterrimus). Fruit flesh in this tree species appears to function as a deterrent to seed predation by palm cockatoos; the fruits of T. impediens fall to the ground before ripening, and are avoided by palm cockatoos until after the flesh has rotted off the hard nut. We found that palm cockatoos are able to prey upon seeds from fruits without flesh on the forest floor more efficiently than they can consume seeds from unripe fruit still on the trees. Further, through foraging preference tests, we found that palm cockatoos largely ignore seeds within ripe fruit on the ground, but readily eat the seeds when the fruit flesh has been removed. Cassowaries consume the fruit whole, when ripe, and defecate seeds in piles away from parent trees, where seed predation rates are lower. These results challenge the prevailing view that fleshy fruits evolved in tight synchrony with high-quality seed dispersers and add support to the non-exclusive hypothesis that aspects of fruit fleshiness may also have evolved as a response to seed predation.

This study, conducted in the Chimalapas region of Oaxaca, Mexico, documents changes in live tree biomass, live fine-root biomass, and fallen and standing dead wood 4 y following deep ground fires occurring in TMCF during the 1997-98 El Niño Southern Oscillation event. Forests growing on two different substrates (metamorphic and sedimentary) and having three different statures (mean canopy heights: 20-30 m, 15-20 m and 4-6 m) were assessed within six paired plots established on adjacent burned and unburned forest sites. Total live tree biomass was 82% and 88% lower for burned TMCF growing on metamorphic and sedimentary substrates, respectively, compared with unburned TMCF. Nearly 100% of the living biomass was killed in elfin TMCF located on exposed sedimentary limestone at the highest elevations. Live fine-root biomass in the upper organic soil horizon of burned TMCF sites was 49% lower on metamorphic substrates and 77% lower on sedimentary substrates compared with unburned sites. The amount of total dead wood was 3- to 14-fold greater in burned forests compared with unburned forests. These results suggest that first-time fires in relatively undisturbed TMCF can cause dramatic changes in live above- and below-ground biomass at levels greatly exceeding values reported for most lowland tropical rain forests. These patterns may be attributed to the slower decomposition rates and thick organic soils typical of TMCF, combined with the relatively fast drainage associated with steep topography and, in some locations, sedimentary limestone-derived substrates.

Water availability is determined by rainfall and also by the available water capacity of the soil. However, while rainfall is recognized as important, linkages between plant distribution and differences among soils in available water capacity have not been demonstrated. One reason for this may be that measurements of soil moisture, such as gravimetric water content, may be overly simplistic. To investigate this, we compared two sites in Panama, Allee and Rio Paja, which have similar rainfall but different plant communities. Soil water release curves were obtained from about -0,1 MPa to - 9 MPa, permitting us to calculate available water capacity. The Rio Paja site had 17% greater available water capacity (between - 0.1 MPa to - 3 MPa), whereas the gravimetric water content at Rio Paja was lower by 16% in rainy season and by 41% at the end of the dry season. Hence soil gravimetric water content and soil available water capacity did not correspond. The results suggest that available water capacity may better predict plant distributions. Hence, whenever possible, available water capacity should be determined in addition to gravimetric water content.

Previous research showed that the key dispersal agent of the neotropical tree, Virola calophylla, is the spider monkey (Ateles paniscus). Spider monkeys generate a heterogeneous seed deposition pattern because they scatter-disperse seeds diurnally, whereas they clump-disperse seeds at their sleeping sites. The recruitment consequences of this pattern were investigated using manipulative experiments and observations. Scatter-hoarding by spiny rats (Proechimys spp.) caused little rearrangement of the initial seed deposition pattern because they moved seeds only short distances. Seed survival to the seedling stage depended negatively on conspecific seed density and positively on the distance from the nearest adult V. calophylla female. These effects were likely mediated by two important seed predators, spiny rats and beetles (Scolytidae). Furthermore, spider monkeys' seed deposition patterns influenced seed survival. Scatter-dispersed and experimentally dispersed seeds had the highest survival. Conversely, clump-dispersed seeds at sleeping sites, which are far from V. calophylla females, and non-dispersed seeds had equally low survival, suggesting that conspeciflc density- and distance-dependence acted independently and did not explain all variation in seed survival. Instead, other characteristics of the seed deposition pattern, such as the multi-specific assemblage of seeds at sleeping sites, also affected post-dispersal seed fates.

RSOM was examined for 16 mid-storey and canopy tree species from a second tropical forest at Barro Colorado Island (BCI). Panama. Interspecific variation in RSOM was equally large for BCI and Pasoh and was unrelated to gap dependence or life form for BCI species. The shape of the relationship between size and the proportion of individuals that were reproductive differed between forests, with an abrupt increase over a narrow range of sizes at Pasoh and a more gradual increase over a wider range of sizes at BCI. Both overtopping trees and heavy liana infestation reduced the probability that BCI trees were reproductive. This presumably reflects reduced availability of carbon for reproduction. We speculate that greater liana loads and a greater abundance of large, shade-casting trees at BCI may increase variation among individuals and contribute to the relatively wide range of sizes characterized by a mixture of sterile and fertile individuals observed for most BCI species.

Its seeds are enclosed in a calyx exuding extremely sticky resin which adheres strongly to feathers. Birds are obviously seed-dispersal vectors, but the multi-seeded infructescences frequently entangle birds, often fatally. On Cousin Island, Seychelles, I investigated the production, germination, survival, and tolerance to seawater of Pisonia seeds, and the occurrence of entanglement with birds. Fresh seeds had high germination success (62-87% in experimental trays), but seedling survival in Cousin's forests was low (0.1% of 6020 seeds survived as seedlings after 2-8 mo). Some seeds tolerated 30 min daily immersions in seawater (8-15% germination after 14-28 d treatment), but not continuous immersion in seawater (reduced germination after 5 d and none after 12 d), Inter-island dispersal is likely via living unencumbered seabirds carrying a few seeds, but not on floating carcasses. Seeds attached to carcasses did not have improved germination or survival. Intra-island propagation is almost entirely vegetative, with negligible local seed dispersal. Pisonia plants therefore do not benefit from fatal entanglements. The extreme stickiness of the seeds evidently evolved to resist removal by seabirds and so facilitate long-distance dispersal. The mortality of some potential vectors is an unfortunate consequence, but has little impact on the large populations of tree- and ground-nesting seabirds which nest in or under these trees.

At each of 69 locations grouped along a topographic sequence the PAR reflected from the top of the canopy, the vertical profile of transmittance, and the reflectance from the ground, were measured as many as four times in the year, including the extremes of the wet and dry seasons. With these observations an annual balance of the portion of PAR radiation reflected and absorbed by the canopy and ground was assembled and the detailed spatial and temporal dynamics of PAR within canopy layers were estimated. Canopy stature declined along the topographic sequence and the shape of the transmittance profiles reflected this. In locations of declining moisture availability the fraction of PAR absorbed by the ground increased and the fraction absorbed by non-foliar tissues decreased. Seasonal variation in canopy structure was the dominant influence on the partitioning of radiation - spatial variation was less important. Of a total annual PAR input of 15 200 mol m -2, about 95% of incident PAR was absorbed, 50% by leaves, 25% by non-foliar tissues and 20% by the ground.

Seedlings were grown in a shade house with 15% above-canopy light in a 50:50 forest soil-sand mixture and were watered frequently; pots were placed so that seedling density was 130 seedlings m-2 of ground. In the first experiment there were 45 pairwise combinations of species when seedlings were 30 cm tall (AB, AC, AD, . . . . BC, BD . . . IJ; where A, B, C . . . J signify different species); each combination was replicated 10 times so there were 450 pots with 900 seedlings.

Ab (30 cm A with 20 cm b), each combination was replicated 10 times hence there were 1000 pots with 2000 seedlings.

We found few significant differences between species in: initial seedling heights; leaf nitrogen concentrations; and specific leaf areas when they were grown in similar conditions, and these attributes were not correlated with growth rates.

(2) is there a shift in species dominance over time? and (3) does the intensity of breeding activity vary seasonally? The number of species captured varied seasonally and tended to be least during the period of minimal trap success. Trap success for the four most abundant species (Sylvisorex johnstoni, Crocidura batesi, Paracrocidura schoutedeni and Sylvisorex ollula) varied seasonally with a minimum around the long dry season. Sylvisorex johnstoni remained the dominant species throughout the year. Seasonal variation in trap success of shrews might be related, at least partly, to their reproductive characteristics. Litter size, based on embryo counts, ranged from 1-4 among the species. Breeding occurred throughout the year, but its intensity was lower during the long dry season corresponding with the period of higher ecological constraints for shrews.

A convergent trait that was phylogenetically independent across the two genera was the presence of a deeper tap-root at any height and any root biomass in sandy-soil specialists than in clay-rich-soil specialists. This trait was fixed independently of the edaphic conditions in which the trees actually grew. Finer-textured soils generally have better water-holding capacity; we concluded that seasonal water limitation would be more severe in sandy soils than in clay-rich soils, and that water limitation would provoke convergence in seedling root depth among species with the same edaphic preferences. All significant differences found in interspecific comparison within Dryobalanops were consistent with the water-availability hypothesis; the sandy-soil specialist had larger root biomass at any total biomass and had smaller leaf biomass at any root biomass than the clay-rich-soil specialist. However, for Scaphium this was not the case, suggesting that factors other than water-limitation may also underlie seedling allometric relationships.

We extend this comparison to 13 other terra firme and várzea forest sites in order to examine the fundamental dichotomy between mammal communities in these Amazonian environments. We found a consistently impoverished fauna in várzea environments both in terms of primates and other non-volant mammals, although primate density and biomass was substantially higher in várzea than in terra firme. The average Bray-Curtis mammal community dissimilarity between terra firme and várzea forests was 74%. whereas mean dissimilarity within várzea and terra firme samples was 40% and 39%. respectively. The results seem to be largely a function of high habitat heterogeneity and floristic diversity in terra firme and the physical connectivity and proximity of várzeas to adjacent terra firme forests.

Surprisingly, shrub density and mean individual above-ground biomass were highest in the sites that had been recently in fallow and intensively cultivated prior to crop abandonment.

Consequently, in the studied G. senegalensis stands, above-ground biomass appeared to be controlled by water availability - rainfall, runoff, infiltration - rather than by cropping intensity.

Some authors suggest a function in reducing splash soil erosion, leaching of substances from the leaf, and light reflectance, while other studies did not find any such correlations. We used an experimental approach to test for the effect of drip-tips on the development of epiphyllous lichen communities. Artificial leaves with and without pronounced drip-tips were exposed in a tropical lowland rain forest at La Selva Biological Station (Costa Rica) for a period of 38 mo, and the physical behaviour of rainwater was tested. On leaves with drip-tips, the water ran off in small, frequent drops 8-30 mm3 in size. On leaves without drip-tips, the water accumulated in the apex region and dripped off periodically in large drops 50-150 mm 3 in size. Nevertheless, there was no significant difference in the development of epiphyllous lichen communities on leaves with and without drip-tips, in terms of area covered, species richness and composition. However, leaves without drip-tips had more debris accumulated in the apex region and, at the same time, fewer lichen species present in this region. Thus, while drip-tips do have an influence on how water is channelled off the leaf surface, they do not impair the development of epiphyllous lichen communities, except for the apex region where the presence of drip-tips does in fact enhance, not reduce, the establishment of lichens, by preventing the accumulation of debris.

Two main activity patterns characterize the diurnal species while nocturnal and crepuscular species show overlapping activity. The association of activity rhythm with the other niche variables, food selection, functional group, body size and relative abundance, was analysed using multiple correspondence analysis. Small diurnal coprophagous species were opposed to large crepuscular necrophagous species. Species packing is suggested but further analysis showed that the variables were independent of one another.

Monthly leaf counts on 160 tagged twigs on ten individuals of each species were made through two annual cycles. Tree species exhibited a gradient of deciduousness (∼ leafless duration), ranging from semi-evergreen species (entire population never becoming leafless) to 7-mo-deciduous species. The semi-evergreen species initiated leaf flush (bud break of vegetative bud) earlier around the spring equinox. In all deciduous tree species synchronous leaf-flush initiation, with low inter-annual variability, occurred during the hot dry summer (May-June, day temperature > 40°C), prior to the onset of the rainy season. Based on the quantification of leafless period, leaf-flush duration, and leaf strategy index (leaf-flush rate/leaf-fall rate, proposed in this study) in different species, four plant functional types were recognized: (a) semi-evergreen, spring flushing, showing leaf exchange, with mean leafless period 8 d, leaf-flush duration 6-7 mo and leaf strategy index < 0.5 (Shorea robusta); (b) < 2-mo-deciduous, summer flushing, leafless period 3-8 wk, leaf-flush duration 5-6 mo, and leaf strategy index > 0.5 - < 0.7 (Anogeissus latifolia, Diospyros melanoxylon and Hardwickia binata); (c) 2-4-mo-deciduous, summer flushing, leafless period 2-3 mo, leaf-flush duration 4-5 mo, and leaf strategy index > 0.8 - < 1.0 (Acacia catechu, Lagerstroemia parviflora and Terminalia tomentosa); and (d) > 4-mo-deciduous, summer flushing, leafless period > 4-7 mo, leaf-flush duration 3-4 mo, and leaf strategy index 1.0 (Boswellia serrata and Lannea coromandelica).

However, phenology data sets spanning many years are rare in the tropics, making it difficult to evaluate possible responses of tropical communities to climate change. Here we use two data sets (1970-1983 and 1990-2002) to describe the fruiting patterns of the tropical tree community in Kibale National Park, Uganda. To address variation in spatial patterns, we describe fruiting over 2-3 y among four sites each separated by 12-15 km. Presently, the Kibale region is receiving c. 300 mm more rain than it did at the start of the century, droughts are less frequent, the onset of the rainy season is earlier, and the average maximum monthly temperature is 3.5°C hotter than it was 25 y ago. The 1990-2002 phenology data illustrated high temporal variability in the proportion of the populations fruiting. Interannual variation in community-wide fruit availability was also high; however, the proportion of trees that fruited has increased over the past 12+y. At the species level a variety of patterns were exhibited; however, a number of the most common species currently rarely fruit, and when they do, typically < 4% of the individuals take part in fruiting events. Combining the data set from 1990 to 2002 with that from 1970 to 1983 for specific species again reveals an increase in the proportion of trees fruiting between 1990 and 2002; however, the proportion of the populations fruiting decreased during the earlier period. When one examines particular species over this whole period a variety of patterns are evident. For example, Pouteria altissima exhibited a relatively regular pattern of fruiting during the 1970s; however, it rarely fruited in the 1990s. Contrasting phenological patterns at four sites revealed that at the community level the fruiting patterns of only one of the six pair-wise site combinations were correlated. Relationships between rainfall and fruiting were variable among sites. Contrasting changes in fruiting patterns over the 30 y with differences among the four sites varying in rainfall, suggests that the changes observed in fruiting may be due to climate change. Responses to this climate change are likely complex and will vary among species.

During a 1-y study in Nicaragua, we found the abundance of birds in acacia was far higher than the representation of this species in the mix of trees, whether this is estimated by number of individual trees, canopy cover or foliage cover. This higher abundance was probably related to the fact that acacias supported approximately three to four times the abundance of arthropods that were found in oaks and twice the biomass. Although oak foliage supported fewer arthropods, relatively more of them were large (> 1 cm). The greater preponderance of small arthropods in acacias versus oaks was probably related to the small leaflet size of acacias. However, it is likely that the higher abundance of arthropods in acacias, particularly herbivorous species, was related to the higher nutritional content of the acacia foliage (crude protein, minerals, non-structural carbohydrates) and lower content of digestion-inhibiting compounds (structural carbohydrates, total phenolics, condensed tannins). The major defensive mechanisms of acacia are mechanical (thorns) or qualitative-defence chemicals (cyanogenic glucosides) that are apparently more effective against vertebrate than invertebrate herbivores.
