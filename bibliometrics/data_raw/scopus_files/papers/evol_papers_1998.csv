The method, called phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR) starts by performing a principal coordinate analysis on a pairwise phylogenetic distance matrix between species. Traits under analysis are regressed on eigenvectors retained by a broken-stick model in such a way that estimated values express phylogenetic trends in data and residuals express independent evolution of each species. This partitioning is similar to that realized by the spatial autoregressive method, but the method proposed here overcomes the problem of low statistical performance that occurs with autoregressive method when phylogenetic correlation is low or when sample size is too small to detect it. Also, PVR is easier to perform with large samples because it is based on well-known techniques of multivariate and regression analyses. We evaluated the performance of PVR and compared it with the autoregressive method using real datasets and simulations. A detailed worked example using body size evolution of Carnivora mammals indicated that phylogenetic inertia m this trait is elevated and similarly estimated by both methods. In this example, Type I error at (Î±= 0.05 of PVR was equal to 0.048, but an increase in the number of eigenvectors used in the regression increases the error. Also, similarity between PVR and the autoregressive method, defined by correlation between their residuals, decreased by overestimating the number of eigenvalues necessary to express the phylogenetic distance matrix. To evaluate the influence of cladogram topology on the distribution of elgenvalues extracted from the double-centered phylogenetic distance matrix, we analyzed 100 randomly generated cladograms (up to 100 species). Multiple linear regression of log transformed variables indicated that the number of eigenvalues extracted by the broken-stick model can be fully explained by cladogram topology. Therefore, the broken-stick model is an adequate criterion for determining the correct number of eigenvectors to be used by PVR. We also simulated distinct levels of phylogenetic inertia by producing a trend across 10, 25, and 50 species arranged in 'comblike' cladograms and then adding random vectors with increased residual variances around this trend. In doing so, we provide an evaluation of the performance of both methods with data generated under different evolutionary models than tested previously. The results showed that both PVR and autoregressive method are efficient in detecting inertia in data when sample size is relatively high (more than 25 species) and when phylogenetic inertia is high. However, PVR is more efficient at smaller sample sizes and when level of phylogenetic inertia is low. These conclusions were also supported by the analysis of 10 real datasets regarding body size evolution in different animal clades We concluded that PVR can be a useful alternative to an autoregressive method in comparative data analysis.",366,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Body size | Comparative methods | Multiple regression | Phylogenetic autocorrelation | Phylogenetic inertia | Principal coordinate analysis,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA,NA,NA

Three hypotheses have been suggested to explain genetic variation in phenotypic response to varying environments (i.e., reaction norm): Lerner's homeostasis, allelic sensitivity, and gene regulation. The homeostasis hypothesis, which predicts that heterozygotes are less sensitive to the environment than homozygotes, was supported for phenotypic plasticity to unpredictable environments (microenvironmental plasticity) at the whole-genome level, but for phenotypic plasticity to predictable environments (macroenvironmental plasticity) the hypothesis was supported only at functioning quantitative trait loci (QTLs). For all growth traits studied, gene regulation was suggested to play a prevailing role in determining the norms of reaction to environments. Indirect evidence for gene regulation is that there tend to be more QTLs with larger effects on the phenotype in optimal growing conditions than suboptimal growing conditions because the expression of these QTLs identified is mediated by regulatory genes. Direct evidence for gene regulation is the identification of some loci that differ from QTLs for trait values within environments and exert an environmentally dependent control over structural gene expression. In this study, fewer environmentally sensitive QTLs were detected that display unparalleled allelic effects across environments. For stem height, there were more regulatory loci and more structural loci (whose expression is determined by gene regulation) affecting phenotypic plasticity than for basal area.

We know little about the heritability of inducible defensive characters or the range of phenotypes available for selection to act on in the field. Membranipora membranacea is a colonial marine bryozoan that produces spines within two days of exposure to waterborne predator extracts. Surveys done in 1993 and 1995 showed that the population at Friday Harbor Labs, Washington, was polymorphic for inducible spine type and was composed of a constitutively spined type that produced spines in the absence of a predator stimulus, an unspined phenotype that did not produce spines irrespective of a stimulus, and an inducibly spined phenotype that would produce spines if exposed to the appropriate cue. In 1995, the frequencies of these types were determined through a laboratory common-garden experiment; 178 colonies were cultured from metamorphosis through approximately 30 days and then exposed to the cue. The inducible type was the dominant, comprising 80.3% of the population. The constitutive type made up 6.2% of the population, and the remaining 13.4 % was the unspined type. The frequency of the three types was similar to a preliminary trial of the experiment run in 1993. Experiments also showed that the lengths of the spines of the inducible type varied continuously among genotypes. To assess causes of variation in the inducible spine response and its clonal heritability, 16 clones were subdivided and grown in a common environment and exposed to a single dosage of spine inducing substance (SIS). Spine length showed high clonal heritability. The range of colony responses from a single environment varied from relatively unresponsive to highly responsive colonies with a very low threshold of response. Norms of reaction were quantified for spine lengths of inducible genotypes originating from two field environments by testing them in a concentration series of SIS. Both spine length and spine type varied with concentration of inducer. Within a clone, colonies were more likely to produce membranous spines than corner spines at higher concentrations. At low concentrations, only straight spines were produced. This study showed that populations of M. membranacea at Friday Harbor are a mix of inducible, nonspined and constitutively spined individuals. Even the inducible individuals showed high heritable variation in the length of spine activated, suggesting that there is considerable scope for the evolution of this character. A norm-of-reaction experiment further showed that the type of spine produced, membranous or corner, varied with the concentration of the cue. Factors maintaining the polymorphism and the broad range of genotypes could include high costs of defending the spined types coupled with a shifting biotic regime.",62,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Bryozoan | Inducible defense | Membranipora | Norm of reaction | Phenotypic plasticity,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,4,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

These were found to be largely concordant. Aside from minor systematic deviations, there was little variance in allele frequency among loci within sites. Yet the allele frequencies did not follow a smooth cline, but formed a mosaic in the center, such that neighboring sites could differ markedly in their enzyme score. A detailed ecological survey revealed a correlation between this pattern and habitat. In keeping with the typical breeding sites of the parental taxa, B. bombina-like hybrids were found more often in ponds, whereas B. variegata-like hybrids were more common in puddles. In addition, there was significant heterozygote deficit (Fis) and strong linkage disequilibrium (R), both of which were stronger on the B. bombina side of the transect, and stronger in puddles than ponds. Mark-recapture data showed: (I) that the animals disperse beyond the scale of the habitat pattern; (2) frequent turn-over of individuals within sites; and (3) nonrandom movement between two sites of different habitat type. We conclude that an active habitat preference must contribute to the observed association between marker alleles and habitat. As a consequence, there is incomplete mixing of the two gene pools, which could explain the high level of F(IS) and R. The asymmetry in these parameters may reflect asymmetry in the preference or in the distribution of habitats across the zone.

Because it is difficult to see how one or a few queens can suppress the much more numerous workers, collective worker control, or policing, offers an attractive solution. When workers are less related to other workers than they are to queens, workers should be selected to suppress each other in favor of the queen's male offspring, if other things are equal. Otherwise, they should allow each other to lay male eggs. For two species of Polistes, we used DNA microsatellites to estimate these two relatednesses, to determine the sex of brood, and to determine whether male brood was produced by queens or workers. Workers were significantly more related to each other (0.63 and 0.73 for P. bellicosus and P. dorsalis, respectively) than they were to queens (0.40 and 0.54, respectively) so they were predicted to allow each other to lay the male eggs. However, workers did not lay male-destined eggs in either species, so the results do not support collective worker control. There are two possible explanations for this result.

We studied premating barriers between the warningly colored butterflies Heliconius erato and H. himera (Lepidoptera) in a narrow contact zone in Ecuador, where hybrids are found at low frequency. Eggs obtained from wild-mated females, supplemented with eggs and young larvae collected from the wild, were reared to adulthood. Adult color patterns of these progeny were then used to infer how their parents must have mated. Likelihood was used to estimate both the frequencies of potential parental genotypes from adult phenotypes collected in the wild, and the degree of assortative mating from the inferred parents. The frequencies of parental genotypes varied across the hybrid zone, but our statistical method allowed estimates of hybrid deficit and assortative mating to be integrated across all sites sampled. The best estimate of the frequency of F1 and backcross hybrid adults in the center of the hybrid zone was 10%, with support limits (7.1%, 13.0%; support limits are asymptotically equivalent to 95% confidence limits). Mating was highly assortative: in the center of the hybrid zone the cross-mating probability between H. erato and H. himera was only 5% (0.3%, 21.4%). Wild hybrids themselves mated with both pure forms, and the probabilities that they mated in any direction were not significantly lower than those among conspecifics. These results are consistent with earlier laboratory studies on mate choice, and suggest that selection against hybrids must be strong to prevent formation of a hybrid swarm.

Phratora vitellinae utilizes salicylates from the host plant to produce its larval secretion, which contains salicylaldehyde, while other Phratora species produce an autogenous secretion. To reconstruct the evolutionary history of host plant use and the larval secretion chemistry in this genus, we sequenced 1383 base pairs of the mt cytochrome oxidase I gene for six European and one North American Phratora species and three outgroup taxa. Bootstrap values of the complete nucleotide sequence were 99-100% for six of eight nodes in the maximum parsimony tree. They were 71% and 77% for the two other nodes.

Awns are associated with greater dispersibility and achene shape is correlated with speed of dormancy loss.

We analyzed morphological shifts associated with viability selection, and how patterns of bilateral symmetry were affected by survival selection, during a four-day period of cold weather in 1992 and a six-day period in 1996 in southwestern Nebraska. Birds that died during the cold were compared to those still alive when the severe weather ended. The event in 1992 killed relatively few birds, but the cold spell in 1996 killed thousands of cliff swallows and reduced their population by about 53%.

Selection was more intense in 1996 than in 1992 because of more stressful conditions in 1996.

Mortality patterns did not differ by sex, but older birds suffered heavier mortality, morphological traits generally did not vary with age Nonsurvivors were not in poorer apparent condition prior to the weather event than survivors, suggesting that selection acted directly on morphology independent of condition. Selection on body size in cliff swallows was more intense than m studies of body size evolution in other bird species.

In this paper, we provide a molecular phylogenetic study of the 19 specialist or generalist species in the bark beetle genus Dendroctonus, which collectively attack species in four different genera in the conifer family Pinaceae. Given substantial variation in diet breadth, we asked two general questions concerning the evolution of resource use in this group. How conservative is the evolution of host use in these insects? Does specialization tend to be derived (i.e., a 'dead end')? To answer these questions, we estimated the phylogeny of Dendroctonus using mitochondrial DNA sequences and mapped transitions in resource use on the resulting phylogeny estimate. The evolution of affiliations with Pinus and Picea hosts in Dendroctonus was conservative among beetle species (PTP test; P < 0.012), but there was no significant correspondence between the phylogeny of these beetles and the phylogeny among their Pinaceae hosts (among genera, P = 0.28; among Pinus species, P = 0.82). Degree of specialization, as measured in the proportion of hosts used, was bimodally distributed with 'generalist' species utilizing â¥ 60% of the congeneric hosts within their range and six specialist species utilizing â¤ 40% of the available hosts. Among the generalists, we found a strong correlation between the number of hosts encountered and the number of hosts utilized (R = 0.97, P < 0.0001), whereas there was no significant correlation among the specialists (R = 0.27, P = 0.59). The evolution of specialization in Dendroctonus proved highly labile - specialists arose from generalists at least six separate times (without reversal) all in derived positions, and closer examination of some specialists revealed instances where they appear to have lost particular host species from their diet, However, evidence from the ecological literature also suggests that several Dendroctonus generalists may have increased their range of host genera within the Pinaceae.",243,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Coevolution | Coleoptera | Cytochrome oxidase I | Dendroctonus | Insect-plant interactions | Mitochondrial DNA | Molecular systematics | Phylogeny | Phytophagous insects,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,15,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We apply an alternative statistical method, logistic regression, to estimate the strength of selection on multiple phenotypic traits. First, we argue that the logistic regression model is more suitable than linear regression for analyzing data from selection studies with dichotomous fitness outcomes. Subsequently, we show that estimates of selection obtained from the logistic regression analyses can be transformed easily to values that directly plug into equations describing adaptive microevolutionary change.

The first population ('base,' B) has experienced laboratory conditions for more than 10 years; the second ('young,' Y) and the third ('old,' O) populations were selected for early and late reproduction, respectively, before the onset of the present experiments. All three populations are successfully selected for both fast and slow preadult development: The realized heritabilities are very similar in all populations, suggesting a similar level of the additive genetic variance for preadult development. We studied the correlated responses on the following life-history traits: egg-to-adult viability, wet body weight, early fecundity, late fecundity, total realized female fecundity, and adult longevity. All life-history traits examined here, except for the egg-to-adult viability, are affected by selection for preadult development in at least in one of the studied populations. In all three populations, beetles selected for slow preadult development are heavier and live longer than those from the fast-selected lines. The findings with respect to adult longevity are unexpected, because the control Y and O populations, selected for short- and long-lived beetles, respectively, do not show significant differences in preadult development. Thus, our results indicate that some kind of asymmetrical correlated responses occur for preadult development and adult longevity each time that direct selection has been imposed on one or the other of these two traits. In contrast to studies with Drosophila, it appears that for insect species that are aphagous as adults, selection for preadult development entails selection for alleles that also change the adult longevity, but that age-specific selection (applied in the Y and O populations) mostly affects the alleles that have no significant influence on the preadult development.

This hypothesis has been tested several times by comparisons of closely related species or comparisons of populations of the same species with different histories of inbreeding. However, if one is interested in whether this relationship contributes to mating-system evolution, which occurs within populations, comparisons among families within a population are needed; that is, inbreeding depression among individuals with genetically based differences in their rate of selfing should be compared. In gynodioecious species with self-compatible hermaphrodites, hermaphrodites will have a greater history of potential inbreeding via both selfing and biparental inbreeding as compared to females and may therefore express a lower level of inbreeding depression. We estimated the inbreeding depression of female and hermaphrodite lineages in gynodioecious Lobelia siphilitica in a greenhouse experiment by comparing the performance of selfed and outcrossed progeny, as well as sibling crosses and crosses among subpopulations. We did not find support for lower inbreeding depression in hermaphrodite lineages. Multiplicative inbreeding depression (based on seed germination, juvenile survival, survival to flowering, and flower production in the first growing season) was not significantly different between hermaphrodite lineages (Î´ = 0.30 Â± 0.08) and female lineages (Î´ = 0.15 Â± 0.18), although the trend was for higher inbreeding depression in the hermaphrodite lineages. The population-level estimate of inbreeding depression was relatively low for a gynodioecious species (Î´ = 0.25) and there was no significant inbreeding depression following biparental inbreeding (Î´ = 0.01). All measured traits showed significant variation among families, and there was a significant interaction between family and pollination treatment for four traits (germination date, date of first flowering, number of flowers, and aboveground biomass). Our results suggest that the families responded differently to selfing and outcrossing: Some families exhibited lower fitness following selfing whereas others seemed to benefit from selfing as compared to outcrossing.

We present results from manipulative field experiments investigating the single and interactive fitness effects of three types of herbivory on scarlet gilia (Ipomopsis aggregata) over two years of study. We utilize these data to test whether selection imposed by herbivore attack on date of first flowering is pairwise (independent) or diffuse (dependent) in nature. Our results reveal complex patterns of the fitness effect of herbivores. Simulated early season browsing had a strong negative fitness effect on plants and also reduced subsequent insect attack. Surprisingly, this ecological interaction did not translate into significant interactions between clipping and insect manipulations on plant fitness. However, we detected a significant interaction between seed fly and caterpillar herbivory on plant fitness, with the negative effect of either insect being greatest when occurring alone. These results suggest that herbivore-imposed selection may have pairwise and diffuse components. In our selection analysis of flowering phenology, we discovered significant pairwise linear selection imposed by clipping, diffuse linear selection imposed by insects, and diffuse nonlinear selection imposed by clipping and insect attack acting simultaneously.

Ecological studies of metapopulations have established that the processes of local extinction and colonization of demes are relatively common in natural populations of many species and theoretical population genetic models have shown that these ecological processes have genetic consequences within and among local demes. Within demes, random genetic drift converts nonadditive genetic variance into additive genetic variance, increasing, rather than limiting, the potential for adaptation to local environments. For this reason, the genetic differences that arise by drift among demes, can be augmented by local selection. The resulting adaptive differences in gene combinations potentially contribute to the genetic origin of new species. These and other recent findings were not discussed by either Wright or Fisher. For example, although Wright emphasized epistatic genetic variance, he did not discuss the conversion process. Similarly, Fisher did not discuss how the average additive effect of a gene varies among demes across a metapopulation whenever there is epistasis. We discuss the implications of such recent findings for the Wright-Fisher controversy and identify some critical open questions that require additional empirical and theoretical study.",246,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Average effect | Conversion | Epistasis | Fisher | Interdemic selection | Metapopulation | Shifting balance | Variance components | Wright,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,30,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Such models predict that individuals who share the same interests are likely to communicate using 'conspiratorial whispers,' signals that are cheap and inconspicuous. Here, I present a game-theoretical model of signal detection (in a noisy environment, in the presence of potential eavesdroppers), which demonstrates that the idea of conspiratorial whispers is far too simplistic. It is true that in 'cooperative' signaling systems (where signalers attempt to elicit responses that are beneficial for receivers), signal cost is not required to maintain honesty. However, some level of expenditure is still needed to ensure that a signal is reliably detected. Moreover, there exists a conflict of interest between signalers and receivers over the division of this expenditure. To predict the stable level of display in such cases, one needs to know how this conflict of interest will be resolved. The model reveals that the outcome may range from a whisper to a conspicuous and costly (though still conspiratorial) display. The more closely related the receiver is to the signaler, the greater the level of signal exaggeration that is expected - the opposite prediction to that of honest signaling models.",29,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Cooperative communication | Game theory | Handicap principle | Honest signaling | Signal detection theory,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,31,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

A number of genetic benefits have been proposed, based on the idea that by taking multiple mates, females increase the likelihood that their offspring will be sired by genetically more compatible or superior males. If certain males have intrinsically 'good genes,' any female mating with them will produce superior offspring. Alternatively, if some males have genetic elements that are incompatible with a particular female, then she may benefit from polyandry if the sperm of such males are less likely to fertilize her eggs. We examined these hypotheses in the field cricket Gryllus bimaculatus (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). By allocating females identical numbers of matings but different numbers of mates we investigated the influence of number of mates on female fecundity, and both short- and long-term offspring fitness. This revealed no effect of number of mates on number of eggs laid. However, hatching success of eggs increased with number of mates. This effect could not be attributed to nongenetic effects such as the possibility that polyandry reduces variance in the quantity or fertilizing ability of sperm females receive, because a control group receiving half the number of copulations showed no drop in hatching success. Offspring did not differ in survival, adult mass, size, or development time with treatment. When males were mated to several different females there were no repeatable differences between individual males in the hatching success of their mate's eggs. This suggests that improved hatching success of polyandrous females is not due to certain males having genes that improve egg viability regardless of their mate. Instead, our results support the hypothesis that certain males are genetically more compatible with certain females, and that this drives polyandry through differential fertilization success of sperm from more compatible males.",237,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Female choice | Genetic incompatibility | Good genes | Gryllus bimaculatus | Inbreeding | Polyandry | Sperm competition,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,33,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Of particular significance was the finding that female fitness differences between morphs were reversed in early- and late-sown plots. This was because a greater proportion of nonradiate than radiate seed germinated directly after sowing, and in early-sown plots a relatively large proportion of early-germinated nonradiate seedlings survived winter to produce large, highly fecund plants the following summer, that contributed greatly to the total female fitness of the nonradiate morph. In contrast, in late-sown plots (i.e., sown two weeks later), survivorship of early germinated seedlings was much reduced, and the radiate morph had an advantage because most radiate seed delayed germination until spring, therefore avoiding seedling mortality during winter. The effect of the association between morph type and germination behavior on morph female fitness in S. vulgaris is clearly important in regard to the evolution of the polymorphism for outcrossing rate in the species.

Under this mechanism, herbivorous insect populations should be more prone to speciate if they are adapting to different host plants, because the evolution of reproductive isolation will be accelerated above the rate promoted by genetic drift and host-independent sources of selection alone. Although the Muller-Mayr hypothesis is widely accepted, little direct evidence has been collected in support of selection's role in allopatric speciation. This paper offers a method for isolating and evaluating the contribution of host plant-related natural selection pressures to the reproductive isolation between allopatric herbivore populations. The host-related selection hypothesis (HRSH) predicts that herbivore populations using different host plants should be more reproductively isolated than those using the same host, other things being equal. Here, I test this hypothesis using Neochlamisus bebbianae, an oligophagous leaf beetle with a geographically variable host range. In each of two sets of experiments (contrast I, contrast II), I compared two beetle populations (Georgia and New York) that use the same host (Acer) in nature and a third population that natively uses a different host (Betula in Oklahoma [CI], Salix in Ontario [CII]). Experiments showed that 'different-host' populations were more strongly differentiated in host-use traits (oviposition, host fidelity, feeding response, larval performance) than were 'same-host' populations and that each population most readily uses foliage from its native host. As predicted by the HRSH, sexual isolation was also greater between the adaptively divergent different-host populations (from Betula vs. Acer, from Salix vs. Acer) than between the same-host populations (from Acer), which were undifferentiated in host-use traits. Interpreting these results in a historical context provided by mtDNA sequences from test populations indicated: (1) that Acer- and Betula-associated N. bebbianae represent separate sibling species whose causal origins have been lost to history, and whose incomplete sexual isolation is fortified by host-associated ecological and 'physiological' isolation; and (2) that incipiently speciating Acer- and Salix-associated populations are more closely related to each other than are the two Acer-associated populations, which is consistent with the HRSH. This study thus illustrates the consequences of host-related selection for both the origin and maintenance of reproductive isolation. More important, it provides evidence that the pleiotropic effects of natural selection promote allopatric speciation.",226,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Chrysomelidae | Host fidelity | Host preference | Insect-plant interactions | Neochlamisus bebbianae | Pleiotropy | Reproductive isolation | Sibling species,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,35,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

I use a phylogenetically based comparative method to address these hypotheses for the evolution and maintenance of sexual size dimorphism among populations of three closely related lizard species (Phrynosoma douglasi, P. ditmarsi, and P. hernandezi). With independent contrasts I estimate evolutionary correlations among female body size, male body size, and sexual size dimorphism (SSD) to determine whether males have become small, females have become large, or both sexes have diverged concurrently in body size during the evolutionary Xhistory of this group. Population differences in degree of SSD are inversely correlated with average male body size, but are not correlated with average female body size. Thus, variation in SSD among populations has occurred predominantly through changes in male size, suggesting that selective pressures on small males may affect degree of SSD in this group. I explore three possible evolutionary mechanisms by which the mean male body size in a population could evolve: changes in size at maturity, changes in the variance of male body sizes, and changes in skewness of male body size distributions. Comparative analyses indicate that population differentiation in male body size is achieved by changes in male size at maturity, without changes in the variance or skewness of male and female size distributions.

A high degree of conservation of gall shape on an independently derived phylogeny of the insects and the presence of nine species of Acacia each bearing two or three morphologically disparate gall forms induced by different thrips species indicate that interspecific variation in gall form is determined predominantly by the insects. Character optimization of PC1 on the phylogeny of gall thrips suggested that the ancestral gall form was a simple roll or curl. The diversification of gall form involved four main processes: (1) the convergent evolution of relatively spherical galls in two clades; (2) the evolution of small elongate and hemispherical galls in one clade; (3) the evolution of a lobed interior in a species with a spherical gall and multiple within-gall generations; and (4) the evolution of intraspecific gall polymorphism in a clade of apparent sibling species. Comparative analyses indicated that gall sphericity was associated with the presence of physogastry (foundress hyperfecundity) and that small elongate and hemispherical forms may be associated with the presence of multiple generations in a gall and, perhaps, with the presence of soldier castes.

Patterns expressed in terms of the localization of transformations are compared with the expectations of null models that the number of transformations is proportional to measures of size or complexity.

Phylogenetic analysis of allozymes shows a well-defined split between Gulf Coast and lowland North Carolina populations, similar to previously observed phylogeographic patterns in a wide variety of taxa.

Furthermore, both average heterozygosity and patterns of isolation-by-distance decline in populations north of the former glacial border.

The northern decline in allozyme heterozygosity contrasts sharply with the northern increase in additive genetic variance of development time and photoperiodic response found in previous studies.

Increased virulence may evolve as a genetically fixed strategy, appropriate for the frequency of mixed infections in the population, or may occur as a conditional response to mixed infection, that is, a facultative strategy. Here we test whether facultative alterations in replication rates in the presence of competing genotypes occur and generate greater virulence. An important alternative, not currently incorporated in models of the evolution of virulence, is that host responses mounted against genetically diverse parasites may be more costly or less effective than those against genetically uniform parasites. If so, mixed clone infections will be more virulent for a given parasite replication rate. Two groups of mice were infected with one of two clones of Plasmodium chabaudi parasites, and three groups of mice were infected with 1:9, 5:5, or 9:1 mixtures of the same two clones. Virulence was assessed by monitoring mouse body weight and red blood cell density. Transmission stage densities were significantly higher in mixed- than in single-clone infections. Within treatment groups, transmission stage production increased with the virulence of the infection, a phenotypic correlation consistent with the genetic correlation assumed by much of the theoretical work on the evolution of virulence. Consistent with theoretical predictions of facultative alterations in virulence, we found that mice infected with both parasite clones lost more weight and had on average lower blood counts than those infected with single-clone infections. However, there was no consistent evidence of the mechanism invoked by evolutionary models that predict this effect. Replication rates and parasite densities were not always higher in mixed-clone infections, and for a given replication rate or parasite density, mixed-clone infections were still more virulent. Instead, prolonged anemia and increased transmission may have occured because genetically diverse infections are less rapidly cleared by hosts. Differences in maximum weight loss occured even when there were comparable parasite densities in mixed- and single-clone infections. We suggest that mounting an immune response against more that one parasite genotype is more costly for hosts, which therefore suffer higher virulence.",127,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Malaria | Mixed infection | Parasite | Plasmodium chabaudi | Virulence,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,48,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the brood parasites and their hosts did not speciate in parallel. The parasitic indigobirds share mitochondrial haplotypes with each other, and species limits in both indigobirds and paradise whydahs do not correspond with their gene trees.

Both phylogenetic and distance analyses indicate that the brood parasites have become associated with their host species through host switches and independent colonizations of the hosts, rather than through parallel cospeciation with them.

We looked at three changes in juvenile body size and shape: body length, body depth, and tailspine length. Fitness costs were measured as changes in adult growth and fecundity, and summarized as the intrinsic rate of increase (r) for individuals reared in the presence or absence of Chaoborus extract. The cost of plasticity was measured as a multiple regression of mean clone fitness against trait and trait plasticity. We found scant evidence for either production or maintenance costs of plasticity. We also failed to find direct costs of these juvenile structures, which is surprising, as others have found such costs. We attribute the lack of measurable direct or plasticity costs to a decrease in metabolic rates in the presence of the Chaoborus extract.

The retention of these layers, despite their high metabolic cost, throughout the evolutionary history of Corbulidae has prompted the proposal of several adaptive scenarios to explain the origin and maintenance of these layers. The most widely held hypothesis contends that conchiolin layers are an adaptation for inhibiting drilling by predatory naticid gastropods. However, others suggest that the layers are adaptations to retard shell dissolution in waters undersaturated with calcium carbonate or to increase shell strength in the face of durophagous (shell crushing) predators. In this paper, experiments using recent Corbula (Varicorbula) gibba (Olivi) and observations of corbulids' present natural habitat demonstrate the current utility of conchiolin layers for all three functions: retardation of shell dissolution in waters undersaturated in calcium carbonate, increase of mechanical shell strength, and inhibition of drilling by predatory naticid gastropods. Earlier analyses of the extensive history of naticid predator-corbulid prey interactions suggested that conchiolin layers were an adaptation, a feature that promotes fitness and was built by selection for its current role, for deterring naticid predators. Not only are naticid drillholes widespread in fossil and recent corbulid shells, but an unusually large number of incomplete drillholes terminate unsuccessfully at conchiolin layers. In addition, a phylogenetic analysis of the origin of conchiolin layers and its function to deter naticid predators is consistent with a hypothesis of adaptation for this function. However, this hypothesis is rejected by an examination of fossil Jurassic Corbulornima. These oldest corbulids contained conchiolin layers before the evolution of naticid drilling during the Early Cretaceous. Therefore, conchiolin layers appear to be an exaptation, characters evolved for other usages and later 'coopted' for their current role, for defense against drilling predators.

In this region, the two subspecies are chromosomally differentiated: M. m. domesticus carries three pairs of Robertsonian (Rb) fusion chromosomes (2n = 34), while M. m. musculus exhibits the ancestral karyotype of 2n = 40 acrocentric chromosomes. A previous chromosomal analysis showed that the Rb clines were staggered and nonconcordant, and that the Rb fusions did not introgress into the M. m. musculus genome due to incompatibilities involving only the centromeric regions. In the present study, the distribution of a centromeric NOR cluster located on an acrocentric chromosome not involved in the Rb fusions (chromosome 1 l; NOR11) was investigated to determine if the observed centromeric incompatibilities were limited to the chromosomal rearrangements or were related to centromeric differentiation between the subspecies. The cytogenetic study by silver staining documented the activity pattern of the five major NOR-bearing chromosome pairs (12, 15, 16, 18, and 19) common to both subspecies and confirmed presence of NOR11 in M. m. musculus and absence in M. m. domesticus. The NOR11 activity pattern showed a very narrow and off-centered clinal transition. An in situ hybridization analysis with rDNA probes indicated that the decrease in frequency of activity of NOR11 through the hybrid zone was related to absence of ribosomal genes in this cluster and not to transcription repression due to competitive or dominance interactions. The center of the NOR11 cline was significantly different from that of the consensus allozymic markers, but coincided with that of the steepest Rb cline. Several arguments support the view that the selective processes involved in maintaining the NOR11 cline are related to the centromeric region of these chromosomes. These include: (1) the similarity in shape and position of the Rb and NOR11 clines; (2) the absence of activity dysfunction involving NOR11; and (3) the tight linkage between NORs and centromeres in house mice. This study indicates that the centromeric segments of acrocentric chromosomes not involved in chromosomal rearrangements show incompatibilities similar to those evidenced by the Rb fusions. These centromeric incompatibilities are thus more likely related to centromeric origin and subspecific differentiation (domesticus vs. musculus) than to centromeric rearrangement (Rb vs. non-Rb). In this case, it may be predicted that the selective processes maintaining the chromosomal clines are distributed over many, if not all, the centromeres and may combine to limit the gene flow between M. m. domesticus and M. m. musculus.",19,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Centromeres | Clines | FISH | House mice | Hybrid zone | Incompatibility | Noncoincidence | NOR | Rb fusions,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,57,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Spatial autocorrelation analysis was used to explore genetic differentiation at smaller spatial scales; estimated patch sizes (within which genetic individuals are randomly associated) indicated no appeciable genetic structure at scales less than 20 m x 20 m. Calculated values of F-statistics were a function of the spatial scale from which samples were drawn: increasing the size of the 'subpopulation' included in calculation of fixation indices for the same 'total' sample resulted in an increase in the magnitude of f (e.g., from 0.092 to 0.181) and a decrease in Î (e.g., from 0.186 to 0.025). On the basis of the best estimate of the spatial scale of subpopulations, the effective number of migrants per generation (N(e)m) ranges from 1.1 to 2.8. Genetic consequences of the disturbance regime in the eelgrass habitat sampled were extreme variation between years in the allele richness and proportion of heterozygotes in a sample and a positive relationship between the extinction probability of patches and the genetic variance among them. The changes in F-statistics as a function of sampling scale and the observation that Î among sampled quadrats was positively associated with the probability of extinction among quadrats indicated that indirect estimates of gene flow (N(e)m) calculated from Î should be cautiously interpreted in populations that may not yet be in drift-migration equilibrium.",62,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Extinction | Gene flow | Genetic differentiation | Isolation by distance | Marine angiosperm | Recolonization | Theta | Zostera marina,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,59,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Furthermore, we argue that the impact on fitness of, and therefore the intensity of stabilizing intensity on, single foundress sex ratios are correlated to how frequently a species produces single foundress broods in nature. Specifically, the intensity of stabilizing selection will be greater in species that encounter single foundress broods more frequently, both because the trait is expressed more often and because fitness shows a greater sensitivity to variation (narrower fitness profile) when that trait is expressed. Across 16 species of Panamanian pollinating fig wasps, the phenotypic variance in single foundress sex ratios was negatively correlated with the frequency with which that species encounters single foundress broods in nature.

We then took the deviations from this regression, the residual number of species, and regressed them on the differences in species richness between the paired genera. This relationship was positive indicating that ornamented genera with more than the expected number of ornamented species were more speciose with respect to their paired genera than were genera with fewer than the expected number of ornamented species. Finally, we compared the deviations from this regression, the residual number of ornamented species, with species' mating system and found a greater residual number of ornamented species among species whose mating system is associated with greater skew in male mating success and thus more intense sexual selection.

In a given year, most spatial variation in relative fitness (genotype-environment [G x E] interactions for fitness) occurred over distances of only 50 cm. Year effects were as large or larger than the spatial variation in fitness; in particular there was a large, three-way, genotype-year-environment interaction at the smallest spatial scale. The genetic correlation of fitness across years at a given location was near zero, 0.03. Thus, the relative fitness of genotypes is spatially unpredictable and a map of the selective environment has constantly shifting locations of peaks and valleys. Including measurements of soil nutrients as covariates in the analysis removed most of the spatial G x E interaction. Vegetation and microtopography had no effect on the G x E terms, suggesting that differential response to soil nutrients is the cause of spatial variation in fitness. However, the slope of response to NH4 and P04 was negative; therefore the soil nutrients are probably just indicators of other, unknown, environmental factors. We explored via simulation the evolutionary consequences of spatial and temporal variation in fitness and showed that, for this system, the spatial scale of variation was too fine grained (by a factor of 3 to 5) to be a powerful force maintaining genetic variation in the population.

Here we investigate how the strength of premating isolation varies between sympatric and allopatric populations of threespine sticklebacks to test a prediction of the hypothesis of reinforcement: that interspecific mate discrimination should be stronger in sympatry than in allopatry. In conducting such tests, it is important to control for ecological character displacement between sympatric species because ecological character divergence may strengthen prezygotic isolation as a by-product. We control for ecological character displacement by comparing mate preferences of females from a sympatric population (benthics) with mate preferences of females from two allopatric populations that most closely resemble the sympatric benthic females in ecology and morphology. No choice mating trials indicate that sympatric benthic females mate less readily with heterospecific (limnetic) than conspecific (benthic) males, whereas two different populations of allopatric females resembling benthics show no such discrimination. These differences demonstrate reproductive character displacement of benthic female mate choice. Previous studies have established that hybridization between sympatric species occurred in the past in the wild and that hybrid offspring have lower fitness than either parental species, thus providing conditions under which natural selection would favor individuals that do not hybridize. Results are therefore consistent with the hypothesis that female mate preferences have evolved as a response to reduced hybrid fitness (reinforcement), although direct effects of sympatry or a biased extinction process could also produce the pattern. Males of the other sympatric species (limnetics) showed a preference for smaller females, in contrast to the inferred ancestral preference for larger females, suggesting reproductive character displacement of limnetic male mate preferences as well.",205,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Prezygotic isolation | Reinforcement | Reproductive character displacement | Speciation | Sticklebacks,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,66,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We describe a system in which an environmentally induced reduction in body size is inherited by progeny via a nongenetic maternal effect. The seed beetle, Callosobruchus maculatus, completes development inside a discrete resource package (a seed) selected by its mother. Due to superparasitism in response to low host availability, progeny frequently develop at high densities, resulting in intense larval competition and pupation at a smaller body size. Females reared at higher density (and thus emerging smaller) lay smaller eggs than females reared at lower density. Progeny from these smaller eggs mature at a smaller size than progeny reared from the larger eggs laid by females reared at lower density.

Here we argue that the principle of Baker's Law applies equally in the context of a metapopulation in which frequent local extinction is balanced by recolonization of sites by seed dispersal: metapopulation dynamics will select for an ability to self-fertilize. We review several studies that support this hypothesis and present a metapopulation model in which the seed productivity required by obligate outcrossers for their maintenance in a metapopulation is compared with that of sellers. Our model also estimates the reduction in the advantage of reproductive assurance to sellers as a result of perenniality and seed dormancy. In general, selection for reproductive assurance is greatest when the colony occupancy rate, p, is low and is much reduced when p approaches its maximum. This provides an explanation for the observation that many highly successful colonizers, in which p is often high, are self-incompatible.

The difference in reproductive success could not be explained by immigrant males having lower phenotypic quality because they had similar life span, spring arrival date, and territory quality as philopatric males. The lower lifetime fitness among immigrant than philopatric males appeared to result from reduced mating success. This suggests that females are reluctant to mate with immigrant males despite their apparently similar phenotypic quality. Though it is not known whether females gain in fitness by avoiding matings with immigrant males, it is notable that immigrant males have smaller song repertoires than philopatric males.

The two groups differ significantly in several song characteristics, particularly the trill-like long chirp given at the beginning of each song. Males with longer long chirps containing shorter interpulse intervals are more likely to be parasitized, suggesting that the flies find such males more attractive.

Therefore we examined whether the magnitude of Hsp70 expression varied during the life cycle and the relationship of this variation to several life-history traits. For 28 isofemale lines derived from a single natural population, estimates of heritable variation in Hsp70 expression ranged between 0.25 and 0.49, and the association among variation in first- and third-instar larvae and in adults correlated highly. Thus, Hsp70 expression is genetically coupled at these developmental stages. A line engineered with extra copies of the hsp70 gene produced more Hsp70 and survived heat shock much better than did a control strain. Among natural lines, Hsp70 expression was only weakly related to tolerance of heat shock and to larva-to-adult survival and developmental time at permissive temperatures. Additionally, lines with high adult survival developed slowly as larvae, which is a possible trade-off.

Inbreeding significantly decreased the individual contribution of seeds to the next generation in the field, but this decrease apparently is not enough to explain the maintenance of gynodioecy. The inbred progeny contributes significantly to the population genetic structure of P. dubia. Fitness estimates and fitness components tended to decrease, usually monotonically, with F. However, nonmonotonic relationships were found in male fitness components and, in some families, in fitness estimates, seed production per fruit, and establishment. Most of the inbreeding depression takes place at the level of seed establishment in the field, but, in artificial conditions the effects of inbreeding were similar at fecundity and establishment. I studied maternal and nonmaternal components of inbreeding by testing the effects of the relatedness of maternal grandparents and parents on the performance of the progeny. Both components affected fitness. Inbreeding depression was conditioned by the level of inbreeding of the maternal plant, but this interaction varied at different fitness components. Also, the magnitude and even the direction of the relationship between fitness and F changed as a result of the combined effects of maternal and nonmaternal components of inbreeding. Such interactions can render convex or concave fitness functions, giving in the latter case the appearance of a false purging. Maternal effects of inbreeding can result from several processes: maternal investment perhaps with serial adjustments during seed development, purging of recessive deleterious genes, and nucleocytoplasmic interactions. These results illustrate the importance of maternal effects of inbreeding, and the complex effects of inbreeding on fitness.

Because a tradeoff between body size and larval developmental time has been reported in Drosophila, we study here whether or not these inversions also affect larva-adult viability and developmental time. In particular, we expect that polymorphic inversions make a statistically significant contribution to the genetic correlation between body size (as measured by thorax length) and larval developmental time.

In contrast, other streams are more permanent and contain pools with predatory fish, where larvae should remain inactive to avoid fish predation. Feeding rates and predator escape behavior were assayed for laboratory-reared larvae from 15 populations. Larval survival was also compared among populations in artificial streams with natural predators. Five populations represented streams subjected to fish predation along a gradient of genetic and geographic isolation from populations without fish; the remaining 10 populations were ephemeral and without fish. Individuals from populations with fish had significantly stronger behavioral responses to fish (i.e., decreased feeding rate associated with the presence of fish and increased escape response) than individuals from fishless populations. Larvae from populations containing fish that were more isolated from fishless populations showed stronger antipredator responses than less isolated populations. Further, larvae from more isolated populations survived longer in the predation experiment, indicating that the behaviors measured were related with survival.

The ancestral host plant appears to be associated within a highly derived rosid clade, including the family Fabaceae. As fossil data suggest that this clade is older than the butterflies, they must have colonized already diversified plants. Previous studies also suggest that the patterns of association in most insect-plant interactions are more shaped by host shifts, through colonization and specialization, than by cospeciation. Consequently, we have focused explicitly on the mechanisms behind host shifts. Our results confirm, in the light of new phylogenetic evidence, the pattern reported by Ehrlich and Raven that related butterflies feed on related plants. We show that host shifts have generally been more common between closely related plants than between more distantly related plants. This finding, together with the possibility of a higher tendency of recolonizing ancestral hosts, helps to explain the apparent large-scale conservation in the patterns of association between insects and their host plants, patterns which at the same time are more flexible on a more detailed level. Plant growth form was an even more conservative aspect of the interaction between butterflies and their host plants than plant phylogeny.

The work described in this paper addresses this question by surveying DNA restriction site variation at six nuclear genes from nine populations encompassing most of the species's North American range, and then attempting to fit the patterns of variation observed at these genes to five different evolutionary models using computer simulations of the coalescent process. Two commonly used constant population size models, one hypothesizing no migration among populations and one hypothesizing equal rates of migration among populations, were found to be statistically inconsistent with the observed patterns of variation. The other three models, which involved either recent divergence among populations coupled with large changes in populations size, unequal migration rates among populations, or selection, were all found to be consistent with the observed patterns of variation.

Activities of a parasite that increase its rate of infectious transmission are presumed to reduce its host's fitness. This reduction in host fitness impedes vertical transmission of the parasite and causes a tradeoff between horizontal and vertical transmission. Given this tradeoff, and assuming no multiple infections (no within-host competition among parasites), a simple model predicts that the density of uninfected hosts in the environment should determine the optimum balance between modes of parasite transmission. When susceptible hosts are abundant, selection should favor increased rates of horizontal transfer, even at the expense of reduced vertical transmission. Conversely, when hosts are rare, selection should favor increased vertical transmission even at the expense of lower horizontal transfer. We tested the tradeoff hypothesis and these evolutionary predictions using conjugative plasmids and the bacteria that they infect. Plasmids were allowed to evolve for 500 generations in environments with different densities of susceptible hosts. The plasmid's rate of horizontal transfer by conjugation increased at the expense of host fitness, indicating a tradeoff between horizontal and vertical transmission. Also, reductions in conjugation rate repeatedly coincided with the loss of a particular plasmid-encoded antibiotic resistance gene.

We show that this epistasis for fitness between the parental and offspring genotypes can result in the evolution of their joint distribution, generating genetic correlations between the parental and offspring characters. This phenomenon can be viewed as a coadaptive process in which offspring genotypes evolve to function with the parentally provided environment and, in turn, the genes for this environment become associated with specific offspring genes adapted to it. To illustrate this point, we present two scenarios in which selection on offspring alone alters the correlation between a maternal and an offspring character. We use a quantitative genetic maternal effect model combined with a simple quadratic model of fitness to examine changes in the linkage disequilibrium between the maternal and offspring genotypes. In the first scenario, stabilizing selection on a maternally affected offspring character results in a genetic correlation that is opposite in sign to the maternal effect. In the second scenario, directional selection on an offspring trait that shows a nonadditive maternal effect can result in selection for positive covariances between the traits. This form of selection also results in increased genetic variation in maternal and offspring characters, and may, in the extreme case, promote host-race formation or speciation. This model provides a possible evolutionary explanation for the ubiquity of large genetic correlations between maternal and offspring traits, and suggests that this pattern of coinheritance may reflect functional relationships between these characters (i.e., functional integration).",162,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Correlational selection | Epistasis | Genetic correlation | Genetic integration | Indirect genetic effects | Kin effects | Maternal effects,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,88,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

The average reduction in the genetic load was as expected if inbreeding depression in this population is caused by highly deleterious recessive alleles that are efficiently removed by selection. For P. p. leucocephalus, a population that experiences periodic bottlenecks in the wild, the effect of further inbreeding in the laboratory was to exacerbate rather than reduce the genetic load. Recessive deleterious alleles may have been removed from this population during repeated bottlenecks in the wild; the population may be close to a threshold level of heterozygosity below which fitness declines rapidly.

Leaf area was removed from replicates of three selection lines (high glucosinolates, control, and low glucosinolates) at three damage levels (0%, 20%, and 60% damage). An external cost of defense would result in a statistically significant selection line by damage treatment interaction, with those selected for high defense expressing less tolerance than those selected for low defense.

Further, selection line also had a significant overall effect on estimated total fitness, with low-defense selection lines having higher fitness compared to both control and high-defense selection lines. More importantly, a cost of defense in terms of tolerance was demonstrated by a significant selection line-by-damage treatment interaction. This interaction was in the direction to demonstrate a genetic tradeoff between defense and tolerance, with low-defense selection lines decreasing estimated total fitness in response to damage less than both control and high-defense selection lines. Variation in tolerance among selection lines was due to the greater ability of low-defense lines to maintain fruit and seed production despite the presence of damage.

One possible explanation for this puzzle is that conditions in hybrid populations may favor selfing, even in otherwise outcrossing species. For example, in self-incompatible plants, mixtures of self and interspecific pollen often induce selfing. Here, we examine patterns of mating in three hybrid zones and four 'pure' populations of Helianthus annuus and H. petiolaris, wild, self-incompatible sunflower species that are thought to have patented three homoploid hybrid species. Fourteen to 16 maternal families from each pure population and 44-46 maternal families from each hybrid zone were analyzed for seven polymorphic isozyme loci. Maximum-likelihood (ML) methods were used to estimate multilocus outcrossing rates (T(m)) and hybridization frequencies for each maternal family, each phenotypic group within each hybrid zone (annuus-like, hybrid, and petiolaris-like), and each population. As predicted for self-incompatible species, all four parental populations have outcrossing rate ML estimates of 1.0. Within the hybrid zones, outcrossing rates were lowest in the H. annuus-like fraction of the population (0.73, 0.72, and 0.74 in the three hybrid zones, respectively), largely intermediate in the H. petiolaris-like group (0.94, 0.90, and 0.94), and highest in the hybrid group (0.97, 0.93, and 0.97). Although outcrossing rates are lower in hybrid zones than in pure populations, it is unlikely that the observed decrease facilitates hybrid speciation because outcrossing rates in the critical hybrid fraction of the population do not differ significantly from 1.0. Dividing the outcrossed pollen pool into intraspecific and interspecific components revealed that maternal plants are largely fertilized by conspecific pollen, confirming an important role for pollen competition as a reproductive barrier. Highly sterile hybrid plants do not appear to discriminate between parental species pollen, but hybrids with higher fertility tend to be fertilized by pollen from the parental group they resemble genetically.

Parthenogenetic lineages from M were assumed to be relatively young due to recurrent origins from the coexisting sexuals, whereas those from P were assumed to be older on biogeographical grounds. As predicted, we found drastically reduced sperm production in parthenogens compared to sexuals, even in the parthenogenetic lineages from M, which may be younger. M parthenogens did not have more testes, but produced more sperm than individuals from the purely parthenogenetic population (P). However, the latter result could not be reproduced with laboratory-raised animals and therefore may be a consequence of different ecological conditions in the different lakes, for example, differences in mating rates. To study the behavioral component of male allocation, copulation frequencies were recorded for sexuals from M and for parthenogens from P.

Significant deviations from random mating occurred in 31 out of 48 tests, in agreement with the propensity values of the tested genotypes.

We used molecular sex and paternity identification to overcome these problems and estimated sex-specific heritabilities and the genetic correlation in body size between the two sexes in the collared flycatcher, Ficedula albicollis. After exclusion of the illegitimate offspring, the genetic correlation in body size between the sexes was 1.00 (SE = 0.22), implying a severe constraint on the evolution of SSD in this species. Furthermore, sex-specific heritability estimates were very similar, indicating that neither sex will be able to evolve faster than the other.

Many clonal invertebrates use polymorphic genetic recognition systems to discriminate kin from unrelated individuals during behavioral interactions that mediate competition for space. Space competition may have been a selective force promoting the evolution of highly polymorphic recognition systems, or preexisting polymorphic loci may have been coopted for the purpose of mediating space competition. Ascidian species in the family Botryllidae have an allorecognition system in which fusion or rejection between neighboring colonies is controlled by allele-sharing at a single, highly polymorphic locus. The behavioral sequence involved in allorecognition varies in a species-specific fashion with some species requiring extensive intercolony tissue integration prior to the allorecognition response, while other species contact opposing colonies at only a few points on the outer surface before resolving space conflicts. Due to an apparent species-specific continuum of behavioral variation in the degree of intercolony tissue integration required for allorecognition, this system lends itself to a phylogenetic analysis of the evolution of an allorecognition system. We constructed a molecular phylogeny of the botryllids based on 18S rDNA sequence and mapped allorecognition behavioral variation onto the phylogeny. Our phylogeny shows the basal allorecognition condition for the group is the most internal form of the recognition reaction. More derived species show progressively more external allorecognition responses, and in some cases loss of some features of internal function.

These differences are most pronounced in small populations in which low mate availability may reduce seed set in some types of sporophytic self-incompatibility. In cases where the pollination system causes a restriction in the number of pollen genotypes available to an individual plant, the fecundity of that plant depends on the availability of compatible pollen, which is determined by its genotype at the incompatibility locus. This leads to an additional component of selection acting on self-incompatibility systems, which we term 'fecundity selection.' Fecundity selection increases the number of alleles maintained in finite populations and increases mate availability in small populations. The strength of fecundity selection is dependent on the type of self-incompatibility. In some cases, fecundity selection markedly alters the equilibrium dynamics of self-incompatibility alleles.

In some cases clonal propagation results in a modest increase in population density, while in other cases dense populations may be generated by the propagation of only a few clones. We analyzed the population structure of the clonal gorgonian Plexaura kuna across several reef habitats with a range of disturbance regimes in the San Bias Islands, Panama, and the Florida Keys, U.S.A. Using multilocus DNA fingerprinting to distinguish clones, we estimated that clones ranged in size from single individuals to 500 colonies. The number of genotypes identified on nine reefs ranged from three to 25. Population density and clonal structure varied markedly among reefs with G(O):G(E) ranging from 0.03 to 1.00. On some reefs vegetative reproduction transformed P. kuna from a rare species to the numerically most abundant gorgonian. The effect of clonal propagation on P. kuna population structure was dependent on interactions between fragmentation and the reef environment (disturbance regime, substratum). We present a generalized model relating population structure of clonal species to disturbance and the mode of vegetative propagation. Disturbance promotes colony propagation and skews the size-frequency distribution of clones among P. kuna and many species that propagate via fragmentation. Propagation of these species is promoted by disturbance (disturbance sensitive), and they tend to have clones that are dispersed across local sites. Species that fragment and have dispersed clones, have high genotypic diversity in habitats with low levels of disturbance. Genotypic diversity then decreases at intermediate disturbance and increases again at the highest disturbance levels. Clonal species that do not rely on disturbance for vegetative propagation (disturbance insensitive) generally do not disperse and form aggregated clones. Among these taxa disturbance has a greater affect on individual survival than on propagation.

The concordance is hypothesized to reflect similarity in the processes governing species boundaries and intraspecific lineage boundaries. This concordance has not, however, been widely tested. In the case of the Point Conception biogeographic boundary between the Oregonian and Californian marine biotas, only the supralittoral copepod Tigriopus californicus has been found to have a coincident phylogeographic break. Here I show that the apparent relationship between this break and Point Conception was, in fact, an artifact of insufficient geographic sampling. Mitochondrial DNA analyses of T. californicus populations between Morro Bay and San Diego reveal at least five equally deep phylogeographic breaks in the region (where only one biogeographic boundary is recognized). Limited nuclear DNA sequence data and allozyme data also support the occurrence of multiple genetic discontinuities along this geographic range. Lack of one-to-one correspondence between intraspecific phylogeography and biogeographic boundaries indicates that the processes affecting the genetic differentiation of populations of T. californicus differ from those responsible for determining species distributional limits at the Point Conception biogeographic boundary. A review of genetic data from other species also fails to provide evidence for concordance of biogeography and intraspecific phylogeography across Point Conception. I suggest that the concordance of phylogeography with biogeography will only be pronounced where the biogeographic boundary separates biotas that are phylogenetically related.

We demonstrate how maximum-likelihood estimates of the branching pattern of divergence of multiple populations may be obtained. We also describe how the method may be applied to test hypotheses such as whether populations have maintained equal population sizes. We illustrate the method by applying it to two previously published sets of human restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) data.,45,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,F(ST) | Maximum likelihood | Phylogeny | Population divergence | Population history | Population size | Population subdivision,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,123,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

This sort of change must occur in both the evolution of canalization, in which a character becomes increasingly buffered against genetic or developmental variation, and in the phenomenon of closely related species that show similar adult phenotypes but different underlying developmental patterns. To study such phenomena, I develop a model that follows evolution on a surface representing adult phenotype as a function of underlying developmental characters. A contour on such a 'phenotype landscape' is a set of states of developmental characters that produce the same adult phenotype. Epistasis induces curvature of this surface, and degree of canalization is represented by the slope along a contour. I first discuss the geometric properties of phenotype landscapes, relating epistasis to canalization. I then impose a fitness function on the phenotype and model evolution of developmental characters as a function of the fitness function and the local geometry of the surface. This model shows how canalization evolves as a population approaches an optimum phenotype. It further shows that under some circumstances, 'decanalization' can occur, in which the expression of adult phenotype becomes increasingly sensitive to developmental variation. This process can cause very similar populations to diverge from one another developmentally even when their adult phenotypes experience identical selection regimes.",143,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Canalization | Epistasis | Evolution of development | Phenotype landscape | Quantitative genetics,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,124,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Although color variants can often be diverse within populations, frequencies of different morphs may be similar across populations, either as a result of balancing selection or gene flow. Under these circumstances selection can be extremely difficult to demonstrate. Here we test for balancing selection on the naturally occurring color forms of the Hawaiian happy-face spider, Theridion grallator with two approaches. First, allozyme loci are used to generate a null model against which to test selection. Frequencies of alleles involved in the color polymorphism of T. grallator are used to generate another estimate for comparison. The results suggest that statistically similar frequencies of color morphs among populations of T. grallator may be maintained by some form of balancing selection. Second, we make use of an unusual event in which the normally stable frequencies of unpatterned and patterned morphs within a population were found to have shifted toward an excess of unpatterned morphs. We scored offspring of all fertilized, unpatterned (bottom-recessive) females found during this period of skewed morph frequencies and also in a year when morph frequencies were normal to deduce paternal color phenotypes. Mating was found to be random in the normal year, but in the perturbed year females had mated with rare (patterned) males twice as frequently as expected on the basis of the frequency of this morph type in the population. Both of these results are consistent with selection operating on the color polymorphism, and we speculate that apostatic selection, perhaps mediated by bird predators, may provide the mechanism.",66,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Frequency-dependent selection | Happy-face spider | Population structure,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,125,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Their distributions overlap in central California to the north of a major faunal boundary at Point Conception, California (PC). To test the hypothesis that modern sympatry is due to a recent northward range expansion by N. emarginata, I analyzed the population structures of both species with nuclear (allozyme) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) markers. Populations of N. emarginata in the region of overlap exhibit significantly lower heterozygosity and allelic diversity than either populations to the south of PC or populations of N. ostrina. A single mtDNA haplotype characterizes all but one population of N. emarginata sampled in this region, but no haplotype to the south of PC is found at more than one locality. MtDNA haplotypes and allozyme allele frequencies also indicate monophyly of central California populations of N. emarginata. Sharp differences in allelic diversity over small geographic distances may reflect the action of natural selection, but because both nuclear and mtDNA markers display concordant patterns, a range expansion across PC best explains patterns of genetic variation in N. emarginata. Allozymes and mtDNA also reveal that the geologically older N. ostrina is paraphyletic with respect to N. emarginata. This pattern is consistent with, but not indicative of, a peripheral isolation model of speciation. Low genetic diversity is also expected if a significant bottleneck occurred at speciation. However, low allelic diversity is not universal throughout the geographic range of N. emarginata; high allelic diversity at the southern end of the distribution of N. emarginata suggests that in the past N. emarginata has been geographically restricted much further south than PC. A northward range expansion across PC by N. emarginata may thus represent only the most recent postglacial movement by the species. The thermal and oceanographic discontinuities found at PC may not have been directly involved in geographic isolation if N. emarginata originated much further south of this modern boundary. Despite uncertainty regarding the exact spatial distribution of populations at speciation, genetic data indicate that even though N. ostrina and N. emarginata currently exhibit a broad range of geographic overlap, speciation was likely allopatric and was initiated by physical isolation of populations in different zoogeographic provinces.",117,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12S | Allozymes | COI | Dispersal | Geographic isolation | Phylogeography | Pleistocene | Point Conception | Range expansion | Vicariance | Zoogeographic boundary,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,127,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

These two zones have very different histories and dynamics of interaction between the two taxa. Orchelimum nigripes and O. pulchellum (Tettigoniidae: Conocephalinae) are distributed west and east, respectively, of the Appalachian Mountains, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast and along the Atlantic Coastal Plain from New York to the Florida Keys, but are not found in the Appalachians themselves. In addition, during this century O. nigripes has become established in a small area east of the Appalachians, in the Potomac River basin, where it has completely replaced O. pulchellum along the river corridor above Washington, DC. I sampled katydids from 40 sites across both hybrid zones and mapped geographic patterns of genetic variation (allele frequencies at two diagnostic loci) and variation in a morphometric index for males. Although the two taxa are quite distinct over most of their extensive distributions, there is clear evidence of introgression in both contact zones. In the Deep South, samples from a transect along the Gulf Coast define a broad hybrid zone of about 50-100 km, while samples from a transect 200 km to the north define a zone of about 150-250 km in width. Only one Deep South population shows a deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at either locus, and there is no evidence of linkage disequilibrium in any Deep South population. In the Potomac region, there is a narrow upstream-downstream hybrid zone along the riven within the Potomac River floodplains downriver from Washington, DC, as well as outside the floodplains throughout the region, O. pulchellum is present in abundance, but O. nigripes markers are virtually absent. Within the floodplains upriver from Washington, DC, O. nigripes is abundant, but O. pulchellum markers are virtually absent.

The position of the Deep South hybrid zone is generally consistent with interspecific and intraspecific phylogeographic patterns previously reported for numerous taxa from the southeastern United States. The observed genetic and morphometric clines appear to be the result of neutral introgression over thousands of years.

Here we use molecular tools to test the morphology-based hypothesis that the moths pollinating two yuccas, Yucca baccata and Y. schidigera, are distinct species. Host specificity was assessed in a zone of sympatry where the hosts are known to hybridize. Because the moths are the only pollinators, the plant hybrids are evidence that the moths occasionally perform heterospecific pollination. Nucleotide variation was assessed in a portion of the mitochondrial gene COI, and m an intron within a nuclear lysozyme gene. Moths pollinating Y. baccata and Y. schidigera were referred to be genetically isolated because there was no overlap in alleles at either locus, and all but one of the moths was found on their native host in the hybrid zone. Moreover, genetic structure was very weak across the range of each moth species. estimates of F(ST) for the lysozyme intron were 0.043 (SE = Â± 0.004) and 0.021 (SE = Â± 0.006) for the baccata and schidigera pollinators, respectively; estimated F(ST) for COI in the baccata moths was 0.228 (Â± 0.012), whereas schidigera pollinators were fixed for a single allele.

In the barn owl, Tyro alba, both females and males display sex-limited plumage traits Males are commonly lighter colored and females spottier. In an experiment with combined cross-fostering and brood size manipulation we determined the relative contribution of genes, environment, and body condition to the variation in plumage coloration and plumage spottiness.

Siblings raised in different nests converged toward similar trait values, offspring resembled the true but not the foster parents, and plumage traits of unrelated nestlings sharing the same nest were not correlated. Results were not inflated by maternal effects detectable in the mother's phenotype, because middaughter to mother resemblance was not higher than midson to father resemblance.

We addressed this problem of relative fitness in sexual selection by developing two adjustments of the predictor variables in the multivariate analyses by including group means in addition to absolute values and by using relative values, deviations from group means In the lesser wax moth, Achroia grisella (Lepidoptera' Pyralidae), aggregated males produce ultrasonic signals attractive to females in the vicinity of honey bee colonies Playback experiments showed that females prefer signals whose pulses are louder, longer, delivered at a faster rate, and include lengthy silent gaps within pulse pairs (long asynchrony intervals). To measure sexual selection on ultrasonic signals, attractiveness was assessed by observing the number of females orienting toward given males in four-choice trials. The various signal characters of the males were computed from ultrasound recordings. Multivariate regression and nonparametric analyses revealed that peak amplitude, asynchrony interval, and pulse rate were the direct targets of selection. Nonlinear stabilizing and correlational selection were also detected. Comparisons of results from multivariate analyses based on absolute values and on the two relative adjustments indicated that the quality of a four-male group did not affect the strength or direction of linear selection but changed the strength of nonlinear selection. Both relative adjustments improved the prediction of male attractiveness. Three-dimensional surface plots generated by the nonparametric regression analyses showed that attractiveness increased monotonically with any combination of the signal characters.

Two aspects of marine organisms further complicate this situation: (1) many species possess planktonic larvae capable of great dispersal; and (2) obvious barriers to movement between populations are rare. Past studies of speciation in the sea have focussed on identifying the effects of past land barriers and on biogeographical breakpoints. However, assessing the role such undeniable barriers actually play in the initial divergence leading to reproductive isolation requires phylogenetic studies of recent radiations living in varying degrees of sympatry and allopatry to see which barriers (if any) tend to separate sister species. Here I refer phylogenetic relationship between 23 species of the marine snail Tegula using DNA sequences from two regions of the mitochondrial genome: cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and the small ribosomal subunit (12S). These snails possess planktonic larvae with moderate dispersal capabilities and have speciated rapidly, with over 40 extant species arising since the genus first appeared in the mid-Miocene (about 15 M.Y.B.P.). Trees constructed from the COI and 12S regions (which yielded 205 and 137 phylogenetically informative sites, respectively)were robust with respect to tree-braiding method, bootstrapping, and the relative weightings of transitions, transversions, and gaps. Within clades where all extant species have been sampled, five of six identified sister species pairs broadly coexist on the same side of biogeographical boundaries. These data suggest strong geographical barriers to gene flow may not always be required for speciation m the sea; transient allopatry or even ecological barriers may suffice.

The degree of flower asymmetry was higher in small, isolated, and marginal populations of the species range. These marginal populations also were the most homozygous. In the core area of the species' range, flowers were more symmetrical. The level of asymmetry was correlated with both population size and heterozygosity. However, a partial correlation analysis revealed that when the impact of population size was controlled for, there was a negative relationship between fluctuating asymmetry and heterozygosity, whereas when controlling for heterozygosity, no relationship between population size and fluctuating asymmetry was found. This indicates that genetic consequences of small population size probably underlie the relationship between the level of asymmetry and population size. Results from a transplantation experiment showed that individuals subjected to a higher environmental stress had an increased level of asymmetry compared to control plants. In the common-garden conditions the level of fluctuating asymmetry did not differ between the central and marginal populations.

Of the three cytonuclear variables examined, the allele frequency clines are the most informative in differentiating among the various migration patterns. The cytonuclear disequilibria and the frequency of the pure parental types tend to be useful only in revealing directional asymmetries in migration. The extent of hybrid zone subdivision has quantitative but not qualitative effects on the distribution of cytonuclear variables, in that the allele frequency clines become more gradual, the cytonuclear disequilibria decrease in magnitude, and the frequencies of pure parentals decline with increasing subpopulation number. Also, the only major difference between the X-linked and haplodiploid frameworks is that a higher frequency of pure parentals is found when considering haplodiploids, in which male production does not require mating. The final important theoretical result is that censusing after migration yields greater disequilibria and parental frequencies than censusing after mating. We analyzed cytonuclear data from two transects from a naturally occurring hybrid zone between two haplodiploid fire ant species, Solenopsis invicta and S. richteri, using our stepping-stone framework.

This study investigated phenotypic plasticity in growth, development, body size, and diapause m the yellow dung fly, Scathophaga stercoraria. Full-sib families were allowed to develop under predator-free field conditions. The time before the onset of winter was vaned and each brood was split into three environments differing in the amount of dung a set number of larvae had as a resource. When resources were abundant and competition was minimal, individuals of both sexes grew to larger body sizes, took longer time to mature, and were able to increase their growth rates to attain large body sizes despite shorter effective development periods later m the season. In contrast, limited larval resources and strong competition constrained individuals to mature earlier at a smaller adult size, and growth rates could not be increased but were at least maintained. This outcome is predicted by only two life-history optimality models, which treat mortality due to long development periods and mortality due to fast growth as independent Elevated preadult mortality indicated physiological costs of fast growth independent of predation. When larval resources were limited, mortality increased with heritable variation in development time for males, and toward the end of the season mortality increased as larval resources became more abundant because this reduced longer development periods. Sexual and fecundity selection favoring large body size in this species is thus opposed by larval viability selection favoring slower growth in general and shorter development periods when time and resources are limited, this overall combination of selective pressures is presumably shaping the reaction norms obtained here. Flexible growth rates are facilitated by low genetic correlations between development time and body size, a possible consequence of selection for plasticity.

We demonstrate this approach with a study of asymmetry in the wings of tsetse files (Glossina palpalis gambiensis). The analysis revealed significant fluctuating and directional asymmetry for shape as well as ample shape variation among individuals and between the offspring of young and old females.

The variation between strains within species was significant among sexual traits, and only external traits were less asymmetric than internal ones, which suggests that sexual traits are not strongly constrained within species. Three main findings show that sexual traits are most divergent between species: (1) testis length and area, and the area of the posterior lobe of the genital arch (sexual traits) showed the highest proportion of variation between species; (2) linear discriminant functions with the highest components associated to sexual traits were better predictors of species membership; and (3) testis length and area revealed a departure from a linear relationship between members of the species group. Examination of interspecific hybrids showed that sexual traits had higher asymmetry in species hybrids than in the parental species and that sexual traits showed additivity or dominance whereas nonsexual traits showed overdominance (with the exception of malpighian tubules length). These results suggest that sexual traits have undergone more genetic changes and, as a result, tend to show higher divergence and stronger hybrid breakdown between species than nonsexual traits.

In wing-dimorphic species one morph is winged, has functional flight muscles (LW), and is flight-capable, whereas the other has reduced wings (SW) and cannot fly. The evolution and maintenance of wing dimorphisms is believed to be due to trade-offs between flight capability and fitness-related traits. Although there are well-established phenotypic trade-offs associated with wing dimorphism in female insects, there only exist two studies that have established a genetic basis to these trade-offs. The present study provides the first evidence for a genetically based trade-off in male insects, specifically in the sand cricket Gryllus firmus. Because they have to expend energy to maintain the flight apparatus (especially flight muscles), LW males are predicted to call less and therefore to attract fewer females. To be of evolutionary significance, call duration, wing morph, and wing muscle condition (size and functionality) should all have measurable heritabilities and all be genetically correlated. Differences between morphs in male G. firmus in the likelihood of attracting a female were tested in the laboratory using a T-maze where females chose between a LW male and a SW male. Call duration for each male was recorded on the sixth day of adult life. A significant difference in call duration was found between SW and LW males (SW = 0.86 Â± 0.01, LW = 0.64 Â± 0.01 h). SW males attracted significantly more females than did LW males (63% vs. to 37%).

However, when sperm must disperse before encountering eggs, differences arise among species such that those with the smaller eggs and faster but shorter-lived sperm achieve relatively fewer fertilizations than do species with larger eggs and slower but longer-lived sperm. A field hybridization experiment, field estimates of sperm dispersal, correlations of egg size to field rates of fertilization, laboratory studies of fertilization kinetics, and a simulation model all suggest that it is attributes of the egg (probably egg size) that are responsible for the differences. These patterns of fertilization match the species' patterns of dispersion; species that do well only when sperm and eggs are released in close proximity are more aggregated, species that do relatively well when sperm and eggs are released farther apart are more dispersed. These results are consistent with the notion that eggs of different species are adapted to maximize reproductive success under different degrees of sperm limitation and suggest that male competition and female choice may not be an appropriate dichotomy in broadcast-spawning organisms.",77,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Bateman's principle | Echinoid | Egg size | Fertilization success | Sexual selection | Sperm limitation,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,172,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

From a structural perspective, the most divergent female gametophytes among all seed plants are found in Gnetum, a clade within Gnetales. Coenocytic organization at sexual maturity, absence of defined egg cells (free nuclei are fertilized), lack of centripetal cellularization, and postfertilization development of embryo-nourishing tissues are features of the female gametophytes of Gnetum unparalleled among seed plants. Although the female gametophyte of Gnetum retains the three basic phases of somatic development common to female gametophytes of plesiomorphic seed plants (free nuclear development, cellularization, cellular growth), the timing of fertilization has been accelerated relative to the rate of somatic development. As a consequence, the female gametophyte of Gnetum matures sexually (is fertilized) at a juvenile (compared with the ancestral somatic ontogeny) and free nuclear stage of somatic development, thereby precluding differentiation of egg cells. Unlike progenetic animals, where truncation of somatic ontogeny evolves in tandem with acceleration in the timing of sexual maturation, the female gametophyte of Gnetum completes the entire ancestral somatic ontogeny after precocious sexual maturation. This results in the evolution of postfertilization development of embryo-nourishing female gametophyte tissues, a phenomenon unique among seed plants. Nonheterochronic developmental innovations have also played important roles in the evolution of the female gametophyte of Gnetum. Centripetal cellularization, which is always associated with the phase change from coenocytic to cellular organization among plesiomorphic seed plant female gametophytes, is lacking in Gnetum. Instead, during early phases of development, apomorphic free nuclear organization is coupled with a highly anomalous pattern of cellularization. Stage-specific innovations during early development in the female gametophyte of Gnetum do not affect plesiomorphic aspects of later phases of development.

Maternal inheritance can alter the direction, rate, and duration of adaptive evolution from standard Mendelian models and its impact on adaptive evolution is virtually unexplored in natural populations. In a hierarchical quantitative genetic analysis to determine the magnitude and structure of maternal inheritance in the winter annual plant, Collinsia verna, I consider three potential models of inheritance. These range from a standard Mendelian model estimating only direct (i.e., Mendelian) additive and environmental variance components to a maternal inheritance model estimating six additive and environmental variance components: direct additive (Ï(A(o)/2)) and environmental (Ï(E(o)/2)) variances; maternal additive (Ï(A(m)/2)) and environmental (Ï(E(m)/2)) variances; and the direct-maternal additive (Ï(A(p)A(m))) and environmental (Ï(E(o)E(m))) covariances. The structure of maternal inheritance differs among the 10 traits considered at four stages m the life cycle. Early in the life cycle, seed weight and embryo weight display substantial Ï(A(m)/2), a negative Ï(A(o)A(m)), and a positive Ï(E(o)E(m)). Subsequently, cotyledon diameter displays Ï(A(o)/2) and Ï(A(m)/2) of roughly the same magnitude and negative Ï(A(o)A(m)).

We then compared these results to the results of a computer model that was designed to examine clone frequency dynamics for various levels of parasite virulence. Consistent with these simulations and with ideas regarding dynamic coevolution, parasites responded to common clones in a time-lagged fashion. Finally, in a laboratory experiment, we found that clones that had been rare during the previous five years were significantly less infectible by Microphallus when compared to the common clones.

Because structural body size traits have previously been found to be significantly heritable and positively genetically correlated, an increase in mean structural body size of individuals as a response to selection might have been expected. By contrast, we found that the mean adult head length and mean adult tarsus length decreased significantly in the largest colony by approximately 0.7 and 0.5 standard deviations, respectively, in both males and females during the 13-year study period. Environmental factors, such as the amount of rain in different years, were found to affect the availability of high-quality food for growing geese. As a consequence of this temporal variability in the availability of high-quality food, the mean adult structural body size of different cohorts differed by up to 1.3 standard deviations. Comparisons of mean body size of cohorts born in different colonies suggest that the most likely explanation for the body-size decline in the main study colony is that a density-dependent process, which mainly was in effect during the very early phase of colony growth, negatively affected juvenile growth and final size.

We found significant, species-level differences in all aspects of the calling song, and these differences persisted even after a generation of common-garden rearing in the laboratory, supporting the hypothesis that interspecific variation observed in the wild largely reflects genetic differentiation between the two taxa. A discriminant function analysis indicated that individual crickets could be assigned to the proper taxon with less than 10% error, supporting the premise that calling song could be used by female crickets as a mechanism for species recognition. One population, collected from within the hybrid zone and containing significant numbers of hybrid individuals, was intermediate in its calling song, presumably reflecting this population's mixed genetic makeup. In this hybrid zone population, song phenotype was highly correlated to a hybrid index score generated using species-specific alleles at four diagnostic allozyme markers, suggesting a multigenic basis to calling-song variation in these crickets as well as linkage disequilibrium between markers and song.

As gauged by the magnitudes of genetic divergence in cytochrome b sequences from mitochondrial DNA, as well as in allozymes, most speciation events in the Sebastes complex were far more ancient than those in the cichlids.

The haplotypes in some populations suggested mtDNA capture also occurred between species through introgression/hybridization. The strong mtDNA population differentiation in Abies is most likely due to the maternal inheritance of mitochondria and restricted seed dispersal. A phenetic tree based on the genetic similarity of the mtDNA suggests that some species are polyphyletic. Based on mtDNA variation, the five Abies species could be divided roughly into three groups: (1) A. firma and A. homolepis, (2) A. veitchii and A. sachalinensis, and (3) A. mariesii. However, we found that all these Abies species, except A. mariesii, are genetically very closely related according to an analysis of their cpDNA sequences. This showed that the chloroplast rbcL gene differed by only one base substitutions among the four species. We believe that the mtDNA variation and cpDNA similarity clearly reflect relationships among, and the dissemination processes affecting, these Abies species since the last glacial period.",72,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Abies | Conifer | mtDNA | Phylogeny | Polymorphism | rbcL,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,187,all,All Open Access,NA,NA
