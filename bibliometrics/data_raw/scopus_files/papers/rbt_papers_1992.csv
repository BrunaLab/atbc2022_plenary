It is a glycoprotein, Mr 14 kDa with a high content of Asp, Glu, and Leu residues and a low content of Cys and Trp. The protease is devoid of myotoxic, hemorrhagic, esterolytic and amidolytic activities. It lyses the alfa and beta chains of human fibrinogen and releases kinin from L.M.W. kininogen. No release of histamine was observed upon incubation with mast cells."

No significant changes in hemoglobin or hematocrit throughout the immunization period were observed, whereas a significant increment in total serum proteins occurred in the second half of the immunization process, probably due to an increased synthesis of immunoglobulins. There were no significant changes in creatine kinase, but a slight increment was detected in both transaminases, although they did not exceed normal limits. These findings suggest the absence of relevant tissue damage in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and liver. In agreement with these results, horses did not develop signs of systemic poisoning, presenting only minor alterations at the site of venom injection, such as oedema, abscesses and fistulas. The development of anti-phospholipase A2 antibody response showed a prominent individual variability, as previously described."
