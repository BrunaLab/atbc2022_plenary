Seeds sired (male success) and seeds produced (female success) were significantly correlated with flower number per plant. While the number of pollinaria removed, the usual estimator of male success in milkweeds, was highly correlated with numbers of seeds sired, it was even more highly correlated with numbers of seeds produced. Plants with many flowers did not behave primarily as males; individuals with the highest total reproductive success contributed equally as males and females. -from Authors",154,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,23,all,All Open Access

Hydration of eggs occurs when sap begins to rise in early spring. Since the ascent to sap occurs at different times in the 6 species of Enchenopa host plants, the phenology of egg hatch and adult maturation are allochronic. Shifts to novel host plants differing in phenology promote asynchrony of Enchenopa life histories among host-plant species.

The first community assay involved measuring the selected traits on the original coevolved communities that had been subjected to community selection. All of the selection treatments resulted in a significant response to selection in the original coevolved communities. None of the single-species populations exhibited a significant response to selection; thus the responses to community selection observed in the first community assay are expressed only in a community context. The second community assay again involved separating the coevolved communities into their constituent single-species populations; however, in this assay a competitor of the opposite species that had never been exposed to community selection was added to each population to form a ""reconstructed' community. For emigration rate in both T. castaneum and T. confusum, the genetic identity of the competing species did not affect the response to selection.

The author studied the social and sexual behavior of this species, and compared it with the Guianan cock-of-the-rock Rupicola rupicola, a dimorphic, lekking member of the same family. Male-male competition in capuchinbirds involved direct contests for dominance. In each year, one dominant individual was able to control the most desired display site on the 8-male lek, and was the only male that copulated. In contrast to dimorphic lek birds, female as well as male capuchinburds engaged in frequent and intense aggression at the lek, and both males and females engaged in sexual mimicry. The author suggests that plumage monomorphism in lek birds has evolved as a result of social competition affecting both sexes. This hypothesis accounts for the exaggerated plumage characters shared by males and females in capuchinbirds and a number of other monomorphic lek birds. The evolution of plumage can best be analyzed as an arms race, in which the balance of selective forces acting on each sex can produce a variety of equilibrium states, ranging from sexual indistinguishability to extreme dimorphism. -from Author",71,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,46,all,All Open Access

Tadpole philopatry may be advantageous: tadpoles restricted to their natal site had greater growth and survivorship than did their siblings restricted to randomly selected sites elsewhere within the same pond. Thus kin affiliative tendency may be a by-product of habitat selection. -from Author",67,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,NA,undefined,NA,0,FALSE,65,NA,NA

Analysis of the extent ot which compensatory mutations can counter Muller's ratchet is presented. If the intensity of stabilizing selection is too small or the mutation rate too high, the optimal genotype becomes extinct and the population mean drifts from the optimum but still reaches a stationary distribution. This distance is essentially the same as predicted for sexually reproducing populations under the same circumstances. Hence, at least in the short run, compensatory mutations for quantitative characters are as effective as recombination in halting the decline of mean fitness otherwise caused by Muller's ratchet. Compensatory mutations may not be able to prevent Muller's ratchet in the long run because there might be a limit to the capacity of the genome to provide compensatory mutations without eliminating deleterious mutations at least during occasional episodes of sex. -from Authors",60,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,74,all,All Open Access

Good nutritional condition is postulated to cause females to breed early and to have high fecundity. The most-preferred males are mated by early-breeding females and receive a sexual-selection advantage from those females' greater reproductive success. Conspicuous male traits that decrease survival can evolve but suggest that the extent of maladaptive evolution is greatly limited relative to what is possible in a polygynous mating system for 2 reasons. First, in the absence of direct fitness effects of mate choice on the female, the equilibria for the male trait and female preference form a curve whose shape shows that the maximum possible strength of sexual selection on males (and hence the potential for maladaptive evolution) is constrained. Under certain conditions, a segment of the equilibrium curve may become unstable, leading to 2 alternative stable states for the male trait.

Semionotids show considerable morphological diversity in body shape and in a modified row of scales (dorsal ridge scales). The author takes advantage of nearly annual stratigraphic resolution to determine whether dorsal-ridge-scale anomalies are concentrated stratigraphically in the early phase of lake formation and colonization by semionotids. Over 1700 specimens were collected from a single lake deposit (Cycle P4), representing 21 000 yr, in the Early Jurassic Towaco Formation of the Newark Basin. Dorsal-ridge-scale anomalies are significantly more frequent in older than in younger lake sediments, interpreted as being the result of relaxed selection during the early colonization of the lake. Some anomalies are atavisms, while others are unique or foreshadow future evolutionary events. -from Author",29,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,87,all,All Open Access

The largest single, consistent source of variation for all traits was family identity within populations. Environmental effects acted predominantly through family × environment interactions. There was little evidence for any intrinsic variation among populations once family heterogeneity had been accounted for. In general, fish raised in a saltwater pond grew faster than their broodmates raised in a freshwater pond. Both males and females tended to mature at a smaller size and later in the freshwater pond. The effects of environmental conditions differed among the 3 yr in which the authors performed these studies. In only one year was there a substantial difference between fish raised under the 2 environmental conditions. Results indicate that direct environmental effects are not strong enough to account for the differences in body size among natural populations and that intrinsic differences among natural populations are due to different frequency distributions of genotypes that are present in all populations. -from Authors",46,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,NA,undefined,NA,0,FALSE,88,NA,NA

In the SE USA P. ciliaris occurs in the Appalachian mountains and coastal-plain physiographic provinces, but is found rarely in the intervening Piedmont. In the mountains, Papilio troilus (spicebush swallowtail) was the most frequent and effective visitor, whereas in the coastal plain, P. palamedes (palamedes swallowtail) was the predominant pollinator. Proboscis lengths of P. troilus (mean 23.3 mm) were significantly shorter than those of P. palamedes (28.7 mm). Floral characters, most notably spur length, also differed significantly between mountain (mean 23.8 mm) and coastal-plain (25.6 mm) plants. In 1983 and 1984, levels of pollinator service, as assessed by rates of removal and insertion of pollinia, were higher in the mountains (0.81 and 0.86) than in the coastal plain (0.63 and 0.67), and fruit-set was significantly greater in mountain (83.9% in 1983, 86.5% in 1984) than in coastal-plain (63.8% in 1983, 65.5% in 1984) populations. Selection pressure exerted through pollinator proboscis lengths has apparently resulted in pollination ecotypes of P. ciliaris. -from Author",120,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,89,all,All Open Access

The purpose was to test the idea that females should be more prevalent in relatively poor sites where plant vigor is low, a hypothesis based on sex-ratio theory, coupled with the idea that fruit-set in the polleniferous morph (ie in ""males') is more dependent on vigor than it is in females. Within populations, females produced significantly more fruit than males. Plant vigor did not differ significantly between the sexes. Fruit-set on males was positively and significantly correlated with number of leaves per shoot within plants, among plants within populations, and among populations. No such correlations were found for females. The greater plasticity of the males altered the relative seed fitnesses of the 2 morphs among the populations, resulting in a negative correlation between female frequency and average plant vigor. In general, such plasticity may be an important factor in sex-ratio variation among populations and should be incorporated into models of sex-ratio evolution. -from Author",86,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,90,all,All Open Access

Using a family-level comparative analysis to control at least partially for taxonomic artifacts, none of a series of ecological variables (diet, nest type, development, nest dispersion, and migratory behavior) accounts for variation in olfactory-bulb size once the effects of body size and brain size (measured by cerebral-hemisphere length) have been controlled. Activity timing, however, accounts for significant variation even after the removal of these other variables. The authors discovered 13 independent cases in which nocturnal or crepuscular lineages have evolved a diurnal habit, or vice versa, and compared relative olfactory-bulb sizes between each branch pair. In all but one case, nocturnal or crepuscular birds have larger olfactory bulbs than their diurnal counterparts. -from Authors",86,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,91,all,All Open Access
