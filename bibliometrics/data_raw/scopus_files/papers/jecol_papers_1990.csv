The clustering approach used, the fuzzy c-means algorithm (or fuzzy ISODATA), requires a starting classification that is refined by a least-squares criterion. The starting strategy used in the example was based on the division of one ordination axis. Ordination axes were also used to reduce the high level of noise present in the ecological data. Fuzzy clustering was compared with the classification produced by TWINSPAN. The first division of TWINSPAN contrasted species of wet environments (Agrostis canina, Sphagnum recurvum, Polytrichum commune and Eriophorum angustifolium) with Pohlia nutans, a moss which grows on peaty or sandy banks and often under mature Calluna vulgaris. Fuzzy c-means show a strong clustering into 2 groups, although there were indications of a substructure at 3 or perhaps 5 groups. The 2 groups contrasted sites from wet habitats and those from drier habitats. When clustering into ≥3 groups, the clusters of drier habitats may be associated with the C. vulgaris development cycle. In comparison with TWINSPAN, fuzzy clustering produces clusters which are more strongly correlated with relevant external environmental variables. This may reflect the fact that ecological communities are more similar to fuzzy sets than to ordinary sets with sharp boundaries. -from Author",102,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,1

Species richness and diversity were highest at intermediate patch ages, but disturbed patches had an altered vegetation composition for at least 100 yr. Four causes of high bryophyte diversity in disturbed patches are proposed: 1) uprooting creates space for bryophyte colonization that is free from potential competitors; 2) disturbed patches have high habitat heterogeneity; 3) within-patch disturbance continues long after patch formation through erosion from the tip-up mound; and 4) the small patch size implies a short distance to potential sources of bryophyte diaspores which should increase the chance of establishment. Both early and late successional bryophytes establish shortly after an uprooting has occurred, ie no facilitation by early species is necessary before late successional species invade. -from Authors",148,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,2

Thuja cotyledons had higher net photosynthetic rates and lower specific leaf weights than Acer cotyledons. Thuja may thus rely more on immediate carbon fixation during establishment than Acer, which may rely more on stored metabolites at this stage of development. Thuja seedlings gained more carbon than Acer at lower PAR levels. More Thuja than Acer seedlings survived the first 6 wk of growth at the two lowest PAR levels, and were than able to survive an imposed drought for a mean of 5.5 days. Six-wk-old Acer seedlings showed low rates of net photosynthesis, biomass production and survival at low PAR and moisture levels, but a greater capacity to respond to favourable conditions. The low net photosynthetic rate of Acer under simulated cliff-edge conditions suggests that it is excluded from the cliff-edge because it is intolerant of hostile conditions that occur there. Unlike Thuja, Acer can benefit from the productive environment in the deciduous forest. Thuja productivity and survival under simulated cliff edge and deciduous conditions were similar.

The quantity of nutrients entering the soil increased from the pioneer to the forest community on recent sand, but outputs from these systems increased even more rapidly. This declining effectiveness of retention is attributed to mobilization of cations by increased quantities of bicarbonate anions beneath the larger biomass communities. On the fossil dune, nutrient outputs in percolating water were much lower despite large inputs and comparable water fluxes, attributed to soil changes induced by weathering, especially lower pH and the development of an anion exchange capacity.

BY 2200 BP all fen indicator species had disappeared and the site was dominated by assemblages similar to those in the present raised bog. The spring-fen mound, however, developed over a rise in the mineral substrate, which was not covered by peat until 3000 BP. The mound was quickly colonized by Sphagnum and no fen indicators appeared until 1160 BP. At this time the bog vegetation was replaced by a sedge fen containing assemblages similar to the present spring-fen channel. This sharp reversal from bog to fen under the spring-fen mound can best be explained by the discharge of alkaline groundwater at the peat surface in sufficient quantities to convert the bog vegetation to a spring-fen channel. -from Authors",184,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,19

The theory incorporates initial density to determine the time to reach a ""temporal self-thinning line' prescribed by density-dependent mortality and the relationship between individual plant growth and population mortality. The maximum rate of per-area increase in exclusive crown-area projection is equivalent to the maximum per-capital mortality rate. Self-thinning proceeds at a near-constant rate until plants approach maximum size, at which point the rate of thinning decreases. These results are used together with density-plant-weight relationships (-3/2 power law) and Michaelis-Menten uptake dynamics for light and below-ground resources to examine the influence of individual plant growth and population mortality on the timing of net primary production (NPP), the relationship between NPP and rate of individual plant weight gain, resource limitation, and below-ground resource pool size. NPP is maximized at intermediate stand ages, and this maximum occurs sooner than does the maximum in the rate of individual plant weight gain. Limitation by below-ground resources is most severe as NPP is maximized. This serves to reduce demand and thus the extent to which pool size is reduced through its reduction in growth, and hence in uptake. Increased resources decrease density, because increased growth increases thinning rates. Because of the low potential relative growth rate of large individuals, large old plants gain little advantage by increasing allocation to structures that increase resource uptake. Theory suggests that resource competition among large old-canopy individuals is minimal, because of increased nutrient availability, decreased demand and decreased sensitivity of growth rate to nutrient levels. -from Author",43,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,20

In latitudes south of 20°N, evergreen broad-leaved trees reach the forest limit determined by a temperature sum of 12-15°C.months, because the mean temperature of the coldest month exceeds -1°C even at the forest limit. However, north of 20°N, winter temperature at the forest limit falls below the mean of -1°C during the coldest month, and evergreen broad-leaved trees are therefore confined to lower altitudes. Temperate deciduous and boreal coniferous forests, which can tolerate winter coldness below -1°C, develop above the zone of evergreen broad-leaved forests by exploiting the summer temperature sum. Boreal forests also reach the limit determined by the temperature sum during summer, and tolerate severe winter cold. Accordingly, the pattern of altitudinal zonation in the high mountain of humid and S Asia differs N and S of 20°N, mainly due to the seasonality of temperature. The zonation north of 20°N is of the temperate type, with a sequence of tropical, nemoral zone drop out.

In order to withstand passage through the gut, seeds are apparently protected in a way that may delay their germination after defecation and alter the inherent dormancy, depending on the amount of wear the seeds go through while in the gut. Frugivory modifies the length of this dormancy so that the evenness of seedling emergence over time increases as more dispersers, each of which treats the seed in its gut differently, ingest the fruit. This may help to spread the risks encountered during germination, as an adaptation to a relatively mesic environment with an unpredictable rain pattern. Rhamnus palaestinus seeds are encased in a sheath with unique features. It fully protects the seeds during passage through the gut of a disperser, and is shed immediately after defecation. -from Authors",106,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,59

Aboveground shoot dynamics of a long-lived clonal sedge, Carex bigelowii, were investigated by comparing 3 populations along an altitudinal gradient for 5 yr. No correlations were found between shoot survival, shoot emergence or proportion of shoots flowering and the density or aggregation of shoots. All new shoots were vegetatively produced, emerging mainly in early or mid summer. At the most severe upper site, survival of the younger age classes was highest, but lower for the older age classes, resulting in the fastest turnover rates at the upper site. Responsive death (not including the death of flowering shoots) in winter and summer was about equally important at the upper and intermediate sites, whereas 82% of the shoots at the lower site died during winter. Flowering varied greatly between years, especially at the upper site, where 32% of shoots flowered in 1986, compared to between 1-6% in the other years. Shoots arising early in the season had a much greater probability of flowering early in their life. At all sites, flowering was followed by a corresponding decrease in shoot numbers, due to the programmed death of the flowering shoots. The mean size in one year of shoots which died in the following year was less than that for shoots remaining vegetative; those which flowered in the following year were larger than vegetative shoots. Floral initiation in a shoot is dependent on shoot size and a developmental period of some years. After flowering, the shoots die, population size decreases, then gradually increases until the next flowering event, such as in 1986. Population size thus changes in a cyclical way. The extent of flowering, therefore, directly controls the growth and performance of the plant by restricting the number of meristems available for production of photosynthetic tissue. -from Authors",48,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,60

Regression models relating yield invididual-1 of each species to the density of both species were fitted for 5 sequential harvests. In the first harvest the relative influence of ryegrass on clover was great, and it declined dramatically over time. The influence of clover on individual ryegrass yield was small in the first harvest, and negative in harvests 4 and 5, indicating an enhancement effect of clover density on ryegrass yield. Complementarity in resource capture in white clover ryegrass mixtures was examined using the relative resource total. Over 5 harvests this index rose from 1, indicating no benefit from mixing, to values >3, implying great benefit. It increased with increasing proportion of white clover in the mixture. The index consists of Lolium and Trifolium components, both of which increased over the last 3 harvests. An explanation of these results was hypothesized in terms of the use by Lolium within 2 months of planting of N fixed by Trifolium, in addition to a scarce supply of soil N. In the later harvests, Lolium performance per seed sown was enhanced in mixture by comparison with Lolium in pure stand at the same Lolium density. Despite this and the complementarity between species described above, total yield was, in general, greatest in pure-stand Trifolium. -Authors",23,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,63

The large amount of space indicated a site open to colonization.

Goslings fed on different swards of Puccinellia phryganodes for up to 150 min. Net above-ground primary production (NAPP) and forage quality of vegetation were measured. Grazing early in the season resulted in increased NAPP of swards of Puccinellia, as predicted by the herbivore-optimization model. Greatest enhancement of production compared to that in ungrazed swards occurred in plots which received a low to moderate period of grazing (30-90 min). When the period of grazing was 120 or 150 min, NAPP was reduced. The increase in NAPP above that of ungrazed swards was dependent upon the presence of goose faeces. In the absence of faeces NAPP did not increase, indicating the deleterious effects of clipping per se by the geese on the regrowth of swards. A moderate period of grazing resulted in the maintenance of the N content of shoots (forage quality) throughout the season compared to the corresponding amount in shoots of ungrazed plants. Input of N from faeces alone was insufficient to account for the net accumulation of N in above-ground vegetation of swards which regrew following grazing. The ability of swards to recover from the effects of grazing decreased over the course of the summer. The growth response thus depends upon rapid recycling of nutrients via faeces, intensity of grazing, and the phenology of plant growth. -from Authors",176,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,66

The concentration of an element in a plant species is best predicted by the concentration of the same element in the peat in only a few instances.

Thus K in Trichophorum and Succisa is positively correlated with peat Ca; Ulex Mg and K, and Cirsium Mg and Na, are negatively correlated with peat Ca. The pattern of uptake for every species and every element is different. This could be taken as evidence of niche differentiation between species in relation to nutrient uptake, and may be a factor in their stable coexistence. -from Authors",41,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,67

The acclimation temperature at which the maximum rate of photosynthesis was recorded does not show a strong correlation with latitudinal occurrence of the species: for Nothofagus cunninghamii, which occurs in SE Australia, the optimum temperature for net photosynthesis ranges from 17-22°C; for the Tasmanian endemic N. gunnii (winter-deciduous), and N. moorei which occurs in New South Wales it is 23°C; for Nothofagus species which are endemic to New Guinea it ranges from 20-24°C. Similarly, there is no overall difference between the Australian and New Guinean species of Nothofagus in the effect of acclimation temperature on the instantaneous temperature optima of net photosynthesis: plants acclimated to 8, 20 and 29°C showed optima at 18, 20 and 22-23°C, respectively. The major difference between the tropical and extra-tropical species lies in the tolerance of their photosynthetic processes to extreme temperatures; the tropical species maintain c80% of their maximum rate of net photosynthesis over a span of 8-11°C of acclimation temperature, whereas the extra-tropical species maintain it over a span of 14-17°C of acclimation temperature and in general show higher rates of net photosynthesis at both high and low temperatures than the tropical species. Results are consistent with the restriction of the tropical species to a mild climate with relatively little daily and seasonal temperature variation, and with the occurrence of the Australian species in climates which show greater variability on daily and seasonal (and often diurnal) scales and greater extremes of cold and heat. -from Author",39,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,68
