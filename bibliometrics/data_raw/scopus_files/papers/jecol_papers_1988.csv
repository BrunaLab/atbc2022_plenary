The endemic conifers Phyllocladus aspleniifolius and Athrotaxis selaginoides regenerate continuously in open vegetation, and occasionally in large canopy gaps created by natural tree death in closed forest, where competition with co-occurring species is low. However, both species, particularly P. aspleniifolius which is most frequent in scrub rainforests on poor soils in which canopy gaps are small and quickly occupied by species which reproduce vegetatively, commonly occur in a narrow range of size classes. This size structure is indicative of regeneration following a large scale disturbance and inability of the species to regenerate in the mature closed forest. Canopy composition and dynamics in Tasmanian temperate rainforest is, therefore, influenced by differences among species in the modes of reproduction, and in tolerance of the light environment under the canopy. Autogenic replacement of canopy species by those with greater shade-tolerance is infrequent because of the slow rate of replacement relative to the frequency of catastrophic disturbance. -from Authors",50,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA,NA

Leaf longevity was longer in B. erectus. The decrease in the rate of leaf emergence in winter was more pronounced for B. erectus.

The deviations were explicable as habitat differences. There was very little evidence for the existence of ""supertramps' (species tending to occur on small islands). Determinacy is considered, especially nesting, ie the extent to which the flora of a species-poor island is a subset of the flora of species-richer islands. Significant nesting existed among the native flora, especially for the woody species and especially inland, though it was far from complete. Nesting amongst the exotic species was lower, but still significant. The results are compatible with a plant community structure determined primarily by the response of individual species to habitat, similar to Gleason's model. The exotic guild is differently structured from the native guild, and has probably not yet reached equilibrium. Inland occurrences show more structure than shore ones, probably because of the greater variety in shore habitats between islands. Woody species consistently showed more structure than herbaceous ones.

Using this morphological feature of the palm, together with its high density (300-1230 mature individuals ha-1) in a 5 ha tract of rainforest at Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico, it was possible to apply a time scale to the study of gap formation and regeneration dynamics of tropical rainforests. Surviving palms record gap-forming events for up to 100 yr. The age structure of the forest mosaic was obtained at a scale of 25 m 2.

The Sphagnum communities had mainly developed from Phragmites- and Typha-dominated vegetation, rarely over Cladium-dominated vegetation. There was evidence for progressive base-depletion in parts of the fens remote from the river, but Sphagnum communities are not restricted to these places but are also developed in fen compartments with cation-rich water and adjacent to dykes and waterways with eutrophic water. Isolation from inundation by base-rich water is necessary for development of Sphagnum lawns. Where Sphagnum has invaded fen compartments with base-rich waters, flooding is avoided by vertical movement of the peat surface which also prevents desiccation of Sphagnum during prolonged dry periods. Vertical movements of the fen mat occurs both through floating rhizome rafts and, more commonly, by expansion and contraction of a loose peat matrix. Tree establishment may lead to a depression of the peat surface and elimination of Sphagnum. In some areas, however, Sphagnum species survive under mature Betula pubescens, forming a poor-fen community that may be a precursor of ombrotrophic conditions. -from Authors",49,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,64,NA,NA

When this last species was excluded and a shorter flowering season was used in the analyses, flowering was significantly aggregated in 3 of the 5 yr and significantly less than random in 2 yr. Observed overlaps were always much greater than those calculated from an even dispersion of flowering times. Flowering sequences of species were highly correlated among years so consistent interactions were possible. The lack of July flowering is perplexing, especially as this could decrease flowering overlap. The shrubs seemed likely to compete for pollination because most species overlapped in flowering, depended upon insect pollinators for seed set and shared bumblebees or small, solitary bees. If the species were divided into these 2 major pollination guilds, flowering remained either aggregated or random in different years and average overlap per species was high (0.5-0.9). Of the 6 congeneric species pairs, only 2 pairs had little overlap (<0.1), 3 had high overlap (0.5-0.9), and 1 was intermediate (0.1-0.2). Competition for pollination seemed likely and pollination limitation of fruit set was detected in 4 of the species; however, pollination limitation could be attributed to interspecific competition in only one species. The high overlap in flowering and pollinator use can be maintained because current competition for pollination is rare or mild. Although competition is generally assumed to select for divergence and specialization in resource use, avoidance of competition by these shrubs was achieved by 3 major characteristics: self-pollination, long-lived flowers and diverse pollinator assemblages. Divergence in time and specialization for pollinators increased, rather than decreased, the risk of pollination limitation. -from Author",83,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,76,NA,NA
