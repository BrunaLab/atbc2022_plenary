The erpobdellids laid cocoons which they deserted; the glossiphoniids brooded their eggs and carried their offspring. Reproductive effort was measured in terms of offspring production per parent. On this basis the annual erpobdellids invested more in reproduction than the biennial populations. After correcting for size differences, Helobdella stagnalis and G. heteroclita carried a larger number of offspring than G. complanata. Differences were less obvious when brood sizes were expressed as live weights. Using laboratory data, reproductive effort was also measured for erpobdellids in terms of the energy investment and the sacrifice of parent biomass to gametes. On those criteria, E. testacea invested more in reproduction than any E. octoculata. Brooding leeches ingested less food per unit time than non-brooding equivalents and this was most marked in short-lived species. Brooding leeches also suffered a larger proportional reduction in weight than non-brooding ones, again most marked in short-lived species. -from Authors",12,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Numerical analysis of the model indicates that colonies are characterized by stable equilibrium for all variables: biomass of old and young workers, production, foraging index, and the mortality of workers. The location of these equilibrium points does not depend on initial conditions. The most important stabilizing factor is the relation of the mortality of old workers to the foraging index. The allocation of production between workers and sexual forms delays the return of the variables to the equilibrium values. Heavy winter mortality is an important factor disturbing the equilibrium conditions of a colony. Since heavy winter mortality happens every few years, and it takes approx 10 yr to reach the equilibrium state, the colony is permanently beyond the equilibrium state. -from Authors",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,3,NA,NA

Increasing prey density caused a transition towards preference for smaller mussels. Diving times of the ducks were strongly affected by both prey density and diving depth. Three hypotheses were proposed to explain selection of sub-optimal mussels. 1) The constraints of diving could change the problem of size selection, as the ducks might do better in swallowing 2 smaller mussels in one dive instead of a larger mussel. 2) Ducks might prefer smaller mussels to avoid the risk of taking mussels that are too large to be swallowed. 3) As larger mussels have highly variable profitabilities, it might pay the ducks to select smaller mussels associated with less variance.-from Author",59,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,8,NA,NA

The mean depth at which seeds are stored, 2.0cm, is compatible with germination requirements, and many sites selected appear suitable for seed germination. One nutcracker stores about 32 000 whitebark pine seeds at subalpine elevations each year, which represent 3-5 times its energetic requirements. Although parent nutcrackers feed stored seeds to juveniles, in some years there is probably an excess of seeds stored by the population as a whole. Seeds retrieved from nutcracker caches are as viable as seeds extracted by hand from cones and seedlings originating in nutcracker caches have a good survival rate: 56% over the 1st year and 25% by the 4th year. Alternative disperal agents (rodents and cone disintegration) disperse fewer seeds, disperse seeds shorter distances from parent trees, place seeds in sites less suitable for germination, and/or make large seed caches with lower reproductive potential. Nutcrackers disseminate seeds throughout the subalpine habitat and are, in part, responsible for the 'pioneering' status of whitebark pine. The evolution of wingless seeds and indehiscent cones in the Cembra pine group was probably a consequence of seed dispersal by an ancestral nutcracker form.

Generally parasitoids were moving among host webs more frequently than expected, as a consequence of the continually changing state of the host patches.

Between-year variations in the food supply at each site were mainly a result of variations in the density of J. squarrosus inflorescences produced. There was a reduction in the mean number of florets per inflorescence, and also a reduction in the percentage of florets developing into seed capsules, with increasing altitude. Thus, the larval food supply was reduced at the higher sites. Highest densities of C. alticolella eggs and larvae, with respect to food supply, were recorded in the middle region of the transect. Survival between the egg stage and larval establishment inside the seed capsules is directly related to the proportion of florets developing into seed capsules. Mortality at this stage is almost entirely due to starvation of larvae inside unsuccessful florets. The percentage of C. alticolella larvae parasitized was reduced with increasing altitude. The main mortality factors acting on the population change systematically along the altitudinal gradient. The incidence of starvation of newly-hatched larvae increases, whilst parasitization decreases. The changing intensity of these 2 factors leaves a middle region where their combined effect is low. The most important factor determining the population fluctuations in the middle region of the transect is density-dependent overwinter mortality and reduction in natality as a result of the increased competition for food at the high larval densities. The population at low altitudes is not limited by the food supply and appears to be held at low density by natural enemies. The population at the highest sites is also at low density and is mainly affected by the harsh climate which limits seed capsule development by the food plant. Extinction of this population occurs in years when the rush fails to set seed. -from Author",65,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,14,NA,NA

Faunal diversity was similar for native and introduced trees for all guilds except the phytophages, which showed a lower diversity on introduced trees. On every native tree, the most abundant species was an hemipteran; on 4 of the five introduced trees other orders provided the most abundant species. Total species richness was correlated with tree abundance for both native and introduced trees in Britain. Arthropod abundance increased with species richness: as communities became richer in species, they became more tightly packed. Biomass and numbers of individual arthropods, classified by guild, was not clearly related to structural and other features of the individual trees sampled. There was a positive correlation between the biomass of chewing phytophages and a measure of defoliation. -Authors",135,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,21,NA,NA

This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that rate of prey digestion determines feeding time. The rate at which the contents were extracted from the body did not determine feeding time. Differences in the extraction efficiency of larvae feeding on different prey species are due to the presence in some prey of defensive secretions which the larvae do not ingest. Variation in extraction efficiency also results from incomplete consumption.

The applied value of ecology is indicated, and the cases of environmental monitoring (environmental impact assessment and seabird monitoring) are used to demonstrate how the ecologist sees problems and can make interpretations and predictions.-P.J.Jarvis",5,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,43,NA,NA

The switch in species of prey is largely a result of shifting from trapping mammals at one time of the year to hunting them at another. It is reinforced by the increased vulnerability of certain species during the period when new gardens are prepared; this period coincides with trapping. -from Author,14,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,44,NA,NA
