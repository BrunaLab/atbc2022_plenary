These include (1) maximize net rate of energy gain (during foraging), (2) minimize energy cost per unit distance, and (3) minimize rate of energy expenditure. These criteria and others have, however, received little justification. General models of animal travel, coupled with the basic hypothesis that travel speeds are such that fitness is maximized, indicate that animals should sometimes behave in accordance with one of the above criteria. These models also indicate that animals should occasionally travel at their maximum sustainable speeds. In general, however, animals would be expected to travel at speeds that satisfy more complicated optimality criteria that include all the various counteracting factors. Hence more information must be available before these predictions can be thoroughly tested. The simplest predictions from the present models arise in the case of travel during foraging. Here the optimal speed, assuming that food affects an animal's fitness by virtue only of its energy content, is the speed that results in the maximum net rate of energy gain. Furthermore, this speed is greater than both the speed for minimum rate of energy expenditure and the speed for minimum cost per unit distance. On the other hand, when travel involves activities other than foraging, the first, but not necessarily the second, of these last two predictions is valid. In the case of foraging, the optimal travel speed increases with increasing body size. This is not necessarily the case, however, for nonforaging activities.

Even over a 3.5 order of magnitude range in body volume,size alone only accounts for about 42% of the variation in rm. Data were presented which indicate that the residual variationis related to the relative size of the macronucleus and micronucleus Which is interpreted to reflect genome size. Ciliates which can multiply quickly for their size have relatively small micronuclei or genomest for their size and vice versa.It is suggested that nuclear dualism,like multicellularitiy is a means of attaining a degree of independence between body size and rm. These ideas are discussed with respect to ther r-K selection hypothesis and the ecological properties of species. We suggest that rm or size should not be used alone as indicators of a species position on the r-K continuum .The potential of these results as a basis for estimating growth rates of wild populations is noted.",30,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NSERC,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada
