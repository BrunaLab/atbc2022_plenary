Species differences in growth and shade tolerance might contribute to coexistence of tree species. To explore how such differences depend on underlying plant traits, 14 tree species were investigated in temperate forests on sand and loess soils in the Netherlands. Plant traits were measured for 0.5-1 m tall saplings: 10 saplings growing at low light conditions and 10 at high light conditions. Growth was determined from annual lengths of leader shoots, and shade tolerance from an independently tested scale. 2. Shade tolerance and extension growth of the leader shoot were negatively correlated. Plant traits that related positively with shade tolerance were negatively related to extension growth, and vice versa. Photosynthetic capacity, leaf dark respiration and total leaf mass related weakly to shade tolerance and extension growth. Specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area/leaf mass) and wood density were the traits most strongly correlated to shade tolerance and extension growth. 3. Shade-tolerant species had denser wood and slower extension growth. They also had larger crowns, suggesting that dense stems provide strength for supporting larger crowns. 4. More shade-tolerant species had a higher SLA, which is opposite to tree communities with larger leaf life span variation. In winter deciduous tree communities, more shade-tolerant species benefit from investing leaf area at low costs (high SLA) rather than from investing in durable leaves (low SLA). 5. Species on sand had higher growth rates and higher light requirements than species on loess. In line with the resource-ratio hypothesis, the dominance of the more shade-tolerant species on nutrient rich loess soils may be attributed to the denser vegetation supported and the resultant lower light availability for saplings compared with saplings on infertile and drought-prone sand soils. 6. Synthesis: These results provide plant trait-based predictions for the regeneration success and composition of species of temperate forests with management based on natural regeneration. These forests are expected to become dominated by shade-tolerant species with high wood density and high SLA on the more productive soils, and by light demanding species with low wood density and low SLA on poorer soils. © 2007 The Authors.",62,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Carbon balance | Extension growth | Natural forest development | Photosynthetic capacity | Shade tolerance | Soil | Specific leaf area | Temperate forests | Total leaf mass | Wood density,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,1,NA,NA

Patterns of tree mortality as influenced by species, diameter and stand age were assessed across a gradient in wind disturbance intensity in a southern boreal forest in Minnesota, USA. Few previous studies have addressed how wind impacts boreal forests where fire was historically the dominant type of disturbance. 2. We surveyed 29 334 trees of nine species within a 236 000 ha blowdown in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW), in forests that have never been logged and were not salvaged after the windstorm. Within the disturbed area, a range of disturbance severity from zero to complete canopy mortality was present, overlaying an existing mosaic of fire origin stands. For this study, we derived an index of wind disturbance intensity by standardizing the observed disturbance severity using common species with similar diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) distributions. We then used multiple logistic regression to assess patterns of tree mortality across gradients in tree size and wind intensity index, and for three stand ages. 3. Probability of mortality was higher with increasing ln d.b.h. for all nine species, with two species (Abies balsamea and Picea mariana) showing much more dramatic shifts in mortality with d.b.h. than the others. As hypothesized, the species most susceptible to windthrow at all d.b.h. classes were early successional and shade intolerant (Pinus banksiana, Pinus resinosa, Populus tremuloides) and those least susceptible were generally shade tolerant (e.g. Thuja occidentalis, Acer rubrum), although the intolerant species Betula papyrifera also had low mortality. 4. Mortality rates were higher in mature (c. 90 years old) stands than for old and very old (c. 126-200 years old) stands, probably because old stands had already gone through transition to a multi-aged stage of development. 5. Synthesis. Quantification of canopy mortality patterns generally supports disturbance-mediated accelerated succession following wind disturbance in the southern boreal forest. This wind-induced weeding of the forest favoured Thuja occidentalis, Betula papyrifera and Acer rubrum trees of all sizes, along with small Abies balsamea and Picea mariana trees. Overall, the net impact of wind disturbance must concurrently consider species mortality probability, abundance and diameter distributions. © 2007 The Authors.",141,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Boreal forest | Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW) | Forest dynamics | Mortality | Stand age | Susceptibility | Wind disturbance | Wind-throw,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,2,NA,NA

Plant functional types (PFTs) are groups of species sharing traits that govern their mechanisms of response to environmental perturbations such as recurring fires, inundation, grazing, biological invasions and global climate change. The key components of a PFT approach are an underlying model of vegetation dynamics for a given system and a classification of functional types based on traits deduced from key processes in the model. 2. Prediction and generalization underpin the potential utility of the PFT approach for understanding ecosystem behaviour. For PFTs to be useful in ecosystem management, they (in concert with their underlying model) must reliably predict vegetation change under given environmental scenarios and they must produce robust generalizations across the species that are classified and the range of environments in which they occur. 3. The efficacy of plant functional types has been explored using various approaches in a wide range of ecosystems. However, very few studies have tested the accuracy and generality of PFT predictions against vegetation changes observed empirically over medium to long time scales. 4. We applied this approach to examine the predictive accuracy and generality of a PFT classification and an associated model of vegetation dynamics for a fire-prone, species-rich wet heathland in south-eastern Australia. We assigned each species to one of six PFTs derived using a deductive approach based on the vital attributes scheme. We measured their initial abundance at a set of sample sites distributed across local environmental gradients. We used the PFT traits and processes in the underlying model to predict qualitative changes in abundance in response to a fire regime scenario observed at the sample sites during a subsequent period of 21 years. We then re-surveyed the sample sites to compare predictions with observed changes in abundance. 5. The PFTs and their underlying model produced an accurate prediction of average vegetation responses over the 21-year period. The majority of species within each PFT exhibited the predicted response and few species had strongly opposing responses in different environments. However, not all species within a PFT underwent the predicted direction of change, and responses of individual species were not uniform across the environmental gradients. 6. Synthesis. We conclude that plant functional types based on vital attributes are very useful tools for prediction and generalization in ecosystem management, although interpretations need to be tempered by the fact that PFTs may not accurately predict responses of all species across all environments. © 2007 The Authors.",74,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Competition | Fire regimes | Heathlands | Long-term monitoring | Plant life history | Plant traits | Predictive modelling | Seed banks vegetation dynamics | Vital attributes,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,3,NA,NA

Many Mediterranean plant species persist after fire because their seeds are protected from the heat of the fire (e.g. hard-coated seeds, serotinous cones), thus permitting rapid post-fire recruitment. For simplicity, this trait will hereafter be called P and its two possible phenotypes P+ (seeder) and P- (non-seeder). 2. Because P+ appears in a narrow taxonomic spectrum and confers persistence under high fire frequencies, we test the extent to which communities with different fire histories have different phenotypic and phylogenetic structures. Specifically, we compare coastal vegetation growing in a warm and dry Mediterranean climate subject to high fire frequency (HiFi vegetation) with montane vegetation subject to a subhumid climate where fires are rare (LowFi) under the hypothesis that P+ species will be over-represented in HiFi communities, thus producing phenotypic and phylogenetic clustering. 3. Trait conservatism on P is evaluated by testing the presence of a phylogenetic signal, phenotypic clustering is tested by correlating co-occurrence and phenotypic distance matrices, and the phylogenetic structure is evaluated by testing whether the phylogenetic distances between species in each community are different from those expected by chance. 4. The results suggest that: (a) P is a strongly conserved trait; (b) co-occurring species have similar P phenotypes (phenotypic clustering); and (c) the phylogenetic structure in HiFi vegetation is significantly clustered while LowFi vegetation tends to be overdispersed. 5. Synthesis: Fire is a strong driving force in assembling HiFi communities while other forces, such as competitive interactions, are the main assembly mechanisms in LowFi communities. This result supports the role of recurrent disturbances as filters driving phylogenetic community structure. © 2007 The Authors.",162,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Evolutionary filtering | Fire regime | Phylogenetic structure | Plant traits | Post-fire recruitment | Seeders,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,4,NA,NA

This paper draws together geographical variation and various correlates of individual seed dispersal success to evaluate spatial variation in major determinants of seed removal rates of the myrmecochore Helleborus foetidus, whose ant assemblages and diaspores vary geographically. 2. We censused seed removal by ants directly from individual plants in 12 populations and four regions across the Iberian Peninsula, and measured the elaiosomed seed, plant fecundity, and the biotic and abiotic environment in the close vicinity of each plant. The relative effect of these three groups of variables on seed removal was then modelled at each region using structural equation models and path analyses. 3. We found a pervasive effect of the close surroundings of each plant on dispersal. We also found a geographically variable influence of diaspore traits on dispersal. Such variable influence of the diaspore was closely related to the compositional and functional variation in ant guilds. 4. Synthesis: The appearance of an effect of diaspore and plant traits on dispersal depended on the surroundings of the plant, the identity of the ant visitors and ant abundance. This dependence itself might lead to different directions of selection among populations, a conclusion that has not emerged from seed offerings to ants, which is the usual protocol in myrmecochory research. © 2007 The Authors.",19,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Ant-plant mutualisms | Elaiosome-bearing seeds | Hellebore | Myrmecochory | Path analysis | Seed dispersal determinants | Seed dispersal macroecology | Structural equation models,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,5,NA,NA

It is generally assumed that the same factors drive the decomposition of both litter and roots and that nutrient release from litter and roots is synchronized. However, few studies have explicitly tested these assumptions, and no studies have examined whether plant genetics (i.e. plant susceptibility to herbivory) could affect these relationships. 2. Here we examine the effects of herbivore susceptibility and resistance on needle and fine root litter decomposition of piñon pine, Pinus edulis. The study population consists of individual trees that are either susceptible or resistant to herbivory by the piñon needle scale, Matsucoccus acalyptus, or the stem-boring moth, Dioryctria albovittella. Genetic analyses and long-term experimental removals and additions of these insects to individual trees have identified trees that are naturally resistant or susceptible to M. acalyptus and D. albovittella. In addition, these herbivores increase litter chemical quality and alter soil microclimate, both of which mediate decomposition in ecosystems. 3. The effects of herbivore susceptibility and resistance on needle litter mass and phosphorus (P) loss, when significant, are largely mediated by herbivore-induced changes to microclimate. But the effects of herbivore susceptibility and resistance on root litter nitrogen (N) and P retention, and needle litter N retention, are largely governed by herbivore-induced changes to litter chemical quality. Whether a particular tree was resistant or susceptible to herbivores exerted a large influence on net nutrient release, but the direction of herbivore influence varied temporally. 4. The controls on decomposition vary between herbivore-susceptible and herbivore-resistant phenotypes. This suggests that understanding decomposition and nutrient retention in some ecosystems may require considering the effects of herbivores on above- and below-ground processes and how these effects may be governed by plant genetics. 5. Synthesis. Because so few studies have attempted to quantify genetic components of ecosystem processes, the integration of ecosystem ecology with population genetics has the potential to place ecosystem science within a genetic and evolutionary framework. Using field trials of known genetic composition, ecosystem scientists may use quantitative genetics techniques to explore ecosystem traits just as population geneticists have used these techniques to explore traditional traits such as resistance to insects. © 2007 The Authors.",41,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Decomposition | Genotype | Herbivory | Insects | Needle | Nitrogen | Nutrient cycling | Phosphorus | Root | Semi-arid,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,6,NA,NA

Upland moorlands are an extensive semi-natural resource, frequently burned either through management or uncontrolled outbreaks of fire. These systems are often situated in areas receiving high levels of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition, yet the effects of burning combined with high N deposition on ecosystem N pools and N leaching to surface waters are unknown. 2. A management burn was applied to an upland Calluna vulgaris moor which contained a set of long-term experimental plots treated with simulated increased N deposition at rates of +0, +40, +80 and +120 kg ha-1 year -1. Leaching losses of total dissolved inorganic N (TDNin) and dissolved organic N (DON) from organic and mineral soil horizons and the N pools in these horizons, as well as in litter and vegetation, were compared before and after the burn. 3. The results showed that leaching of TDN in and DON from both soil horizons increased in a 6-month period after the burn, with leaching of TDNin remaining elevated 2-3 years later. N pools in the deeper mineral layer of the soil also increased after the burn. Increasing long-term N additions magnified the burn effect on leaching losses but lessened the burn effect on the N pools in the mineral layer. In the +40 N addition plots, the amount of N removed in burning vegetation was of an equivalent size to the amount of additional N retained within the system. 4. Synthesis: These results suggest that burning approximately every 10 years may be effective in removing N retained in the system at N deposition rates up to 56 kg N ha-1 year-1. However, extensive burning of moorland or uncontrolled outbreaks of fire over wide areas may considerably exacerbate the threat of N loading to groundwater in areas where moors are more heavily N polluted, increasing the potential for acidification, eutrophication and brown water colouration. The data suggest that this is because the mineral horizon of upland moors receiving high N inputs has already been saturated with N such that increased downward percolation rates of N caused by the burn have risen above a threshold for immobilization (hence leading to more substantial post-burn increases in leaching of N). © 2007 The Authors.",21,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,Fire | Moorland burning | Nitrogen content | Nitrogen deposition | Nitrogen leaching,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,7,NA,NA

Increasing functional diversity often leads to an increase in ecosystem productivity in the form of overyielding. While the mechanisms (i.e. complementarity or facilitation) that underlie overyielding provide strong insights into species coexistence and community assembly, they are rarely tested. In subalpine grasslands, traditional management through manuring and hay-making results in intermediate productivity that is associated with high functional diversity. This functional diversity results from the coexistence between conservative plant species (with slow growth rates, low specific leaf area) and exploitative species (with fast growth rates, high specific leaf area). 2. We hypothesized that overyielding occurs among these two functional groups and tested whether complementarity or facilitation can explain overyielding. Using three perennial grass species per functional group, we compared single and mixed functional group mesocosms at low and intermediate levels of fertilization to test the occurrence of overyielding. Additionally, we measured the outcomes of biotic interactions among these two functional groups by manipulating plant density. 3. After two growing seasons, we found evidence of overyielding under intermediate levels of fertility. Overyielding was associated with a reduction of competition intensity when both functional groups were grown together. These results suggest that complementarity, as evidenced by a decrease in competition intensity, rather than facilitation, explains the observed overyielding. Indeed, we found evidence for complementarity for light and modification of nutrient use as possible mechanisms for the overyielding. 4. Synthesis. Complementarity between functional groups might be an important mechanism enhancing functional diversity, particularly in harsh environments at intermediate rather than low fertility. © 2007 The Authors.",105,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Biotic interactions | Complementarity | Dominant species | Fertilization | Functional groups | Grasses | Overyielding | Subalpine grasslands,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,8,NA,NA

To investigate life-history differentiation and an objective functional classification of tree species we analysed the demography of 29 species in subtropical montane forests in north-western Argentina. 2. We computed 13 growth, demographic, abundance and distribution variables based on: (i) two 5-year re-measurements of stems ≥ 10 cm diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) in 8 ha of old growth forest and 4 ha of secondary forest; (ii) assessments of tree crown illumination; and (iii) sapling counts under shade and on landslides. 3. We assessed the potential confounding effects of stem size and crown illumination on absolute stem diameter growth rate for the 24 most abundant species. As diameter increased, one species showed significant increases in growth rate and five showed significant reductions. Seventeen species grew significantly faster with increased exposure to light and we controlled for this confounding effect in the computation of diameter growth rates for subsequent analyses. 4. A principal component analysis resulted in three meaningful and interpretable axes of demographic variation across species. The first axis (interpreted as shade tolerance) indicates that trees of species with inherently high growth rates tend to have well-exposed crowns at 10-30 cm d.b.h., have high density of trees in secondary forest and are less tolerant of shade. 5. The second axis (turnover) shows that in old-growth forest short-lived species, with high mortality rates, size-class distributions with a steep negative slope and low dominance, persist due to high rates of recruitment (to ≥ 10 cm d.b.h.). 6. The third axis indicates that species that colonize landslides have lower tree recruitment rates and greater growth variability in secondary forest, reflecting spatio/temporal differences in species' recruitment linked to differences in their substrate requirements for regeneration. 7. Maximum height and diameter are correlated with the first and second axes, indicating that higher rates of both growth and survival permit some species to attain large size. 8. All three demographic axes depict separate trade-offs that confer competitive advantage to each 'demographic type' under contrasting ecological conditions (of light availability, disturbance frequency and disturbance intensity), thus underpinning species' coexistence in dynamic forest landscapes. © 2007 The Authors.",43,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Demography | Forest dynamics | Functional classification | Longevity | Maximum height | Species coexistence | Trade-off,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,9,NA,NA

In plant invasion ecology, viruses and other pathogens are often considered in terms of the enemy release hypothesis, which predicts that plants become invasive in new ranges if they escape pathogens from their home range. However, pathogens may sometimes facilitate host spread rather than hinder it. 2. Previously, we hypothesized that apparent competition mediated by barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (Luteoviridae: BYDVs, CYDVs) may have facilitated historical grassland invasion in California, USA, where Eurasian grasses displaced native grasses in the 18th and 19th centuries (the disease facilitation hypotheses). However, this could have happened only if the viruses were present during the invasion, which is unknown. 3. To investigate the historical ecology of BYDVs in California grasses, we analysed preserved virus infections in herbarium specimens and used the historical virus sequences to determine rough time estimates of relevant phylogenetic events. 4. The historical viral RNA sequences we identified in invasive and native grasses date from 1917 and are among the oldest recovered from plants thus far and the oldest from North America. 5. Herbarium evidence and phylogenetic analysis suggest that BYDVs were likely to have been present in wild grasses during the California grassland invasion and to have shared some functional characteristics with present-day isolates, supporting the disease facilitation hypothesis. 6. We found evidence of virus spread from California to Australia (or, less likely, from Australia to California) in the late 19th century, when much horticultural exchange occurred, as well as potential correspondence in the timing of virus diversification events and the beginning of extensive human exchange between the Old and New Worlds. 7. Synthesis. Increasing evidence indicates that viruses are important in the ecology of grasslands and may, in some cases, mediate apparent competition among species.

Plant species affect ecosystem carbon uptake via biomass production and carbon release via decomposition processes. Differences in their responses to climate change and effects on ecosystem carbon cycling processes may thus feedback to the atmospheric carbon balance and the climate at a global scale. Hierarchical species classifications based on plant growth forms are widely used in cold, northern biomes to generalize and predict these differences. This review investigates the usefulness of broad (vascular, non-vascular), intermediate (woody, non-woody) and narrow (evergreen shrubs, deciduous shrubs, graminoids, forbs) plant growth-form-based groups in these biomes for predicting plant responses to climate change and effects on the main processes of the full carbon cycle by looking at the similarity of species within growth-form groups and the consistency of differences among groups under changing environmental conditions. 2. Production responses to climate change differ between broad growth-form groups, but their opposite responses do not imply that the responses of non-vascular plants are consistently negative. Within vascular growth forms, production responses to climate change are not always similar among species under identical conditions, and average differences among narrow vascular growth forms are usually small. Moreover, differences in production responses among growth forms strongly depend upon the duration of the study, the region and the ecosystem type. 3. Species within narrow growth forms show a high similarity for a range of leaf litter chemistry variables and differences among narrow growth forms are often large and consistent. However, differences in leaf litter decomposability are large between broad growth-form groups, but small and environment-dependent among important narrow vascular growth forms. Litter feedback effects to plant production vary among narrow vascular growth forms, but the differences strongly depend on the study duration. Data on the climate dependence of growth-form differences regarding this aspect of the carbon cycle are currently lacking. 4. Synthesis: Overall, the usefulness of growth-form-based groups clearly differs between carbon cycling processes. Different aggregation levels are therefore needed for different processes. For most processes there is evidence that the differences among growth forms depend on environmental conditions, which hampers their use for generalizations and modelling. Future studies should therefore explicitly test for differences among growth-form groups and aim to unravel the dependence of growth-form differences on environmental conditions. © 2007 The Author.",53,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Cold biomes | Cryptogams | Hierarchical classification | Litter decomposition | Litter effects | Peatlands | Plant functional types | Plant production | Plant traits | Tundra,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,11,NA,NA

Secondary seed dispersal occurs whenever a seed is dispersed in two or more different dispersal events, so that different dispersal agents (e.g. animal frugivores or invertebrates) contribute to different events. Three secondary seed dispersal systems, in which lizards and predatory birds participate, are studied in Lanzarote (Canary Islands). 2. Seeds from all three plant species studied (Lycium intricatum, Rubia fruticosa and Asparagus nesiotes) were found with the remains of lizards (Gallotia atlantica) when they appeared inside shrike (Lanius meridionalis) and kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) pellets. This suggests that these two avian predators might secondarily disperse these plants by incidentally ingesting seeds when they prey upon the frugivorous lizards. 3. Lycium and Rubia seeds dispersed by Falco had significantly thinner seed coats compared to the other treatments (Gallotia and Lanius) and to uningested seeds. Correlated with this result, seed hardness increased from Lycium (the softest coat), to Rubia (intermediate values), to Asparagus. 4. Seed viability was high in all three species, although both viability and germination were significantly reduced in seeds of Lycium and Rubia dispersed by Falco. 5. The seed distribution was markedly different, Gallotia being an important disperser in the open ground microhabitats, Lanius in hillocks and Falco in hills. Because all three plant species were present in all these microhabitats, our observations suggest that the dispersal of these plants might be associated with the differential use of the habitat by the different dispersers. 6. Synthesis: Contrary to some long-distance seed dispersal (LDD) paradigms, the complex seed dispersal systems we describe are common and affect an important number of seeds that are moved each year to particular microhabitats. Finally, the simultaneous ecological factors analysed in this study support the hypotheses that diplochory by double endozoochory could have played a more important role in LDD events than is currently recognized, both in recent volcanic areas (lowlands) and also probably in the colonization of other subtropical islands. © 2007 The Authors.",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Badlands | Canary Islands | Diplochory | Endozoochory | Frugivorous lizards | Island plant colonization | Long-distance seed dispersal | Seed coat and hardness | Seed distribution | Seed viability and germination,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,12,NA,NA

Tropical rain forest trees have been classified according to the importance of canopy disturbances for their life histories. To assess gap-dependence vs. shade tolerance, we propose using demographic analysis of the degree to which gaps are critical for population growth. 2. Population growth is the composite of the successes and failures of individuals experiencing different life-cycle pathways (i.e. gap, building, and mature forest patches). To assess the contribution of each pathway, it is necessary to study patch dynamics. 3. We use stage and patch structured matrix models and loop analysis to assess the life-history strategies of two Neotropical mangrove trees, Avicennia germinans and Rhizophora mangle. We use data from field studies in Lake Maracaibo, Venezuela, that were specifically designed to parameterize these models. 4. In R. mangle, seedling to juvenile progression was limited to high light patches (> 20% canopy openness), even though they comprised < 10% of the area, and population growth depended entirely on gaps. A. germinans seedlings progressed to juveniles from all light patches, and progression rates increased with light level. However, low and medium light patches (< 20% openness) were most important to population growth because they were most frequent. We suggest that R. mangle is gap-dependent while A. germinans is shade-promoted (i.e. shaded patches are demographically more important to A. germinans population growth even though seedling progression rates increase with canopy openness). 5. Previous studies considered R. mangle shade-tolerant because its propagules can establish and initially survive in the shade, but our classification was based on its entire life cycle. For A. germinans, the important measure was not the growth response to light, but the frequency and demographic importance of different light patches. 6. Synthesis: These examples show that observations of a plant's germination biology or photosynthetic/growth response to light do not necessarily translate into demographic behaviour because physiology can be decoupled from demography by patch dynamics. Thus, it is critical to consider the entire life cycle in the context of forest patch dynamics when assessing the life-history strategies of tropical trees. © 2007 The Authors.",22,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Avicennia germinans | Canopy gap | Disturbance | Gap dynamics | Markov model | Matrix model | Patch | Population projection matrix | Rhizophora mangle | Tropical forest | Venezuela,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,13,NA,NA

Plant ecologists have long since realized that the persistence of many facultative biennial plants depends upon disturbance. However, we still have a limited knowledge of the population-level effects of disturbance, and the connection between adult and seed bank dynamics. 2. Using data from a 3-year demographic study combined with experimental gap-opening in a large population of Digitalis purpurea, we parameterized stochastic transition matrix models in 'disturbed' vs. 'undisturbed' areas. We simulated different gap sizes (fraction of population that was disturbed) and temporal disturbance patterns (constant, random, regular and irregular return intervals) and evaluated the effects on population growth rate and seed bank dynamics. To explore seed bank importance we used two alternatives for seed bank survival rate (0.75/0.35) and three alternatives for seed bank recruitment fraction (0.9/0.5/0.1). 3. Observed background recruitment levels were insufficient to ensure a positive population growth rate. Increased amounts of gap-opening led to higher growth rates, and population persistence was predicted at moderate disturbance levels if seed bank survival was high (0.75). 4. Temporal disturbance pattern affected model results; random and interval scenarios resulted in lower population growth rates and higher extinction risks than constant scenarios of the same average disturbance level. Small and frequent disturbances led to considerably higher growth rates than large and rare disturbances. 5. Stochastic elasticity analyses identified the seed bank as the most important life cycle stage with respect to population growth and persistence in most scenarios, and its relative impact was positively related to seed bank survival rate and negatively related to disturbance level. Variation in the recruitment fraction from seed bank vs. seed rain affected both population growth rate and elasticity patterns, indicating the large impact of spatial variation in seed bank density. 6. Synthesis: Despite the existence of a large seed bank, our data suggest that recruitment may be locally seed-limited due to a patchy seed bank structure. Local population development may consequently differ widely from gap to gap. These results illustrate how spatial structures in both seed bank, adult population and gap formation interact to shape plant population dynamics, as well as the occurrence of microsite- vs. seed-limitation. © 2007 The Authors.",30,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Disturbance | Elasticity | Facultative biennial | Gap dynamics | Matrix population models | Monocarpic perennial | Seed bank | Stochastic growth rate,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,14,NA,NA

Shade tolerance, defined as the ability to survive and grow under low light, varies markedly among tree species. However, the role of low-light growth responses in determining shade tolerance is unclear, as are the effects of non-light resources such as soil nutrients. 2. A conceptually simple field measure of shade tolerance is the whole-plant light compensation point (WPLCP), evaluated as the x-intercept of the relationship between growth and incident light integrated over a long time interval. Here we compare WPLCP for growth and survivorship of saplings of Bornean tree species differing in shade tolerance, and evaluate the importance of various physiological and morphological traits in predicting WPLCP. We also examine both phenotypic and evolved differences in WPLCP between tree saplings growing on two distinct soil types at Sepilok Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysia. 3. Growth-based estimates of WPLCP showed essentially a 1:1 correspondence to threshold light levels for survivorship. At higher light, more light-demanding species showed higher growth, resulting in a steeper slope of the relationship between relative growth rate (RGR) and light availability than in more shade-tolerant species. This resulted in significant crossovers in the RGR-light relationship among species. 4. Dark respiration (Rd) was the single best predictor of WPLCP; other leaf traits such as leaf nitrogen and photosynthetic capacity were correlated with, but excluded as predictors of, WPLCP in multiple regression analyses. 5. Although soil type had no consistent phenotypic effect on WPLCP, evolved responses among species were pronounced: species associated with the nutrient-poor, drought-prone, sandstone-derived soils had higher WPLCP values than alluvial soil specialists in phylogenetically controlled comparisons. 6. Our results indicate that minimum light levels for growth do not diverge from those for survivorship, and do not support the view that low-light survivorship solely determines shade tolerance. Our analyses also suggest that Rd is the strongest determinant of whole-plant light requirements in tropical tree saplings, and thus may be an easily measured surrogate of WPLCP and shade tolerance. 7. Prediction of tree species resource requirements is crucial for understanding forest dynamics and promoting ecology-based forest management and restoration, particularly in diverse tropical forests where data on the resource requirements of most species are not available. Easily measured surrogates of resource requirements (e.g. Rd as a predictor of shade tolerance) will contribute to this goal, as will an improved understanding of the interactive effects of multiple resources on tree performance. © 2007 The Authors.",120,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Edaphic specialization | Foliar dark respiration | Habitat association | Leaf traits | Rank reversals | Shade tolerance | Trade-offs | Tropical rain forest | Whole-plant light compensation point,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,15,NA,NA

Environmental stochasticity can play a major role in population dynamics with consequences for population viability and the evolution of life-history traits. However, in empirical studies it is necessary to verify that environmental stochasticity is actually present and that the observed variability is not simply a consequence of sampling variation. 2. We propose a non-parametric method to detect environmental variability in demographic parameters of structured populations based on data randomization using an estimated Kullback-Leibler distance as a test statistic. 3. The Kullback-Leibler distance is an established information-theoretic measure of the deviance between distributions and we show, with empirical and simulated data sets, that it can be adapted effectively to detect variability in demographic fates among populations. 4. This metric has the potential to reveal the importance of relatively rare transitions for understanding temporal variability in demography that would not be revealed by log-linear analysis. 5. Synthesis: Using an estimated Kullback-Leibler distance as a test statistic allows variability at the level of demographic rates to be economically assessed as an adjunct to the randomization tests that many researchers currently perform to assess variability in λ, and would provide additional and complementary insight. © 2007 The Authors.",4,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Demographic census | Environmental stochasticity | Kullback-Leibler | Matrix models | Randomization tests,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,16,NA,NA

Patch dynamics is a new, potentially unifying mechanism for the explanation of tree-grass coexistence in savannas. In this scale-explicit paradigm, savannas consist of patches in which a cyclical succession between woody and grassy dominance proceeds spatially asynchronously. The growing ecological and economic problem of shrub encroachment is a natural transient phase in this cycle. 2. An important step towards understanding patterns at the landscape scale is achieved by investigating mechanisms at a smaller scale. We developed the spatially explicit individual-based simulation model SATCHMO to test the null hypothesis that cyclical succession cannot emerge from a realistic patch scale simulation model of the population dynamics of savanna woody species. 3. We calculated the partial temporal autocorrelation coefficient for 100 simulated time series of shrub cover over 500 years for time lags of up to 200 years to establish the existence and duration of successional cycles. We found a significant positive autocorrelation indicating the existence of cycles with a typical duration of about 33 years. 4. The shrub size frequency distributions over the course of a cycle showed shifts from dominance of small shrub sizes towards larger sizes during the increasing phase of a cycle and the reverse in the declining phase. This supports the three phase explanation as follows: (i) an initial phase when spatially and temporally overlapping favourable conditions lead to mass recruitment of shrubs; (ii) a build-up phase when the shrub cohort grows; and (iii) a break-down phase when increased competition due to crowding and unfavourable conditions lead to the break-down of the shrub cohort. The frequency distribution of shrub age at death over 10 simulations was also in agreement with this explanation. 5. We investigated the relationship between shrub cover, annual precipitation and time-lagged shrub cover to identify the driver of the cyclical successions. More than 90% of the variation in shrub cover was explained by shrub cover of the previous year, precipitation, and their interaction. 6. With the demonstration of precipitation-driven cyclical succession at the patch scale, we show that the mechanistic, temporal component of patch dynamics can be used to explain tree-grass coexistence in semi-arid savannas. © 2007 The Authors.",50,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Acacia mellifera | Cyclical succession | Individual-based simulation model | Patch scale | Scale | Shrub encroachment | Size-frequency distributions | Temporal autocorrelation | Tree-grass coexistence,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,17,NA,NA

This account reviews information on all aspects of the biology of Juniperus communis that are relevant to understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2. Juniperus communis (juniper) is an evergreen dioecious gymnosperm shrub with two main population centres in Britain, one on chalk downlands of southern England and the other in northern England and Scotland. British populations are divided into two main subspecies although there is overlap in genetic and morphological features. Subspecies communis varies from a spreading shrub to an erect tree characteristic of calcareous soils in southern England, various soils in the Scottish highlands, while ssp. nana is a small procumbent shrub, restricted to well-drained bogs and, more usually, rocky outcrops, generally as a minor component of upland heaths and montane scrub. Both subspecies are drought and frost tolerant, although sensitive to fire. A third subspecies, hemisphaerica, primarily found in mountains of southern Europe has two small populations on maritime cliffs in the UK. 3. Although not very palatable, J. communis is grazed by small and large mammals when food is short, particularly in winter. Its low palatability is derived from oils found in the needles, cones and wood, dominated by monoterpenes. These have been extensively used in folklore medicine and to flavour alcoholic drinks, and are being investigated for new medicinal uses. 4. Juniperus communis ssp. communis is a characteristic light-demanding invader of pasture but has declined due to agricultural expansion, erosion, overgrazing, fire and poor regeneration, such that it is now rare and threatened across lowland/southern Europe. Although susceptible to overgrazing, some grazing can be beneficial to create the open sward necessary for seedling establishment. Other limits to regeneration are: progressively ageing stands in which male plants predominate; increasing fragmentation of stands that reduces pollination efficacy; and high seed dormancy with consequent variable germinability. © 2007 The Authors.",90,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,Climatic limitation | Communities | Conservation | Ecophysiology | Geographical and altitudinal distribution | Germination | Herbivory | Mycorrhiza | Parasites and diseases | Reproductive biology | Soils,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,18,NA,NA

Competition strongly influences many species assemblages, but its role in mycorrhizal fungal interactions is not well understood. We examined interactions among three ectomycorrhizal (ECM) species to determine if the structure of competition could be characterized by either competitive networks (where no clear hierarchy exists in the outcome of competition between various species pairs) or competitive hierarchies (where one species out competes all other species). 2. Using a bioassay experiment, we inoculated Pinus muricata seedlings with three Rhizopogon species (R. occidentalis, R. salebrosus, and R. vulgaris) in single-, two-, and three-species treatments. After 7 months, we assessed the relative abundance of each species in each treatment using real-time PCR of internal transcribed spacer rDNA. 3. We found that R. occidentalis was strongly inhibited by R. vulgaris and R. salebrosus in all competition treatments. In contrast, R. vulgaris and R. salebrosus had similar ECM biomasses in the two-species treatment, but R. vulgaris had significantly higher biomass than R. salebrosus in the three-species treatment. 4. In the single-species treatments, seedlings colonized by the competitive dominants had higher shoot biomass and total leaf nitrogen, but also higher percentage ECM biomass. In the multi-species treatments, seedlings had either equivalent or somewhat lower shoot biomass and total leaf nitrogen than their respective single-species treatments. 5. Synthesis. Our results indicate that ECM competition does not appear to be characterized by strict networks or hierarchies. Instead, the outcome is dependent on the conditions of the local environment in which it occurs. There also does not seem to be a clear relationship between ECM competitive ability and plant performance, but competition does appear to negatively affect the ability of ECM fungi to provide benefits to their hosts. © 2007 The Authors.",61,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Ectomycorrhizas | Fungi | Interspecific competition | Pinus muricata | Real-time PCR | Rhizopogon | Symbiosis,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,19,NA,NA

Plant responses to nutrient heterogeneity may be influenced by spatial heterogeneity in other soil-based resources. We investigated how heterogeneity in two resources, nutrients and oxygen, affected root system morphology and biomass of three floodplain tree species, which differ in waterlogging tolerance from highly tolerant (Nyssa aquatica L.) to intermediate (Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh.) to less tolerant (Liquidambar styraciflua L.). 2. We predicted that heterogeneity in soil oxygen would affect the well-known root proliferation response to nutrient-rich patches, and biomass, of the least tolerant species, L. styraciflua, but would not influence biomass or proliferation of the more tolerant species, F. pennsylvanica and N. aquatica. To test this prediction, we grew seedlings in pots where we manipulated the spatial distribution of oxygen (via waterlogging) and nutrients. 3. All species were precise foragers (i.e. they displayed preferential proliferation of roots in nutrient-rich patches) in uniformly drained and waterlogged conditions. When waterlogging and nutrients were both heterogeneous, roots of L. styraciflua avoided waterlogged patches and did not precisely forage for nutrients. In contrast, waterlogging had no negative effects on nutrient foraging of either F. pennsylvanica or N. aquatica; however, these species did not precisely forage for nutrients when nutrient-rich and waterlogged patches were spatially separate. 4. Waterlogging reduced biomass of L. styraciflua, did not significantly affect biomass of F. pennsylvanica, and enhanced biomass of N. aquatica. In pots where waterlogging and nutrients were simultaneously heterogeneous, the spatial position of waterlogging relative to that of nutrients influenced the biomass response of F. pennsylvanica and N. aquatica to nutrient heterogeneity, but did not influence L. styraciflua. For F. pennsylvanica and N. aquatica, nutrients may have been easier to acquire in waterlogged patches due to faster diffusion rates. 5. Synthesis. Our results suggest that root system and biomass responses to nutrient heterogeneity can be affected by heterogeneity in another soil-based resource (i.e. soil oxygen availability).

Prolonged dormancy, during which a plant does not produce above-ground shoots during one or more growing seasons, is common in temperate herbaceous species, but its role in life history is poorly understood. 2.

We monitored 179 S. spaldingii plants from 1987 through 2005, and analysed demographic rates as a function of plant state and seasonal precipitation. 3. Dormant plants had similar survival and growth to vegetative plants, and were more likely to flower in the following year, resulting in a greater reproductive value being associated with the dormant state. Thus, prolonged dormancy is likely to increase fitness in S. spaldingii. 4. Both external (precipitation) and internal (stage in previous year) factors were associated with S. spaldingii vital rates. Prolonged dormancy was more likely following flowering than after being vegetative, and following a wetter summer and/or drier fall the previous year. 5.

Comparative analyses of diversity variation among and between regions allow testing of alternative explanatory models and ideas. Here, we explore the relationships between the tree α-diversity of small rain forest plots in Africa and in Amazonia and climatic variables, to test the explanatory power of climate and the consistency of relationships between the two continents. 2. Our analysis included 1003 African plots and 512 Amazonian plots. All are located in old-growth primary non-flooded forest under 900 m altitude. Tree α-diversity is estimated using Fisher's alpha calculated for trees with diameter at breast height ≥ 10 cm. Mean diversity values are lower in Africa by a factor of two. 3. Climate-diversity analyses are based on data aggregated for grid cells of 2.5 × 2.5 km. The highest Fisher's alpha values are found in Amazonian forests with no climatic analogue in our African data set. When the analysis is restricted to pixels of directly comparable climate, the mean diversity of African forests is still much lower than that in Amazonia. Only in regions of low mean annual rainfall and temperature is mean diversity in African forests comparable with, or superior to, the diversity in Amazonia. 4. The climatic variables best correlated with the tree α-diversity are largely different in the African and Amazonian data, or correlate with African and Amazonian diversity in opposite directions. 5. These differences in the relationship between local/landscape-scale α-diversity and climate variables between the two continents point to the possible significance of an array of factors including: macro-scale climate differences between the two regions, overall size of the respective species pools, past climate variation, other forms of long-term and short-term environmental variation, and edaphics. We speculate that the lower α-diversity of African lowland rain forests reported here may be in part a function of the smaller regional species pool of tree species adapted to warm, wet conditions. 6. Our results point to the importance of controlling for variation in plot size and for gross differences in regional climates when undertaking comparative analyses between regions of how local diversity of forest varies in relation to other putative controlling factors. © 2007 The Authors.",94,Journal,ar,Article,100,37,37,Africa | Amazonia | Biodiversity | Biogeography | Climate | Comparative analysis | Diversity theory | Fisher's alpha | Tree alpha diversity | Tropical forest,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,22,NA,NA

The tree-ring growth response of stone pine (Pinus cembra L.) to climatic variability was studied in the Alps. The aims were (i) to assess tree-ring growth patterns at different spatial-temporal scales; (ii) to identify the climate parameters that explain most of the variability in radial growth at different time domains; and (iii) to study past and current trends in radial growth and climate-growth relationships at different locations. 2. High- and low-frequency stone pine chronologies were compiled for 30 treeline sites on the French and Italian Alps. We used gridded climate data computed from 200 years of instrumental records from an extensive Alpine network. Climate-growth relationships were computed with bootstrap correlation functions and their stationarity and consistency over time assessed with moving correlation. 3. No spatial patterns were detected in stone pine chronology statistics despite the regional clustering observed in tree-ring series and climate responses. This can be attributed to (i) local weather variability; (ii) different biophysical conditions caused by soil moisture, solar radiation, snowmelt dynamics and growing season length; and (iii) forest stand history and age structure, the expression of long-term land use and disturbances. 4. The exceptionally long-term climate records allowed significant stone pine growth response changes to be assessed at both annual and decadal time scales. Winter conditions and spring-summer temperatures mainly affected the growing season length, in addition to site carbon and water balance. Most of these limiting factors varied spatially and temporally along the latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in response to the corresponding changes in local conditions. 5. Our results show evidence of a clear response variability of Pinus cembra to climate limiting factors, at both spatial and temporal scale.

Indigenous species of Acacia are common in African savannas that have N-rich soils. This raises doubt regarding the extent of plant dependence on N2-fixation. Why would Acacia spp. enjoy an advantage over other tree species on N-replete soils? 2. We tested the hypothesis that competition by grass for nutrients would induce increased nodulation of Acacia karroo, A. nilotica, A. tortilis and A. nigrescens seedlings that would enable them to survive better than a non-nodulating congeneric species (A. ataxacantha). A glasshouse pot experiment was conducted to determine the capacity of the Acacia spp. to nodulate. The Acacia spp. were also grown in a randomized field plot experiment in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park with and without grass coexistence, and biomass accumulation and δ15N values were determined. We also sampled a range of legume and non-legume saplings from the Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park for δ15N values. 3. In the pot experiment all species, except A. ataxacantha, which is a forest margin species, nodulated and consequently had lower δ15N isotope values than A. ataxacantha. In the field experiment the δ15N values of the plants grown with grass were significantly lower (δ15N = 0.77 ± 0.08‰) than those grown without grass (δ15N = 5.0 ± 0.16‰) for all species, except A. ataxacantha. The δ15N isotope abundances of field-collected leaves of legume saplings were found to be significantly lower than those of non-legume species (legume δ15N = 0.98 ± 0.32‰, non-legume δ15N = 2.15 ± 0.32‰). 4. These data confirm that A. karroo, A. nilotica, A. tortilis and A. nigrescens seedlings are capable of nodulating, and do so in their native habitat. The decreased δ15N in plants grown with grass indicates that N2 fixation was strongly enhanced by competition with grass for N. 5. N2 fixation may thus be an important attribute allowing legume tree seedlings to survive competition with grass through a critical period when tree roots and grass roots must compete for nutrients. © 2007 The Author.",72,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,15 N isotope | African Acacia | Competition | Grass | Natural abundance | Nitrogen fixation | Nodule | Savanna | Tree-grass competition,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,24,NA,NA

Acer platanoides (Norway maple) is an important non-native invasive canopy tree in North American deciduous forests, where native species diversity and abundance are greatly reduced under its canopy. We conducted a field experiment in North American forests to compare planted seedlings of A. platanoides and Acer saccharum (sugar maple), a widespread, common native that, like A. platanoides, is shade tolerant. Over two growing seasons in three forests we compared multiple components of seedling success: damage from natural enemies, ecophysiology, growth and survival. We reasoned that equal or superior performance by A. platanoides relative to A. saccharum indicates seedling characteristics that support invasiveness, while inferior performance indicates potential barriers to invasion. 2. Acer platanoides seedlings produced more leaves and allocated more biomass to roots, A. saccharum had greater water use efficiency, and the two species exhibited similar photosynthesis and first-season mortality rates. Acer platanoides had greater winter survival and earlier spring leaf emergence, but second-season mortality rates were similar. 3. The success of A. platanoides seedlings was not due to escape from natural enemies, contrary to the enemy release hypothesis. Foliar insect herbivory and disease symptoms were similarly high for both native and non-native, and seedling biomass did not differ. Rather, A. platanoides compared well with A. saccharum because of its equivalent ability to photosynthesize in the low light herb layer, its higher leaf production and greater allocation to roots, and its lower winter mortality coupled with earlier spring emergence. Its only potential barrier to seedling establishment, relative to A. saccharum, was lower water use efficiency, which possibly could hinder its invasion into drier forests. 4. The spread of non-native canopy trees poses an especially serious problem for native forest communities, because canopy trees strongly influence species in all forest layers. Success at reaching the canopy depends on a tree's ecology in previous life-history stages, particularly as a vulnerable seedling, but little is known about seedling characteristics that promote non-native tree invasion. Experimental field comparison with ecologically successful native trees provides insight into why non-native trees succeed as seedlings, which is a necessary stage on their journey into the forest canopy. © 2007 The Authors.",41,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Acer platanoides | Acer saccharum | Biological invasion | Canopy trees | Congeneric pair | Enemy release | Norway maple | Photosynthesis | Seedling ecology | Sugar maple Authorship is shared equally,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,25,NA,NA

The importance of plant-soil interactions in land reclamation, and the management and restoration of functioning native ecosystems, is becoming widely recognized. However, relatively little is known about broad-scale patterns of genetic variation and adaptation in wild plant-soil symbiotic interactions. 2. The current study is part of a larger project examining patterns of genetic variation and adaptation in host and symbiont populations across their geographical ranges using two widespread native Australian Acacia spp. (A. salicina, A. stenophylla) and associated populations of rhizobial bacteria. 3. A total of 58 sites were characterized with regard to symbiont population sizes, soil chemistry and environmental parameters. Rhizobial abundance was negatively correlated with a small number of soil factors, including nitrogen, and positively correlated with organic carbon and cation exchange capacity. 4. There were clear differences between host species in seedling growth responses in glasshouse trials using pots inoculated with native soils. While A. salicina grew equally well with soils from A. stenophylla and A. salicina sites, A. stenophylla grew best when inoculated with its own soils, indicating broad-scale adaptation to its own rhizobia. 5. Rhizobial abundance in these soils was also strongly correlated to variation in nodulation and host growth, indicating that abundance may be a good indicator of the relative effectiveness of rhizobial populations. 6. The clear differences in specificity and effectiveness of host-symbiont associations, even among related species, suggests that better knowledge of these systems at multiple spatial scales is central to understanding the factors that influence the ecology and evolution of plant and soil communities, and has potential to increase the cost-effectiveness of restoration programs. © 2007 The Authors.",50,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Host specificity | Mutualism | Nitrogen-fixation | Nodulation | Provenance | Restoration | Revegetation | Soil symbiont,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,26,NA,NA

As a result of global warming, species may spread into previously cool regions. Species that disperse faster than their natural enemies may become released from top-down control. We investigated whether plants originating from southern Europe and recently established in north-western Europe experience less soil pathogen effects than native species. 2. We selected three plant species originating from southern Europe that have immigrated into the Netherlands and three similar native Dutch species. All six plant species were grown in sterilized soils with a soil inoculum collected from the rhizospheres of field populations. As a control we grew a series of all six plant species with a sterilized rhizosphere inoculum. 3. We harvested the plants, added the conditioned soil to sterilized soil and grew a second generation of all six plant species in order to test for each plant pair feedback effects from the conditioned soil communities to conspecifics and heterospecifics. 4. The effect of the soil community is dependent on plant species, and is dependent on soil fertility in only one of the three pairs. 5. Soil conditioning caused less biomass reduction to exotic plant species than to native species, suggesting that exotic immigrants are less exposed to soil pathogens than similar native plant species. 6. Our results suggest that plant species that expand their range as a result of climate change may become released from soil pathogenic activity. Whether the exotics are released from soil pathogens, or whether they experience enhanced benefit from mutualistic symbionts remains to be studied. We conclude that range expansion may result in enemy release patterns that are similar to artificially introduced invasive exotic plant species.

From Darwin to the present day, sexual selection has been shown to be widespread in both animals and plants. Attractive floral traits in hermaphrodite plants evolve in response to selection acting simultaneously through male and female sexual functions, but knowledge about the relative strength of gender-specific selection is scarce. 2. We experimentally altered flower size of the hermaphrodite Cistus salvifolius in three sites differing in physical characteristics, and measured the effect of this manipulation on both male and female success. More pollen was dispersed from the non-manipulated flowers compared with the size-reduced flowers. 3. Standardized selection differentials for flower size through pollen dispersal were significantly positive in all three populations. By contrast, flower size had little effect on female success. Fruit set was always high and selection for this trait through fruiting was not significant. The number of seeds per fruit from bigger flowers was significantly higher than that from smaller flowers, but this difference was attributable exclusively to one population in which selection via seeds per fruit was significant. Flower size reduction had no effect on offspring quality. 4. Our results show that phenotypic selection through male function generally supports that flower size would evolve primarily through selection on male fertility (male function hypothesis). Selection through female function was apparent only in one population, as pollen limitation was absent or weak. We show the relative strength of selection through male and female functions depends on the pollinator context. © 2007 The Authors.",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Cistus salvifolius | Floral evolution | Flower morphology | Hermaphrodites | Male function hypothesis | Mediterranean species | Pollinator-mediated selection | Sexual selection,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,28,NA,NA

A recent experiment varied the genetic diversity of model grassland communities under standardized soil and management conditions and at constant initial species diversity. After 5 years' growth, genetically diverse communities retained more species diversity and became more similar in species composition than genetically impoverished communities. 2. Here we present the results of further investigation within this experimental system. We proposed that two mechanisms - the first invoking genetically determined and constant differences in plant phenotypes and the second invoking genotype-environment interactions - could each underpin these results. This mechanistic framework was used as a tool to interpret our findings. 3. We used inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) DNA markers to confirm which of the individuals of six study species initially included in the model communities were unique genotypes. We then used the molecular markers to assess the survival and abundance of each genotype at the end of the 5-year experimental period. 4. The DNA marker data were used to create, for the first time, a genotype abundance hierarchy describing the structure of a community at the level of genotypes. This abundance hierarchy revealed wide variation in the abundance of genotypes within species, and large overlaps in the performance of the genotypes of different species. 5. Each genotype achieved a consistent level of abundance within genetically diverse communities, which differed from that attained by other genotypes of the same species. The abundance hierarchy of genotypes within species also showed consistency across communities differing in their initial level of genetic diversity, such that species abundance in genetically impoverished communities could be predicted, in part, by genotypic identity. 6. Three species (including two canopy-dominants) experienced shifts in their community-level genotype abundance hierarchies that were consistent with an increased influence of genotype-environment interactions in genetically impoverished communities. 7. Our results indicate that under relatively constant environmental conditions the species abundance structure of plant communities can in part be predicted from the genotypic composition of their component populations. Genotype-environment interactions also appear to shape the structure of communities under such conditions, although further experiments are needed to clarify the magnitude and mechanism of these effects. © 2007 The Authors.",75,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Community ecology | Community genetics | Competition and coexistence | Genetic diversity | Genotype-environment interactions | Grasslands | Species diversity,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,29,NA,NA

Trophic relationships are often depicted as networks, in which species are connected by links representing predatory interactions. Network analyses have also been applied to non-trophic species interactions, such as pollination and seed dispersal mutualisms, to summarize community-level patterns in mutually beneficial interactions. However, the processes responsible for common network properties such as degree distributions (the number of interactions maintained by each species in the network) and nestedness (the tendency for specialists to interact with perfect subsets of the species interacting with generalists) are poorly understood. 2. I evaluated the network properties of a novel type of species interaction, commensal interactions between epiphytes and their host trees. I quantified the occurrence of 19 vascular epiphyte species on seven host tree species in a metacommunity of epiphytes in New Zealand. I then developed null models to test whether observed network properties result from the frequency of species interactions, which is a commonly cited but rarely tested explanation for degree distributions and nestedness. 3. Results showed that degree distributions of both epiphyte and host tree species were consistent with a null model that randomly populated hosts with epiphytes. Several null models that test for nestedness by randomly linking pairs of interacting species showed significantly higher nestedness in the real community. In fact, the observed level of nestedness was among the highest yet recorded for any type of ecological interaction. A second null model that randomized species interactions according to their overall frequencies of occurrence in the community confirmed support for nestedness. 4. Results indicate that the degree distributions were consistent with randomized expectations; the number of interactions maintained by both epiphyte and host tree species appears to be determined by their frequency of occurrence in the community. However, interaction frequencies could be ruled-out as an explanation for nestedness. Nested epiphyte-host interactions may instead result from a predictable sequence of epiphyte succession, wherein earlier colonists ameliorate environmental conditions within host trees for later recruiting species. © 2007 The Author.",73,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Commensalisms | Degree distribution | Epiphyte | Host | Metacommunity | Nestedness | Null model,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,30,NA,NA

The conventional explanations for large plant species producing larger seeds on average than small plant species have recently been challenged, and it has been suggested that the pattern is better explained by the theory developed by Charnov (1993). Here we use simple life-history theory to explore the logic underlying Charnov's models and show that under most reasonable conditions they predict no relationship between seed mass and size at maturity. 2. Using a simple general model incorporating size-specific growth and survival, we explore the joint evolution of seed mass and size at maturity, and argue that seed mass will be correlated with adult traits, such as the timing of reproduction and size at reproduction, only if seedling and adult growth and mortality rates are correlated. Evidence for such correlations is briefly explored. 3. It has also been suggested that the standard model for seed mass evolution (Smith & Fretwell 1974) has been misinterpreted, and that application of the model requires measurement of survivorship to reproductive maturity. Using a simple model incorporating size-specific growth and survival we show that this criticism is unfounded. 4. Our results differ from those of Moles and colleagues because they look at the effect of long juvenile period on survival to maturity, but do not recognize that this may be compensated by covarying life-history traits, such as plant size and reproductive lifespan. Also, they seem to argue that life-history evolution is constrained by cross-angiosperm correlations, such as that between seed mass and longevity, while the life-history models presented here seek selective causes of such correlations, rather than regarding them as constraints. 5. Models similar to those of Charnov (1993) only predict a positive relationship between seed size and plant size if unrealistic assumptions are made about the effects of seed mass on survival, such as the effect of seed mass on instantaneous survival persisting to adulthood. © 2007 The Authors.",47,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Evolutionary stable strategy | Life-history theory | Seed mass | Size at maturity | Smith-Fretwell model,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,31,NA,NA

Understanding the factors influencing tree growth is central to forest ecology because of the significance of growth to forest structure and biomass. One of the simplest, yet most controversial growth models, proposed by Enquist and colleagues, predicts that stem-diameter growth scales as the one-third power of stem diameter. Recent analyses of large-scale data sets have challenged the generality of this theory and highlighted the influence of resource competition on the scaling of growth with size. 2. Here we explore the factors regulating the diameter growth of 3334 trees of mountain beech (Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortioides) growing in natural single-species forests in New Zealand. Maximum-likelihood modelling was used to quantify the influences of tree size, altitude, the basal area of taller neighbours (BL) and the basal area of all neighbours (BT) on growth. Our interpretation of the models assumed that taller neighbours compete for light whereas all neighbours compete for nutrients. 3. The regression analyses indicate that competition for light has a strong influence on the growth of small trees, whereas competition for nutrients affects trees of all sizes. These findings are consistent with experimental manipulation studies showing that competition for light and nutrients inhibits the growth of small mountain beech trees, and fertilizer application studies showing that nitrogen limits the growth of large trees. 4. Tree growth declined with altitude. The regression analyses suggest that the intensity of light competition also declines with altitude, when trees with similar BT and BL values were compared along the gradient. These results are consistent with observations that trees become stunted and have more open canopies at high altitudes. 5. Our study is the first to build the effects of competition and environment into Enquist's model of tree growth. We show that competitive interactions alter the scaling of mean growth rate with size, whereas altitude does not influence the scaling of potential growth rate with size. © 2007 The Authors.",303,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Boltzmann-Arrhenius function | Competition | Elevation | Facilitation | Metabolic theory | Non-linear mixed-effects model | Quantile regression | Temperature | Tilman vs. Grime debate | WBE theory,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,32,NA,NA

Spatial segregation of the sexes did not occur in any of the populations. 3. Flowering sex ratios were female biased (2: 1) in both the intermediate and old populations, but were slightly male biased in the young population. The female-biased sex ratios in the mature populations were due to the increasing number of flowering females with increasing plant size, but not to differences in demographic parameters; neither mortality nor growth rate differed between the sexes in any population. 4.

Nutrient availability, defoliation and soil disturbance are important factors that influence the richness of plant communities. However, few studies have examined the interactions between these factors, especially in harsh environments. We therefore examined the effects of fertilization, defoliation and soil disturbance on plant species richness in an alpine meadow in northern Sweden. 2. From 2002 to 2005, plots were fertilized, mowed and disturbed annually in a factorially designed experiment. Plant species richness, colonization and extinction were recorded in permanent subplots. Seedling densities and recruitment from seed of Potentilla crantzii were also estimated in order to examine the mechanisms whereby these treatments influence colonization by new species. 3. Species richness peaked in the absence of disturbance in unfertilized plots and with light disturbance in fertilized plots. Colonization by new vascular plant species, seed recruitment and seedling density were all increased by soil disturbance, suggesting that colonization was increased because conditions were more favourable for seed recruitment following the disturbance treatment. Extinction of species was highest in the mowed, intensively disturbed and unfertilized plots and lowest in the fertilized, lightly disturbed and unmowed plots. 4. Local extinction was negatively correlated with both moss and vascular plant biomass. Local colonization, seedling density and recruitment of P. crantzii were all strongly negatively correlated with the biomass of mosses. In contrast, the biomass of vascular plants was only weakly correlated with local colonization, seedling density and recruitment of P. crantzii. 5. This study suggest that the level of disturbance at which species richness peaks should move towards higher disturbance levels when productivity increases. However, lower extinction rates rather then higher colonization rates seem to be causing the increase in species richness following disturbance. © 2007 The Authors.",36,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Alpine | Colonization | Defoliation | Disturbance | Extinction | Fertilization | Potentilla crantzii | Recruitment | Seed | Species richness,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,35,NA,NA

When the two sexes compete so intensively that one of them may be consistently excluded from patches of habitat, how can they coexist in the population as a whole? 2. To address this question, we constructed a population model capable of simulating the dynamics of sex-specific life-history stages within frequently disturbed patches and across a multipatch system strongly influenced by extinction and colonization (metapopulation). 3. We parameterized the model based on the dioecious bryophyte Marchantia inflexa, attempting to capture sufficient biological realism for the results to be quantitatively comparable with natural patterns. 4. In nature, M. inflexa spreads by tissue extension and dispersal of asexual propagules within patches or sexual spores between patches. Females have faster tissue expansion and males greater production of asexual propagules. Some patches and even entire populations lose males or, more rarely, females. 5. In the model, males were often eliminated by competition from individual patches, but both sexes almost always persisted in the metapopulation (as in nature), with females typically predominating. Male advantage during patch filling and spores produced and dispersed where males (the fugitive sex) had not yet been eliminated kept both sexes in the model system. 6. Similar mechanisms may maintain both sexes in other systems, particularly small, highly disturbed populations where life-history traits and mortality differ between the sexes. © 2007 The Authors.",13,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Asexual reproduction | Clonality | Loss of sex | Marchantia inflexa | Overgrowth competition | Sex-ratio dynamics | Sexual dimorphism | Sexual reproduction,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,36,NA,NA

Ecological networks have been shown to display a nested structure. To be nested, a network must consist of a core group of generalists all interacting with each other, and with extreme specialists interacting only with generalist species. 2.

However, we know of no study addressing to what extent nestedness depends on sampling effort, despite the numerous studies discussing the ecological and evolutionary implications of nested networks. 3. Here we manipulate sampling effort in time and space and show that nestedness is less sensitive to sampling effort than number of species and links within the network. 4. That a structural property of an ecological network appears less prone to sampling bias is encouraging for other studies of ecological networks.

Limiting similarity theory predicts that successful invaders should differ functionally from species already present in the community. This theory has been tested by manipulating the functional richness of communities, but not other aspects of functional diversity such as the identity of dominant species. Because dominant species are known to have strong effects on ecosystem functioning, I hypothesized that successful invaders should be functionally dissimilar from community dominants. 2. To test this hypothesis, I added seeds of 17 different species to two different experiments: one in a natural oldfield community that had patches dominated by different plant species, and one in grassland mesocosms that varied in the identity of the dominant species but not in species richness or evenness. I used indicator species analyses to test whether invaders had higher establishment success in plots with functionally different dominant species. 3. A large percentage of invader species (47-71%) in both experiments showed no difference in affinity across the different dominant treatments, although one-third of species did show some evidence for limiting similarity. Exotic invaders had much higher invasion success than native invaders, and seemed to be inhibited by dominant species that were functionally similar. However, even these invasion patterns were not consistent across the two experiments. 4. The results from this study show that there is some evidence that dominant species suppress invasion by functionally similar species, beyond the effect of simple presence or absence of species in communities, although it is not the sole factor affecting invasion success. Patterns of invasion success were inconsistent across species and experiments, indicating that other studies using only a single species of invader to make conclusions about community invasibility should be interpreted with caution. © 2007 The Author.",80,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Centaurea maculosa | Community assembly | Diversity | Dominance | Evenness | Grassland | Niche complementarity | Seed addition,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,38,NA,NA

Although outbreeding populations of many grassland plants exhibit substantial genetic and phenotypic variation at fine spatial scales (< 100 m2), the implications of local genetic diversity for community structure are poorly understood. Genetic diversity could contribute to local species diversity by mediating the effects of competition between species and by enhancing species persistence in the face of environmental variation. 2. We assayed the performance of three genotypes each of a dominant tussock grass (Koeleria macrantha [Ledeb.] J.A. Schultes) and dominant sedge (Carex caryophyllea Lat.) derived from a single 10 × 10 m quadrat within a limestone grassland in Derbyshire, UK. Genotypes were grown in monoculture and grass-sedge mixtures of different genetic composition in two environments of contrasting fertility. Species mixtures also included one genotype of the subordinate forb Campanula rotundifolia L. 3. When grown without neighbours, intraspecific genotypes responded similarly to environmental treatments. One genotype of the sedge performed worse in both environments than the other two sedge genotypes. 4. When grown in species mixtures, genotype performance was significantly influenced by the genetic identity of the neighbouring species for both the sedge and the grass. At high fertility, differential genotype performance was not sufficient to alter the expectation of competitive exclusion of the sedge by the grass. However, at low fertility, the competitive dominant depended on the genetic identity of both the grass and the sedge. In addition, each genotype of the grass performed best next to a different genotype of the sedge, and the identity of the best genotype pairings switched with environment. 5. Performance of a single genotype of the subordinate Campanula was not predictable by fertility alone, but by how fertility interacted with different neighbouring genotypes of both the grass and the sedge. 6. Results support the hypothesis that the genetic identity of interspecific neighbours influences plant performance in multispecies assemblages and mediates species' responses to environmental variation. Such interactions could be a key factor in the contribution of local intraspecific genetic diversity to species diversity. © 2007 The Authors.",116,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Campanula rotundifolia | Carex caryophyllea | Genetic diversity | Koeleria macrantha | Limestone grassland | Species coexistence,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,39,NA,NA

Studies using highly informative genetic markers (e.g. microsatellites) have revealed effective movement of genes through pollen grains from more distant sources into offspring than those inferred on the basis of physical pollen movement alone. In order to identify the factors that cause such effective pollen movement in tree populations, analyses of the genetic structure of reproductive trees and parentage analyses for seedlings and saplings were conducted in a 110-ha population of Aesculus turbinata, a tall deciduous tree species that is pollinated by insects and has large seeds that are dispersed by gravity and small mammals. 2. By analysing genotypes of seed coats, which are identical to those of the seed parents, and of leaves from seedlings, pollen donors and seed parents were identified for seedlings. Differences in size and dispersal mode between pollen and seeds caused a significant difference in dispersal distances. Reflecting the restricted seed dispersal (25.3 m on average), there was significant positive relatedness between reproductive trees standing within 150 m of each other. 3. The percentage of self-pollinated offspring decreased from 8.3% at the seedling stage to 0.56% at the sapling stage. The disappearance of out-crossed individuals during the stage between seedling and sapling seemed to be associated with the spatial distance separating their parents: the proportion of juvenile trees that died was higher for those that originated from out-crosses between adults standing within 100 m of each other, where positive relatedness was found between adult trees. Consequently, the deaths of individuals arising from self-pollination events and from crosses between reproductive trees that were spatially adjacent caused longer effective pollen movement for the offspring that survived. The distance between the two parents of a tree, which indicates the distance of effective pollen movement, increased from 179.9 m for seedlings to 288.9 m for saplings. 4. The genetic structure of the adult population of A. turbinata affected the survival of offspring through biparental inbreeding depression, and, then, removal of individuals resulting from crosses between related adults in turn promoted effective pollination over longer distances. © 2007 The Authors.",31,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Aesculus turbinata | Biparental inbreeding depression | Genetic structure | Microsatellites | Pollen dispersal | Pollination | Relatedness | Seed dispersal,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,40,NA,NA

It is widely considered that phenotypic plasticity is important to species invasiveness. However, few empirical studies have expressly assessed the relationship between species invasiveness and their responses to environmental variability. Thoughtfully incorporating phenotypic plasticity into studies of invasiveness requires explicit links among appropriate environmental variables, traits relevant to invasion success, and comparison groups of species, populations or genotypes (competitors or close relatives) that place focal species in context. 2. We examine trait responsiveness in introduced species of Crepis and Centaurea (Asteraceae) that have been characterized by different degrees of success. Specifically, we assess the extent to which species are robust in the face of harsh environments and opportunistically responsive to favourable conditions. 3. We exposed all species to water and phosphorus availability treatments in a common glasshouse experiment and report the responses of phenological, architectural, size and fitness traits. We predicted that, compared with less invasive congeners, invasive species would more often display robust fitness in harsh environments (here, drought and no phosphorus addition) and would also be more responsive to favourable conditions (no drought and phosphorus additions). 4. In both Crepis and Centaurea we found evidence of greater stress tolerance to low phosphorous among the more invasive congeners, albeit for different components of fitness. Contrary to expectations, we observed no relationship between invasiveness and opportunism. Overall, trait responses were highly variable and largely idiosyncratic with respect to invasive categorization. 5. Consistent with basic expectations, across-environment species performance largely corresponded to degree of invasiveness. 6. Our results suggest that, even among closely related species, relationships between invasiveness and phenotypic plasticity do not necessarily reveal consistent patterns, nor do they conform to simple theoretical expectations. We suspect that phenotypic plasticity may indeed play an important role in many species invasions, but the breadth of relevant factors (which genotypes, which populations, which traits, which environments) reduces the likelihood of detecting robust general patterns. © 2007 The Authors.",52,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Biological invasions | Centaurea | Crepis | Drought | Environmental variation | Invasiveness | Jack-of-all-trades | Non-indigenous species | Phenotypic plasticity | Phosphorous,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,41,NA,NA

Habitat fragmentation, degradation and abiotic disturbances may strongly affect population dynamics and genetic diversity of plant populations. 2. In this study, a Life Table Response Experiment (LTRE) and stochastic simulations were used to investigate how different types of disturbance affected the fitness and population dynamics of small, fragmented populations of the long-lived perennial Primula vulgaris and how this was related to genetic diversity. Nested factors were included in the LTRE analysis in order to assess population-specific contributions to changes in population growth rate and to contrast these with contributions derived for year and type of disturbance. 3. Stochastic growth rates (λs) varied considerably among disturbance types: sites continuously disturbed throughout the year had a mean stochastic growth rate smaller than one, whereas sites receiving low or cyclic disturbance had stochastic growth rates larger than one. 4. LTRE analysis revealed that disturbance had a major impact on variation in growth rate, whereas year effects were less pronounced. However, contributions of individual populations equalled or exceeded those of the disturbance regime and mainly originated from negative or positive contributions of seedling recruitment and growth. 5. Linear regression analysis showed that these deviations of population demography from the disturbance type contribution were positively related to genetic diversity and effective population size, whereas inbreeding and isolation had no effect. Similar analyses revealed a positive effect of effective population size on λs. 6. Our data indicate that disturbance has an important impact on population dynamics of this plant species, but that populations containing a higher number of reproductive adults are buffered against large fluctuations due to environmental stochasticity so that stochastic growth rates are higher. However, because population specific contributions to changes in population growth rate were as large as the contributions of disturbance itself, and because they were significantly related to population genetic diversity, our study suggests that, along with local and regional environmental variables, genetic diversity may also play a key role in determining population viability of perennial plant species. © 2007 The Authors.",26,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Disturbance regime | Environmental stochasticity | Extinction | Genetic erosion | Habitat fragmentation | Matrix projection models | Nested LTRE | Population viability | Primula | Stochastic simulations,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,42,NA,NA

Mast seeding is the synchronous and highly variable production of seed by a population of plants. Mast seeding results from the behaviour of individuals; however, little is known about the synchrony of individuals at local scales. 2. We address two primary questions at a within-population (17-36 ha study plots) and individual level: (i) How variable is seed production between and within years? (ii) How synchronized is seed production between individuals? 3. We monitored annual cone production of 356 Picea glauca (white spruce) from 1990 to 2005 within four plots spanning a total distance of 5.3 km in the Yukon Territory, Canada. 4. Spearman correlations (rs) were conducted to test for synchrony. Overall, the trees were moderately synchronous (mean rs (± SE) of 0.52 ± 0.14), and synchrony was statistically detectable (rs > 0) over all distances. Individuals < 75 m apart were highly synchronous (0.64 ± 0.18), and correlations dropped to 0.33 ± 0.07 for trees > 3 km apart. There was considerable variation in cone production patterns among pairs of individuals. 5. The number of mast years per plot varied from one to three. During a mast year, many individuals within plots produced large cone crops, with more variability between individuals in low mean cone years. Individual trees had dominant endogenous cycles varying from none to 1-5 years. Forty-four per cent of trees had no significant lag, 23% a negative 1-year lag, and 20% a positive 3-year lag. Basal area did not influence lags, but trees with higher mean cone production throughout the study were more likely to have a 3-year lag compared with no lag. 6. The scale of highest synchrony coincided with the scale at which the dominant seed predator in the area, the territorial red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), operates. This may be the scale at which selection for synchrony occurs. 7. Based on high synchrony locally, high synchrony within a mast year, and multiple lags in cone production by individuals, both available resources and strong weather cues appear to play roles in the observed patterns. © 2007 The Authors.",110,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Autocorrelation | Boreal forest | Cone production | Individual variability | Mast seeding | Picea glauca | Synchrony | White spruce,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,43,NA,NA

The predator satiation hypothesis (PSH) posits that GF events enhance seed survival by reducing the survival, reproduction and population sizes of seed predators between GF events, and then satiating the reduced seed predator populations during GF events. 2 Three GF events of different magnitudes occurred in Pasoh Forest Reserve, Peninsular Malaysia, during 2001, 2002 and 2005. We exploited this natural experiment to test two predictions of the PSH. The first prediction was that seed survival should increase with the magnitude of the GF event. The second prediction was that seed predation should decrease with time since the previous GF event. 3 A reproductive survey of all (c. 900) dipterocarp trees ≥ 30 cm d.b.h. in a 50 ha plot showed that flowering pervasiveness (the proportion of dipterocarp species participating) was high and similar in all three GF events. However, relative flowering magnitudes (measured by an index of individual tree participation and flowering intensity in Shorea species) were 2, 5 and 8 for the 2001, 2002 and 2005 GF events, respectively. 4 The percentage of Shorea seeds surviving pre- and post-dispersal predation increased with the magnitude of GF events, which is consistent with the first prediction. 5 Pre-dispersal insect seed predators consumed 12.9%, 11.2% and 3.45% of Shorea seeds in the 2001, 2002 and 2005 GF events, respectively, which is consistent with both predictions. 6 Pre-dispersal seed predation by primates (mainly leaf monkeys) increased from 11.9% to 38.6% then fell to 9.3% in the 2001, 2002 and 2005 GF events, respectively. 7 Predator satiation occurred only at population and community levels. At the individual tree level there was no relationship between the percentage of seeds surviving pre- and post-dispersal seed predation and variation in seed crop size or seed density beneath the tree. This suggests that attempts to test the PSH on the scale of individual trees may miss key community level effects. 8 Our results suggest a more significant role of pre-dispersal seed predation in the evolution of reproductive synchrony than was recognized in the original statement of the PSH. © 2007 The Authors.",57,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Dipterocarpaceae | Flowering phenology | General flowering event | Lowland dipterocarp forest | Pasoh | Post-dispersal seed predation | Pre-dispersal seed predation | Predator satiation | Shorea,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,44,NA,NA

A sharp vegetational change occurred after 6000 cal. years BP involving a drastic decline of Abies alba around the site. 3 Time-series analyses suggest that increased fire activity at this time caused a strong decline in Abies alba, a highly fire-sensitive species. During 100 years of higher fire incidence, diverse (predominantly evergreen) forest communities were converted to low-diversity fire-prone shrub communities. 4 Cross-correlations reveal that fire during the mid-Holocene hindered the expansion of holm oak (Quercus ilex), the most common tree species today in Mediterranean environments. While the factors that triggered the Holocene expansion of this species in the Mediterranean area are unclear, our results do not support the hypothesis that fire was key for holm oak expansion. 5 Diatom analyses of the same sediment core provide an independent palaeoenvironmental proxy for palaeoclimatic reconstruction. A change in the eutrophy and salinity of the lake occurred just before 6000 cal. years BP, suggesting that a climatic shift towards aridity may have triggered the observed change in hydrology and possibly also in fire regime. 6 Over the millennia fire has decisively contributed to the establishment of the present fire-adapted vegetation type (macchia). Native fire-sensitive species were displaced or repressed, and arboreal vegetation became less diverse. Combined ecological and palaeoecological data may help to assess possible future scenarios of biosphere responses to global change. Our results imply that the forecasted global warming and fire increase may trigger irrecoverable biodiversity losses and shifts in vegetational composition within a few decades or centuries at most.

However, the action of disturbance, creating heterogeneous environments and suppressing potential dominants, may also be important for biodiversity maintenance. 2 Hypothesis: subordinate species exhibit primarily opportunistic (ruderal) survival strategies, with increasing disturbance intensity constraining dominant species - favouring opportunistic strategies and thus functional and species diversity. 3 The diversity, character and frequency of strategies in an alpine sedge-dominated vascular plant community were quantified in situ using CSR (competitor, stress-tolerator, ruderal) classification, and compared with a pasture in the same alpine vegetation belt (i.e. with additional disturbance). Adaptive trends were confirmed by independent multivariate analysis [detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS)]. 4 The extremely stress-tolerant sedge Carex curvula (C : S : R = 17.2 : 72.9 : 9.9%) dominated the relatively undisturbed community (frequency = 52%), with 32 subordinates (typically < 5%) exhibiting a functional spectrum encompassing stress tolerance to ruderalism, but not competitive strategies. With grazing, the community exhibited weaker co-dominance by five species, greater biodiversity (76 species) and greater functional diversity, characterized by larger numbers of ruderals and some competitive-ruderals. The principal variation in both DCA1 and NMDS1 for both communities directly reflected CSR strategy spectra, confirmed by Spearman's correlation. 5 Dominance by stress-tolerators and restricted functional diversity demonstrates habitat-level (β-scale) functional convergence in response to stress. A spectrum of S to R strategies demonstrates α-scale functional divergence in response to differential stress and disturbance. Grazing suppresses potentially dominant species and favours diversity, with the additional presence of competitive-ruderals suggestive of a more intricate niche topology including more relaxed abiotic opportunities. 6 Natural communities are not necessarily structured according to the rules of resource competition models, as these fail to account for disturbance and facilitation processes. © 2007 The Authors.",80,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Co-occurrence | Coexistence | CSR theory | Functional diversity index | Niche differentiation | Species richness,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,47,NA,NA

A sequence of regulating factors was considered from source to sink of in-stream woody debris (SWD), including fire history at the landscape scale, patterns of post-fire recovery of riparian forest and inputs of SWD at the scale of a stream reach and its associated floodplain, and burial of SWD at an excavated site. 2 Fires occurred repeatedly in the studied landscape (at least in 1708, 1733, 1791, 1811, c. 1838, c. 1850, 1882, 1941 and 1998), and were generally patchy on the floodplain because of the firebreak effect of the riparian corridor. Unburned forest remnants were regularly generated at the stream margin, thus permitting temporally continuous but spatially localized transfer of woody material across the forest-stream interface. These remaining forest patches also increased forest resilience by dispersing seeds and promoting conifer re-establishment in burned areas. 3 Because of higher severity compared with previous fires, the 1941 fire burned almost everywhere on the floodplain, creating only a few widely isolated unburned forest remnants. Consequently, following an abrupt post-fire increase, SWD inputs almost completely ceased. In addition, post-fire recovery of the riparian wood source is slow because of the spatially restricted seed source. 4 In this alluvial stream, wood burial is faster than decay and largely determines the residence time of SWD. Because the residence time is about 150 years, the current density of SWD is high and contrasts sharply with the very low tree density at the stream margin. Although this long residence time helps maintain stream integrity while the forest is recovering from the 1941 fire, it is unlikely that SWD inputs would resume extensively before burial of the current SWD pool. 5 Our research exemplifies the potentially complex impacts of disturbances on material transfer between a source and a sink ecosystem. We conclude that when certain components of ecosystems are coupled by unidirectional flow, those components will behave asynchronously if a disturbance impact at the source ecosystem does not propagate rapidly to the sink and the source and the sink recover at different rates. © 2007 The Authors.",24,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Aquatic woody debris | Boreal landscape | Disturbance severity | Ecosystem coupling | Ecosystem resilience | Forest-stream interface | Lateral flow | Nonlinear ecosystem dynamics | Riparian forest | Source-sink dynamics,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,48,NA,NA

Plant symbionts such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can have considerable influence on nutrient uptake and are therefore likely to influence plant competition. In this study we investigated the influence of different AMF isolates on the competitive relationships between a legume (Lotus corniculatus L.) and a grass (Festuca ovina L.), and between L. corniculatus and a forb (Plantago lanceolata L.). 2 AMF altered the competitive interactions between the investigated plant species. The legume, which was the most AMF-dependent plant species, was favoured in the presence of AMF relative to the non-AMF treatment in seven out of eight cases. Competition between the grass and the legume was the most strongly affected by AMF. The grass and the legume both benefited from AMF when grown alone, but in competition AMF favoured the legume and grass biomass was reduced by 38%. 3 The presence and also the identity of AMF influenced the competitive relationships. The extent to which AMF influenced plant competition and changed the relative abundances of the competitors depended on the specific AMF isolate. 4 This study shows that both presence and identity of AMF can influence plant competition.

Resprouting ability in seedlings may depend on both developmental ontogeny and seed size. However, the relationships between these factors are not well explored, especially for woody species with comparatively small seeds and epigeal germination. 2 We investigated resprouting capacity in seedlings from four subtropical, riparian, Myrtaceous tree species, Melaleuca leucadendra, Asteromyrtus symphyocarpa, Eucalyptus camaldulensis var. obtusa and Tristaniopsis laurina, displaying these characteristics. We recorded resprouting in response to simulated disturbance as a function of seed mass and developmental age (5-150 days post-emergence) and examined the acquisition of resprouting ability in relation to growth and biomass allocation patterns. 3 Patterns of resprouting were distinct among species, but the acquisition of resprouting ability was not determined by seed mass. The 'small' seeded M. leucadendra and the 'intermediate' seeded E. camaldulensis showed unexpectedly high shoot resprouting vigour from cotyledon stage (70% resprouting at 5 days post-emergence), as well as greatest ongoing allocation to root mass and lateral root development. In contrast, in A. symphyocarpa (another species with 'intermediate' seed mass) and T. laurina (a 'large' seeded species) resprouting rates during early development were much lower (< 10%), although there was a trend towards increasing resprouting ability with age in A. symphyocarpa (> 150 days). Resprouting capacity was also independent of seedling size and relative growth rate. 4 Our results indicate that the size-dependency of resprouting capacity varies considerably among these species. This suggests physiological and morphological species traits other than those directly related to reserve size or relative growth rate may convey survivorship in river environments. 5 Our findings show that resprouting capacity was not related to seed size and seedling growth patterns in these four species. This is different to evidence from comparative studies undertaken in fire-prone and other temperate environments. A broader survey of seedling resprouting ability including more species is required to determine the generality of our findings in riparian species. © 2007 The Authors.",8,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Allocation | Plant reserves | Resprouting | Riparian | Seed size | Seedling growth | Tolerance,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,50,NA,NA

We studied patterns of exotic and native species richness across the Flooding Pampas of Argentina, and tested for exotic richness correlates with major environmental gradients, species pool size, and native richness, among and within different grassland habitat types. 2 Native and exotic richness were positively correlated across grassland types, increasing from lowland meadows and halophyte steppes, through humid to mesophyte prairies in more elevated topographic positions. Species pool size was positively correlated with local richness of native and exotic plants, being larger for mesophyte and humid prairies. Localities in the more stressful meadow and halophyte steppe habitats contained smaller fractions of their landscape species pools. 3 Native and exotic species numbers decreased along a gradient of increasing soil salinity and decreasing soil depth, and displayed a unimodal relationship with soil organic carbon. When covarying habitat factors were held constant, exotic and native richness residuals were still positively correlated across sites. Within grassland habitat types, exotic and native species richness were positively associated in meadows and halophyte steppes but showed no consistent relationship in the least stressful, prairie habitat types. 4 Functional group composition differed widely between native and exotic species pools. Patterns suggesting biotic resistance to invasion emerged only within humid prairies, where exotic richness decreased with increasing richness of native warm-season grasses. This negative relationship was observed for other descriptors of invasion such as richness and cover of annual cool-season forbs, the commonest group of exotics. 5 Our results support the view that ecological factors correlated with differences in invasion success change with the range of environmental heterogeneity encompassed by the analysis. Within narrow habitat ranges, invasion resistance may be associated with either physical stress or resident native diversity. Biotic resistance through native richness, however, appeared to be effective only at intermediate locations along a stress/fertility gradient. 6 We show that certain functional groups, not just total native richness, may be critical to community resistance to invasion.

More specifically, species with bird-dispersed seeds can potentially infiltrate natural nucleation processes in savannas. 2 To test (i) whether invasion depends on facilitation by host trees, (ii) whether propagule pressure determines invasion probability, and (iii) whether alien host plants are better facilitators of alien fleshy-fruited species than indigenous species, we mapped the distribution of alien fleshy-fruited species planted inside a military base, and compared this with the distribution of alien and native fleshy-fruited species established in the surrounding natural vegetation. 3 Abundance and diversity of fleshy-fruited plant species was much greater beneath tree canopies than in open grassland and, although some native fleshy-fruited plants were found both beneath host trees and in the open, alien fleshy-fruited plants were found only beneath trees. 4 Abundance of fleshy-fruited alien species in the natural savanna was positively correlated with the number of individuals of those species planted in the grounds of the military base, while the species richness of alien fleshy-fruited taxa decreased with distance from the military base, supporting the notion that propagule pressure is a fundamental driver of invasions. 5 There were more fleshy-fruited species beneath native Acacia tortilis than beneath alien Prosopis sp. trees of the equivalent size. Although there were significant differences in native plant assemblages beneath these hosts, the proportion of alien to native fleshy-fruited species did not differ with host. 6 Synthesis. Birds facilitate invasion of a semi-arid African savanna by alien fleshy-fruited plants, and this process does not require disturbance. Instead, propagule pressure and a few simple biological observations define the probability that a plant will invade, with alien species planted in gardens being a major source of propagules. Some invading species have the potential to transform this savanna by overtopping native trees, leading to ecosystem-level impacts. Likewise, the invasion of the open savanna by alien host trees (such as Prosopis sp.) may change the diversity, abundance and species composition of the fleshy-fruited understorey.

In this glasshouse experiment, seedlings of Gnaphalium norvegicum were grown with and without an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus, in the presence and absence of a large conspecific adult plant. The ability of adult plants to support the fungus was modified by defoliating 0%, 50% or 75% of its leaf area. 3 We found that mycorrhiza increased below-ground competitive intensity. The mycorrhizal benefit to the seedlings was low in the vicinity of non-defoliated adult plants, but increased with increasing defoliation intensity of the adult plant. This was mirrored by reductions in mycorrhizal benefit that adult plants gained at the highest level of defoliation. 4 These results emphasize the importance of below-ground competition during seedling establishment and show that competition for mycorrhiza-mediated resources may be an important factor underlying seedling establishment in nutrient-poor systems.

Several mechanisms have been proposed for the successful establishment of exotic plants in natural communities, but the positive effects that native engineer species may have on the distribution and performance of exotic plants remain unknown. 2 In this study, we propose that amelioration of extreme abiotic conditions by ecosystem engineers can make stressful habitats invadable by exotic plant species, with larger positive effects on the performance of exotic plants as environmental harshness increases. We tested this hypothesis by assessing the effects of a high-Andean ecosystem engineer, the cushion plant Azorella monantha, which is known to create habitat patches where environmental conditions are less extreme than in the surrounding habitats, on the distribution and the performance of two exotic plant species, field chickweed (Cerastium arvense) and common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale), along a an elevation gradient in the Andes of central Chile. 3 We measured and compared the abundance, biomass and survival of both exotic species within and outside cushion habitat patches at three elevations (3200 m, 3400 m and 3600 m), and evaluated whether the effects of A. monantha varied across elevations. 4 The results indicated that cushion plants positively impact the performance of both exotics, and have greater facilitative effects at higher elevations. Indeed, at the higher elevation site, C. arvense was only detected within A. monantha patches, suggesting that cushions may expand the distribution range of exotics. These results suggest that ecosystem engineering by native species could promote biological invasions in harsh environments, leading to higher abundances of invaders than those expected in the absence of engineers. 5 Given the conspicuousness of ecosystem engineering in nature, we suggest that exotic species eradication programmes might be less successful by not taking into account the facilitative effects of native engineer species on invaders. Further, we suggest that the recent proposals to use engineer species in ecosystem restoration should be aware of their potential role in promoting invasions. © 2007 The Authors.",87,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Alpine ecology | Azorella monantha | Biological invasions | Cerastium arvense | Cushion plants | Ecosystem engineering | Environmental gradient | Facilitation | Plant ecology | Taraxacum officinale,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,55,NA,NA

We experimentally varied seed density, and soil disturbance size and timing, to examine the formation of seed banks and the resulting population dynamics in wild annual sunflowers (Helianthus annuus). Seed density treatments reflected the expected increase in seed production of individual wild sunflowers due to hybridization with Bt-transgenic crop sunflowers. Soil disturbances of two sizes (large and small) were applied either before or after seed dispersal. We followed the experimental plots for 2 1/2 years measuring seedling emergence, seeds in the soil, and reproduction, while preventing additional seed input. We assessed seed bank formation by the numbers of emergent seedlings and seeds in the soil. 2 Soil disturbances, regardless of timing, were required for successful germination and reproduction of wild sunflowers. Large disturbances resulted in greater seedling emergence and reproduction than small disturbances. Reproduction on small disturbance plots was low, due to low seedling survival. Higher seed density resulted in more seedlings only in large-disturbance plots. 3 Post-dispersal disturbances led to significant seed bank formation. This effect was greater for large, post-dispersal disturbances. Higher seed density increased seed bank size only in the presence of large, post-dispersal disturbances. 4 Negative density-dependence in seedling mortality and reproduction meant that there was no effect of the high seed density treatment on reproduction. Thus the positive effects of increased seed bank size on population growth were tempered by density-dependence. To assess fully the impact of seed banks on population growth, studies should continue beyond the seedling stage. 5 Our results suggest increased seed production of individual sunflowers resulting from crop transgenes would be unlikely to increase population growth on the scale of small patches. Increased seed production could result in dispersal of seeds across larger areas, and thus could lead to larger seed banks in disturbed environments and an increased prevalence of sunflowers across the landscape. These results are relevant to other annual species, especially those with transgenic crop relatives. © 2007 The Authors.",24,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Crop-wild hybrids | Density-dependence | Fate of seeds | Helianthus annuus | Seed bank | Seed burial | Soil disturbance | Sunflowers,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,56,NA,NA

These fungi produce an array of metabolites in culture and there is some evidence that they can increase the resistance of plants to herbivorous insects. 2 As herbaceous plant endophytes are thought to be unspecialized, ubiquitous taxa, we hypothesized that their occurrence within two closely related plant species would not vary between local plant communities. Furthermore, we expected to find negative relations between endophyte occurrence and that of a herbivorous insect. 3 We tested these hypotheses by isolating endophytes from Leucanthemum vulgare and Cirsium arvense (Asteraceae) plants growing together in five populations, each about 13 km apart. Damage by the leaf mining fly, Chromatomyia syngenesiae, was also measured on each plant. 4 C. arvense harboured more species of fungi per plant and the number of isolates recovered per leaf was also higher. Several fungi showed differences in occurrence within the two plants, but these differences were not consistent between sites. The similarity in the endophyte assemblage decreased with increasing intersite distance in C. arvense, but not in L. vulgare. We conclude that endophytes either colonize C. arvense more readily or have greater activity within this host (or both). 5 Leaf miner attack was positively related to total endophyte species number in L. vulgare, but not so in C. arvense, while occurrence of Chaetomium species was negatively associated with insect attack in both plants. In L. vulgare, only 5% of relations between occurrence of different endophyte species were significant, but in C. arvense this figure was 43% and all were negative. 6 This study has important implications for understanding the factors that influence plant resistance to insects.

Because exotic plants may differ in their requirements compared with native plants, changes in resource levels or ratios may change their invasive potential. The concentration hypothesis, nutrient balance hypothesis and resource ratio hypothesis make different predictions regarding the effects of nutrient additions on plant communities and the success of invaders. 2 We investigated these hypotheses using Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum), which is an aggressive invader of grasslands in the southern USA. Soil nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were manipulated in a full factorial field experiment in a Texas coastal prairie. 3 Survival of Sapium seedlings over three growing seasons was independent of all three types of nutrient additions, alone or in any combination. Adding nitrogen or potassium increased the mass and height of Sapium seedlings. Adding phosphorus increased the mass and height of Sapium seedlings only when nitrogen was also added. These results support the nutrient balance hypothesis, which assumes that higher tissue concentrations of a nutrient reflect a greater ability of a plant species to take up and/or conserve that nutrient. 4 The above-ground biomass of background prairie vegetation was independent of the addition of each type of nutrient alone or in any combination. However, the functional composition of the community shifted from graminoids to forbs with the addition of nitrogen and from graminoids to woody plants with the addition of phosphorus. These results support the concentration hypothesis, which assumes that higher tissue concentrations of a nutrient reflect a greater requirement for that nutrient. The contrasting responses of native woody vegetation and Sapium to phosphorus addition suggest that Sapium may have unusually low demands for phosphorus relative to nitrogen for a woody plant in this community. 5 These results show that potassium or nitrogen addition, perhaps in combination with phosphorus addition, has the potential to accelerate the invasion of Sapium into Texas coastal prairies. Because anthropogenic nutrient additions are common in grasslands worldwide, this may help to explain the frequent success of woody species invading grasslands. © 2007 The Authors.",25,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Chinese tallow tree | Light | Nitrogen | Phosphorus | Potassium | Sapium sebiferum,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,60,NA,NA

We used the interaction between phloem-feeding scale insects [Ultracoelostoma assimile (Homoptera: Coelostomidiidae)] and the beech trees [Nothofagus solandri var. solandri (Hook f.) Oerst.] they feed on to estimate directly the carbon costs of herbivory for a forest tree species over two consecutive years. The scale insects live on the bark of tree trunks and branches, and excrete readily collected droplets of carbon-rich honeydew - this allows us to make an estimate of the carbon cost of herbivory that is not complicated by feeding damage to leaves and buds. 2 Canopy photosynthesis (A) was estimated with an environmentally driven process-based model, developed with parameters derived from measurements of photosynthesis on trees with (HD+) and without (HD-) honeydew scale insects during year 1. Honeydew dry matter production (PHD) was estimated from values for air temperature and humidity, and accounting for variation in honeydew production due to host-tree diameter. The carbon cost of scale insect herbivory, CHD, was estimated as PHD/AHD+× 100%, where AHD+is canopy photosynthesis for trees with scale insects. 3 Over the two years annual canopy photosynthesis at the site was 1720 g C m -2 ground area. In spring-summer, values for parameters describing photosynthesis (Vcmax, the maximum rate of rubisco-catalysed RuBP carboxylation, and Jmax, the rate of electron transport when irradiance is saturating) were 44% and 66% higher, respectively, in infested, as opposed to uninfested, trees. Consequently, for equivalent basal area, annual canopy photosynthesis was 4% greater for infested trees. 4 Assuming that honeydew dry matter was 42% carbon by mass, annual honeydew production was 59 g C m-2 ground area, which represents 4% of infested-tree gross photosynthesis (c. 8% of net photosynthesis). Daily values of honeydew production were highest on cloudy days in summer, when warm humid conditions resulted in high values for PHD but cloud cover reduced A HD+; on these days CHD could be > 50% of A HD+. Values for PHD are remarkably similar to the differences between AHD+ and AHD-, suggesting that HD+ trees may be able to compensate fully for the loss of carbon to herbivory. Our modelling results thus suggest that while the honeydew insects harvest relatively large amounts of carbohydrate from their host trees, the consequences of this for tree growth and reproduction may be small. © 2007 The Authors.",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Carbon uptake | Ecosystem productivity | Herbivory | Modelling | Photosynthesis,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,61,NA,NA

In the late 1990s northern Patagonia, Argentina, experienced extreme droughts which led to severe wildfires affecting a range of Andean ecosystems. 2 We experimentally examined how variations in moisture, temperature and herbivory by livestock affect post-1999 fire patterns of the three main tree species. Over two years we monitored, in three forest types, the survival and growth of tree seedlings in a factorial warming (+2°C)/livestock exclosure/watering experiment. 3 Seedling survival in the warmed treatments and in the controls was nil for the evergreen Nothofagus dombeyi and the conifer Austrocedrus chilensis at the two low-elevation experimental sites. Survival of the subalpine Nothofagus pumilio in the warmed treatments at high elevation tended to be lower than in the control; for all treatments of warming alone there were no significant differences compared with the controls. 4 In all three forest types, increased water availability was essential for higher rates of tree seedling survival. Doubling water availability during the growing season resulted in up to fourfold increases in seedling survival and up to threefold increases in seedling biomass. 5 In the subalpine forest, livestock reduced seedling survival by c. 30% in non-watered treatments compared with watered treatments, probably due mainly to soil desiccation and to consumption of or damage to facilitating plants. In contrast, at lower elevation, where livestock pressure was lower, seedling survival of N. dombeyi and A. chilensis tended to be higher in unfenced sites, possibly due to reduced competition from highly palatable shrub species. 6 General circulation models predict a warming-drying trend in northern Patagonia during the twenty-first century. The resulting increase in wildfire is likely to be followed by inadequate tree regeneration and conversion from forest to shrubland cover types. This and similar studies suggest that under relatively slight changes in regional climate, increased fire occurrence interacting synergistically with moisture limitations will result in long-lasting displacements of forest by more xeric vegetation shrublands. © 2007 The Authors.",45,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Austrocedrus | Climate change | Disturbances | Fire | Livestock | Nothofagus | Patagonia | Seedling survival | Tree regeneration,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,62,NA,NA

Further improvements in model prediction may come from incorporating an estimate of moss area in addition to LAI, and from using vegetation-specific estimates of LAI. 6 The success of this model at predicting NEE independent of any information on species composition indicates a high level of convergence in canopy structure and function in the arctic landscape. © 2007 The Authors.",135,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Alaska | Arctic | Carbon balance | CO  flux 2 | Landscape heterogeneity | Light response | Net ecosystem production | Sweden | Tundra,29602,NE/D005795/1,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,63,NERC,Natural Environment Research Council

Species with particular ecological demands or life-history attributes are more prone to extinction than species with a broader niche. 2 We used an old herbarium from the municipality of Küsnacht (Swiss lowlands) as a historical record for comparison with contemporary plant diversity. This comparison revealed that 17% to 28% of all vascular plants that occurred between 1839 and 1915 were extinct by 2003. 3 Species of different habitats and life-forms had significantly different rates of extinction: wetlands, disturbed sites and meadows lost most species, whereas forests and rocky habitats were least affected; aquatics and annuals were most prone to extinction, geophytes and hemicryptophytes were intermediate, and phanerophytes and chamaephytes were least affected. 4 Species adapted to nutrient-poor soils suffered highest extinction in all habitats, indicating that eutrophication poses an urgent threat to species diversity. Light and soil moisture requirements also had significant effects on extinction, but the direction of the effect varied by habitat. 5 When species were grouped into IUCN categories of the red list of Switzerland, the rank order of the observed extinction matched the red list assignment. 6 Because many of the remaining species had high estimated extinction probabilities and because extinction is often delayed (extinction debt), a substantial part of the remaining flora of Küsnacht is likely to go extinct in the near future. This will increase the dominance of the common species that already comprise 81% of the local flora. 7 The rates and patterns of extinction in Küsnacht are probably representative of surrounding Swiss lowlands and peri-urban landscapes in most developed countries.

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history and conservation. 2 Cirsium dissectum (meadow thistle) is a perennial, rhizomatous herb found in moist, nutrient poor grasslands and heathlands in north-west Europe. It is readily distinguishable from other Cirsium species in the British Isles but has been considered a subspecies of C. tuberosum, along with C. filipendulum, in some other areas of Europe. 3 It is susceptible to being out-competed by species that are able to increase biomass more rapidly. At more productive sites, greater nutrient availability increases the proportion of rosettes that flower, as well as rosette turnover. Seeds germinate readily under a range of conditions in the growth room and greenhouse but seedlings are very rarely found in the field. An examination of its population dynamics reveals that clonal propagation is the dominant form of reproduction, with the low number of seedlings primarily caused by very low establishment rates in vegetation stands. 4 Cirsium dissectum is relatively tolerant of drought and shade even though it is found in moist grasslands. At very low pH it suffers from ammonium and aluminium toxicity. As it has suffered habitat loss through drainage and succession, C. dissectum has declined in the British Isles and it is now endangered in Germany and the Netherlands. © 2007 The Author.",11,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Cirsium dissectum | Climatic limitation | Communities | Conservation | Ecophysiology | Geographical and altitudinal distribution | Germination | Herbivory | Mycorrhiza | Parasites and diseases | Reproductive biology | Soils,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,65,NA,NA

In addition to unfertilized controls, we created heterogeneous and homogeneous nutrient enrichment treatments by applying fertilizer to field plots in a patchy or uniform manner. Fertilization treatments were crossed with seed addition and cover reduction treatments, to allow examination of the effects of recruitment limitation and competition from established vegetation on diversity responses to nutrient heterogeneity. 3 In contrast to predictions, we found that spatially heterogeneous soil nutrient supply did not promote increased species richness or greater species sorting relative to a uniform supply of soil nutrients. Instead, both nutrient enrichment treatments depressed plant species richness (especially at small spatial scales) and, depending on cover reduction and on spatial location in the field, increased the abundance of two spreading clonal species. 4 Our results do not support the heterogeneity-diversity hypothesis, and suggest that the response of clonal species to nutrient enrichment may constrain how plant diversity responds to resource heterogeneity.

However, trade-offs in long-lived, clonal herbs have proven difficult to assess, particularly when they are prone to adult dormancy. 2 We assessed the costs of fruiting in a study of two species of lady's slipper orchid, Cypripedium candidum and C. parviflorum, growing sympatrically in a wet meadow in north-eastern Illinois, USA, from 2000 to 2005. 3 First, we characterized flowering and fruiting in both populations. We found some differences between species, with 68.6 ± 5.7% (mean ± SE) and 43.5 ± 1.4% of sprouting plants flowering, while 33.6 ± 10.0% and 33.5 ± 8.1% of flowering plants fruited in C. candidum and C. parviflorum, respectively. 4 Next, we tested the survival, sprouting and flowering response to current fruiting using multistate mark-recapture statistics. The best-fit model posited no cost of fruiting. However, according to a model parsimonious with the best-fit model, fruiting may have resulted in a small cost to survival visible primarily in small-sized individuals of C. parviflorum (decrease from 0.846 in non-fruiting but flowering plants to 0.824 in fruiting plants). In all cases, fruiting resulted in an increased probability of future flowering, suggesting that reproduction may have a higher priority in resource allocation than survival. 5 Finally, we tested the effects of fruiting on future fruiting using logistic regression for two years in which fruiting was particularly high, but detected no change in the probability of fruiting after fruiting. 6 Fruiting may increase in response to internal cues, perhaps related to nutrient uptake or storage, in addition to the obvious effects of pollination. The result may be that plants with greater access to nutrients or with greater stored reserves are more likely to flower each season.

The relationship was right-skewed unimodal and was significantly different between the benthos and the plankton; larger sizes were more speciose in the benthos, and smaller sizes in the plankton. The species richness peaks were explained with allometric trade-offs between maximum nutrient uptake rate and dispersal in the benthos but maximum nutrient uptake rate and sinking resistance in the phytoplankton. 3 I also explored the cell size similarity among species and across environments. Small diatoms were significantly more similar in size than large diatoms, and benthic diatoms were significantly more similar than planktonic diatoms. 4 This is the first continental study on the richness-body size relationship in algae, which suggests that the environmental differences between benthic and planktonic habitats generated allometric trade-offs that have driven the cell size optimization towards larger species in the benthos but smaller in the plankton. The patterns of cell size similarity revealed a higher niche overlap in the benthos than in the phytoplankton and among small species than among large species.

Generalists should co-occur with many species, whereas specialists should co-occur with relatively few species, given equal plot occurrences. We quantify this concept using a generalist-specialist metric (θ) derived from a beta diversity statistic. 3 We evaluate the ability of our generalist-specialist metric to correctly rank species according to simulated (known) niche widths. Our technique is generally robust to a wide variety of niche distribution structures and sampling designs, but surveys strongly biased toward certain habitats can undermine the ability of θ to accurately describe niche widths for underrepresented species. 4 We apply our technique to three spatially nested surveys of the large woody flora (> 1 cm d.b.h.) of the south-eastern USA. For each dataset we rank the generalist-specialist tendencies of all species of non-trivial occurrences, including 113 species across the Southeast, 71 species of southern Appalachian forests, and 44 species of the 6800-ha Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness Area (NC and TN, USA). 5 Rankings of species' θ-values were generally consistent among datasets of different spatial extent. Generalist species (e.g. Ilex opaca, Ulmus rubra, Morus rubra, Prunus serotina, Acer rubrum) were often those with large geographical ranges, particularly for θ-values from the largest dataset, and overall were more likely to be bird-dispersed, deciduous, and shade tolerant. South-eastern specialist species (e.g. Taxodium spp., Abies fraseri, Quercus laevis, Pinus pungens, Pinus palustris) were those associated with stressful or unusual conditions, such as a long duration of flooding, high fire frequency, or extreme cold or dry climates. 6 Our study demonstrates that increasingly available, large-survey datasets can contribute niche-related species information in the absence of detailed environmental or habitat measurements.

A potential reason for this is that the distribution of precipitation within a growing season affects productivity in addition to the total amount. 2 We analysed long-term ANPP data for three southern African temperate grasslands (mean annual precipitation ranging from 538 mm to 798 mm) to determine the effects of precipitation event size, number and spacing relative to seasonal totals. 3 Ungrazed, non-manipulated treatments at each site showed contrasting results despite sharing a common, dominant species. At the driest site, a model combining average event size and number of events per growing season provided a substantially better fit to the ANPP data than precipitation amount (seasonal total). At the wettest site, the interval between events was the most important precipitation variable. Precipitation distribution was not important at the intermediate site where amount was the best predictor of ANPP. A limit to the size of precipitation events efficiently utilized for ANPP was evident for the driest site only. 4 At each site, experimental treatments that altered species composition and soil fertility had little effect on precipitation-ANPP relationships. The lack of consistency in the relative importance of the precipitation variables among sites suggests that local, edaphic factors modify precipitation-ANPP relationships. 5 This analysis demonstrates that the distribution and size of precipitation events can affect ANPP independent of precipitation amount. As altered precipitation regimes are forecast by global climate models, the sensitivity of ecosystems to precipitation distribution should be considered when predicting responses to climate change. 6 While mean values of precipitation, and other ecosystem drivers, are typically used to predict function at the level of whole ecosystems, our results show that more complex measures of environmental variability may be required to understand ecosystem function, and to increase the accuracy of predictions of ecosystem responses to global change. © 2007 The Authors.",150,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,C  grasslands 4 | Climate change | Fertilization | Net primary production | Precipitation | Species composition,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,70,NA,NA

The role of individual fungal species in shaping this response is as yet unresolved. 2 We have used the fungicide benomyl to alter the community of AM fungi in undisturbed monoliths of soil in a natural community. Changes in the community were characterized by root colonization (%RLC), cloning, sequencing and tRFLP of a partial SSUrDNA fragment. Eleven plant species were sufficiently abundant in the monoliths to be examined. 3 In the highly mycorrhiza-dependent perennial herb Ajuga reptans, phosphate concentration was significantly reduced after benomyl treatment over a full growing season. The other plant species showed low colonization and no significant difference in phosphate concentration after benomyl treatment. 4 Although colonization in A. reptans was reduced, many mycorrhizal fungi survived in the roots. Some became more abundant following fungicide treatment, suggesting competitive release. Fungi that increased were generalists that have been identified in field samples from published studies colonizing a wide range of plant species. Those that declined were specialists with a narrow host range; five types had not been recorded previously in field samples. 5 AM fungi in this study differed greatly in their response to perturbation, independent of the identity of the host plant.

We tested this hypothesis by assessing the growth and defence investment strategies of 18 grass species and comparing them against vole feeding preferences. In addition, we assessed the effectiveness of silica, the primary defence in many grasses, in influencing vole feeding behaviour. Across species, we found that there was a strong negative relationship between the overall investment in defence and growth rate, thus supporting predictions of the RAH. However, no such relationship was found when assessing the various individual anti-herbivore defences, suggesting that different grass species show significant variation in their relative investment in strategies such as phenolic concentration, silica concentration and leaf toughness. Silica was the most influential defensive factor in determining vole feeding preference. Experimentally induced increases in leaf silica concentration deterred vole feeding in three of the five species tested, and altered feeding preference ranks between species. The strong positive relationship between silica concentration and leaf abrasiveness, when assessed both within and between species, suggests that increased abrasiveness is the mechanism by which silica deters feeding. Although grasses are often considered to be tolerant of herbivore damage rather then defended against it, they do follow predictions of defence allocation strategy based on their growth rates, and this affects the feeding behaviour of generalist grass-feeding herbivores. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 British Ecological Society.",118,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Feeding preference | Grass | Growth rate | Herbivory | Microtus agrestis | Resource allocation hypothesis | Voles,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,72,NA,NA

However, the consequences of snowfall variability remain uncertain for ecological variables operating at longer time scales, especially the distributions of forest communities. The Great Lakes region of North America offers a unique setting to examine the long-term effects of variable snowfall on forest communities. Lake-effect snow produces a three-fold gradient in annual snowfall over tens of kilometres, and dramatic edaphic variations occur among landform types resulting from Quaternary glaciations. We tested the hypothesis that these factors interact to control the distributions of mesic (dominated by Acer saccharum, Tsuga canadensis and Fagus grandifolia) and xeric forests (dominated by Pinus and Quercus spp.) in northern Lower Michigan. We compiled pre-European-settlement vegetation data and overlaid these data with records of climate, water balance and soil, onto Landtype Association polygons in a geographical information system. We then used multivariate adaptive regression splines to model the abundance of mesic vegetation in relation to environmental controls. Snowfall is the most predictive among five variables retained by our model, and it affects model performance 29% more than soil texture, the second most important variable. The abundance of mesic trees is high on fine-textured soils regardless of snowfall, but it increases with snowfall on coarse-textured substrates. Lake-effect snowfall also determines the species composition within mesic forests. The weighted importance of A. saccharum is significantly greater than of T. canadensis or F. grandifolia within the lake-effect snowbelt, whereas T. canadensis is more plentiful outside the snowbelt. These patterns are probably driven by the influence of snowfall on soil moisture, nutrient availability and fire return intervals.

The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, history, and conservation. Melampyrum sylvaticum is a hemiparasitic annual of upland, often birch-dominated woodlands. It is found across boreal and montane areas of Europe but within the UK it is predominantly found in the Scottish Highlands. These populations are consequently very isolated and vulnerable to a range of threats. Suitable habitat is characterized by open-canopied deciduous woodland close to water bodies, such as fast-flowing burns or lochs. Sites are typically north-facing, in cool and wet areas of Britain, on moderately acidic soils that are moist but freely draining. Hemiparasitism allows M. sylvaticum to acquire nutrients from a range of hosts but very little is known about which species it is able to parasitize in the field. Melampyrum sylvaticum is associated with herb-rich patches of the understorey. Melampyrum sylvaticum is insect-pollinated. Ants have been reported to be the main dispersal agents and the seed bears an elaiosome which offers them a lipid-rich reward. However, neither insect pollination nor ant dispersal has been observed directly in British populations. Melampyrum sylvaticum has relatively large seeds and been described as an 'annual K-strategist'; it has been suggested that this unusual combination makes it vulnerable to environmental change. Because of its endangered status, M. sylvaticum has been classed as a UK Biodiversity Action Plan species and a recovery project is underway to protect existing populations and to introduce it to suitable habitats in the Central Highlands of Scotland. © 2007 The Author Journal compilation © 2007 British Ecological Society.",16,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Climatic limitation | Communities | Conservation | Ecophysiology | Geographical and altitudinal distribution | Germination | Hemiparasite | Herbivory | Parasites and diseases | Reproductive biology | Soils,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,74,NA,NA

A test in a neotropical forest,Norden N.,Journal of Ecology,00220477,13652745,95,3,507-516,2007-05-01,May 2007,10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01221.x,"Both spatial and temporal processes are assumed to play an important role in driving seedling dynamics. We assessed the magnitude of these two processes in a neotropical forest in French Guiana. We first quantified temporal changes in seedling community structure, then evaluated the relative importance of environmental heterogeneity and temporal fluctuations in seed arrival in determining seedling dynamics. We monitored the seedling dynamics of 6244 seedlings by censusing 370 1-m2 seedling plots in 160 stations over 20 months. At each station, we quantified environmental variability (light availability, soil resources, litter depth, topography), and measured temporal fluctuations in seed input by sampling seed arrival into seed traps located in each station. Temporal changes in seedling density and diversity between four consecutive censuses were compared with those predicted by a neutral model assuming randomrecruitment and mortality. Seedling density fluctuations were considerably more variable over time than expected under the neutral assumption. Diversity changes showed less consistent results. For the two first census intervals, seedling diversity was more constant than under the neutral expectations. For the last census interval, seedling diversity was more variable than expected under neutrality. Seedling recruitment, mortality and diversity of recruits were modelled against environmental variables and seed arrival. Sites with higher light availability and soil fertility had more diverse recruits (P < 0.01) but lower seedling survival (P < 0.05). Both density and diversity of local seed arrival had a positive effect, respectively, on density and diversity of recruited seedlings (P < 0.05). Our results show that temporal pulses in seedling community are mainly driven by large temporal fluctuations in seedling recruitment. Annual variation in seedfall and environmental filtering both contribute to explaining spatio-temporal variation in seedling dynamics to a large degree. Irrespective of species identity, tropical seedling communities are both seed- and establishment-limited. The temporal component of seed-limitation appears to be of critical relevance in the structuring of tropical seedling communities. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 British Ecological Society.",56,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Environmental heterogeneity | French Guiana | Recruitment fluctuations | Seed arrival | Seedling diversity | Seedling dynamics | Temporal fluctuations,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,75,NA,NA

The effects of density on any ecological process (e.g. competition, herbivory, mortality) may therefore be scale-specific, and different processes may respond to density at different spatial scales. A field experiment was set up in which focal Silene latifolia plants were subjected to a range of densities at each of four spatial scales (squares with sides of 16 cm, 80 cm, 4 m and 20 m); data were collected on growth, herbivory, flowering and survival. The Akaike information criterion was used to determine which scale displayed the strongest relationship between density and each response variable. The variables showed peak responses to density at different scales and with various relationships (positive, negative and non-monotonic). Some (e.g. herbivory by mammals) showed contrasting responses at different scales. Growth rate showed surprisingly little response to conspecific density, presumably owing to balancing effects of intra-specific and inter-specific competition from the surrounding vegetation. However, 25% of variation in first-year survival was explained by a model including a positive effect of density at the 80-cm scale. Herbivory was mainly due to slugs and showed negative responses to density at the 4-m and 20-m scales, in accordance with hypotheses about resource limitation, mobility and spatial scaling. Mammal herbivory responded with contrasting patterns at the 80-cm and 20-m scales. Congruence between the responses of herbivory and survival suggest that herbivory was an important cause of mortality. Plant population patterns may thus reflect density effects interacting at different characteristic scales.

Natural gradients provide an ideal opportunity to test this hypothesis. In a coastal dune system in northern California, we used comparative and experimental studies to evaluate how a wind and soil texture gradient influences the relative abundance of native and exotic plant species in this community. We detected small-scale spatial variation in soil texture along a 200-m gradient from relatively sheltered to more exposed. Sand coarseness significantly increased with exposure while soil nitrate levels significantly decreased. The more extreme end of the gradient was also subject to greater wind speeds and less soil moisture. The plant community consistently responded to this gradient in the 7 years censused. Species richness decreased with exposure, cover of natives decreased and cover of exotics increased at the more extreme end of the gradient. A single-season wind-shelter experiment similarly shifted the balance between native and exotic species. Shelters decreased the relative density of exotic species and increased the relative density of natives regardless of position on the gradient. These comparative and manipulative findings both suggest that a single factor, wind, at least partially explains the success of exotic species in a coastal dune plant community.

We tested this prediction and further investigated whether clonal growth traits, which are found in adult plants but also affect regeneration, are correlated with seedling traits. We characterized seedling root systems by their total length, number of root tips and several architectural parameters (length of exterior and interior root links and two topological indices). These below-ground traits were supplemented by the ratio of leaf area to root length, representing relative investment into photosynthesizing surface. We compared seedling traits with clonal growth traits, adult plant heights, and species positions on gradients of nitrogen and water availability. Plant species with limited horizontal spread by clonal growth exhibited a larger relative investment in photosynthetic area and also developed larger root systems as seedlings. Seedlings of species with taller shoots and those which occur naturally at nutrientrich sites developed both larger roots and more dichotomously branched root systems (with higher total length and more branches). Taking phylogenetic inertia into account showed that this explained large parts of the variation in seedling traits. Relationships between clonal spread and seedling traits were strengthened by phylogenetic correction. Our study shows that some of the traits of clonal growth affect both the established and the regenerative stages of the life cycle, suggesting that an evolutionary trade-off exists between the ability to spread clonally and performance at the seedling stage. Species not able to escape from less favourable conditions by extensive clonal spread seem to be more able to exploit the location in which they germinate. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 British Ecological Society.",27,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Clonal growth | Ecological traits | Grassland plant species | Lateral spread | Leaf area: root length ratio | Phylogenetic correction | Regenerative stage of life cycle | Resource availability | Root architecture,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,78,NA,NA

This occurs as a plastic response to a patchy environment where two resources tend not to occur together and different ramets experience high availabilities of different resources. We hypothesized that if division of labour is an important advantage of clonal growth in such environments in nature, then clones from habitats where resource availabilities are negatively associated should show a greater capacity for division of labour than clones from habitats where resource availabilities are more uniform. To test this, we collected clones of Fragaria chiloensis from sand dune and grassland sites in each of three regions of the central coast of California, grew pairs of connected or severed ramets under low light and high N or under high light and low N, and measured leaf area, chlorophyll content and final dry mass. Given that previous work has indicated that high availabilities of light and N show a stronger tendency not to occur together in the dune than in the grassland sites, we expected that clones from dunes would show greater capacity for division of labour than clones from grasslands. Clones from dunes showed a greater capacity than clones from grasslands to specialize for acquisition of abundant N via high proportional mass of roots. Clones from the two types of habitats showed similar capacity to specialize for acquisition of abundant light via high leaf area and chlorophyll content of leaves. Specialization via leaf area and chlorophyll content took place mainly within the first half of the 60-day experiment. These results provide evidence that division of labour in a clonal plant has been selected for in natural habitats where high levels of different resources tend to be spatially separated. Results also show that division of labour can occur, not just via allocation of mass, but also via physiological traits, and that both morphological and physiological specialization can take place within a few weeks. Clonal plants dominate many habitats and include many highly invasive species. Division of labour is one of the most striking potential advantages of clonal growth, and is a remarkable instance of phenotypic plasticity in plants. This study further suggests that division of labour in clonal plants is an instance of adaptive plasticity and could therefore play a part in their widespread ecological success. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 British Ecological Society.",95,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Adaptive plasticity | Allocation to root and shoot | Chlorophyll content | Clonal growth | Division of labour | Environmental heterogeneity | Fragaria chiloensis | Grassland | Physiological integration | Sand dune,29602,UC6-AI058607,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,79,NIH,National Institutes of Health

Unifying previous works, we present a statistical framework to quantify thephylogenetic structure of communities in terms of average divergence time between pairs of individuals or species, sampled from different sites. This framework allows an additive partitioning of the phylogenetic signal into alpha (within-site) and beta (among-site) components, and is closely linked to Simpson diversity. It unifies the treatment of intraspecific (genetic) and interspecific diversity, leading to the definition of differentiation coefficients among community samples (e.g. IST, PST) analogous to classical population genetics coefficients expressing differentiation among populations (e.g. FST, NST). Two coefficients which express community differentiation among sites from species identity (IST) or species phylogeny (PST) require abundance data (number of individuals per species per site), and estimators that are unbiased with respect to sample size are given. Another coefficient (ΠST) expresses the gain of the mean phylogenetic distance between species found in different sites compared with species found within sites, and requires only incidence data (presence/absence of each species in each site). We present tests based on phylogenetic tree randomizations to detect community phylogenetic clustering (PST > IST or ΠST > 0) or phylogenetic overdispersion (PST < IST or ΠST < 0). In addition, we propose a novel approach to detect phylogenetic clustering or overdispersion in different clades or at different evolutionary time depths using partial randomizations. IST, P ST or ΠST can also be used as distances between community samples and regressed on ecological or geographical distances, allowing us to investigate the factors responsible for the phylogenetic signal and the critical scales at which it appears. We illustrate the approach on forest tree communities in Equatorial Guinea, where a phylogenetic clustering signal was probably due to phylogenetically conserved adaptations to the elevation gradient and was mostly contributed to by ancient clade subdivisions. The approach presented should find applications for comparing quantitatively phylogenetic patterns of different communities, of similar communities in different regions or continents, or of populations (within species) vs. communities (among species). © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 British Ecological Society.",204,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Additive partitioning of diversity | Community ecology | Equatorial Guinea | Neutral community | Phylogenetic structure of communities | Phylogeny | Rain forest | Randomization test | Species assemblage | Tropical trees,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,80,NA,NA

Although species richness response to land-use change in rural landscapes is relatively well studied, few have examined its effects on plant species composition over time. In this study, four life-history traits associated with spatiotemporal dispersal were analysed: seed size, seed dispersal attributes (e.g. awns, wings), seed bank persistence and plant longevity (annuals, perennial with and without clonal ability). I investigated how differences in distribution of these traits among plants in semi-natural grasslands are related to current and historical landscape configuration. The distributions of two out of the four investigated traits, longevity and seed bank persistence, were correlated with grassland connectivity and area, whereas seed size and seed dispersal attributes were not. The proportion of short-lived plants was positively associated with current grassland connectivity and grassland area, whereas long-lived species, with and without clonal ability, were unrelated to current grassland connectivity and area. In contrast, short-lived plants were not affected by historical grassland connectivity, but the proportion of long-lived clonal plants was negatively associated with high historical grassland connectivity and large grassland area. In addition, the proportion of species with long persistence in the seed bank was negatively associated with historical grassland connectivity. The result suggests that there are two main strategies to persist in response to landscape fragmentation: either persist in the seed bank or disperse vegetatively. The higher sensitivity to isolation among short-lived plants and plants without clonal ability calls attention to the importance of considering life-history traits to understand plant community dynamics fully over time. In the long term, reduction in historical connectivity and grassland area will thus create a grassland community dominated by clonal longlived plants and plants with a persistent seed bank. This study shows that both spatial and temporal effects of landscape configuration are important factors structuring local plant species composition in grasslands. The results bring important insights to our understanding of large-scale ecological processes, and are also highly relevant to biodiversity conservation in fragmented agricultural landscapes worldwide. © 2007 The Author Journal compilation © 2007 British Ecological Society.",102,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Clonality | Conservation | Dispersal | Diversity | Fragmentation | Land use | Longevity | Plant traits | Seed bank | Seed size,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,81,NA,NA

Field and herbarium surveys were thus used to determine if two pathogens (a smut and a rust) and a pre-dispersal seed predator were less common at the western range limit of the forest sedge Carex blanda in Kansas, USA. Host plant size, reproduction and density did not decline at the western border of the range. In fact, plants at two western sites had unusually large size and seed production. Host populations at the edge of the range were more likely to be disease-free or lack the pre-dispersal seed predator. Where the smut, seed predator and rust were found, the proportion of infected or infested plants was not related to longitude, latitude or percentage forest cover. More of the peripheral populations lacked the smut than the rust, as expected given the more localized nature of smut spore dispersal and the limited period when smut infection can occur. In the adjacent, more highly forested state of Missouri, there were no geographical patterns in the incidence of the smut or seed predator in herbarium data. The smut and rust increased in frequency over the 129-year span of herbarium collections. Although field and herbarium distributional data were not identical (for example, smut infection was found much farther west in the field than in the herbarium data), the qualitative agreement between the two data sets suggests herbarium data can be used more broadly for studies of natural enemy distributions. Limited dispersal by pathogens and seed predators is probably the reason why small, isolated western populations were less likely to have natural enemies. Peripheral host populations may thus have different ecological and evolutionary trajectories compared with more central populations. This conclusion, as well as the considerable variation among peripheral populations, is relevant to geographical studies of co-evolution and to research on climatic effects on plants inhabiting ecotonal regions. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 British Ecological Society.",60,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Anthracoidea blanda | Biogeography | Central-marginal model | Ecotone | Host-pathogen interactions | Peripheral populations | Pre-dispersal seed predator | Puccinia | Rust | Smut,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,82,NA,NA

To determine whether such associations form at early life stages, we compared species' positive associations with five habitat types (high plateau, low plateau, slope, streamside, and swamp) at two life stages for 80 tree and shrub species in a Panamanian lowland forest. Nineteen significant, positive habitat associations were detected at the small tree stage (seedlings and saplings ≥ 20 cm tall and < 1 cm d.b.h.), and 18 at the large tree stage (individuals ≥ 1 cm d.b.h.), according to results of torus-translation randomization tests. The majority of species did not show consistent associations at the two stages. Of the 30 species significantly associated with a habitat, only five were associated with the same habitat at both stages. Overall, more species were associated with the wetter slope habitat at the large tree stage compared with the small tree stage. For a subset of species, we examined the relationship between observed habitat associations and seed dispersal and seedling establishment patterns by using speciesspecific seed dispersal kernels to predict seed rain into each habitat. Two-thirds of species associated with a habitat at the large tree stage had higher predicted seed densities in the associated habitat relative to other habitat types, indicating that limited seed dispersal acts to reinforce habitat associations for most species. In contrast, only one-third of the species associated with a habitat at the large tree stage showed evidence of higher seedling establishment rates in the associated habitat compared with other habitats, and an equal number of species appeared to have lower rates of establishment in the habitat that large trees of the species were associated with. Overall, our results indicate that habitat associations of large trees typically do not form at early life stages. Rather, many species appear to exhibit different ecological habitat preferences across life stages.

The objective of this study was to determine if a major canopy disturbance, resulting from an ice storm, would favour the coexistence of sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and beech (Fagus grandifolia) in an old-growth forest located near the northern limit of the species' range. The growth, density and frequency of occurrence of understorey stems were evaluated 7 years after the ice storm and compared with pre-disturbance values to determine if sugar maple, a slightly less shade-tolerant species, would be favoured over beech. Although height and radial growth increased three- to five-fold, and > 70% of the 5-10 cm d.b.h. stems showed a release, sugar maple did not benefit more from the opening of the canopy than beech. The inability of sugar maple to outgrow beech might be related to the high proportion of beech root sprouts at our site, suggesting that the potential for the disturbancemediated mechanism to slow the competitive exclusion of maple might decrease as the importance of vegetative reproduction increases in beech. Prior to the disturbance, sugar maple was more abundant and occurred in a larger proportion of the plots among small size classes, while beech dominated in the larger size classes. Although some increases in the density of both species were detected after the disturbance, the general trends of relative abundance and distribution of the species were not modified significantly. Our results do not indicate that a single canopy disturbance such as the major 1998 ice storm significantly favoured sugar maple over beech. When a disturbance opens the canopy, competition for light in gaps may tend to maintain or reinforce a pre-existing hierarchy instead of reversing it, especially when interspecific differences in postdisturbance growth are small or absent, as in this study. This study shows that the dynamics of sugar maple - beech communities are more complex than previously envisaged and that revised models should incorporate additional factors (e.g. vegetative reproduction) that might also play an important role in regulating community dynamics. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 British Ecological Society.",47,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Advance regeneration | Disturbance-mediated coexistence | Gap dynamics | Ice storm | Root sprouts | Vegetative reproduction,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,84,NA,NA

Marine plants (seaweeds) are exposed to a considerable grazing pressure by herbivores ranging from large, mobile fishes and sea urchins to small, sedentary crustaceans and molluscs. The number of investigations studying induced resistance in seaweeds has increased during the last decade, but empirical results are conflicting. We performed a categorical meta-analysis to evaluate statistically the overall seaweed responses to damage or damage-related cues, and factors that may explain the observed variation in inducible seaweed resistance to herbivores. We found a highly significant overall effect of damage on induced seaweed resistance to further herbivory. Division of the studies into different categories showed that brown and green, but not red, seaweeds induce significant resistance to further grazing in response to grazing by small crustaceans and gastropods, but not in response to large gastropods and sea urchins. The seaweeds showed stronger responses when exposed to damage for 11-20 days than in shorter or longer experiments. Seaweeds are very important both as habitat and food for a wide range of marine animals. Our findings contribute importantly to the general ecological understanding of marine plant-herbivore interactions by showing that induced resistance in seaweeds is more common than previously assumed. Many recent marine investigations included in this study have not put emphasis on the ecological relevance and underlying mechanisms of the investigated plant-herbivore interactions. We suggest that the scientific value of future investigations concerning induced defences in marine algae would benefit from formulating more advanced and/or complex hypotheses including the genetic and biochemical mechanisms, cost and constraints of damage-induced civilian and defensive seaweed responses, as well as the effects of these responses on herbivores and other organisms/trophic levels, and on community structure and functioning. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 British Ecological Society.",97,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Algae | Chemical defence | Consumption | Herbivore resistance | Induced response | Marine | Mesoherbivore | Meta-analysis | Plant-herbivore interaction | Seaweed,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,85,NA,NA

Utilizing a long-term experiment, where birch was planted on heather moorland 20 years ago, the cascading effects of a single tree species (Betula pubescens) on ecosystem characteristics (plant species richness, soil chemistry, soil fauna and decomposition rates) were tested. Under the birch, plant species richness decreased and the vegetation composition changed, with lower cover of grasses and Vaccinium myrtillus. The depth of the soil organic horizon, its moisture content and percentage carbon were all smaller under the birch than under the heather. Concentrations of available phosphorus and mineralizable-N were significantly greater in the soil under birch than under the heather plots. Decomposition was faster in the birch than in the heather plots. The abundance and species richness of collembola and oribatid, mesostigmatid and prostigmatid mites were all significantly greater under the birch than under the heather. The durability of the engineering effects of the birch was studied in a second experiment. Plots were established in first generation birch woodland that had developed on Calluna-dominanted moorland. The plots were cleared of birch and planted with heather. After 20 years soil chemical properties, microarthropod communities and decomposition rates were not significantly different between plots with and without the birch. However, the mass of the soil O-horizon was significantly greater in the felled birch plots than in the control birch plots, providing the first indication of a change towards soil properties more typical of a Calluna moorland. Thus for most of the birch engineering effects measured here their durability in the absence of the engineering species is at least 20 years. This work has provided experimental evidence that birch acts as a top-down engineer, driving cascading effects on both above- and below-ground communities, soil chemical and physical properties and ecosystem processes. The work also shows that the role of birch in driving changes in the ecosystem is durable 20 years after the removal of the birch. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 British Ecological Society.",40,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,Betula | Calluna moorland | Cascades | Collembola | Decomposition | Ecosystem engineer | Mites | Soil | Succession,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,86,NA,NA

At the same time, intensive grassland management or changes in land use may result in species extinction. As a consequence, plant diversity in semi-natural calcareous grasslands may be related to both historical and current human population density. We hypothesize that current vascular plant diversity in semi-natural calcareous grasslands is positively correlated with the Late Iron Age (c. 800-1000 years ago) density of human settlements (indicated by Late Iron Age fortresses and villages) due to enhancement of grassland extent and species dispersal, and negatively correlated with current human population density due to habitat loss and deterioration. We described the size of the community vascular plant species pool, species richness per 1 m2 and the relative richness (richness divided by the size of the species pool) in 45 thin soil, calcareous (alvar) grasslands in Estonia. In addition to historical and current human population density we considered simultaneously the effects of grassland area, connectivity to other alvar grasslands, elevation above sea level (indicating grassland age), soil pH, soil N, soil P, soil depth, soil depth heterogeneity, geographical east-west gradient, precipitation and spatial autocorrelation. Both the size of the community species pool and the species richness are significantly correlated with the Late Iron Age human population density. In addition, species richness was unimodally related to the current human population density. The relative richness (species 'packing density') was highest in the intermediate current human population densities, indicative of moderate land-use intensity. Community species pool size decreased non-linearly with increasing soil N, and was highest at intermediate elevation. Small-scale richness was greater when sites were well connected and when the elevation was intermediate. Spatial autocorrelation was also significant for both species pool size and small-scale richness.

The true nature of a resource allocation trade-off is detectable only if variation in the total amount of growth is accounted for. We controlled for this effect by measuring all of the components of annual growth associated with leaf production at the individual terminal shoot level. Hence, number of leaves produced was expressed as ""leafing intensity"", i.e. the number of leaves produced by newly emerged (current year's) shoots, divided by the total volume of these shoots. Ninety per cent (r2 = 0.90) of the variation in mean individual leaf mass across species, spanning two orders of magnitude, could be accounted for by proportional variation in mean leafing intensity, i.e. representing an isometric trade-off, with a slope for log-transformed data that did not deviate significantly from -1.0. We suggest that this isometric relationship may represent a generalized trade-off strategy for leaf deployment at the shoot level within temperate deciduous woody species. Following traditional interpretations, adaptation here may involve a fitness benefit associated with a particular leaf size. The present results also suggest an alternative, i.e. selection may instead favour high leafing intensity, with small leaf mass resulting not as a direct adaptation, but simply as a trade-off. According to this ""leafing intensity premium"" hypothesis, the fitness benefits of higher leafing intensity are associated primarily with the fitness benefits of a larger pool of lateral meristems, because each leaf is usually associated with an axillary bud. This may in turn provide greater facility for wide phenotypic plasticity in the allocation of these meristems to vegetative vs. reproductive functions. This represents a plausible hypothesis, we suggest, in accounting for why most woody deciduous angiosperms, even some of the largest/tallest ones, have relatively small leaves. © 2007 The Authors.",99,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Allometry | Bud bank | Isometry | Leafing intensity | Meristem allocation | Plasticity | Strategy,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,89,NA,NA

This disease causes lethal stem infections in oaks (Quercus spp.) and tanoak (Lithocarpus densiflorus), as well as non-lethal foliar infections in a range of other species. We investigated two questions to evaluate the effect of landscape structure on the spread of P. ramorum: (i) does the spatial pattern of forested habitat predict P. ramorum disease severity, and is this relationship scale-dependent; and (ii) what influence does spatial pattern have on the optimal microclimate conditions for P. ramorum reproduction? We mapped the spatial distribution of suitable forest habitat for P. ramorum and established 86 randomly located field plots within a 20-km2 region of northern California. For each plot, we quantified P. ramorum disease severity and measured the abundance of woody species. Disease severity in each plot was examined in relation to the surrounding landscape structure measured for nested landscapes of increasing scale. P. ramorum disease severity was greatest in plots surrounded by a high proportion of contiguous forest, after accounting for plot-level variables of host abundance, elevation, canopy cover and microclimate. The explanatory power of the model increased with increasing scale up to 200 m, but was not significant at scales less than 50 m. High disease severity was associated with lower temperatures in the field than the laboratory-determined optimal range for pathogen reproduction. Variation in microclimate conditions was explained by elevation, not the pattern of host vegetation, indicating that spatially varying disease severity was not a function of microclimate-related edge effects on pathogen growth and survival. Both landscape-scale configuration and local composition of host habitat are related to the severity of this destructive forest disease. Increased disease severity within contiguous woodlands may have a considerable impact on the composition of such woodlands, with cascading effects on the population dynamics of both host and pathogen. © 2007 The Authors.",85,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Connectivity | Emerging infectious disease | Fragmentation | Invasive species | Landscape pathology | Phytophthora ramorum | Sudden oak death,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,90,NA,NA

Resource reduction, as summarized in R*, is readily observed. Soil concentrations of nitrate and water are decreased by plant uptake, and are lowered to different levels by different species. Tests have shown R* theory to correctly predict competitive outcomes for a variety of organisms and ecosystems. Consumer-resource mechanisms are a building block for theories that incorporate other trade-offs faced by plants, such as those between competitive ability and dispersal. Numerous plant traits interactively determine R* in a manner predictable from trait-based resource competition theory. The same traits shown by comparative research to be associated with plant dominance in low-nutrient habitats give lower R* values, greater predicted competitive ability and greater predicted abundances in nutrientlimited habitats.

Grime fails to adequately address three of these concerns. Regarding the other concerns, it is clear that the concept of relative importance needs to be developed further. For example, if both competition and the stress of low nutrient supplies can remove species from a given environment, then neither can be elevated over the other without being tautological. With regards to Tilman's response, it is clear that it will be important to be explicit about the relationship between data and models. At times, Tilman is neither evaluating individual models with a Popperian approach nor comparing contrasting models in a Bayesian fashion. As it stands, it is unclear what is required for Tilman to reject R* as the mechanism of competition, or whether it passes some undetermined threshold of acceptability. Comparing concentration reduction to supply pre-emption as the mechanism of competition recommends supply pre-emption on many fronts. Supply pre-emption better represents the movement of nutrients in soil solution. Assuming well-mixed soil solutions can theoretically lead to improper prediction of competitive outcomes. Empirically, there are examples where R* does not predict outcomes for competition for nutrients, and supply pre-emption appears to generate metrics (root length density) that are equivalent if not better than concentration reduction (R*) at explaining these outcomes. The next plant strategies paradigm will not be a result of choosing either Grime's or Tilman's theories, but represent a synthesis of the two sets of theories while also incorporating novel concepts and research. I agree with Tilman that more research is needed in understanding mechanisms of coexistence, but there still remains large gaps in our understanding of plant traits and growth that limit our understanding of competition for nutrients and will likely constrain our understanding of coexistence even more. © 2007 The Authors.",20,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Community assembly | Competition | Light | Nutrients | Plant strategies,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,92,NA,NA

Sonoran Desert winter annuals exhibit striking year-to-year variation in population dynamics that is driven by variable precipitation, but species differ in the strength of demographic response to precipitation and hence in the degree of temporal variance in population dynamics. To understand the physiological mechanisms of differing population dynamic responses to environmental variation, we investigated interspecific differences in functional traits that mediate responsiveness to precipitation. We conducted sequential harvests throughout the growing season to examine relative growth rate and biomass allocation patterns. We then related growth parameters to leaflevel carbon isotope discrimination (a time-integrated measure of water-use efficiency) and long-term demographic variation. We hypothesized that water-use efficiency should trade-off with rapid growth rates. Furthermore, we hypothesized that species having efficient water use should have buffered population dynamics in dry years but sacrifice high growth and fecundity in wet years, resulting in low long-term variance in demographic success. Conversely, species with high growth capacity should be very responsive to infrequent periods of high precipitation and thus exhibit high temporal variance. Species differed in seasonal relative growth rate and allocation patterns. Species with the highest relative growth rates rapidly deployed large leaf area displays following mid-season rainfall. Species with intermediate relative growth rates exhibited high biomass assimilation rates per unit leaf area. Species with low relative growth rates exhibited low leaf area ratios and low assimilation rates per unit leaf area. Relative growth rate was positively related to leaf carbon isotope discrimination, consistent with a trade-off between growth rate and water-use efficiency. Seasonal relative growth rate did not predict long-term demographic variance. However, leaf area plasticity in response to precipitation was positively related to longterm demographic variance.

Moreover, when biomass varies systematically along productivity and other environmental gradients, common indices of competitive outcome mask important ecological interactions. This study presents two indices derived from how neighbours interact with target plants. The first, relative crowding, increases directly with the abundance of neighbours present and decreases inversely with the potential size and vigour of the target plant itself. The second, interaction strength, is the integral of suppression of the target by neighbours over the range of neighbour abundance. Relative crowding and interaction strength are derived independently, but when multiplied produce the commonly used relative competitive index, showing the biological underpinnings of the relative competition index in terms of crowding and strength of interaction. Since the new indices of relative crowding and interaction strength explicitly account for the amount of neighbour biomass, they serve as a valid method to track the effects of changing habitat conditions on the components of competition. The new indices are applied to three published data sets. In each case, relative crowding increased with standing crop. In one case competition was reported as unchanged along a productivity gradient, whereas the new indices show that relative crowding and interaction strength both had significant patterns, but their effects were counteracting. These results do not fit current theories of competition. Further empirical studies are needed to see if competition theory needs revision.

We present the first experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis, using seven woody neotropical species. We transplanted seedlings that had recently expanded their first photosynthetic cotyledon or leaf to the forest understorey (1% of full sun) and quantified initial biomass and total non-structural carbohydrate (TNC) in stems, roots and storage cotyledons. We then randomly assigned seedlings to control and two stress treatments: light reduction (0.08% of full sun for 8 weeks) and complete defoliation. First-year survival of control seedlings, a comparative measure of shade tolerance, differed widely among species. The two stress treatments reduced survival and relative growth rates (RGR) of all species. Shade-tolerant species were little impacted by the stress treatments, whereas the two least shade-tolerant species experienced 100% mortality. In all treatments, 8-week and first-year survival was positively correlated with initial TNC pool size in stems and roots. By contrast, survival was generally not correlated with initial TNC concentration in any organ, TNC pools in cotyledons, seed mass or seedling biomass. TNC in stems and roots, but not in cotyledons, decreased in response to light reduction and defoliation over 8 weeks. Leaf area recovery of defoliated seedlings was positively correlated with initial TNC pools in stems and roots. First-year survival in each treatment was negatively correlated with 0-8 week RGR of control seedlings, suggesting higher stress tolerance of species with inherently slow growth rates in shade. RGR of control seedlings from 0 to 8 weeks was negatively correlated with initial TNC pools, but not concentrations, in stems and roots. After 8 weeks, RGR was positive for all species, without clear relationships with survival or TNC. We conclude that carbohydrate storage in stems and roots enhances long-term survival in shade by enabling seedlings to cope with periods of biotic and abiotic stress.

However, experiments on this phenomenon have manipulated not only the presence/absence of neighbours, but also substrate volume. Restricted substrate volume can itself affect plant growth, possibly through chemical self-inhibition of root growth. We conducted an experiment with oats (Avena sativa) to examine whether the experimental design used in previous studies on the tragedy of the commons in root competition might have confounded the effects of detection of neighbours and substrate volume. Six treatments combined two factors, namely the presence or absence of activated carbon, and either the presence of a plastic or a mesh partition, or the absence of a partition, between two plants in a pot. Activated carbon was used to adsorb root exudates and reduce their potential effects on root growth. In a seventh treatment, plants were grown alone in pots with half the substrate volume replaced by gravel, to fragment the distribution of available resources. We observed no tragedy of the commons in a comparison of the performance of plants grown with and without partitions; plants performed equally well in the presence and absence of root competition. In the treatment with gravel, plants displayed reduced tillering and shoot growth per unit root mass, and an earlier switch to reproduction. Pot partitioning was associated with inhibition of root growth that was mediated by root exudates. When activated carbon was present, plants in partitioned pots performed better than plants growing with a root competitor. We conclude that two processes could determine plant growth in the experimental design used in studies of the tragedy of the commons: (i) greater root self-inhibition in the more limited space of partitioned pots, and (ii) inefficient root placement in larger substrate volumes in unpartitioned pots that are shared with roots of a competitor.

Differences observed between aspects were due primarily to the differential presence of permafrost. Additional variability among sites was related to slope and vegetation type. Results were less conclusive for willow, but evidence for an advance was found at two sites. Increases in stand density were strongly correlated with summer temperatures. The period of rapid change coincided with a 30-year period of above average temperatures, beginning in 1920. The highest correlations were obtained using a forward average of 30-50 years, supporting the hypothesis that tree line dynamics are controlled more by conditions influencing recruitment than by establishment alone. The changes observed at several sites are suggestive of a threshold response and challenge the notion that tree lines respond gradually to climate warming. Overall, the results provide further evidence to support the idea that the pattern and timing of change is contingent on local, landscape, and regional-scale factors, as well as species' biology. © 2007 The Authors.",252,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Climate change | Dendroecology | Ecotones | Forest-tundra | Non-linearity | Picea glauca | Salix glauca | Stand dynamics | Timberline | Yukon,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,98,NA,NA

Lowered red to far-red ratio (R : FR), a cue of above-ground competition, is known to cause increased stem elongation and decreased allocation to roots. In nature, however, cues for above- and below-ground competition are likely to be experienced simultaneously, and may elicit contradictory responses. We investigated whether the presence of the above-ground competition cue (low R : FR) affected the responses to the below-ground competition cue (presence of neighbouring roots) in soybean and whether these responses depended on the presence or absence of symbiotic bacteria or on the availability of nutrients. In a fully factorial study in a growth room, light quality, root neighbours, nutrient availability and Bradyrhizobium inoculation were manipulated. Stem elongation and biomass allocation were measured. As predicted, plants allocated more to roots in the presence of root neighbours, regardless of R : FR, Bradyrhizobium and nutrient treatment. Plants elongated under low R : FR, although the degree of elongation was affected by Bradyrhizobium and nutrients. R : FR did not affect allocation to roots. Surprisingly, we found no reduction in reproductive allocation and therefore no 'tragedy of the commons' cost; instead, growth was increased in the presence of root neighbours. We conclude that soybean responds to both competition cues independently, but that below-ground resources such as Bradyrhizobium and nutrient availability moderate the morphological responses to above- and below-ground competition. To our knowledge, this is the first study that tests responses to above- and belowground competition cues simultaneously and that shows the independence of these responses. This study provides supporting evidence that plants can sense neighbouring roots as a cue of impending competition and demonstrates clearly that the root allocation response is not dependent on the presence of Bradyrhizobium or an artefact of inadvertent R : FR manipulation. © 2007 The Authors.",56,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Above-ground competition cue | Below-ground competition cue | Glycine max | Phenotypic plasticity | R: FR | Root proliferation | Stem elongation | Tragedy of the commons,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,99,NA,NA

Moreover, there is a lack of long-term, quantitative data on the rates of spread of populations. We report the results of a cross-range-edge transplant experiment established in 1960 with the perennial forest herb Hyacinthoides non-scripta. We evaluated determinants of survival/extinction, performance and migration distances and patterns of 27 transplanted populations after a period of 45 growing seasons. Of 27 experimental populations of Hyacinthoides non-scripta implanted in 1960, 11 (41%) were still found in 2005-06. Population survival was independent of soil type and changes in the vegetation layer. In contrast, physical disturbance of the soil and major changes in the tree layer as a result of forest management were the main determinants of population extinction. Current population surface areas ranged from 0.23 to 26.23 m2. Plant height, leaf length, number of flowers and seed size were generally lower in the introduced populations than in the source populations. However, densities and proportions of non-flowering adults were higher, especially in the larger populations. This suggests that these populations are still expanding with more but younger, and thus smaller, individuals. Observed migration rates were very low, ranging from 0.006 my -1 to 0.06 my-1. Migration occurred by the establishment of isolated individuals, which were later absorbed by the advancing wave of the main population. The spread projected for the largest population in the next 45 years is only 14 m for the main population front and 42 m for the furthest individual. Our results may be representative of population spread for slow dispersing forest plant species after occasional long-distance dispersal events across a range edge.

Very little is known about differences in individual performance and population dynamics across habitats. We analysed habitat-specific performance and demography of Scaphium borneense, a tropical rain forest tree with strong habitat preference in a 52-ha plot at Lambir Hills, Malaysia. This species occurs at high densities on ridges with sandy soils ('preferred habitat'), at low densities in valleys on loamy soils ('non-preferred habitat') and at intermediate densities on slopes. We used 10-year demographic data to compare tree performance across habitats and constructed population matrix models to analyse population dynamics. Tree performance was rather similar across habitats. Some vital rates (mortality) did not differ among habitats, while others were modestly (juvenile tree growth) to substantially higher (recruitment) in the non-preferred valley habitat, probably due to higher canopy openness. Matrix models projected population sizes to remain stable in all habitats, thus maintaining abundance differences across habitats. This suggests that habitat preference of Scaphium is generated by (a)biotic differences among habitats and not by chance processes or disturbance history. Population dynamics were also very similar among habitats. The distribution of elasticity values over categories and vital rates was almost equal for the three habitats. Life table response experiment (LTRE) analysis showed that habitat differences in vital rates had little effect on λ. Thus, Scaphium populations in the three habitats are maintained in a very similar way, despite differences in (a)biotic conditions and abundance. We hypothesize that habitat preference of Scaphium is maintained because of a better performance in its preferred habitat relative to other species in that habitat, while the reverse may be true in non-preferred habitats. We suggest that such differences in performance may become apparent during periods of drought, creating windows of opportunity for maintaining density differences. Strong habitat preference of rain forest tree species does not necessarily imply strong differences in tree performance, demography or population growth across habitats. The mechanisms that generate density differences across habitats remain to be unravelled. © 2007 The Authors.",48,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,Elasticity | Habitat preference | Life table response experiments | Matrix analysis | Niche differentiation | Population dynamics | Population growth rate | Scaphium borneense | Tropical rain forest,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,101,NA,NA

The degraded soils are the outcome of intensive destructive foraging by geese, which results in vegetation loss and near-irreversible changes in soil properties. The objective of the study was to determine whether vegetation loss led to a decline in microbial activity and a redistribution of N amongst the different soil N pools that potentially could adversely affect plant regrowth. In situ N allocation between plants, microbes and soil was determined based on injection of 15NH4Cl into soil cores; changes in isotopic ratios and N concentrations in the different pools were measured after 24 h. Degraded soils, in contrast to vegetated soils, were characterized by a decline in microbial biomass, reduced microbial 15N excess, reduced rates of gross N immobilization and an increased microbial residency time of 15N. In vegetated soils, both microbes and the forage grass, Puccinellia phryganodes, accumulated 15N such that little remained in the soil abiotic phase after 24 h, unlike in degraded soils. The decline in microbial activity in degraded soils may be linked to a low availability of soil carbon in the absence of plants and to deteriorating abiotic conditions, including the occurrence of hypersalinity in summer. Not all biotic processes respond similarly to the change in ecosystem state. Unlike vascular plant productivity and goose foraging which are absent in degraded soils, soil microbial activity is maintained, albeit at a lower level. In spite of this activity, the greater proportion of 15N in degraded soils is in the abiotic pool rather than in microbial biomass with an increased potential for soil N loss from leaching and soil erosion. Disturbance linked to herbivory often triggers catastrophic shifts in ecosystem properties resulting in vegetation loss and changes in soil biogeochemical cycling that are irreversible, at least on a decadal time scale, and lead to the loss of N and other nutrients required for plant growth. These results clearly illustrate that microbial activity does not compensate for the effects of plant removal on soil N retention. © 2007 The Authors.",41,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,15 N allocation | Gross nitrogen mineralization | Isotope dilution assay | Microbial biomass | Puccinellia phryganodes,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,102,NA,NA

We investigated how root competition by an invasive tree, Cinnamomum verum, affects regeneration in nutrient-poor tropical secondary forests, in the Seychelles. We performed three trenching experiments to investigate the effects of severing the root systems of mature trees on the growth of juveniles. These experiments had the following objectives: (i) to compare the responses of native and invasive saplings to release from root competition; (ii) to compare how seedlings (< 50 cm tall) and saplings (> 50 cm tall) of C. verum respond to trenching; and (iii) to compare the response of C. verum seedlings to trenching in forest stands with and without C. verum as the dominant species. The results indicate that the dense topsoil root mat produced by mature C. verum trees suppresses the growth of young trees, mainly by increasing competition for scarce nutrients. Growth responses to trenching were stronger for seedlings than saplings, and stronger for juveniles of invasive than of native species. We conclude that stands of C. verum exert a strong below-ground filtering effect on seedling regeneration. This effect is likely to influence secondary forest succession by selectively reducing the establishment of invasive and small-seeded species. Because of the bias in invasion biology towards relatively nutrient-rich, productive ecosystems, few studies have investigated the role of below-ground resource competition in plant invasions. Our results for an infertile, phosphorus-poor ecosystem show that root competition by an alien species can exert a strong influence on forest regeneration.

This so-called self/non-self discrimination has been suggested as a mechanism by which plants may prevent wasteful competition with their own roots and enhance their competitive ability for nutrients with roots of neighbouring plants. The overproduction of root biomass is said to result in a 'tragedy of the commons', because it appears to occur at the expense of reproductive biomass. Studies on self/non-self root discrimination have commonly used a split-root design to distinguish self from non-self competition, while keeping the total amount of nutrients available per plant the same. This design has recently been criticized because the rooting volume differs between treatments. Here, we use three general hypotheses to explain the published results without invoking the mechanism of self/non-self discrimination. The hypotheses propose that differences in root mass are due to differences in rooting volume, and differences in nutrient availability determine whole plant growth. More root mass without more growth results in less reproductive biomass. A reanalysis of the results of root self/non-self discrimination confirms these hypotheses. Root overproduction in the presence of another plant, as found in nearly all studies, is consistent with effects of a larger soil volume available to these plants as compared with plants growing alone. Under the same total nutrient availability, total plant weight was the same or higher when more roots were produced. Inevitably, a larger root production with the same total biomass implies that less reproductive biomass is produced. Although our analysis can explain most of the results of the split-root experiments, we cannot rule out the possibility that self/non-self root discrimination did take place. We discuss a limited set of experiments for which volume effects cannot explain the results, suggesting, in fact, that direct self/non-self root interactions have operated. We suggest experimental designs that can demonstrate their ecological significance in the future. We conclude that there is ample evidence that plants can sense the volume of available rooting space, and a limited number of studies on individual roots show that plant roots may sense the identity of neighbouring roots and respond accordingly. The significance of these responses for whole plant growth and reproduction in relation to well-known resource competition effects is yet largely unknown and in urgent need of further study. © 2007 The Authors.",122,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Allocation | Competition | Nutrients | Root growth | Root recognition | Rooting volume | Roots | Self/non-self discrimination | Split-root design,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,104,JSPS,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science

We examined the influence of herbaceous competition and water and nitrogen limitations on tree seedling establishment as functions of distance from trees (within-site spatial context) and site history (between-site spatial context; as old-fields vs. savanna openings). We grew Quercus ellipsoidalis E.J. Hill (pin oak) and Q. macrocarpa Michx. (bur oak) seedlings for 3 years in abandoned agricultural fields and savannas in central Minnesota, USA, near and distant from adult oak trees, with and without water and nitrogen resource additions, and with and without clipping of herbaceous vegetation (reducing above-ground competition). The strongest treatment effects were found in response to distance from trees and clipping herbaceous vegetation. Ectomycorrhizal infection, year 1 foliar N concentrations, and survival were greater in seedlings growing near vs. distant from adult trees, while clipping herbaceous vegetation increased above-ground seedling biomass but reduced seedling heights, regardless of distance from adult trees. There were conflicting effects of resource addition, which were dependent on clipping of herbaceous vegetation and site (savanna vs. old-field). Distance from adult trees and clipping herbaceous vegetation appear to have largely independent effects. Thus, while being near trees benefits seedlings, probably via increased mycorrhizal infection, competition from herbaceous vegetation limits seedlings regardless of distance from trees. In contrast, the effects of resource addition were more context dependent, interacting significantly with herbaceous context and site. The factors influencing seedling success can perhaps be best conceptualized as a series of largely independent environmental filters: seedlings near trees have increased mycorrhizal infection, nutrient uptake and survival, but face competition from herbaceous vegetation regardless of distance from trees. The slow encroachment of woody vegetation into old-fields and savanna openings in this region is likely to be the result of the net cumulative effect of such filters. © 2007 The Authors.",59,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Competition | Facilitation | Forest dynamics | Herbaceous vegetation | Mycorrhiza | Nitrogen | Succession | Water,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,105,NA,NA

Surprisingly, most statistical methods devoted to this have remained poorly interconnected, as well as poorly connected with the popular metrics of diversity estimation. In the present paper we show that important questions related to determinants of species diversity can be specified through a simple multivariate linear model and explored, in common diversity metrics, using standard methods and routines of variance/covariance decomposition. Thanks to an unusual form of presentation of taxonomic data into a table of species occurrences, which considers the individuals as data units, Shannon and Simpson indices as well as species richness can all be expressed as a (weighted) sum of squares. Subsequent apportionments into explained and residual sum of squares provide direct estimates of the beta- and alpha-diversity components with respect to either categorical habitat types or continuous gradient variables. Appropriate statistics and non-parametric tests are available to assess the significance of these components. Explicit analytical relationships exist between the linear approximation of the table of species occurrences by sampling sites, and the more classical table of species abundances by sites. Therefore, direct links with methods of ordination in reduced space, such as correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis, provide opportunities for partitions that preserve consistency with usual diversity indices. The sum of squares of the approximated occurrence table provides measures of intersites beta-diversity, from which measures of dissimilarity with explicit references to diversity indices can be derived. Such measures are amenable to distance-based apportionments through multivariate variograms and multiscale ordination. What are the relative effects of the biological, environmental and anthropogenic factors and of their potential interactions on species diversity? Are these effects stable across scales, from landscape to region, between regions and across ecosystems? The methodological integration proposed in our analytical framework enables one to address these questions using standard statistical tools, and opens new prospects for quantitative biodiversity studies.

A prominent idea in the literature on plant-herbivore interactions is that fast-growing species have low resistance but high resilience to herbivory. In other words, fast-growing species are selectively eaten by herbivores but recover quickly following damage. Many studies have challenged the generality of this theory, but little attention has been paid to plant species that have evolved in the absence of major groups of herbivores. Here we analyse whether this resistance-resilience trade-off applies to New Zealand woody species, which evolved without exposure to mammalian herbivores until their introduction in 19th century. 2. We simulated deer browse by clipping saplings of 12 tree species to varying extents (0, 20, 40, 80 and 100% of leaf-bearing branches removed), and quantified the shoot growth, diameter growth and survival of these saplings. The time taken to regrow the removed branches was generally slow, but varied among species. For example, species took between 0.5 and 3 years to recover from removal of 60% of branches. It was the inherently fast-growing species that recovered most quickly. Some species had stimulated shoot growth at moderate levels of clipping (40-60%) but this effect had relatively little effect on recovery time compared with differences in potential growth rates of species. 3. Diameter growth rate fell linearly with increased clipping intensity for all 12 species, and there was no indication of recovery 2 years after the treatment. We speculate that saplings invested in rebuilding their canopies following clipping, and that few resources were left over for diameter growth. 4. Few saplings died as a result of clipping, except when 100% of leaf-bearing shoots were removed, in which case five species died in substantial numbers (> 15%), including all three conifers in the study. 5. Previous work has shown that the most palatable species (i.e. those with low resistance) have leaves with low fibre content. We find that these species are relatively fast growing and recover most rapidly from simulated browsing (i.e. are highly resilient). This provides some support for a resistance-resilience trade-off related to potential growth rates. 6. Deer invasion in New Zealand was associated with the loss of short soft-leaved tree species from the browse layer. Our study suggests that the most palatable species have the potential to grow fast and may be in a relatively strong position to recover if deer are eradicated. © 2007 The Authors.",40,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Herbivory | Invasive species | Plant growth | Plant-herbivore interactions | Red deer | Simulated browsing,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,108,NA,NA

Such general predictions can have critical importance for worldwide food production and agricultural practice but are largely untested at higher levels of diversity. We propose new methodology for the design and analysis of experiments to quantify diversity-function relationships. Our methodology can quantify the relative strength of inter-specific interactions that contribute to a functional response, and can disentangle the separate contributions of species richness and relative abundance. Applying our methodology to data from a common experiment at 28 European sites, we show that the above-ground biomass of four-species mixtures (two legumes and two grasses) in intensive grassland systems was consistently greater than that expected from monoculture performance, even at high productivity levels. The magnitude of this effect generally resulted in transgressive overyielding. A combined analysis of first-year results across sites showed that the additional performance of mixtures was driven by the number and strength of pairwise inter-specific interactions and the evenness of the community. In general, all pairwise interactions contributed equally to the additional performance of mixtures; the grass-grass and legume-legume interactions were as strong as those between grasses and legumes. The combined analysis across geographical and temporal scales in our study provides a generality of interpretation of our results that would not have been possible from individual site analyses or experimentation at a single site.

The recruitment stage can be critical in determining plant population dynamics, as juveniles encounter a range of abiotic and biotic stressors in the environments where they land after dispersal, and often experience high mortality rates. Although both abiotic and biotic constraints on recruitment are often assumed to operate at multiple scales, these relationships are rarely quantified in ways that enable prediction of recruitment dynamics across environmental gradients. 2. In plants such as orchids, an important bottleneck on recruitment may arise from an obligate dependence on mycorrhizal fungi in order to reach photosynthetic stage. Very little is known, however, about the factors controlling the distribution of the fungi or how fungal distributions may constrain orchid recruitment and distributions. 3. In this study, seed introduction experiments were used to test for relationships between symbiotic germination success of an orchid, Goodyera pubescens, and both proximity to adult orchids and soil abiotic conditions. Experiments were linked to ongoing demographic monitoring across a large environmental gradient to place patterns of germination better in the context of longer-term demographic patterns. 4. A hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework was used to evaluate explicitly how recruitment varies across scales and how this variation is explained by key abiotic variables. This framework was further utilized to link hypothesis testing to model building, and thereby improve our ability to make predictions across a range of environmental conditions. 5. At a microsite scale (< 4 m2) strong evidence was found for decreasing germination success further from adult plants. At distances greater than 1 m from adults, increased germination success was associated with higher soil moisture, higher organic content and lower pH, although the strength of these relationships varied regionally. Patterns of symbiotic germination success were also highly correlated with observed recruitment patterns at the population level. 6. Explicitly linking plant recruitment to underlying abiotic gradients and key biotic interactions using a hierarchical, predictive modelling framework is essential for understanding basic plant population processes and building capacity to make predictions of how species and communities may respond to environmental changes. © 2006 The Author.",108,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Germination | Hierarchical Bayesian | Mycorrhizae | Orchidaceae | Prediction,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,110,NA,NA

The arctic environment is highly heterogeneous in terms of plant distribution and productivity. If we are to make regional scale predictions of carbon exchange it is necessary to find robust relationships that can simplify this variability. One such potential relationship is that of leaf area to photosynthetic CO2 flux at the canopy scale. 2. In this paper we assess the effectiveness of canopy leaf area in explaining variation in gross primary productivity (GPP): (i) across different vegetation types; (ii) at various stages of leaf development; and (iii) under enhanced nutrient availability. To do this we measure net CO2 flux light response curves with a 1 × 1 m chamber, and calculate GPP at a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 600 μmol m-2 s-1. 3. At a subarctic site in Sweden, we report 10-fold variation in GPP among natural vegetation types with leaf area index (LAI) values of 0.05-2.31 m2 m-2. At a site of similar latitude in Alaska we document substantially elevated rates of GPP in fertilized vegetation. 4. We can explain 80% of the observed variation in GPP in natural vegetation (including vegetation measured before deciduous leaf bud burst) by leaf area alone, when leaf area is predicted from measurements of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). 5. In fertilized vegetation the relative increase in leaf area between control and fertilized treatments exceeds the relative increase in GPP. This suggests that higher leaf area causes increased self-shading, or that lower leaf nitrogen per unit leaf area causes a reduction in the rate of photosynthesis. 6. The results of this study indicate that canopy leaf area is an excellent predictor of GPP in diverse low arctic tundra, across a wide range of plant functional types. © 2006 The Authors.",167,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Alaska | Arctic tundra | Carbon balance | CO  flux 2 | Gross primary productivity | Landscape heterogeneity | Leaf area index | Light response | Normalized difference vegetation index | Sweden,29602,NE/D005795/1,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,111,NERC,Natural Environment Research Council

Linking new developments in genomics with ecology provides interesting novel tools to address ecological questions in ways that have not been possible up to now. In this paper we address this issue for the ecology of infochemicals and plant-insect interactions in a food web context. 2. Plants are at the basis of most terrestrial food webs and insects are a dominant animal group interacting with plants. Insect-plant communities are characterized by direct and indirect interactions, many of which are mediated by infochemicals. Plants respond to insect herbivory with the production of volatiles that attract the enemies of the herbivores, such as insect predators and parasitoids. Moreover, the plant volatiles may be exploited by any organism in the environment and this results in many more infochemically mediated interactions. Thus, a food web is overlaid with an infochemical web. 3. In the past, several manipulative tools have been developed to investigate the role of infochemicals. The rapid advancement of molecular genetics and '-omics' technologies results in interesting new tools. A recent development is the use of well-characterized genotypes that are modified in the mechanisms underlying the induced plant volatiles. These genotypes produce precisely manipulated phenotypes that often differ in only a single gene, and can be used to investigate the effect of particular genes on specific interactions. Moreover, these genotypes can be introduced into a natural community to assess the effects of the genetic change and its resulting phenotypic change on interactions with the entire natural community. 4. Furthermore, with the progress in microarray technology it becomes possible to assess the expressed genotype of plants in the field, which can be exploited to investigate expressed genetic variation under field conditions. 5. These developments are expected to be only the beginning of a successful integration of -omics technologies, such as transcriptomics and metabolomics, with community ecology into the new research field of ecogenomics. 6.

We tested the hypothesis that the competitive effect of multi-species mixtures on a single target plant can be described as a simple additive function of the effects of single species. 2. In a controlled field competition experiment on sand, we used four common species of dry acidic grasslands (Hieracium pilosella, Jasione montana, Corynephorus canescens and Festuca ovina) to study the effects of both, single- and multi-species neighbourhoods on the target species H. pilosella. 3. Target plant biomass points at a competitive ranking of neighbour species with F. ovina as the strongest competitor followed by C. canescens and H. pilosella, while J. montana has a lower effect on the target. The analysis of the competitive response gives no indication of competitive release or amplification with increasing number of neighbouring species. 4. Further analysis with yield-density models reveals that the competition intensity of most multi-species mixtures is well predicted by the effect of pairwise interactions. Hence, for the majority of species combinations, our results indicate additive effects of species competition. 5. Specific species combinations, however, significantly deviate from this result. For combinations of C. canescens with either one of the herbs, the models show a significantly better fit if a non-additivity parameter is included. The important missing factor to describe target plant growth is species-specific biomass of neighbouring plants and here root biomass is the most crucial determinant. The addition of each of these factors as non-additive parameters significantly increases the predictive power of the model. 6. Our work adds to the increasing evidence that interactions in diverse plant communities are not simply a sum of their component species interactions. For a better understanding of the effect of competition on the structure and development of diverse plant communities, future studies need to consider both additive and non-additive effects of competing species. © 2006 The Authors.",69,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Additivity | Biodiversity | Coexistence | Competitive hierarchies | Hieracium pilosella | Hyperbolic model | Multi-species mixtures | Relative yield | Relative yield total | Yield-density model,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,113,NA,NA

We quantify the effects of spatial structure on individual, population and community biomass within a natural community of annuals for two years (1994 and 1996) in which competition operated differently. 2. Using field-parameterized neighbourhood models in which we had previously estimated the spatial scale and magnitude of competitive effects, we perform virtual experiments in which we manipulate spatial structure relative to that observed. We first remove segregation by randomly re-labelling all annual plants in a focal plant's neighbourhood and then give individuals of all species the same average number of neighbours by re-locating individuals within the overall pattern of annuals. 3. The natural spatial structure generally acted to promote species coexistence. In 1994, when the strength of individual-level competition within species was already greater than that between species, the natural spatial structure enhanced this effect for six out of seven species by increasing the relative frequency of intraspecific contacts. Average plant biomass increased by 0.24-38% when spatial locations were randomized. 4. In 1996, when a single competitive hierarchy operated, the natural spatial structure systematically benefited small-seeded, weakly competitive species while having weak negative effects on large-seeded, strong competitors. Randomizing spatial locations decreased the biomass of the species with the smallest seeds by 12% but increased the biomass of the species with the largest seeds by < 1%. This asymmetry increased dramatically when we used the model to increase the competitive advantage of large seeds artificially. Randomizing spatial locations decreased the biomass of the species with the smallest seeds by 37% but increased the biomass of the species with the largest seeds by only 2.7%. 5. Effects of spatial structure on total community biomass were always small (maximum 7%). This was because common species always have weak spatial structure, and they draw down the effect on the community as a whole. 6. Our analysis, for the first time, quantifies the magnitude and direction of the effects of spatial structure in a natural community, and supports the conclusions of theoretical models that spatial structure can have substantial impacts on component species and community dynamics. © 2006 The Authors.",55,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Competition/colonization trade-off | Neighbourhood modelling | Plant competition | Spatial segregation | Spatial structure,29602,644267,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,114,H2020,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

We examined the factors determining synchrony in reproduction in nine Acacia and six other tree species in the Serengeti ecosystem. 2. We test two hypotheses: (i) an abiotic hypothesis where the primary determinant of synchrony is an adaptation to water availability; and (ii) biotic hypotheses where these adaptations to water can be further refined by additional adaptations to avoid predators, or attract seed and fruit dispersers. 3. Flowering and fruiting were recorded monthly for individually marked trees during 1997-2004. Flowering in different species occurs semi-annually, annually or, in the case of one species, once every 2 years. For most species synchrony of flowering was correlated with seasonal rainfall, with lags related to the mean height of the species; small species flowered during the rains while larger species flowered in the dry season. Fruiting seasons occurred at the end of the rains irrespective of the flowering season. 4. Most species showed flowering synchrony greater than expected from the distribution of rainfall. This may be related to avoidance of insect seed predators through predator satiation. Two Acacias showed multi-annual fruiting (masting), possibly as a predator avoidance mechanism. Acacia tortilis has two flowering seasons: a dry season flowering with early abortion of pods and a wet season flowering producing successful fruits. 5. Two species of Commiphora appeared to be synchronized so as to attract birds that disperse seeds. Acacia tortilis produced indehiscent pods attractive to ungulates, possibly to kill bruchid beetles during digestion and so increase seed viability. 6. Our results suggest that synchrony in these trees is caused by a strong interaction between abiotic and biotic factors. Closely related species have different reproductive patterns of synchrony that seem to be adapted to different combinations of rainfall, predators and dispersers. Rainfall is the primary determinant but the activities of predators and dispersers increase the degree of synchrony. © 2006 The Authors.",21,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Anti-predator adaptation | Dispersal | Flowering | Fruiting | Seasonality,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,115,NA,NA

Invertebrate grazing during the regeneration phase is well known to exert a strong structuring effect in terrestrial plant communities. However, very few studies have investigated the effect of invertebrate herbivores on regenerating freshwater angiosperms, despite the obvious benefits for the development of general theories in plant community ecology. 2. Our study investigated the parameters that determine the sensitivity of the freshwater macrophyte Potamogeton pectinatus L. to herbivory by the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis (L.). P. pectinatus was raised from winter-collected tubers in aquatic microcosms and submitted to grazing by snails at various densities and starvation levels. 3. Newly sprouted P. pectinatus was much more sensitive to snail grazing than mature plants: survival of newly sprouted plants decreased as snail density increased, whereas the survival rate of mature plants was unaffected by snail density. Moreover, the sensitivity of newly sprouted P. pectinatus to herbivory decreased as its initial tuber mass increased. The damage to newly sprouted P. pectinatus by herbivory increased with snail starvation. However, the presence of an alternative, highly palatable, food (i.e. benthic algae) deflected feeding on P. pectinatus, even by extremely hungry snails. 4. These results demonstrate the potential structuring role exerted by gastropods during the regeneration of freshwater macrophytes, supporting results from terrestrial systems. They also suggest that regenerating plants may avoid invertebrate herbivory by modulating their intrinsic characteristics (e.g. increasing propagule size) or by emerging under favourable environmental conditions (e.g. low invertebrate density, presence of alternative food). Herbivory during the regeneration phase is therefore pivotal to our understanding of plant dynamics in aquatic as well as terrestrial ecosystems, and should be integrated into explicative models of vegetation patterns across various environments. © 2006 The Authors.",17,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Clonal reproduction | Lymnaea stagnalis | Macrophyte | Microcosm | Mollusc herbivory | Palatability | Periphyton | Plant-animal interactions | Potamogeton pectinatus | Propagule size,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,116,NA,NA

Herbivores can play a key role in affecting ecosystem function, but their direct and indirect effects are often confounded with each other and have rarely been dissected. Predictions for open systems, i.e. those with cross-habitat nutrient fluxes and dispersal, may differ from those expected in closed systems, where no such transfers occur, but these differences have only recently begun to be characterized. 2. We present a theoretical model of plant productivity and soil nitrogen (N) based on the Serengeti ecosystem in order to investigate the interplay among herbivore movement, nutrient transport across habitats (spatial subsidies), the fire regime and the effects of herbivores on N cycling. 3. Model results suggest that the fire regime and herbivore migration are key determinants of primary productivity and fertility, and that the impact of these factors depends on grazing intensity. At low intensity, high grass biomass leads to extensive fires and N volatilization, but this effect is reduced at high grazing intensity. Without migration, the model predicts that primary productivity and fertility initially increase, then decline with increasing grazing intensity. Conversely, seasonal migration decouples the growing and grazing seasons, leading to a monotonic increase in productivity with grazing intensity. Cross-habitat N transport has a relatively modest effect on N dynamics, and the magnitude of the seasonality effect outweighs the spatial subsidy effect. 4. Our model suggests that herbivores and fire may play key interactive roles in regulating producers and determining ecosystem functional properties in grazing systems, both through consumption and via indirect effects on nutrient availability. The direction and magnitude of these effects could potentially vary greatly among ecosystems with resident vs. migratory herbivores, suggesting that spatial coupling through animal movement can be important at both the population and ecosystem levels. 5. This study suggests that the degree to which trophic interactions influence ecosystem function may be strongly modulated by whether systems are open or closed. It also suggests that direct and indirect effects of consumers on their resources (top-down effects) may be far more important than nutrient subsidies in open terrestrial systems. © 2006 The Authors.",66,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Fire effects | Fire-herbivore interactions | Grazing optimization | Migratory ungulates | Nitrogen loss | Nutrient cycling | Primary productivity | Serengeti | Spatial subsidies | Wildebeest,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,117,NA,NA

Accurate assessment of net primary production is vital for understanding carbon (C) cycling, both regionally and globally. However, this requires effective methods of measurement that acknowledge the unique characteristics of the subject or area being monitored. 2. Feathermosses dominate the ground layer of boreal upland ecosystems and play a vital role in soil C accumulation, accounting for up to 50% of total photosynthesis. Feathermoss growth is both apical and lateral, with branches of determinate length at maturity produced at consistent frequencies along the stem. 3. Traditional methods of estimating annual production of feathermosses underestimate total plant production because they do not account for lateral growth of the previous year's immature branches. We present a conceptual model of feathermoss growth using Pleurozium schreberi that includes apical and lateral annual growth. From this model, we provide a modified method to more accurately estimate P. schreberi production. The top 3 cm of 10 P. schreberi plants from each of five bog peatlands in Alberta, Canada, were collected. For each plant, distance from the stem apex to branch insertion, branch length and dry mass, and dry mass of 3-mm stem sections were measured and used to define model parameters that, due to lack of significant variability among the sites, can be applied regionally and possibly globally throughout the boreal zone. An additional 20 plants were collected from a sixth site for testing the accuracy of our modified method. 4. Assessment of our method showed an insignificant mean difference between observed and calculated production values. Furthermore, comparison of our method with traditional methods showed a c. 25% underestimation of annual production by the latter. Traditional methods underestimate annual biomass production of P. schreberi by c. 73 g m-2, accounting for more than 14 Tg C year-1 across the boreal region. 5.

Tree-size distributions are changing in many natural forests around the world, and it is important to understand the underlying processes that are causing these changes. Here we use a classic conceptual framework - the shifting mosaic of patches model - to explore the ways in which competitive thinning and disturbance influence tree-size distributions, and to consider the effects of temporal variability in disturbance frequency on the size structure of forests. 2. We monitored 250 stands of Nothofagus solandri var. cliffortiodes (mountain beech), randomly distributed over 9000 hectares, for 19 years. Mountain beech is a light-demanding species that forms monospecific forests in New Zealand mountains. For the purposes of our model, we assumed that each stand functions as an even-aged population: it is initiated by a pulse of recruitment, undergoes competitive thinning as it matures, and is eventually destroyed by a disturbance event. The tree-size distribution of the whole forest is driven partly by the frequency and temporal patchiness of disturbance events and partly by competitive processes within the constituent stands. 3. Temporal changes in stem density and mean tree size were observed to be remarkably similar in all young stands, indicating that a consistent packing rule operates during this phase of stand development. A popular idea in the self-thinning literature is that the maintenance of constant leaf area index (LAI) provides the mechanism for this packing rule, but our analyses suggest that LAI increased by about 30% during the thinning phase. We use leaf economic theory to develop a new packing rule based on light interception, and argue that LAI increases with stand age because of changes in canopy organisation. 4. Smaller trees were significantly more likely to die than larger trees within the young stands. Tree-diameter distributions within young stands were left skewed but those of older populations were normally distributed. These observations are consistent with asymmetric competition winnowing out small, suppressed trees from young stands but having less effect in older stands. 5. Large-scale disturbances created gaps of sufficient size to allow mass recruitment of seedlings in about 0.8% of stands each year. Older stands were most susceptible to such large-scale disturbance, but the trend was weak. 6. The diameter-distribution of the whole Nothofagus forest was found to be approximately exponential in form. Simulation models only produced realistic diameter distributions when competitive packing rules and disturbance were included. Therefore, the shifting mosaic model provides a general framework for understand the ways in which these mortality processes determine forest size structure. 7. The diameter distribution of the forest was not in equilibrium over the 19-year study. Using simulation models, we show that temporal variability in disturbance frequency can generate enormous deviations in tree-diameter distributions away from the long-term mean, leading us to conclude that modern-day disequilibrium in natural forests may be the legacy of past disturbance events. © 2006 The Authors.",215,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Asymmetric competition | Density dependence | Forest dynamics | Leaf economic spectrum | Scaling relationships | Size frequency distribution | WBE metabolic scaling theory | Weibull function,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,119,NA,NA

Metacommunity and neutral theory have reinvigorated the study of 'niches' and have emphasized the importance of understanding the influences of competition, abiotic factors and regional spatial processes in shaping communities. 2. We conducted a field survey to examine the effects of soil characteristics and distance on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal communities of maize (Zea mays) in sand and clay soils. To address whether the field distributions of AM fungal species represented their fundamental or realized niches, we grew representative species of the two dominant genera, Glomus and Gigaspora, alone or together on Sorghum bicolor plants in sand, clay or a sand/clay mixture in the glasshouse. 3. In the field, soil characteristics and spatial structure accounted for significant proportions of the variation in community composition among sites, suggesting that both environmental variables and dispersal were important factors shaping AM fungal communities. 4. AM fungi in the family Glomeraceae occurred predominately in clay soils, whereas AM fungi in the family Gigasporaceae dominated in sand soils. Niche space of Glomeraceae was further partitioned by levels of soil organic carbon and nitrogen. 5. In the glasshouse, root colonization by Glomus was high in all three soils when grown in the absence of Gigaspora, indicating a broad fundamental niche. Root colonization by Gigaspora was negatively correlated with percentage clay when grown in the absence of Glomus, consistent with the low abundance of this family in clay soils in the field. When grown together, spore production of both Glomus and Gigaspora was significantly reduced only in the sand soil, indicating that competition could limit niches of both families in certain soil environments. 6.

The size of the entire sampled population increased by 50% during the 32-year observation period and thereby pine has become a more prominent element on the landscape. This reverses a natural multicentennial or even millennial trend of tree line decline and recession. 3. Contrasting population trends were recorded for the subperiods 1973-87 and 1988-2005, viz. decline and increase, respectively. Mean summer temperatures (JJA) did not change perceivably over and between these intervals, although some exceptionally warm summers from 1997 onwards have contributed to population expansion by increased seed viability and seedling emergence. Winter temperatures (DJF) decreased significantly over the first subperiod and were consistently higher during the second, which has significantly lowered the mortality rates. 4. A functional link to winter temperature conditions was particularly stressed by the aetiology of individual plant vigour, injuries and final mortality. Classical symptoms of winter desiccation correlated significantly with low winter temperatures. This negative impact occurred with a high frequency during the decline phase and virtually ceased during the expansion phase from 1988 onwards, when winter air and root zone temperatures were raised to a consistently higher level. 5. Winter and summer temperatures in the air and soil, as well as positive feedback mechanisms and nonlinear responses, must be taken into account in the search for global or regional mechanical explanations for the tree line phenomenon. This insight helps to generate realistic tree line models for a high-CO2 world, when winter warming is usually predicted to be particularly large. © 2006 The Author.",206,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Climate change | Demography | Monitoring | Mortality | Pinus sylvestris | Recruitment | Swedish Scandes | Tree line advance,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,121,NA,NA

Currently, plant ecologists are increasingly adopting approaches and techniques from molecular biology. The new field of ecogenomics aims at understanding the mechanistic basis for adaptation and phenotypic variation by using genomic techniques to investigate the mechanistic and evolutionary basis of species interactions, and focuses on identifying the genes affected by evolution. 2. While the entire toolbox of genomics is only available for model species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, we describe the options open to ecologists interested in pursuing an ecogenomics research program on ecologically relevant traits or phenomena in non-model species, for which part of the genomic toolbox may be currently unavailable. In these non-model species, a viable ecogenomics research program is possible with relatively modest effort. 3. Four challenges to further development of ecogenomics are described and discussed: (i) the ecogenomic study of non-model species; (ii) reconciliation of experimental languages of ecology and evolutionary biology with molecular biology; (iii) development of specific ecogenomic data analysis tool; and (iv) adoption of a multidisciplinary cooperative research culture. 4. An important task for ecologists is to provide the necessary ecological input (the 'eco' part) to ecogenomics. © 2006 The Authors.",55,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Adoptation | Evolutionary ecology | Gene expression | Microarray | Sequence analysis,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,122,NA,NA

Variation in diversity with habitat productivity has long been a central ecological topic. Plant diversity is mostly highest at intermediate productivity, exhibiting the unimodal (so-called 'hump-back') relationship. This relationship has been explained by both evolutionary and ecological processes, but the potential role of dispersal limitation has not been considered. 2. We used European flora data to show that dispersal limitation may contribute to the unimodal productivity-diversity relationship. Species were characterized by their habitat productivity preference and dispersal probability (determined by the number of seeds and the presence of a dispersal syndrome). We calculated average relative dispersal probabilities for species assemblages occurring preferentially in different habitat productivity levels. 3. At low productivity levels, species without dispersal syndromes predominate (R2 = 0.89), but at high productivity levels, species with a low number of seeds are common (R2 = 0.89). The total relative dispersal probability, combining both the dispersal probabilities attributable to the number of seeds and to the presence of dispersal syndrome, had a unimodal relationship with habitat productivity (R2 = 0.86). Thus, the unimodal productivity-diversity relationship may arise due to the minimal dispersal limitation of local richness in conditions of moderately low productivity. At very low productivity, the lack of dispersal syndromes may limit dispersal. At high productivity, the low number of seeds may limit dispersal. 4. Consequently, in conditions where species pool size and biotic interactions do not vary along productivity gradients, the variation in dispersal probabilities with productivity alone can produce unimodal relationships between diversity and productivity. Thus, dispersal limitation may contribute to the observed diversity pattern and ecosystem functioning to a greater extent than usually assumed. © 2006 The Authors.",60,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Diaspore | Dispersal agent | Dispersal syndrome | Diversity | Ellenberg indicator values | Hump-back productivity-diversity relationship | Plant biomass | Propagule | Seed size | Species richness,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,123,NA,NA

Climate change in South Africa may threaten the sclerophyllous evergreen shrubs of this region. Available data suggest that they are not as tolerant of water stress as chaparral shrubs occurring in climatically similar California, USA. 2. Seventeen species from nine angiosperm families, including both fynbos and succulent karoo species, were studied at a field site in Western Cape Province, South Africa. Minimum seasonal pressure potential (Pmin), xylem specific conductivity (Ks), stem strength against breakage (modulus of rupture, MOR), xylem density, theoretical vessel implosion resistance ((t/b)h2) and several fibre and vessel anatomical traits were measured. 3. Species displayed great variability in Pmin, similar to the range reported for chaparral and karoo shrub species, but in contrast to previous reports for fynbos shrubs. 4. More negative Pmin was associated with having greater xylem density, MOR and (t/b)h2. There was no relationship between Pmin and traits associated with increased water transport efficiency. 5. Xylem density integrates many xylem traits related to water stress tolerance, including Pmin, MOR and (t/b)h2, as well as percentage fibre wall, parenchyma, vessel area and fibre lumen diameter. 6.

The seasonal timing of flower production is a critical event in the life cycle of many plants. A range of abiotic and biotic interactions has been suggested to influence the optimal flowering phenology. More rarely, phenology has been examined from a developmental perspective. Still, the production of a flower or an inflorescence is an integral part of the ontogeny and architecture of a plant. 2. We investigated to what extent the timing of flowering is coupled to overall ontogeny and architecture in the perennial herb Lathyrus vernus. We asked if the decision to flower is associated with a change in vegetative phenology. We also investigated if onset of flowering depends on the start of shoot growth and leaf unfolding, time to complete shoot growth and leaf unfolding, and plant architecture. Lastly, we investigated whether the resource state of the plant affects vegetative and flowering phenology. 3. Flowering plants started shoot growth and leaf development significantly earlier than non-flowering plants. In flowering plants, start of vegetative growth was positively correlated to start of flowering, but there was no positive correlation between development time and start of flowering. Earlier flowering plants produced their first inflorescence at lower positions than late-flowering plants. Experimental manipulation of resource state affected several components of fitness but did not influence vegetative or flowering phenology. 4. Our results show that the decision to flower is linked to a change in vegetative phenology in L. vernus, and that differences in the onset of flowering among individuals are correlated to differences in vegetative phenology. A possible interpretation of this pattern is that the evolution of flowering phenology is partly constrained by vegetative development. Alternatively, flowering changes the optimal time of vegetative development. Still, individuals with similar timing of vegetative development may differ considerably in flowering time, suggesting that independent adjustments of vegetative and flowering phenology are possible. © 2006 The Authors.",45,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Development time | Flowering time | Lathyrus vernus | Plant architecture | Vegetative phenology,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,125,NA,NA

We examined whether two different grassland microhabitats forming a stable mosaic (anthills and surrounding grassland) are colonized by different genotypes of a common grass, Agrostis capillaris, and thus maintain genetic variation in the species. 2. The potential of individual Agrostis genotypes, coming from different microhabitats, to withstand burial by ants was examined under experimental burial conditions. The same genotypes were then planted into these microhabitats in a reciprocal fashion to test whether their performance differs according to their source microhabitat. Isozymes were used to identify genet diversities and mean genet sizes at the microhabitats. They were also used to determine whether there is any indication that different genets occupy each of these microhabitats. 3. The burial experiment showed a high genetic variation between clones, both in overall performance (mean over both environments) and in their plastic response to burial. Variation in the way individual clones respond differently to changes in their environment was observed. In contrast to the response in the burial experiment, no clone-origin interaction was found in the transplant experiment. The performance of all plants on the anthills was significantly lower than on other habitats. 4. Isozyme analyses showed that the number of genets (per ramet sampled) on anthills is significantly lower than in the surrounding grassland. It also indicated a partial separation of genets into these microhabitats compared with homogeneous grassland conditions. 5. The harsh environment of anthills therefore acts as a filter for the total pool of Agrostis genets in the grassland, with only the fastest growing clones able to survive under these conditions. As Agrostis is capable of extensive clonal growth, it is able to cross microhabitats given sufficient time. Isozyme data showed that the contribution from generative reproduction is very low. Such a system indicates some 'genet sorting' through vegetative growth instead of genetic differentiation. © 2006 The Authors.",4,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Clonal growth | Functional differentiation | Genetic variation | Isozyme markers | Lasius flavus | Microhabitats | Reciprocal transplant,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,126,NA,NA

Herbivores may negatively impact plant populations by reducing the survival, growth and reproduction of individual plants. 2. In African savannas, browsing by large mammalian herbivores has been shown repeatedly to reduce adult survival and growth of members of the genus Acacia, the dominant trees in these systems. However, the potential costs of mammalian herbivory to Acacia reproduction are largely unexplored, and have never been investigated experimentally in African savannas. 3. Using a long-term, large-scale field experiment, we demonstrate that, in the absence of native herbivores, individual trees were twice as likely to reproduce, and those that reproduced produced a greater biomass of seeds. In addition, spine length (an indicator of past herbivory) was correlated with reduced reproduction of Acacia drepanolobium, the dominant tree across large areas of East Africa. Browsing by native herbivores triggers the production of longer spines, an induced resistance, and spine length was significantly and negatively related both to the occurrence and magnitude of reproduction. 4. Induced resistance appeared to mitigate the negative effects of herbivory where large herbivores were present: trees with long spines reproduced at levels comparable to trees with similarly long spine lengths in the absence of browsers. 5. Large mammalian herbivores kill and suppress the growth of adult Acacia, and therefore often are regarded as critical in maintaining the co-dominance of trees and grasses in African savannas. Our results provide the first experimental evidence that large mammalian herbivores can suppress reproduction in Acacia, thus highlighting an additional pathway through which these herbivores might impact population dynamics of this important and widespread genus. 6. In savanna systems, declining populations of large herbivores may trigger a series of complex demographic responses for trees, with potentially strong consequences for the structure and function of savannas. © 2006 The Authors.",75,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Acacia | Cost of herbivory | Hierarchical model | Induced resistance | Landscape change | Population dynamics | Reproduction | Savanna | Seed production | Ungulate,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,127,NA,NA

Prolonged dormancy, a condition in which herbaceous perennial plants do not sprout for more than a year, has only been described to any great extent in long-lived clonal species, particularly in the family Orchidaceae. However, some short-lived, partly clonal or non-clonal perennials also experience dormancy, and their shorter life spans and reduced or absent clonality may change the life history costs and benefits of this phenomenon. 2. We explored the life history context of dormancy in one such plant, Neotinea ustulata. A total of 1013 plants were monitored in five populations across Estonia between 1993 and 2005. Cormack-Jolly-Seber (CJS) and multistate analyses, two statistical methods to estimate demographic parameters in open populations, were conducted to estimate the probabilities of survival, dormancy and state transition among flowering, vegetative and dormant states among the populations. 3. The best-fit CJS model suggested that dormancy varied among populations unpredictably, while survival varied in parallel among populations across time. Mean survival was 0.727 ± 0.115 (± SE) and mean dormancy was 0.543 ± 0.129. 4. Multi-state analyses suggested that survival varied in parallel with life history state across all populations, with flowering plants surviving almost completely (0.999 ± 0.007) and dormant plants being the least likely to survive (0.684 ± 0.042). Vegetative plants were found to be intermediate (0.793 ± 0.051). All plants were likely to revert to a dormant state (range 0.451 ± 0.085-0.812 ± 0.053). 5. Dormancy appears to be maladaptive in N. ustulata, although we suggest that it may still be adaptive as a bet-hedging trait if it results in substantially lower variability in survival and fitness over the long term. We suggest that conservation measures aimed at preserving populations of dormancy-prone plants be linked to censuses focusing on detecting and estimating dormancy levels because high levels of dormancy indicate a low annual survival. © 2006 The Authors.",31,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Adaptation | Bet-hedging | Clonal plants | Maladaptive | Mark-recapture | Program MARK | Short-lived perennial,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,128,NA,NA

However, it is not clear if this only applies to exotic species or also to native species arriving at a site with few other native species during community assembly. We tested the latter by transplanting four native species into experimental grassland communities varying in species richness form 1-16 (-60) species. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that invasion is less successful if the invading species belongs to a functional group that is already present in the community. The test invaders included a grass species (Festuca pratensis, FP), a short (Plantago lanceolata, PL) and a tall herb species (Knautia arvensis, KA), and a legume species (Trifolium pratense, TP). The same four functional groups also occurred alone or in all possible combinations in the different experimental communities. The overall performance of the transplants was negatively related to the logarithm of the species richness of host communities. Plant biomass declined by 58%, 90%, 84% and 62% in FP, PL, KA and TP, respectively, from monocultures to 16-species mixtures, indicating lower invasiveness of the two herbs than of the grass and the legume. Resident grasses showed a strong negative effect on the performance of all test invaders, whereas resident small and tall herbs had neutral, and resident legumes had positive effects. The case of the legumes indicates that contributions to invasion resistance need not parallel invasiveness. Communities containing resident species of only one functional group were most inhibitive to transplants of the same functional group. These results indicate that invasion resistance of experimental plant communities is related to the degree of niche overlap between resident species and invaders. This niche overlap can be high due to generally low amounts of empty niche space in species-rich resident communities or due to the occurrence of the same functional group as the one of the invader in the resident community. Stronger within- than between-functional-group invasion resistance may be the key mechanism underlying diversity effects on invasion resistance in grassland and other ecosystems at large. © 2006 The Authors.",101,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,Diversity effects | Invasion resistance | Invasiveness | Niche overlap | Phytometers | Plant functional groups | The Jena Experiment,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,129,NA,NA
