The prevalence of these infections was significantly higher in the former. Although squatter children (1-14 years old) were more heavily infected with A. lumbricoides and H. nana than squatter adults, the same pattern was not observed for T. trichiura. The results suggest that local community-based helminthic parasite surveys may more accurately portray the actual health status of socioeconomically diverse urban populations.",3,9709793,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,2,2

Simultaneously, the general condition of the animals during the immunization schedule was also studied. There was a great individual variability in the immune response, although most of the horses studied reached the highest neutralizing titer after injection of doses of venom of 30 mg and 50 mg. On the other hand, in horses that had been previously immunized and were infected for a second immunization, the highest antibody titer was observed 16-22 days after inoculation. There were only mild alterations in the general condition of the horses as a consequence of venom inoculation. However, local abscesses, fistulae and fibrosis were observed at the site of venom injection. On the basis of the conspicuous individual variability observed, it is proposed that the immune response in horses used in the production of antivenom must be evaluated on individual basis, instead of working with pools of serum samples.",7,9709794,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,3,2

The protein eluted at 0.4 M Nacl in 0.01 Tris pH 7.3 and exhibited agglutinin activity toward 0+ human erythrocytes. The protein is a dimer with Mr 28 kDa. Amino acid analysis revealed high content of tryptophan and acid recidues and low content of cysteine and methionine residues. No neutral carbohydrates and sialic acid were detected. Circular dichroic spectrum shows 78% of B structure and 1% of alpha structure. In vitro experiments with erythrocytes from rat, rabbit and dog revealed strong agglutination while red blood cells from mice, sheep and goat were not agglutinated. In vivo experiments using anesthetized rats, a sharp and prolonged fall in the blood pressure was observed at protein dose of 1.5 mg/kg.

For their isolation, these bacteria were enriched in alkaline peptone water and streaked on MacConkey agar and on brilliant green bile inositol agar. This was followed by the biochemical tests necessary for their identification. Thirty-five strains of A. hydrophila, 58 of A. caviae, 43 of A. sobria, and 7 of P. shigelloides were isolated. None of these predominated nor was there any indication of a seasonal distribution along the 15 month's duration of the study. Seven strains of A. hydrophila and two of A. sobria showed the biochemical characteristics associated with toxin production (positive Voges-Proskauer and lysine decarboxylase tests).
