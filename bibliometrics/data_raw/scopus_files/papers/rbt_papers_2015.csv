Espelelia paipana is an endangered giant caulescent rosette endemic to Boyacá department. In order to establish whether a plant disease, characterized by the loss of leaf pubescence (PPF) and attributed to the pathogenic action of endophytic microorganisms, is the cause of the increasing mortality of population, the physiological performance of the species was evaluated with and without PPF. The incidence (% leaves affected in each of the 27 individuals in the current population) and severity (% leaf area affected on 135 leaves) of the PPF were monitored over a period of nine months, in three topographic zones of different heights. During four consecutive days in both dry and wet season, physiological parameters as chlorophyll content index (ICC), stomatal conductance (Gs) and leaf temperature (Tfol) were measured in healthy and affected leaves. The study was complemented with isolations and pathogenicity tests to identify the causal agent of the PPF. Overall, although the disease incidence in E. paipana was constant over time, the severity progressed surpassing 60 % of the leaf area. The increasing of severity in the upper side of leaves was attributed to the photo-oxidative effect of high radiation between 11:00 h and 14:00 h of the day. The reduction of functional leaf area because of the PPF, led to low Gs with serious implications for carbon fixation and thus limiting growth and biomass renewal. The effect of season in Tfol varied according to the topographic zone, while the ICC did not present a defined pattern with respect to the PPF; its low values could be associated with the production of other pigments. Finally, although it is not possible to ensure that Botrytis sp. is the causative of the loss of leaf pubescence, it is postulated as the most probably causal agent due to its high representativeness in the isolates and its infectious potential during the pathogenicity tests. In general, the reduction of healthy leaf biomass and decrease of physiological performance suggest that PPF affect negatively the survival of E. paipana, which means that the use of biological controllers could be a strategy to mitigate its effect on the population.",0,26666137,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Within these processes, mid- to large-sized mammals consume fruits and seeds from several species; however, because of their size these mammals are overhunted, resulting in defaunated forests. Our objective was to evaluate and compare seed removal and survivorship in a forest with no hunting, a forest with moderate or reduced hunting, and a forest with higher hunting pressure. We examined the interaction between Astrocaryum gratum and white lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) to tease apart the defaunation process. To isolate and evaluate mammal seed removal rates and to identify the causes of mortality on A.gratum, under the three different hunting pressures forests, we used exclosures in each one. In four different forest-patches for each forest, we positioned a block-treatment consisting of three exclosures (total exclusion, peccary exclusion, and control), randomly distributed 5m apart and the block-treatments spaced 50-75m apart from one another. We established 15 treatments in total for each patch (5 blocks per patch). There were 20 blocks within each forest type. For total exclusion, all vertebrates were excluded using galvanized wire mesh exclosures. The second, the peccary exclusion, was designed to stop peccaries from entering treatment units, providing access only to small vertebrates; larger mammals were able to access the treatment unit by reaching over the sides and the open top; finally, the Control allowed full access for all mammals. Fresh A. gratum fruits were collected from the forest floor under different adult trees throughout the study area. In each exclosure treatment, twenty A.gratum seeds were placed, and their removal was recorded. In total, 3 600 seeds were analyzed. Seed survival was lower in unhunted forest compared to areas with moderate hunting and forest with a higher hunt pressure, supporting the hypothesis of the importance of mammals in seed removal. From the initial 400 seeds left for each control exclosure in each type of forest, there was a significant difference between the seed removal; 1.75% seeds in the unhunted forest remained; 43.5% in the moderately hunted forest, and 48.5% in hunted forest. The main cause of seed mortality was white lipped peccaries; while in the forests without them, the main removal was caused by rodents and a higher insect infection was observed in the heavily hunted forest.

Other ecosystems with few studies included mangroves, desert zones, natural savannahs, palm swamps, paramos, flooding forests and agroforestry systems. The biogeographic region with the greatest number of localities was the Andean region, followed by Choco-Magdalenense and Amazonia. Our results showed that high levels of subsampling persist and that some zones lack registries, as in the case of some parks of the national system of protected areas.

Despite the general presumption that productivity and hence carbon stocks in these ecosystems are low, studies in this regard are scarce. This study aimed to i) to estimate Above Ground Biomass (AGB) in forests located in the South of the Colombian Andean region, ii) to identify the carbon storage potential of tropical montane forests dominated by the black oak Colombobalanus excelsa and to identify the relationship between AGB and altitude, and iii) to analyze the role of tropical mountain forests in conservation mechanisms such as Payment for Environmental Services (PES) and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+). Twenty six 0.25ha plots were randomly distributed in the forests and all trees with D≥10cm were measured. The results provided important elements for understanding the role of tropical montane forests as carbon sinks. The information produced can be used in subnational initiatives, which seek to mitigate or reduce the effects of deforestation through management or conservation of these ecosystems, like REDD+ or PES. The AGB and carbon stocks results obtained were similar to those reported for lowland tropical forests. These could be explained by the dominance and abundance of C. excelsa, which accounted for over 81% of AGB/carbon. The error associated with the estimates of AGB/carbon was 10.58%. We found a negative and significant relationship between AGB and altitude, but the higher AGB values were in middle altitudes (≈1 700-1 800m), where the environmental conditions could be favorable to their growth. The carbon storage potential of these forests was higher. However, if the historical rate of the deforestation in the study area continues, the gross emissions of CO2e to the atmosphere could turn these forests in to an important emissions source. Nowadays, it is clear that tropical montane forests are vulnerable to deforestation, especially black Oak forests due to their commercial value.

In the present report, we determined the effect of dieldrin (DD) and chlorpyrifos (CP) on the freshwater crayfish, Cambarellus montezumae. The organisms (4-6cm in diameter) were collected in the Ignacio Ramírez Reservoir, situated at 50km Northeast of Mexico City, in the Rio Lerma Basin. Initially, we determined the LC50 value with the Probit method, then the DNA damage with single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay applied at 24, 48, and 72h of exposure) to the brain and hepatopancreas of animals exposed (in reconstituted water) to 0.05 and 0.5mg/L of each insecticide. In the hepatopancreas of the same organisms, we determined the lipid peroxidation by applying the TBARS test. DNA damage and lipid peroxidation were also evaluated with the same methods to organisms exposed in water from the reservoir. In regard to the LC50, at 72h of exposure, we found a value of 5.1mg/L and a value of 5.62mg/L for DD and CP, respectively. The comet assay applied at different exposure times showed significant DNA damage to both organs, with respect to the control level. In the case of DD, statistical significance was observed for the two doses in the whole evaluated schedule. CP was genotoxic in the brain with the high dose at 72h, and in the hepatopancreas with the two tested doses at all evaluated exposure times. Also, a significant lipid peroxidation increase was detected with the two doses of insecticides. In the study with water from the reservoir, a more pronounced DNA damage was detected. Our results showed strong DNA damage induced by both insecticides in the crayfish, as well as a correlation with the lipid peroxidation effect, suggesting that oxida-tive stress is involved in the genotoxic alteration.

For this, a three-level stratified random sampling approach was adopted for 22 months. Phytoplankton samples were obtained by towing a 0.5m diameter phytoplankton net (35μm mesh size and 0.25m2 mouth surface area) from a non-motorized canoe through a distance of about 100m against the current from downstream to upstream of the river.

Data on total length (cm), total weight (g), and sex were recorded for each specimen. No sexual dimorphism was shown with respect to length (ts=1.113, p>0.05), so one length-weight ratio was established for both sexes (Wt=0.0612*Lt2.54); and they both exhibited minor allo-metric growth. Growth was estimated by analysis of length frequency distributions using FiSAT software. The estimated growth parameters (L∞=39.03cm, W∞=679.60g, k=0.48/year and to=-0.32year) showed moderately rapid growth. Length frequency data were adjusted to the von Bertalanffy model, and indicated an exponential tendency of accelerated growth during the first years of life, followed by slow growth until the fish reached its maximum length. The coefficient of variation of the growth index (Ø’) demonstrated no differences in growth pattern. The natural mortality rate (M=0.97/year), from fishing (F=1.57/year), and total mortality (Z=2.54/year), were high, as well as the exploitation rate (E=0.62/year).

Despite its economic importance, there is a dearth of information on size structure and life history strategies of the species. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to provide baseline data on the life stages, exploitation status and habitat use for the species in Nigeria. Monthly samples were obtained from artisanal and trawl catches in Five Cowrie Creek and Lagos coastal waters between December 2008 and December 2010, respectively. Length-frequency distributions of the fishes caught were analysed to provide preliminary information on mean and modal lengths at capture and life - history strategies based on habitat use and estuarine-dependency for L. goreensis. A total of 822 specimens of L. goreensis were collected from Five Cowrie Creek while 377 specimens were collected from Lagos coastal waters. Total length varied between 7.90-34.90cm for creek samples and from 21.90-56.10cm for marine samples. Length-frequency histograms showed polymo-dal size distributions in creek and marine samples. Length-frequency distributions of L. goreensis showed a high abundance of juveniles (<20cm) and sub-adults (20-35cm) which accounted for 84.1% and 68.4% of creek and marine samples examined, respectively. For the creek samples, fish in modal length class of 13.00-13.99cm were the most exploited while in the marine samples, length classes of 29.00-30.99cm and 31.00-32.99cm constituted the most frequently exploited fishes. Increase in total lengths from the creek (mean±SD; 16.19±3.73cm) to the marine habitat samples (32.89±6.14cm) indicated ontogenetic shift in habitat use. Occurrence of a predominant juvenile population in Five Cowrie Creek by L. goreensis suggests estuarine-dependency and is indicative of a temporary juvenile habitat or a migratory corridor. In conclusion, data from the presently reported study and previous studies demonstrated that juvenile L. goreensis displays estuarine dependency and habitat flexibility. Hence, this underscores the importance of preserving estuarine environments as essential fish habitats to prevent overfishing. The study also concludes that the species is vulnerable to recruitment overfishing in the marine environment especially as a consequence of shrimping.

We assessed the conservation status of their habitats, and the vulnerability of Jatropha spp. populations. A total of 15 sampling sites were selected in the Reserve. The taxonomic work was based on specimens, original descriptions and type material from herbaria and those available on-line. ELUs were classified using biophysical variables, and gvSiG software. Ecological attributes were determined using a quantitative analysis by the point-centered quarter method; disturbance was estimated through site indicators, and the conservation status of the Jatropha populations was assessed using the Method for Evaluation of the Risk of Extinction of Plants in Mexico (MER). Jatropha frequently dominated the physiognomy of plant communities. The current distribution of Jatropha species in the Reserve was mainly determined by elevation, temperature, and precipitation variables. The confirmed species were Jatropha ciliata Sessé ex Cerv., Jatropha neopauciflora Pax, Jatropha oaxacana J. Jiménez Ram. & R. Torres, Jatropha rufescens Brandegee, and Jatropha rzedowskii J. Jiménez Ram., which are distributed in four of the six defined ELU.

During the period 2010-2012 we made direct and continuous observations of inflorescences (visitors, pollinators, and reproductive success) of the three species in every development phase. We determined the association of the palms with their floral visitors through a complex or interaction network, whereas specificity or preference of the insects for each individual palm was assessed through paired similarity analysis, similarity analysis (ANOSIM), and ordering analysis based on non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMSD). The three species flowered throughout the year; their inflorescences have long rachillae that hang close to each other from a short rachis, and they bear flowers in dyads or triads. Inflorescences are protandrous, thermogenic; anthesis takes place during daytime but pollination is nocturnal. We recorded 79 species of insects, mainly beetles, 33 of which visited O. balickii, 63 visited O. bataua, and 33 visited O. minor. Although they shared some visitors, their abundance during the pistillate phase, as well as their pollen loads showed that only a few species of Curculionidae and Nitidulidae are the principal pollinators of the three studied species. Differences in network structure between staminate and pistillate phases, as well as difference in abundance found with the ANOSIM and NMSD similarity tests, suggest a high specificity of pollinators, leading to reproductive isolation among the three species. Because all pollinating beetles were found to develop their life cycles within the inflorescences, we hypothesize the occurrence of a specialized system of mutual dependence between each of this three Oenocarpus species and their pollinators.

In Costa Rica, lionfish were first sighted by the end of 2008 and are now present in all South Caribbean reefs. Lionfish are a major problem for local fisherman by displacing native fish species. The aim of this study was to determine population density, size and diet of lionfish populations at four study sites along the Southern Caribbean coast of Costa Rica. Two of the sites were located inside the National Park Cahuita where regular lionfish removal occurs, whereas the other two study sides do not experiment this kind of management. Total length and wet weight of >450 lionfish individuals were determined between March and June 2011. Three relative metrics of prey quantity (percent number, percent frequency, and percent weight) were compared from ~300 lionfish caught with the polespear in shallow waters (<7m depth). Population density was assessed weekly through visual transect surveys. Our results showed that lionfish preyed mostly upon teleosts and crustaceans. Teleosts dominated lionfish diet in percent frequency (71%) and percent weight (85%), whereas crustaceans had the highest percent number (58%). The top five teleost families of dietary importance were Pomacentridae, Acanthuridae, Blennidae, Labridae and Serranidae.

Therefore, to contribute to this knowledge, this study aimed to morphologically describe the early stages of development (eggs, larvae and juveniles) of S. pappaterra using morphometric and meristic traits, and to assess changes in growth rates throughout larval and juvenile development by analyzing the relationships between various morphometric traits using analytical regression models. Both juvenile and adult individuals with mouth-brooded offspring were collected along the basins of the Cuiabá and Manso Rivers in the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil between March 2000 and March 2004. After the adults were identified, the offspring were classified according to its stage (embryonic, larval or juvenile period), and various morphometric and meristic variables were individually measured (when possible). The eggs of this species are yellow in color, oval shaped, show dendritic pigmentation within their yolk, have small to moderately sized perivitelline spaces and lack a mucous membrane and oil droplets. The horizontal and vertical diameters of the sample yolks ranged from 1.43mm to 2.70mm and 1.05mm to 1.68mm, respectively. The standard length of the larval period varied from 4.30mm to 7.16mm, and the standard length of the juvenile period varied from 10.29mm to 24.57mm. Larvae exhibit yolk sacs with internal dendritic pigmentation and dark punctate pigmentation in the dorsal and ventral body regions, whereas irregular transverse spots along the flanks are observed during the juvenile period. Adhesive organs are only present during the yolk-sac stage and at the beginning of the flexion stage. The mouth is terminal during all stages of development. The myomere number varied from 22 to 29 (9 to 16 pre-anal and 10 to 16 post-anal), and the maximal numbers of fin rays and spines were as follows: dorsal, xvI+10; anal, Iv+8; pectoral, 16; and pelvic, I+8. Growth analyses identified periods of important change in larval morphology (i.e., metamorphosis), particularly during the flexion and post-flexion stages and in juveniles. Therefore, the morphological development of S. pappaterra is consistent with the ecological requirements of this species, which primarily occurs in structured lentic environments with aquatic macrophytes.",4,26299120,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,25,22152075,10.15517/rbt.v63i1.14121,Eggs | Fish | Larvae | Ontogeny | Pantanal Eartheater | Paraguay River Basin,all,All Open Access

However, its use is highly controversial for the possible impact on not-target organisms, such as amphibians, which are vanishing at an alarming and rapid rate. Due to the high solubility in water and ionic nature, the glyphosate requires of surfactants to increase activity. In addition, for the control of coca (Erythroxylum coca) and agricultural weeds in Colombia, formulated glyphosate is mixed and sprayed with the adjuvant Cosmo-Flux®411F to increase the penetration and activity of the herbicide. This study evaluates the acute toxic and sublethal effects (embryonic development, tadpole body size, tadpole swimming performance) of the mixture of the formulated glyphosate Roundup® Active and Cosmo-Flux®411F to anuran embryos and tadpoles of four Colombian species under 96h laboratory standard tests and microcosms, which are more similar to field conditions as they include soil, sand and macrophytes. In the laboratory, embryos and tadpoles of Engystomops pustulosus were the most tolerant (LC50=3 904µg a.e./L; LC50=2 799µg a.e./L, respectively), while embryos and tadpoles of Hypsiboas crepitans (LC50=2 203µg a.e./L; LC50=1 424µg a.e./L, respectively) were the most sensitive. R. humboldti and R. marina presented an intermediate toxicity. Embryos were significantly more tolerant to the mixture than tadpoles, which could be likely attributed to the exclusion of chemicals by the embryonic membranes and the lack of organs, such as gills, which are sensitive to surfactants. Sublethal effects were observed for the tadpole body size, but not for the embryonic development and tadpole swimming performance. In microcosms, no toxicity (LC50 could not be estimated), or sublethal responses were observed at concentrations up to fourfold (14.76kg glyphosate a.e./ha) the highest field application rate of 3.69kg glyphosate a.e./ha. Thus, toxicity was less in the microcosms than in laboratory tests, which may be attributed to the presence of sediments and organic matter which rapidly adsorb glyphosate and surfactants such as POEA. It is concluded that the mixture of glyphosate (Roundup® Active) and Cosmo-Flux®411F, as used in the field, has a negligible toxic effect to embryos and tadpoles of the species tested in this study.",10,26299127,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,26,22152075,10.15517/rbt.v63i1.12893,Amphibians | Ecotoxicology | Herbicides | Surfactants | Survival,all,All Open Access

Passalids are distributed in tropical and templates zones, and until now, more than 200 species of mites have been associated to them. One of the relationships between passalids and mites is the phoresy where one small animal (the phoretic) seeks out and attaches to another animal (the host) for transportation. Herein, we studied the mites associated to O. zodiacus and O. striatopunctatus; for this, 80 Odontotaenius with miteswere reviewed; passalids were collected in and under decaying logs from six states of Mexico, and were individually kept in vials with 80% ethanol. The specimens were carried to the laboratory and mites removed with fine-pointed forceps under stereo microscope. The mites were stored with 80 % alcohol until some were cleared with lacto-phenol and mounted in Hoyer’s solution. We found 1 945 mites belonging to 13 families (Acaridae, Ascidae, Diarthrophallidae, Digamasellidae, Diplogyniidae, Euzerconidae, Heterocheylidae, Histiostomatidae, Klinckowstroemiidae, Laelapidae, Megisthanidae, Trematuridae, and Uropodidae) and 42 species, being the most abundant species Anoetus sp. For O. striatopunctatus (16 specimens) we found 562 mites (95 ♀♀, 34 ♂♂, 197 hypopus, 234 deutonymph, 2 tritonymph) of 11 families and 22 species; the most abundant were Uropodidae (42 %) and Histiostomatidae (26 %). While for O. zodiacus (64 specimens) were found 1 383 mites (300 ♀♀, 204 ♂♂, 608 hypopus, 139 deutonymphs, 133 tritonymphs) of 10 families and 30 species; the most abundant were: Diartrophallidae, Acaridae, and Histiostomatidae (23 % for the two first and 21 % for third).

This study details the home range of the parthenogenic lizard, Aspidoscelis cozumela, an active forager microendemic to Cozumel Island, México, with high preference for open sand beaches. The home range of A. cozumela was compared with other species of Aspidoscelis (gonochoric and parthenogenetic) and other lizards that occupy coastal habitats. Furthermore, the biotic and abiotic factors that may influence home range were analyzed. This study was conducted in the beach located on the East side of the island (area of 4 000 m2) that is composed primarily of halophyte vegetation with high levels of sunlight. From 1999 to 2001, nine samples were taken which included the dry, rainy, “nortes”, and breeding seasons. During each sampling, capture-mark-recapture techniques were conducted and the date, time of day, and snout-vent length (SVL) were recorded to the nearest millimeter. Individuals were located in the study area using a bi-coordinate reference using 10 x 10 m subdivisions of the habitat. Home range and home range overlap were calculated using the convex polygon method in McPaal and home range/SVL correlation was tested using Pearson´s correlation. To calculate females home range, three or more recaptures were considered. A total of 20 home ranges that averaged 45.1 ± 14.0 m2 were obtained and no correlation between SVL and home range size was detected (p = 0.9229, n = 20). However, removing individuals with outlier home ranges (females with home ranges > 100 m2, n = 2) resulted in a positive correlation with SVL (r = 0.61, p = 0.0072, n = 18). A 22.9 ± 5.7% overlap in home range was also detected. The small home range of A. cozumela represents the smallest home range within the Aspidoscelis genus recorded to date (including both parthenogenetic and gonochoric species) and contrasts the theoretical predictions of broad home ranges for widely foraging species. Thermoregulatory benefits and a high population density may explain the small home range of A. cozumela.

The study was conducted in the sectors of Bocon, Brujo and Coco Island in Boca Zacate, from 2008 to 2013.

A sample of 10 individuals was taken in each hive, totaling 200 per location, for a total of 1 600 individuals. We used fluctuating asymmetry (FA) in size and shape of the forewing through geometric morphometrics. The FA analysis was conducted in order to check bilateral differences. The indexes of size and shape were submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA), where the characters evaluated were used as factors to verify the size and shape differences. The results indicated an asymmetry on the shape of the wing (P < 0.001) but no asymmetry was observed on wing size. Considering FA as an environmental response and high and low impacted areas as a fixed factor, we observed significant differences (P < 0.05). The results for the wing shape in A. mellifera demonstrated that this feature undergoes more variation during ontogeny compared to the variation in size.

In the Caribbean, Donax striatus has an important role for nature and human, nonetheless studies on the population dynamics of this beach clam are scarce and no information exists on secondary production of this species. Growth parameters and secondary production of D. striatus were estimated from February 2008 to November 2009 at Las Balsas beach, Northeastern Cuba, in order to provide basic information for management purposes. In each month 45 samples were taken by means of a PVC corer of 0.025 m2 area and sieved with a 1 mm mesh. Animals were measured and weighted with and without shell. A total of 5 471 specimens were collected during the sampling period. Shell length ranged from 2.7-33.3 mm. Growth parameters estimated from length frequency data were L∞ = 36.1 mm, K= 0.8/yr and t0 = 0.2/yr. The growth performance resulted in values of Φ´= 3.02. Life span was 2.4 yrs and mortality rate was 3.07 /yr. In 2008, mean abundance of D. striatus ranged between 17.1- 770.7 ind./m2. In 2009 the lowest mean abundance was 34.4 and the highest was 892.5 ind./m2. During 2009 biomass and production was more than twice higher in comparison with 2008. Individual production showed highest values in the 24 mm shell size (3.74 g/m2.yr) and 25 mm (0.71 g/m2.yr), considering mass with shell and without shell, respectively. During 2009 abundance of individuals with 15 mm shell length or more increased resulting in higher biomass and production, compared to 2008. Using the conversion factor of wet mass to ash free dry mass (AFDM), annual production ranged between 2.87-6.11 g AFDM/m2.yr, resulting in a turnover rate (P/B) between 5.11 and 3.47 in 2008 and 2009, respectively.

In order to establish whether a plant disease, characterized by the loss of leaf pubescence (PPF) and attributed to the pathogenic action of endophytic microorganisms, is the cause of the increasing mortality of population, the physiological performance of the species was evaluated with and without PPF. The incidence (% leaves affected in each of the 27 individuals in the current population) and severity (% leaf area affected on 135 leaves) of the PPF were monitored over a period of nine months, in three topographic zones of different heights. During four consecutive days in both dry and wet season, physiological parameters as chlorophyll content index (ICC), stomatal conductance (Gs) and leaf temperature (Tfol) were measured in healthy and affected leaves. The study was complemented with isolations and pathogenicity tests to identify the causal agent of the PPF. Overall, although the disease incidence in E. paipana was constant over time, the severity progressed surpassing 60 % of the leaf area. The increasing of severity in the upper side of leaves was attributed to the photo-oxidative effect of high radiation between 11:00 h and 14:00 h of the day. The reduction of functional leaf area because of the PPF, led to low Gs with serious implications for carbon fixation and thus limiting growth and biomass renewal. The effect of season in Tfol varied according to the topographic zone, while the ICC did not present a defined pattern with respect to the PPF; its low values could be associated with the production of other pigments. Finally, although it is not possible to ensure that Botrytis sp. is the causative of the loss of leaf pubescence, it is postulated as the most probably causal agent due to its high representativeness in the isolates and its infectious potential during the pathogenicity tests. In general, the reduction of healthy leaf biomass and decrease of physiological performance suggest that PPF affect negatively the survival of E. paipana, which means that the use of biological controllers could be a strategy to mitigate its effect on the population.",0,26666137,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,37,22152075,10.15517/rbt.v63i3.15939,Chlorophyll content | Espeletia paipana | Leaf temperature | Pathogenic disease | Pubescence | Severity | Stomatal conductance,all,All Open Access

DP isolates are hemibiotrophs and have different sources of primary inoculum as stubble and seeds to restart cycles of parasitism - saprophytism. They colonize host tissues from early plant stages and establish different nutritional relationships, acting as endophytic and necrotrophic fungi. The plasticity of the Phomopsis genus has favored its expansion to different agro-ecosystems and various hosts constituting an epidemiological risk. The objective was to validate the identity and evaluate the biological relationships among 12 isolates of P. longicolla and D. phaseolorum var. sojae (anamorph P. phaseoli var. sojae) obtained in different tempered and subtropical agro-environments of Argentina, in order to analyze the variability and strategies for preserving fungal biodiversity. Macromorphological attributes (such as texture and color of colonies, stroma shape and distribution, pycnidia and perythecia shape and distribution) and micro-morphological characteristics (such as size and shape of conidia, asci and ascospores) allowed identifying three new isolates as P. longicolla. A complementary molecular analysis was also made to overcome the limitations derived from the morphological analysis, thus the AFP.8413 isolate was finally identified as P. longicolla. The molecular characterization was useful to identify the evaluated isolates and to group them in four taxa of the Diaporthe-Phomopsis complex: ten isolates were included in P. longicolla, one isolate was included in D. phaseolorum var. sojae (anamorph P. phaseoli var. sojae), one isolate was identified as D. phaseolorum var. caulivora and two isolates were included in D. phaseolorum var. meridionalis. The use of phenotipic and molecular tools have contributed to an accurate identification of P. longicolla, and comprehension about the biological relationships (homo or heterothallic hibridizations) among D. phaseolorum varieties (P. phaseoli) and species of Diaporthe-Phomopsis.

The aim of this study was to systematize and analyze data distribution patterns of felids in the state of Michoacán, in the Central-Western Mexico. We conducted a review of literature and databases to compile species presence records in the study region. Moreover, we analyzed data obtained from ten years of field work conducted in the region, in which complementary methods (detection of direct and indirect evidence of species occurrence along transects, camera-trapping and interviews to local people) were applied to detect the presence of felid species.

Specimens were collected quarterly in eight sites from February 2010 to November 2013 using gillnets (12 to 70 mm mesh between adjacent knots). The specimens captured were counted and the following biometric and biological data were analysed: standard length, total weight, and reproductive data, such as, sex, weight and gonadal maturity stage. The species abundances were estimated by CPUE and expressed as the number of individuals per gill net area x gill net exposition time (m2 x h); length frequency histograms were built with intervals of 5 cm. The length-weight parameters were estimated with a linear regression after a logarithmic transformation of the data. With the reproductive data we estimated sex ratio, reproduction period and length at first maturity (L50). We captured a total of 1 071 specimens of P. squamosissimus and 156 specimens of C. monoculus. Both species showed higher abundances in 2010, 0.004306 m2 x h and 0.00022 m2 x h, respectively, but this parameter decreased from 2010 to 2013.

The Lp50 was estimated to be 15.90 cm for P. squamosissimus and 15.65 cm for C. monoculus, and the reproductive data indicated that both species reproduced throughout the year. We concluded that although the population of both species reduced their abundance over the study period, P. squamosissimus and C. monoculus are established and structured populations in the Santa Cruz Reservoir with individuals growing satisfactorily and reproducing in all seasons, without a well-defined reproductive peak.

Natural disturbances contributed to explain the high number of individuals, the low number of liana species, as well as the low values of basal area observed in this study. Our results suggested that the seasonally dry tropical forest of Yucatan Peninsula seems to be resilient to natural disturbances (hurricane) in terms of the observed number of species and families, when compared with the reported values in Mesoamerican seasonally dry tropical forests.

However, little is known about the current status of threatened and endangered felids, which coexist in the Northeastern portion of the Peninsula. Our objective was to estimate the wild cats’ density population over time at El Eden Ecological Reserve (EEER) and its surrounding areas.

The species studied were jaguar (Panthera onca), puma (Puma concolor), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), jaguarundi (Puma yaguaroundi) and margay (Leopardus wiedii). Capture frequency was obtained for all five species and the density for three (individuals/100km2). The density estimated with The Mean Maximum Distance Moved (MMDM), CAPTURE, ranged from 1.2 to 2.6 for jaguars, from 1.7 to 4.3 for pumas and from 1.4 to 13.8 for ocelots. The density estimates in SPACECAP ranged from 0.7 to 3.6 for jaguars, from 1.8 to 5.2 for pumas and 2.1 to 5.1 for ocelots. Spatially explicit capture recapture (SECR) methods in SPACECAP were less likely to overestimate densities, making it a useful tool in the planning and decision making process for the conservation of these species.

In Brazil, bioindicators use is strongly focused in a multimetrical ecological index approach; this way, we investigated the black fly spatial distribution, in relation to abiotic factors correlated to water quality, to provide baseline information for their utilization as standalone indicators of lotic systems integrity. We have tested the hypothesis that environmental changes related to urbanization, lead to decreased abundance and loss in the number of species of the black fly fauna. The sampling was conducted in 10 urban and 10 preserved streams during the dry season (August-September) of 2012, in the mountainous region of Teresópolis, State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The streams were characterized for their environmental integrity conditions and physico-chemical properties of water. In each stream, five different rapid points were sampled in a section of 50 meters, 10 meters apart from each other. The black flies were sampled with a kick-net sampler on rocky substrates. The material was separated and the larvae were sorted in morphotypes, and later, the final instar specimens were dissected and identified with the help of taxonomical literature at species level. A total abundance of 488 larvae from nine species were collected, 5 (1.02 %) in extremely impacted streams, 470 (96.31 %) in intermediate streams and 13 (2.66 %) in preserved streams.

Studies on the population dynamics and stock assessment on fishery target species are thus imperative to sustain their fisheries and the benefits for the society. In Lake Koka (Ethiopia), very little is known about the vital population parameters and exploitation status of the fishery target species: tilapia Oreochromis niloticus, common carp Cyprinus carpio and catfish Clarias gariepinus. Our study, therefore, aimed at determining the vital population parameters and assessing the status of these target species in Lake Koka using length frequency data collected quarterly from commercial catches from 2007-2012. A total of 20 097 fish specimens (distributed as 7 933 tilapia, 6 025 catfish and 6 139 common carp) were measured for the analysis. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters and their confidence intervals were determined from modal progression analysis using ELEFAN I and applying the jackknife technique. Mortality parameters were determined from length-converted catch curves and empirical models. The exploitation status of these target species were then assessed by computing exploitation rates (E) from mortality parameters as well as from size indicators i.e., assessing the size distribution of fish catches relative to the size at maturity (Lm), the size that provides maximum cohort biomass (Lopt) and the abundance of mega-spawners. The mean value of growth parameters L∞, K and the growth performance index ø’ were 44.5cm, 0.41/year and 2.90 for O. niloticus, 74.1 cm, 0.28/year and 3.19 for C. carpio and 121.9 cm, 0.16/year and 3.36 for C. gariepinus, respectively. The 95 % confidence intervals of the estimates were also computed. Total mortality (Z) estimates were 1.47, 0.83 and 0.72/year for O. niloticus, C. carpio and C. gariepinus, respectively. Our study suggest that O. niloticus is in a healthy state, while C. gariepinus show signs of growth overfishing (when both exploitation rate (E) and size indicators were considered). In case of C. carpio, the low exploitation rate encountered would point to underfishing, while the size indicators of the catches would suggest that too small fish are harvested leading to growth overfishing. We concluded that fisheries production in Lake Koka could be enhanced by increasing E toward optimum level of exploitation (Eopt) for the underexploited C. carpio and by increasing the size at first capture (Lc) toward the Lopt range for all target species.",14,26666131,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,52,22152075,10.15517/rbt.v63i3.16715,Exploitation rate | Growth | Mega-spawners | Mortality | Optimum length (L ) opt | Size indicators,all,All Open Access

It is also possible that both strategies exist, depending on the characteristics of each nesting beach, with stable beaches leading to repeating nest site selections and unstable beaches leading to nest scattering. To determine the strategy of the Tortuguero population of D. coriacea, female site preference and repetition were determined by studying whether females repeat their nest zone choices between successive attempts and whether this leads to a correlation in hatching and emergence success of subsequent nests. Nesting data from 1997 to 2008 were used. Perpendicular to the coastline, open sand was preferred in general, regardless of initial choice. This shows a tendency to scatter nests and is consistent with the fact that all vertical zones had a high variability in hatching and emergence success. It is also consistent with nest success not being easily predictable, as shown by the lack of correlation in success of subsequent nesting attempts. Along the coastline, turtles showed a preference for the middle part of the studied section of beach, both at a population level and as a tendency to repeat their initial choice. Interestingly, this zone has the most artificial lights, which leads to slightly lower nest success (though not significantly so) and hatchling disorientation.

Differences between areas, and in size and survival between microhabitats, were found only for the first two species. Fruit production was higher in the mature forest for the three species. The study concluded that: 1. The effect of the microhabitats “between canopies” and “under the canopy” in mature and secondary forest areas depends on the species considered; 2. Populations sensitive to light intensity differ in number of individuals, height and fruit production; and 3.

The present study investigated the longevity and germination of the buried seeds of this species in an experimental seed bank. Laboratory germination and viability tests were performed for comparison with field results. Pyrenes (seeds enclosed by the endocarp) were buried in a forest fragment edge in July 2012 (dry season) and exhumed monthly during one year, for the assessment of water content and percentage of germinated and viable seeds. Germination tests were conducted in a Mangelsdorf-type germinator at 30°C under constant light and the viability was assessed by the tetrazolium test. An additional sample of pyrenes was buried to evaluate the percentage of seedling emergence and survival. Climatic and soil moisture data were recorded. In the laboratory, the pyrenes were stored for one year in a temperature-controlled room at 20ºC and 75% (±10%) relative air humidity to assess changes in the percentage of germination and viability over time. In the field, a reduction in seed viability was observed over the study period, with a total loss of viability of non-germinated seeds at seven months after burial. The maximum germination (close to 26%) was observed in the samples that were exhumed between five and seven months after burial. In the field, seedling emergence did not exceed 10% and seedling mortality was not observed. The percentages of germination and of viable seeds decreased both in burial and stored seeds. The stored seeds maintained viability at up to six months, with marked reduction thereafter. After the germination tests (four months) in the laboratory, all of the remaining seeds were nonviable.

The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the forests influences the richness and density of the soil seed bank, but there is a hypothesis that such influence can be changed in anthropogenic areas, where we expect to find lower richness and seed density in relation to the seed bank of mature forests. The richness and seasonal density of seeds in the soil depth of a young caatinga forest, 17 years after an agricultural activity was abandoned, were evaluated and compared with those of a mature forest. The study was conducted at the Instituto Agronômico de Pernambuco - IPA (Estação Experimental José Nilson de Melo), located in Caruaru, Pernambuco, Brazil, in an area of tropical dry forest, known locally as “caatinga”. The local climate is seasonal, the dry season occurring from September to February and the rainy season concentrated in the remaining months. The average annual rainfall over time (time series of 30 years) is 692mm. In each climatic season (rainy and dry), the seed bank was sampled in 210 20x20cm plots (105 in the leaf litter and 105 at 5cm soil depth). The richness and seed density of the soil samples were evaluated by the method of seedling emergence. The seed bank had 47 species, with a predominance of herbaceous plants. Seasonal variation in richness and seed density in the soil (leaf litter + soil) was not significant, but 42 species of the mature forest were absent from the seed bank of the young forest, despite 17 years of natural regeneration and its proximity to the mature forest. On its own, the soil has greater richness and density of seeds than the leaf litter. The depth of seed deposition in the soil bank of the young forest significantly explained 36% of the species richness and 16% of the seed density, with a significant interaction effect with the climatic season only on species richness, explaining 4% of the variation recorded.

Nevertheless, the inter annual fluctuations that have been witnessed in recent years, suggest that this resource requires an urgent analysis of the species reproduction, growth, mortality and the fishery activity, in order to provide a scientific basis to develop sustainable management strategies. For this, weekly samples were collected during the June-December 2012 El Tirano fishing season. Mantle length (ML), total weight (TW), sex and stage of gonadal development were recorded for 1 268 males (9-25cm ML) and 818 females (9-22cm ML). The monthly sex ratio differed from one, except in June and August, with a high percentage of mature individuals in both sexes. Minimum and average sizes were: 11cm ML (428g) and 16cm ML (1 142g) in sexually mature males, and 12cm ML (476g) and 15.35cm ML (844g) in sexually mature females. The length-weight relationship of males (TW=0.7994*ML2.62) and females (TW=1.4552*ML2.33) showed minor allometric growth. Growth was estimated by analysis of the frequency distribution of lengths, using FiSAT software. Growth parameters, estimated by the von Bertalanffy model, were considered rapid, being L∞=26.26cm, W∞=3 769g, k=2.3/year, and to=-0.015/year, in males; and L∞=24.28cm, W∞=2 287g, k=1.8/year, and to=-0.09/year, in females. The maximum age in males was A0.95=1.3 years and A0.95=1.57 years in females. Octopus captures were directly significant with superficial water temperature, but negatively significant with wind velocity and precipitation, which corresponds to a study zone with seasonal hydrologic variability.

The study was conducted during the rainy season of 2003 and 2004, in North Western Venezuela. Fecundity (number of eggs/female), dry weight of egg mass (PSH) and egg quality (C/Neggs) were evaluated in five populations of this species, in mangroves under different environmental conditions (estuarine, marine, hypersaline) and diverse degrees of structural development (arboreal, arbustive, scrub). Reproductive output (Ro) was obtained by the ratio Ro=PSH/dry body weight (PSC); other estimations of Ro were tested: Ro1=PSH/carapace length (CL), Ro2=fecundity/CL. A path analysis was used to explore causal relationships between environmental and morphological variables and reproductive investment (PSH, fecundity). Fecundity ranged from 6 463±831 eggs (Mean±SE) in the hypersaline arbustive mangrove to a maximum of 24 584±2 393 eggs in estuarine arboreal mangrove, which presents the greatest structural development. The reproductive output of females showed significant differences among mangroves, with the highest values of Ro1, Ro2 in the estuarine mangrove females. The results of the path analysis indicated a multicausal effect of morphological and environmental variables; in particular, the salinity showed the greatest influence on fecundity and PSH.

Samples of floral calyx in anthesis and flower buds at different stages of development were fixed and processed according to the methods for light and electron microscopy. The trichomes are randomly distributed throughout the entire inner surface of the calyx and are also visible on the flower buds. These capitate glandular trichomes were composed of a peduncle, having up to nine cells, and a multicellular secretory head with their cells in columnar format and arranged in disc form. The collar cell, which is under the secretory head, divides anticlinally and arranges itself side by side with the mother cell. As they develop, they bend with some of them becoming adpressed to the calyx. Histochemical tests indicate that the secretory head cells produce lipid substances, acidic lipids and phenolic compounds. In the secretory head, the vacuome is dispersed and the cytoplasm possesses a great number of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and leucoplasts, organelles involved in the production of osmiophilic substances.

The sampling program was carried out in two mangroves, Vaza-Barris and Sergipe River, from January through December 2011. Crabs from both mangroves were randomly collected by a professional fisherman during daytime low tide periods, using a fishing rod baited with pieces of a locally abundant gastropod, Pugilina morio, during 20min/area (catch per unit effort). Monthly measurements of air, sediment surface layer and water temperatures were obtained with a digital thermometer and salinity with an optical refractometer. Both crab populations were compared concerning their abundance, body size, sex ratio, size at onset of sexual maturity and fecundity (FI). Abiotic factors (air, water and mud temperature; and salinity) showed no significant differences between sampling localities. A total of 4 370 crabs were sampled, 2 829 from the Sergipe River and 1 541 from the Vaza-Barris River. The abundance and body size of crabs were compared between mangroves, and statistically significant differences were found. The sex ratio for both populations differed from the expected 1:1 ratio, and a significant deviation in favor of juvenile males was obtained, while adults showed a bias toward females. The estimated size at onset of sexual maturity for both sexes was similar in both populations. However, the populations differed significantly in the number and volume of eggs: a higher FI was obtained in females from the Sergipe River, while a higher egg volume was observed in females from the Vaza-Barris River mangrove. These results indicated a tendency to decrease the body size, the abundance of crabs and the reproductive potential of the species, with higher fishing intensities, reinforcing the need to develop a management plan as well as to establish conservation units for G. cruentata in the Northeastern Brazilian coast.

A total sample of 3 316 Trichoptera larvae were collected, belonging to 10 family and 14 genera; six of these genera and one family are new records for the Magdalena department. The caddisflies presented the greatest abundance and richness on leaves in pool, leave in riffles and stones in riffle, where Nectopsyche (28%), Leptonema (17%) and Smicridea (15%) were the more predominant genus. Structure and composition of Trichoptera genus in each site changed in function to the rainfall pattern, and physical and chemical variables presented in the basin, showing the lowest abundance and richness during high rainfall period (October and November), and the greatest abundance and richness in low rainfall period (December, January and February). Likewise, stations with higher values of dissolved oxygen and lower in temperature and conductivity reported the greatest abundance of Trichoptera. The Trichoptera showed affinity to the specific microhabitats, variations in their composition in relationship whit climatic periods and pollution levels of the river. To know others aspects about the Trichoptera distribution, we recommended continuing these studies including annual cycles and increasing the altitudinal gradients.",11,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,71,22152075,10.15517/rbt.v63i2.15604,Caddisflies | Community structure | Stream ecology,all,All Open Access

Unfortunately, they have been disappearing due to human activities such as conversion to farmland, pollution, habitat fragmentation, invasion of alien species, and inappropriate management, resulting in declines in species diversity, wildlife habitat quality, and ecosystem functions and services. In some countries, many programs and actions have been undertaken to reverse the rate of wetland loss by restoring, creating and constructing new wetlands. We report on the assessment of Odonata larvae from a tropical and putatively restored wetland located in the La Mancha Biological Station, CICOLMA (LM, Ramsar site #1336), Veracruz, Mexico. Larval surveys were performed during the 2010 and 2011 dry and rainy seasons in both LM and a reference site, Cansaburro (CB), located approximately 2 km South of LM. Twelve samples were collected during each survey using a D-frame aquatic net (0.2 mm mesh size), sweeping 1 m2 areas along shorelines using a random design. The effect of site, season and year on Odonata larval abundance was explored and diversity and abundance patterns of the assemblages were compared. A total of 3 718 larvae from 25 species (five Zygoptera and 20 Anisoptera) in 14 genera and three families were collected from both wetlands. Species number was equal in both wetlands although abundance was significantly higher in LM. Renyis diversity profiles and species abundance patterns (rank abundance curves) in both sites were similar, suggesting an apparent recovery at LM. Differences in species composition (sites shared 13 species), and species dominance between both assemblages were observed and were related to differences in the aquatic plant structure between both wetlands as a result of extensive plant management in LM and cattle grazing in CB.

In our study we evaluated population features of this species, such as population density, spatial distribution pattern and natural mortality, as well as the relationship between population density and several environmental variables. From October 2009 to September 2011 monthly sampling was carried out using belt transects in three localities of the coast of Oaxaca, Mexico: Estacahuite, Dos Hermanas and Isla Cacaluta. Additionally we recorded in situ temperature, salinity and pH in each locality. Records of irradiation and pluvial precipitation were obtained from databases. Distribution pattern of the urchins was characterized using the Morisitas Index and the models of Poissons probability and Negative Binomial Distribution. Natural mortality was estimated using the modified method of Berry. A step by step analysis of Multiple Lineal Regression was applied to evaluate the relationship between population density and the recorded environmental variables. Mean (± SD) density was 0.12 ± 0.02 ind·m-2(Estacahuite), 0.05 ± 0.01 ind·m-2(Dos Hermanas) and 0.04 ± 0.01 ind·m-2(Isla Cacaluta). The pattern of spatial distribution of T. roseus was aggregated in most of the sampled months in all the localities. In Estacahuite natural mortality was 0.45 and in Dos Hermanas it was 0.46, it was not possible to calculate mortality for Isla Cacaluta. Of the recorded environmental variables, pluvial precipitation showed a direct but not determinant relationship with population density of T. roseus only in Isla Cacaluta. As a result of the differences observed in the three localities we assume that the factors that could determine the population dynamics of T. roseus are: A larger extension of the area in general, and the contribution of sediments by the presence of rivers in the localities, since Isla Cacaluta was the only locality where there was evidence of an important relationship with pluvial precipitation, and this locality undergoes the influence of the rivers Copalita and Coyula, which produce an important increase in sedimentation rates at this community, affecting the entire benthic community during the rainy season.",2,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,73,22152075,10.15517/rbt.v63i2.23135,Echinodermata | Echinoidea | Pink flower urchin | Population parameters | South pacific,NA,NA

Nest-site choice has been studied for most sea turtle species, but the information for Lepidochelys olivacea, the most abundant sea turtle species, is scarce. The present work explores the spatial nesting patterns of L. olivacea and seeks to determine whether this species employs a scatter nesting strategy or chooses to clump its nests based on a specific spatial preference. Night patrols were conducted between July and September 2011 at the beaches of Piro and Pejeperro, located in the Osa Peninsula, in the South Pacific region of Costa Rica. Nest-site location was evaluated by measuring the distance from the tide line to the nest, distance from nest to vegetation, and by noting beach sector according to beach-marker setup. In total, 84 nesting turtles were observed. Sea turtles in both beaches showed a strong preference to locate their nests as far from the tide line as possible, crawling longer distances when presented with wider stretches of beach. Turtles nesting at Piro beach also favored areas that were close to the river mouth, while turtles at Pejeperro preferred to nest near an estuary. It seems that the main driving force that influences L. olivacea to choose a nest site is to protect the eggs from tidal inundation, even if this means a higher predation risk from nesting too close to the vegetation, in addition to a longer trip to the ocean for both the female adult and the hatchlings. Nests near rivers and estuaries may have higher hatching success, which could prompt females to return and select these areas due to imprinting or philopatry. Future research focused on recapture could provide valuable information on individual behavior, and prove whether or not L. olivacea shows strong nest-site fidelity and repeatability of nesting preferences at the individual level.",3,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,74,22152075,10.15517/rbt.v63i1.23116,Imprinting | Lepidochelys olivacea | Nest-site selection | Osa Peninsula | Philopatry,all,All Open Access

We presented data of paleoshells from shell middens, located on Castilletes-Alta Guajira, Venezuela, dated from 3 580 ± 30 años B.P years, and we included data of actual shells from mangrove forests located on Cocinetas laggon (Castilletes) and Maracas Island (Maracaibo lagoon). We examined 185 samples of fixing traces marked by mangrove roots on paleoshells (n = 109) and actual shells (n = 76) of C. rhizophorae. Subsequently, we estimated paleoroot and modern root diameter using a geometric model using shells trace. To validate this model, we directly measured modern roots. Furthermore, a physiognomic study was made in both sites to associate mangrove forest with roots diameter and shells information. Results showed that there were no significant differences between estimated root diameter values obtained from traces of modern shells and the ones recorded by direct measurement of roots (Castilletes P = 0.160854; Maracas P = 0.617271); allowing the use of geometric model to obtain estimated values of paleoroots.

Seeds were collected from a Cerrado reserve located in Corumbataí, Sao Paulo State, which characterizes to have a cool dry season from April to September, and a warm wet season from October to March. M. chartacea seeds are dispersed in the dry season and exhibited a photoblastic behavior both at constant and alternating temperatures. The germination was decreased at irradiances below 17 μmol / m2s, whereas R: FR ratios below 0.4 reduced the germination rate, but not the germination capacity.

Between August 2010 and March 2013 we captured individual hawksbill turtles using entanglement nets along the edges of mangroves and seagrasses of the Golfo Dulce, in southwest Pacific Costa Rica. A total of 62 hawksbills were captured, including 14 recaptures, of which 46 (74.19%) were juveniles (CCL<66cm) and 16 (25.81%) were adults. The catch per unit effort (1 unit: 100m of net for 7h) during the study ranged between 0.03 and 0.07. The Golfo Dulce is highly turbid during the rainy season (May-November), particularly at our study area, as high sediment loads due to intensive runoff lead to poor water clarity. The probability of detection of hawksbills was considerably higher in the dry season (December-April) compared to the rainy season, suggesting these turtles may prefer waters with higher clarity. None of the individuals captured had evidence of internal or external tags, making it possible to conclude that they had not been previously marked at other feeding or breeding sites. A total of 28 (45.16%) individuals were found to host the ectoparasitic barnacle Stephanolepas muricata, which in high concentrations can be harmful by limiting the mobility of organs and limbs. Although consistent in-water quantification of hawksbills in the ETP remains scant, this study represents the longest and most robust marine monitoring dataset for hawksbills in the region to date.

Here, we provide observations on the biology of a new species of Holopothrips associated with leaf-vein galls on four species of Piper at a cloud forest site (Zurquí de Moravia) in Costa Rica. This species colonized the galls soon after the gall-inducing cecidomyiid or one of its parasitoids emerged, and several generations of thrips appeared to occupy the empty galls. A total of 175 empty galls from 34 leaves were collected, brought to the laboratory for dissection under the microscope, and the contents quantified. Holopothrips occupied approximately 75 % of the galled leaves and among the latter they occupied about 40 % of the galls. Every combination of adults, nymphs and eggs was found, which implies that adult thrips move in and out of galls, and possibly do not defend their galls from invasion by other members of their species. However, when disturbed, both nymphs and adults raise the tip of their abdomen and emit a distinctive odor, suggesting a defensive reaction against potential predators. Preliminary evidence suggests that they feed on gall tissue lining the inner cavity and spend very little time outside the galls. The thrips is described as a new species, and is one of only four known species of Holopothrips to have the unusual condition of two pairs of epimeral setae on the pronotum. This new species was compared to these other three Holothrips species, and the remarkable variation of the female spermatheca and the male sternal pore plate is illustrated. Further research is needed to confirm that several generations of thrips occupy empty galls, to determine whether adult thrips do indeed move between galls, and to explore in greater detail their possible chemical defense.",4,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,98,22152075,10.15517/rbt.v63i4.16787,Holopothrips new species | Leaf galls | Piper species | Spermatheca structure,all,All Open Access

A central area with greater marine influence features a vertically homogeneous or well mixed estuary, while the south of the estuary has a balanced (intermediate) condition, through the contributions of the Sierpe river and the tidal regime, which confers characteristics of a partially mixed estuary.

The structure of the seed coat and the shape and size of the seeds were characteristics that allowed species differentiation, and based on the seeds morphological characteristics, an identification key is provided. The seed germination was high (> 90 %) and fast (< 7 days). Germination occured through the axis protrusion of the embryo. Approximately four days after germination, the first leaf develops and is followed by the adventitious roots. After 10-15 days, the second leaf and the new adventitious roots develop. In field conditions, the studied species occur in quartzite soils and their small seeds (dust-like type) germinate faster than the other Eriocaulaceae species (from mesic soils).

However, the fruits of this species has been under an unsustainable extraction and there is a growing interest of establishing this species as a crop; nevertheless, the information about its breeding system is scarce, which is essential for its sustainable management and conservation. This research aimed to study the floral and reproductive biology of V. meridionale in natural conditions, and to analyze the importance of pollinators on its reproduction, in two wild populations of V. meridionale in the states of Cundinamarca and Boyacá, in the Oriental Cordillera of Colombia. For this, we have made different observations and experiments to describe its flower morphology, floral phenology, pollen viability, stigma receptivity, pollen-ovule ratio and nectar production. To study its reproductive system, we performed experiments of flower emasculation, pollinator exclusion and hand pollination (self-and cross-pollination). We found that although the flowers have poricidal anthers, the release of pollen could occur easily without vibration. V. meridionale shows a large floral display, long floral longevity and has female-biased nectar production. The pollen-ovule ratio was of 571±133, which classified the species as facultative xenogamy. This result agreed with the pollination experiments because the plants produced fruits by agamospermy, selfing and outcrossing. However, we registered a strong inbreeding depression, observed in high rates of fruit abortions, after self-pollination. Unlike of self-pollinating fruits, the plant retains those produced by cross-pollination since its formation. The floral traits showed by this species are mechanisms to favor a more diverse guild of floral visitors than only insects able to buzz-pollination. In addition, these floral traits may enhance the pollination probability, and reduce geitonogamy. Moreover, the inbreeding depression suggests that V. meridionale promotes outcrossing as its main reproductive strategy. Therefore, pollinators, particularly bees, are essential for this species reproduction and conservation, and are critical in the maintenance of its genetic variability and fruits production.",7,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,112,22152075,10.15517/rbt.v63i4.18022,Agamospermy | Bees | Buzz pollination | Geitonogamy | Inbreeding depression | Nectar production | Vaccinium meridionale,all,All Open Access

For this reason, the objective of this study is to describe relevant nesting aspects, such as number of nest per season and nesting sites of L. olivacea on the Tortuga Beach in the South Pacific of Costa Rica, during three nesting seasons (2010, 2011, 2012). The beach was divided into 14 sectors of 100m each. Beach patrols were conducted every night from July to December (2010) and July to January (2011, 2012), with the purpose of observing and recording nesting behavior in the turtles as well as to protect their nests. The females observed were identified by means of metal tags applied to their rear flippers. Other data collected included: number of eggs deposited, nest location, hour, biometric data (width and length taken along the curve of the carapace), and the total of nests laid (found with or without the turtle present). After three seasons, 100 females of Olive Ridley Sea Turtle were successfully marked, and a total of 233 nests were counted. The frequency of re-nesting of an individual during a season was of every 14 to 20 days and four individuals re immigrated to nest again over the period of one year. The total population of nesting females during these three years was estimated at 117.

Moreover, the present and past events of climatic anomalies (e.g. severe drought years and erratic rain before the growth season) may cause drastic reductions in population size, leading to the temporal disappearance of some species. Therefore, this three-year study aimed to assess the dynamics of Delilia biflora (Asteraceae), Commelina obliqua (Commelinaceae), Phaseolus peduncularis (Fabaceae) and Euphorbia heterophylla (Euphorbiaceae). The study was conducted in an area of tropical dry forest known as Caatinga, situated in the experimental station of the Pernambuco Agronomic Institute (IPA), in Caruaru, Pernambuco, Brazil. The Caatinga has a semiarid climate with strong seasonal and annual variation in total precipitation. During this study, there was a climatic anomaly event called the 2006 drought, and also erratic rains in the dry season. The birth, death and survival of plants were evaluated monthly using 105 plots (1 × 1 m). Differences in density between years and seasons were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The explanatory power of present and past precipitation on density was evaluated using the General Linear Model. In this study, we present the first record of Euphorbia heterophylla in the studied area. The studied populations were larger during the rainy seasons and in wet years, and were drastically reduced in the driest year and dry seasons. Commelina obliqua was the least sensitive to variation in total rainfall. Regarding the variation in density, all four species were present during all three years. Birth rates were higher during the rainy season, and death rates were higher in the dry season. Sporadic rain in the dry season caused pronounced seedling recruitment followed by death, and had a strong impact on the dynamics of D. biflora, E. heterophylla and P. peduncularis. The precipitation of the current year explained between 3 % - 18 % of the inter-annual density variation, and the explanatory power of the previous year precipitation on the density of populations ranged from 32 % to 67 %.

The nestedness pattern is originated when depauperate communities are subsets of those found in communities with greater species richness, and has normally used to study parasite communities. Therefore, in this study we determined whether the structure of parasite communities of the intertidal fish, of central Chile, relates to host lengths and parasitological descriptors, by the use of nested subset analyses. We collected 2 435 individuals of five fish species from the intertidal rocky zone of central Chile (32º02’-33º57’ S - 70º30’-70º30’ W): Helcogrammoides chilensis, Scartichthys viridis, Auchenionchus microcirrhis, Gobiesox marmoratus, and Sicyases sanguineus; each specimen was analyzed for parasites and its total body length (LT) was measured. The total species richness, average richness, abundance, diversity, and dominance of parasites infracommunity (all parasites in a host specimen) were calculated. Each fish species was classified into three LT ranges, to calculate the indices of nestedness and average of these parasitological descriptors in each LT range. We used the models given in the NTCP (Nestedness Temperature Calculator Program) and NODF (Nestedness metric based on Overlap and Decreasing Fill), considering the presence or absence of parasite species; we also used WNODF (Weighted-NODF) model for parasite abundances. The average of parasitological descriptors and LT of each host species, as well as the indices of nestedness were also calculated and related one another, considering the infracommunity and component community levels. The parasite infracommunity of most fish species exhibited a nestedness pattern structure, with the exception of G. marmoratus and H. chilensis, in some of the LT ranges. No relationship between the nestedness indices and fish LT was found. Nevertheless, direct correlations were observed among nestedness indices, average of richness, abundance and diversity of parasite infracommunity, and an inverse correlation with the parasite total richness (per LT range).

In tropical forests, studies that document epiphyte reproductive phenology are relatively few because of the challenges of tracking plants that live in the canopy.

Though some epiphyte species flowered and fruited throughout the year, the majority showed significant seasonality in phenological events. Based on circular statistics, the timing of mean flowering of different epiphyte species varied, however, timing of mean fruiting for most species tended to occur during the wet season. Insect- and bird-pollinated species had peak flowering during the dry season and late wet season, respectively. Bird-dispersed fruits were present each month of the year with peaks from February to October and again in December. Wind-dispersed fruits were observed eight months of the year with a peak in the early wet season. The timing of epiphyte flowering coincided with flowering of large trees in the area.

The aim of this study, was to evaluate the diversity and composition of vascular and nonvascular epiphytes, in a transition zone between tropical moist forest and tropical dry forest in the Choco biogeographic region of Valle del Cauca, Colombia. For this study, the data were grouped into six zones along the Loboguerrero-Buenaventura road: Zone 1 was closest to the Pacific Ocean (tropical moist forest) and Zone 6 was closest to the subxerophytic enclave of The Dagua River (transition zone to tropical dry forest). The data also were grouped depending on exposure to light (microsites), and the sites were categorized as open, semiopen and closed. A total of 43 trees densely covered by epiphytes were sampled: non-vascular epiphytes were sampled up to 2 m high, while vascular epiphytes were sampled along the entire phorophyte. A total of 485 specimens of non-vascular epiphytes belonging to 77 species of lichens, five of liverworts and eight of mosses were collected, for a total of 90 species. In addition, 5 987 individuals belonging to 24 species of vascular epiphytes were found; Bromeliaceae (six species) was the richest in species, followed by Gesneriaceae, Orchidaceae and Polypodiaceae (each with four species).

Therefore, the present research aims to complete and update an evaluation of the main biological components of ACOSAs reefs ecosystems, using a standard methodology. Between 2013 and 2014, five localities were visited: Dominicalito, Marino Ballena National Park, Caño Island Biological Reserve, Osa Peninsula and Golfo Dulce, on which 27 sites were evaluated. Transects at two depths in each site were done to estimate substrate cover, reef rugosity, macroinvertebrates diversity and density, and reef fishes composition and biomass. Results indicate that ACOSAs reef are moderately complex and on most of them the substrate is dominated by turf (62.7%) and live coral cover is moderate (16.5%). Substrate cover was significantly different between localities, which can be attributed to adverse environmental conditions for reef development (e.g. sedimentation, pollution).

The objective of this study was to make accessible data on trace metals collected during pilot surveys (2000-2006) at four coastal embayments of Costa Rica. Concentrations of Fe, Pb, Zn, Mn, and Ni were determined by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS) and Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (GFAAS), in tissues of the rock snail Acanthais brevidentata, the infaunal bivalves Anadara tuberculosa and Tagelus affinis from three Pacific shorelines (Culebra Bay, Gulf of Nicoya, and Golfito Bay) and in the clam Polymesoda arctata from the Caribbean coast (Moín Bay). In addition, Sn, Cd and Cu were evaluated in tissues of T. affinis. A group of specimens of T. affinis was depurated for 72 hours in filtered seawater from the collection site. Concentrations varied between and within sites and also between parts of the same organisms. Maximum concentrations (μg/g dry weight) were: Fe 2 230 (P. arctata-tissues, Moín Bay), Pb 195 (P. arctata-tissues, Moín Bay), Zn 961 (A. brevidentata-tissues, Golfito Bay), Mn 921(P. arctata-tissues, Moín Bay), and Ni 10.5 (A. tuberculosa-shells, Golfito Bay). Minimum concentrations (μg/g dry weight) were: Fe 5.36 (P. arctata-tissues, Moín Bay), Pb < 0.20 (P. arctata-foot, Moín Bay), Zn 2.75 (P. arctata-shell, Moín Bay), Mn 5.5(A. tuberculosa-foot, Gulf of Nicoya) and Ni 0.83 (A. tuberculosa-foot, Golfito Bay).

The concentrations (except for Pb and Mn) were within values reported in recent literature. The relatively high concentration of Pb was probably related to the use during sampling of leaded fuel in small boat operation at the site, while no evident cause was found for the high Mn values.

The goal of this research was to analyze the diet composition of juvenile specimens of C. robalito and to study its ontogenic changes in Barra de Navidad coastal lagoon located in the Mexican Central Pacific. Specimens were collected between January 2011 and March 2012 using several fishing gears (cast net, gillnets and beach purse seine). A total of 681 juvenile fish were obtained and classified in three size-classes (small < 69 mm TL; intermediate 70-139 mm TL; large ≥ 140 mm TL) to analyze stomach contents. The number of stomachs with some content was 292, and the general diet composition included 14 food items dominated by crustaceans (Alpheidae, Penaeidae, Brachyura) and fishes (Gobiidae, Engraulidae, Mullidae), with minor representation of copepods and insects. Significant changes in the diet composition between size-classes were found. Diet of small and intermediate fish was dominated by juvenile peneid shrimps, and fishes (mainly Gobiidae); while for larger fish, Alpheidae shrimps, and in second place, fish from Engraulidae and Mullidae were dominant in the diet.

With this aim, we collected fruits of Senegalia tenuifolia from a total of nine sites from three different areas in Minas Gerais, from June to August 2011. Fruits were collected and taken to the laboratory in special containers, to allow insect development and description. And then, we characterized the food web of insects associated with these seeds, and described interactions between these organisms and the host plant, and assessed the impact of insect attacks on seed germination with an experiment under controlled conditions. Additionally, we estimated the available NPK content and the Carbon:Nitrogen ratio in both fruits and seeds. In S. tenuifolia seeds, we have found 937 associated insects of 15 species structured in four trophic levels. We found two Bruchinae seed-feeders species: Merobruchus terani and Stator maculatopygus. We also have observed the seed-feeding hymenopteran species Allorhogas sp. 1 and Prodecatoma sp. 1, and hymenopteran parasitoids species such as Eupelmus sp.1, Lyrcus sp.1, Eurytoma sp.1, Horismenus sp.1, Chelonus sp.1, Aprostocetus sp.1, Eiphosoma sp.1 and an unidentified Pteromalinae. Considering quantitative food web metrics, our data have suggested low values of generality and high values of trophic vulnerability, besides others, which demonstrated how species interactions are specialized. The impact of seed-feeding insects on seeds was found severe and prevented their germination. Lastly, seeds contained higher NPK content than fruits. In conclusion, the seed predation food web supported by S. tenuifolia has depicted two different features: specialized species interactions, considering parasitoids and seed-feeding species, and, generalized species interactions, considering host-plant and seed-feeding species. Indeed, seeds are resources with high nutrient concentration supporting a rich and complex food web.

Its geographic location -between the oceanic influences of the Western Central Atlantic and the Eastern Central Pacific- largely explains its enormous biological and ecological diversity.

Oxidative stress caused by higher endogenous ROS may cause irreparable damage to cells, leading to the loss of seed viability. Considering that the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) composes the first enzymatic antioxidant defense mechanism, this study aimed to evaluate zygotic embryos of Araucaria angustifolia recalcitrant seeds during storage regarding changes in SOD activity. Besides, some of the major alterations resulting from oxidative stress, e.g., lipid peroxidation and changes in proteins and DNA integrity were also measured. Approximately, 7 000 seeds were harvested from a population in Southern Brazil and stored for 180 days under laboratory (L, laboratory temperature), refrigeration (R, 5 ± 1 °C) and freezing (F, -18 ± 1 °C) conditions. The analysis of lipid peroxidation through TBARS levels, SOD activity, protein profile by electrophoretic separation, and integrity of genomic DNA were performed at 0, 60, 120, and 180 days of storage. The results revealed an increase in lipid peroxidation and SOD activity, especially during the L storage, a condition in which there was an extensive degradation of proteins. Some proteins (i.e., 45, 32, and 31 kDa) were expressed only in embryos stored under R and F conditions. No damage was observed in the nuclear DNA integrity for the evaluated period of seed storage at R and F conditions. The F samples maintained the biochemical traits of interest throughout the storage period, with the exception of the protein profile. However, such changes are limiting for the maintenance of seed viability.

Tiny crabs, Dissodactylus crinitichelis Moreira, 1901 living associate with these irregular echinoids. It is unclear whether the presence of crabs can affect the fitness of hosts and if this effect may be dependent on the abundance of crabs that a sand dollar is capable of hosting. If we consider that sand dollars act as substrate for symbionts then, they are subject to intraspecific competition for space. Based on this assumption, we hypothesize that the abundance of crabs will be positively correlated with sand dollar size. Two sampling campaigns were made, one in September - 2011 and other in May - 2012. Sand dollars were counted and measured in situ at the tidal flat in front of Cobras’ Island (25° 29’ 5” S - 48° 25’ 48” W) in the Paranaguá Bay - Southern, Brazil. Four parallel transects were distributed between depths of 0.5 to 2 m and the number of individuals were counted in a sample area of 4 m2. In another moment, 164 sand dollars and their symbionts were measured. We observed 906 specimens of E. emarginata (558 in Sep / 11 and 348 in May / 12). Sand dollar densities range from zero to 20 ind. 4 m-², and had an aggregate distribution pattern with patches of different densities within transects and periods (F2, 15 = 9.466, p < 0.01). Patches were observed near to the coast in Sep / 11 compared with May / 12. The symbionts D. crinitichelis present a more variable distribution pattern if compared with sand dollars. In Sep / 11, crabs were clumped distributed as well as sand dollars. On the other hand, in May / 12 D. crinitichelis was random distributed, displaying a distinct pattern than those observed for E. emarginata hosts. No relationship between size of E. emarginata and the number symbionts was observed (Longitudinal axes: r = - 0.021, p < 0.05; Transverse axes: r = - 0.017, p > 0.05), refuting the hypothesis that space is a limiting resource for the crabs. On the contrary, distribution patterns of D. crinitichelis were seemingly influenced by the distribution of their host population, rather than by one single host specimen. This suggests that other factors (e.g., the spatial distribution and connectivity between patches within a population of sand dollars) may be more important for the population dynamics of D. crinitichelis than competition for space per se.",7,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,158,22152075,10.15517/rbt.v63i2.23155,Echinodermata | Irregular echinoid | Pinnotheridae | South atlantic | Spatial distribution,NA,NA
