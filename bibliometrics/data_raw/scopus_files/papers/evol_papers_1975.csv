The advantage that may arise by virtue of dissimilar allelic sequences is examined in detail by means of a simple example. The bearing of the model on the current neutralist selectionist controversy is discussed. Under the proposed model, the advantage of heterozygotes appears to be inversely correlated with population size, growing as population size decreases."

Two strains are from a small population of flies near Bogota, Colombia, which is geographically isolated from the main distribution of D. pseudoobscura. The third strain is a sample of the main distribution and was collected near Taxco, Mexico. Rate constants were determined at three densities for the three strains. A comparison of the results indicates that average mating rates are independent of density changes over the range of densities tested. Time to first mating decreases as density increases, while the percentage of flies mating in a thirty minute time interval increases at higher densities. An exponential model suggests that the population can be divided into two distinct groups based on mating rates. The frequency of fast maters increases as density increases, suggesting the presence of a switch mechanism which, in the presence of appropriate environmental stimuli, switches slow mating flies to the fast mating state."

Basing the analysis on a method introduced by De Mar (1972), it is argued that these variations are related to differences between the proportion of their lives for which the individual teeth of different reptiles remain efficient. The greater the proportion of time for which teeth remain efficient, the steeper are the replacement waves. The evolution of mammalian dentitions was in part characterized by a lengthening of the efficient life of teeth with the result that the wave replacement of alternate teeth, which can only be clearly recognized in dentitions where teeth are efficient for between 1/3 and 2/3 of their life, was lost. In reptiles the efficient life of a tooth may be limited, not by the exigencies of wear and tear, but by the fact that a growing animal requires increasingly larger teeth. The more rapidly an animal grows the more rapidly it requires to replace small teeth by larger teeth which are more commensurate with its size. The decrease in the rate of tooth replacement in mammals may have been related to a decrease in the rate at which the animal grew which, in turn, would have prolonged the efficient life of a tooth."

Juvenile mortality as well as rigid and flexible selection have been shown to be unrelated to the ideas illustrated by the published examples of soft selection. The following definitions are suggested: hard selection is both density and frequency independent; soft selection is both density and frequency dependent. Under this classification, selection that is now referred to as 'density dependent' would be frequency independent while that known as 'frequency dependent' would be density independent. An analysis of an ecological model presented by Clarke reveals that under certain conditions α, k, and w selection all qualify as soft selection. Clarke's α selection is always soft; his k selection may at times be density dependent only."

The most striking trends over the last decade were a reduction in frequency of the PP chromosome on the Pacific coast and a concomitant increase in the frequency of TL.

This problem is studied mathematically, and the results obtained indicate that the amount of reduction in verage heterozygosity per locus depends not only on the 'size of bottleneck' but also on the rate of population growth. If population size increases rapdily after going through a bottleneck the reduction in average heterozygosity is rather small even if bottleneck size is extremely small. On the other hand, the loss in the average number of alleles per locus is profoundly affected by bottleneck size but not so much by the rate of population growth. This difference occurs mainly because random genetic drift eliminates many low frequency alleles. However, the average number of alleles per locus increase faster than the average heterozygosity when population size is restored. Application of the theory developed to the Bogota population of Drosophila pseudoobscura supports Prakash's postulate that this population has grown very rapdily, starting with a few migrants from a Central or North American population."
