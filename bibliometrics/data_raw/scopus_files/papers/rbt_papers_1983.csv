Dermatogliphs were analyzed in relation to sex, bilaterality or assymetry and differences in pattern frequencies between localities. The sample included 134 males and 127 females in two groups, according to their ethnic and linguistic origin: Western Guaymi (Movere), from Limoncito and Abrojo, and Eastern Guaymi (Murire or Buglere) from Limoncito. When compared with other Amerindian groups, the Guaymi presented a very low finger pattern average, as well a low total ridge count. The Movere subgroup, showed similarities among different patterns both in Limoncito and Abrojo. However there are significant differences between the Murire and Movere groups in relation to the ridge count (ab; bc), atd angle; frequency of designs at the interdigital zone 4; bilaterality; and sex. The results obtained confirm the existence of a marked evolutionary divergence between the two groups.",1,6679611,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,2

The first appear as spheroidal structures with some irregularities on the surface. Under the transmission electron microscope these irregularities are composed of islets from a material morphologically similar to cytoplasm, and with structures that resemble a fragment of rugose endoplasmic reticulum. The membranes in specimens fixed immediately after secretion are tri-layered, similar in appearance to those of a single membrane, but in samples fixed between two and four hours after secretion the details are unclear.

Eighteen of the total patients died during hospitalization. Suicidal ingestion was the principal cause of severe and latent poisoning, especially in urban areas, followed by occupational poisoning in agricultural workers in mild and moderate cases. Occupational poisoning was common in men; in women it was attempted suicide and in children accidental poisoning. Under 40 years of age, the main cause was suicidal ingestion among both men and women, and occupational poisoning after 40 years of age. After discharge from the hospital, 19.6% of the total poisoned patients were referred to psychiatric treatment; 22.7% and 18.2% had had mental and alcoholic problems, respectively, prior to poisoning. Attempted suicide was the principal cause of poisoning in 86.4% of these patients, indicating emotional instability. In this study, the incidence in psychiatric consultation after discharge from the hospital is not indicative of a relationship between mental disorders and acute insecticide poisoning. In 42.6% and in 22% of the deceased patients pralidoxime (PAM) and atropine respectively, were not administered as antidotes in the emergency room. Aminophylline and skeletal muscle relaxants among other contraindicated drugs were administered as part of the treatment in these deceased patients. The consequences of this misguided treatment are questioned.",11,6665252,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,6

Rates of incidence ranged between 12.6 and 153.2 per 100,000 inhabitants in men and 10.6 and 56.6 in women. Variations in the incidence of gastric cancer rates were studied in relation to ecological parameters, including certain soil and drinking water characteristics as well as the presence of vitamins A and C in serum. No significant relation was found between gastric cancer rates and the presence of vitamins and of several components in drinking water. However, a multivariate analysis considering nine soil components and pH showed a statistically significant (p less than 0.01) association with pH, K, Zn and Fe, which account for 22% of the variation in the incidence rates. A dynamic and multifactorial model is proposed to explain regional variations in cancer rates, with a tentative application of this model to the results obtained.",6,6665251,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,8

Laboratory procedures included chemical tests and one-dimension paper- electro- and column-chromatography. Phenylketonuria was found in a mentally retarded girl and in one of her brothers; iminoglycinuria in a mentally retarded boy and heterozygote cystinuria in a man with manic-depressive psychosis. The percentage of high excretors of beta-aminoisobutyric acid (B-AIB) in the controls (4.88%) was similar to previous findings in the Caucasian race. The children with hearing and speech defects showed a number of high excretors of B-AIB significantly lower (X2 = 5.32; p less than 0.025) and the children with visual defects a number of hyperglycinurias significantly higher (X2 = 9.19; p less than 0.05). Previous non-consistent findings on the excess of high excretors of B-AIB in Down's syndrome were not confirmed in this study.
