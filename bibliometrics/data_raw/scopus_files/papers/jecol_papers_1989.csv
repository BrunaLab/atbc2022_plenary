The seasonal trend of leaf length was used to delimit annual complements of leaves, of which up to 20 persisted. Correlation analysis between 4 measures of annual leaf performance showed several similarities between 2 Svalbard populations, a few between the low altitude population from Svalbard and that from Swedish Lapland and none between the higher altitude Svalbard population and that from Swedish Lapland. July temperatures and precipitation during May were particularly important for leaf development in the Svalbard populations. In Swedish Lapland, number of leaves per year was correlated with summer temperatures but only negatively with precipitation. At the Swedish site, protection of leaf primordia from frost is probably greater than in Svalbard because of a more persistent snow cover. Correlations between number of leaves per year and the other measures of leaf performance and weather in the previous year were particularly strong in the Svalbard populations, demonstrating the performation of an annual leaf complement by the High Arctic Svalbard populations. This may be an important mechanism to buffer production against particularly adverse weather conditions during the growing season.

The species with the highest natural densities of seed rain also had the greatest per-seed colonization success, even though negative density-dependent effects must have been strongest for those species. Seed size was positively correlated with survivorship on mounds, but was unrelated to the sizes of individual colonists in gaps or on mounds. Overall, canopy gaps and gopher mounds favoured the same species that colonized well in undisturbed sites. Both types of disturbance increased colonization by perennials in annual-dominated vegetation, and canopy gaps were required for changes in species dominance in perennial vegetation. -from Author",77,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,19,NA,NA

In areas of poor growth potential, fecundity of Sorghum is considerably reduced and density of plants is very low. Populations would not be able to persist in these regions were it not for migration of seeds into them from the surrounding areas favourable for Sorghum growth. In the short term, an annual dry season fire will reduce density of flowering Sorghum plants by c40%; a rainy season fire, following seedling emergence, has the potential to eliminate populations completely, because Sorghum lacks a persistent seed bank. A high density of the seed-harvesting ant Meranoplus can reduce the density of Sorghum by an order of magnitude.

Fruit set in B. ericifolia was examined in detail. The proportion of inflorescences setting fruit was generally lower in late-season samples. Resource limitation probably explained this. Pollination was limiting fruit set in 1985. Interspecific competition among plants for pollination may be occurring.

At Fleam Dyke over the study interval, E. pseudokerneri decreased in density 100-fold while Gentianella was constant in numbers; Linum was intermediate. Both life-history parameters (generation time, presence of a seed bank) and sensitivity to environmental factors were implicated in the differences between species. Gentianella was more ""stoical' (less sensitive to environmental changes) than Linum, which seemed to be important in the greater constancy of Gentianella.

Potamogeton stands concentrated their biomass at the surface surface during summer, thereby compensating for high water attenuation. The photosynthetic rate of the stand was strongly reduced if the biomass was assumed constant with depth. Simultaneously, the depth strata with highest photosynthetic and respiratory activity and the light compensation point in the canopy moved towards the surface.

Gross O2 production corresponded to total stream photosynthesis at maximum biomass during mid-summer.

Species distributions were very patchy: 4 patch types accounted for c95% of total cover. Three patch types (""perennial patches') were dominated, respectively, by 1 of 3 species of perennial grasses, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Holcus lanatus or Deschampsia holciformis. ""Annual patches' were dominated by annual grasses, including the most abundant annual Vulpia bromoides, the perennial grass Rytidosperma pilosum and forbs. Species not present in patches contributed little to the seed rain and nothing to recruitment in the interiors of those patches. Species differed significantly in the densities of their seed rain in the patches they dominated, ranging from 2300 m-2 for R. pilosum to 82 300 m-2 for H. lanatus. Density of seed rain was patchy on all spatial scales examined (from cm to km), but was not significantly correlated with densities of recruits on any scale for the perennial species. However, V. bromoides recruitment correlated positively with the density of its seed rain on small spatial scales (up to 1 m2) in annual patches. The poor relationship between seed rain and recruitment for the perennials probably reflects the over-riding importance of adult interference as an influence on seedling establishment in the perennial vegetation. A. odoratum has relatively high recruitment (30 m-2) in the patches it dominated. Other perennials had very low recruitment in their own stands (less than 5 m-2). V. bromoides had the highest recruitment (904 m-2) in annual patches. -from Author",83,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,58,NA,NA

The critical light level, below which shoot population could not be maintained, was c30% of full light in Q. acuta and c10% in Q. gilva. Actual light intensity under foliage-crowns of both species was less than that of their critical light level, due to active multiplication of foliage at the canopy surface and light interception by old leaves. The process of crown development was described mathematically as changes in the spatial distribution of foliage density, taking into account light conditions. Such changes were estimated from the leaf area of current-year's shoots, leaf survivorship and shoot population dynamics (ie yearly changes in the spatial distribution of shoot population density). All parameters in this model were obtained from actual crowns. The development of interacting foliage-crowns was reproduced by simulation. In actual foliage-crowns, dense foliage was found in the upper and peripheral parts of the total canopy composed of both crowns, and foliage density was low at the lower side. -from Author",64,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,59,NA,NA

The remaining 24 species were inconsistent, being significantly more abundant on the protected side in some sites and on the grazed side in others. Of the inconsistent species, 14 showed a pattern of responses over sites that could be explained by a unimodal response to grazing intensity, with an optimum at intensities between the extremes of complete protection and very heavy continuous grazing. Perennial species with long growing seasons were somewhat more frequent among protection increasers, and their total cover greater in protected grassland. Grazing responses was strongly and significantly associated with plant growths form: protection increasers were mostly tall erect plants; grazing increasers mostly small, prostrate or rosette plants; and species with intermediate responses mostly erect plants of medium height. Ungrazed grassland was dominated (60-80% cover) by tall perennials and tall, annual grasses. Under light to moderate grazing their cover decreased to the benefit of annuals of a wide range of growth forms and families; of those, under heavy grazing, small and prostrate annuals, rosette crucifers and thistles remained abundant. Responses to grazing can be explained best by the opening of establishment gaps in the closed sward of foliage and mulch maintained by the dominants. At moderate to heavy grazing the vertical differential defoliation gradient imposed by cattle, particularly early in the growing season, becomes the major mechanism of grassland change. -from Authors",407,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,60,NA,NA

All perennial species effectively inhibited colonization of their stands, but annual vegetation could be colonized by Anthoxanthum and to a lesser degree by Holcus. Species differences in colonizing ability depended in part on their different densities of seed rain, but there were major differences in intrinsic, per-seed colonizing ability as well.

The 3 species which resprout vegetatively after fire, produced less seeds and retained smaller seed banks than 2 non-sprouting species. Contiguous patches of scrub-heath were burned in spring and autumn. The spring fire was cooler, and both sets of seed released subsequently did not germinate until the following (common) winter. Rate of seed release was higher after the autumn fire. The non-sprouting species released more seeds after each fire and yielded more seedlings per parent than the resprouting species. Percentage (field) germination of the non-sprouters was not consistently different from that of the resprouters. Seeds exposed on the soil surface during summer soon lost viability compared with buried seeds. The large number of seedlings established up to 8 months after the spring fire resulted from many seeds escaping exposure by dispersal into litter-covered ""safe' sites. Although litter microsites covered only 30% of the ground surface after the spring burn, they accounted for 80% of seedlings both before and after the summer drought. Litter microsites covered only 14% of the autumn-burned site but accounted for 60% of seedlings before summer and 40% after summer, suggesting density-dependent thinning of seedlings. The autumn-burned site supported more than twice the density of seedlings than the spring-burned site by the end of the 1st winter. Summer mortality of seedlings was 32% in the spring-burned site and 65% in the autumn-burned site, equalizing the seedling:parent ratio at both sites.

The largest diaspores (E. botrys) rarely buried themselves, regardless of substrate or time of exposure to water. In the field, the rate of diaspore burial declined throughout the season. The 2 larger diaspores (E. botrys, E. brachycarpum buried themselves more often than the smaller diaspores (E. cicutarium, E. moschatum); large numbers of diaspores (of both sizes) failed to bury themselves and thus remained on the soil surface over the summer months. Percentage germination was higher when diaspores were buried. With normal watering, seedling biomass was greater for those in bare soil compared to those in straw-littered soil. However, under drought conditions, seedlings in the straw-littered soil were larger than those in bare soil. The sixfold difference in diaspore size among these species does not reflect partitioning of microhabitats, but may relfect the advantage that large plants, which produce large diaspores, may have when the growing season (= rainy period) is relatively long and, in contrast, the advantage that small plants, which produce diaspores sooner, may have when the growing season is short. -from Author",29,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,64,NA,NA
