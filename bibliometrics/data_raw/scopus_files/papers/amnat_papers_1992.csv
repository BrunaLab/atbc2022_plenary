There was qualitative agreement with the time-minimization hypothesis, but quantitative agreement requires that specific assumptions can be fulfilled for both species: 1) consistent differences in expected speed of migration should exist between different individuals of the same species and/or 2) the expected speed of migration should increase along the route. Both of these assumptions are probably valid, and ringing data suggest an increase in bluethroat autumn migration speed along the route.

The model suggests that investment in male function imposes an opportunity cost with respect to female allocation by diverting resources from further vegetative growth that could have fueled later fruit and seed maturation. The optimal sex allocation predicted by the model is more female biased than the allocation expected if a plant instantaneously divides a common pool of reproductive resources. If fruiting tissue is photosynthetic, the optimal allocation is even more female biased. Temporal factors may help account for the frequently observed female bias in carbon allocation.

These analyses identify the level(s) at which selection is acting and distinguish indirect from direct selection acting at other levels. Contextual analysis of group selection in the absence of individual selection indicates that indirect selection is acting on individuals. Under soft selection, though all groups have the same relative fitness, contextual analysis detects equal and opposite levels of group and individual selection resulting from frequency-dependent selection acting within groups.

The authors apply these principles to the use of a particular spatial resource, hilltops, by Euphydryas editha, distinguishing between the occupation of a hilltop location (resource use) and preference for these locations or ""hilltopping' behavior. Previous authors estimated that the mating success of male E. editha on a hilltop was lower than that on the slopes below. In consequence, hilltopping by these males was labeled ""maladaptive'. The evidence presented by these authors fails to demonstrate 1) that hilltopping behavior occurred, 2) that, if it did occur, it was variable among individuals, and 3) that, if variation of hilltopping was present, it was associated with mating success. -from Authors",13,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,22,NA,NA

Herbivory may enhance plant diversity in two qualitatively different ways. The first is global frequency dependence, the level of herbivory suffered by a plant decreasing as the species becomes rare. Second, spatial variability in levels of herbivory can create ephemeral, local refuges for herbivory for each plant species. Both of these mechanisms operate only if there is not a negative correlation between a plant's palatability and its competitive ability. Both mechanisms also require that herbivores have sufficiently strong diet preferences (or, equivalently, that the plants have sufficiently different grazing tolerances). If there is no relationship between palatability and competitive ability, then plant diversity is a monotonically increasing function of the herbivore's degree of monophagy. If there is a positive correlation between palatability and competitive ability, then the diversity/degree-of-monophagy relationship may be either monotonically increasing or humped. -Authors",136,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,23,NA,NA

The author develops a model that quantitatively analyzes the costs and benefits of defensive spine formation in D. pulex by modifying life tables of both the spined (SM) and typical (TM) morphs of this prey to account for the effects of different levels of predation on population growth rate. At low Chaoborus densities the population growth rate (and thus fitness) of TM exceeds that of SM and spine formation is therefore disadvantageous in the population. Above a critical Chaoborus density the opposite is true and spine formation is favored. The exact value for this critical Chaoborus density is influenced by both food availability for Daphnia and the degree of spatial overlap between predator and prey. Spine induction is more advantageous under relatively poor food conditions, so the cost of this antipredator defense may not be an energy loss, but merely a lengthening of the developmental process in spined instars. The model also predicts that any predator or prey behavior that reduces spatial overlap between the two species in nature will make the formation of defensive spines less advantageous. -from Author",71,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,24,NA,NA

Individual growth rates of copepods can be accurately estimated from data on generation times and the weights of eggs and adults. Analysis of 181 separately published estimates of generation time for 33 species of copepods at environmental temperatures ranging from -1.7° to 30.7°C shows that temperature alone explains >90% of variance in growth rate. Temperature dependence of growth rate transcends species differences. Weight-specific growth rate appears to be independent of body size. Food may not be limiting to growth in nature; the impression that food is limiting may be due to sampling at the wrong scales. Another possible cause of the apparent maximum growth rates of copepods in nature is predation mortality, which could selectively remove slower-growing individuals from the population. The temperature-dependent model developed here predicts the phenomenon of decreasing body size with increasing environmental temperature, often observed for single species of copepods. A method is suggested for making more accurate estimates of secondary production by using modern instrumentation to make quasi-synoptic measurements of biomass and temperature and using the temperature-dependent model to estimate individual growth rates. -from Authors",549,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,25,NA,NA

Since birds must position, insert, and withdraw their bills in addition to licking nectar, the optimum at the scale of flower visits is even higher. This ""overhead time cost' of handling flower morphology, for most nontraplining hummingbirds under most natural conditions, is as great as or greater that the cost of handling nectar.

Recruits were defined as saplings of 1-8cm dbh appearing in the 1985 census that were not present in 1982. The ratio of recruits to species i to all recruits was taken as an estimate of the probability that species i would occupy that site as an adult. A few species showed a significant reduction in recruitment probability close to adults, but more species showed a significant increase, and many other species showed no significant spatial pattern. Among canopy trees, 1/3 of the species showed some sign of local reduction in recruitment, but the distance over which the effect extended was usually <5m; however, the most abundant canopy tree, Trichilia tuberculata , showed a sharp reduction in recruitment probability up to 10m from adults. In treelets and shrubs, most species showed strong peaks in recruitment probability close to adults.

Increased predator density may increase the fitness of their prey, while increased prey density may decrease the fitness of their predator. Such unusual interactions are most likely when the adaptive species increase foraging effort in response to increased food availability. The nature of the indirect effects can often be deduced from knowing the sign of the second derivative of foraging cost-and-benefit functions. -from Author",165,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,43,NA,NA

This condition implies some sort of density-dependent interactions among offspring, although it is possible to have either positive or negative sib interactions in fitness functions that are homogeneous in offspring number.

The prediction that habitually diving species have substantially reduced energy expenditure while underwater and correspondingly higher aerobic dive limits than infrequent divers agrees with field observations. Following Boyle's law, aerobic dive limits are predicted to increase with increasing dive depth due to a reduction in upthrust following volumetric reduction of feather-trapped air caused by hydrostatic pressure. It appears energetically more costly for diving birds to forage near the surface than at greater depths. Reduced plumage air to minimize underwater swimming costs, however, probably increases heat loss. Use of fat for insulation is not compatible with minimized flight costs.

Significant phylogenetic autocorrelations were demonstrated for female body size, age at first reproduction, and neonate size. Because the last two life-history traits are strongly correlated with body size, the authors recalculated the autocorrelations using residuals from a linear regression model that removed size-related effects from the life-history traits.

Under most conditions of purely spatial variation in environment, maintenance of polyphenism requires adaptive developmental sensitivity to cues, which results in phenotype-environment matching. Other determinants of the maintenance of polyphenism under spatial variation include relative fitnesses of different phenotype-environment combinations, frequencies of alternative environments, and possible costs of polyphenism. Where variation is temporal, polyphenism is affected by the same parameters but is maintained more readily and may be favoured without adaptive developmental sensitivity. Even where environmental conditions are sufficient for maintaining polyphenism, its evolution may be precluded by constraints on developmental sensitivity that prevent phenotype-environmental matching, costs of developmental switching, or antagonistic pleiotropy that prevents independent evolution of alternative phenotypes. These factors could be highly taxon-specific, which would preclude generalizations concerning the distribution of polyphenism. However, the abundance of seasonal polyphenisms in multivoltine organisms suggests that where environments are favourable, developmental systems are often flexible enough for the establishment of simple polyphenisms.

Thus regular spatial arrangement of colonies cannot be used as a test of any type of competitive effects, since other spatial arrangements can also result from strong competition between colonies. Regular intraspecific spatial arrangement is most readily produced by increased mortality of young colonies that settle near established conspecifics (no competition between species). Spacing is increasingly regular as density increases (density-dependent spacing). Where competition occurs only between established colonies, nest spacing is random, and the spatial statistics are not related to nest density. Persistence was defined as the length of time that all species in a simulation coexisted.

Removal of zero counts from time series is also probably involved, and skewness of population-size values may have an effect as well. Populations showing low temporal variabilities are mainly of two kinds: small populations with moderate to high extinction rates and large populations with low extinction rates.

It predicts that low prey densities during foraging will reduce copula duration. In model 2, sperm reserves increase with diminishing returns during prey foraging. It generates an optimal reproductive pattern - cycles of allocation of time between foraging and mate searching. It again predicts decreased copula duration with reduced diet but also predicts that low prey density reduces the number of mating during each mate-searching phase. If mortality is insignificant during mate searching, copula duration will remain constant throughout the successive matings in a phase. Presence of fresh dung reduces copula duration.

This trait links theories of food webs and nutrient cycles by posing a role of herbivores as functional switches determining both plant community composition and the array of litters returned to the soil. This role appears to be particularly strong in boreal forests, where nutrient availability is low and limits productivity and determines successional pathways, where effects of herbivores are strong and long lasting, and where the same plant traits that determine herbivore preference and response to browsing also determine interactions with soil nutrient availability. Such feedbacks cause the effects of herbivores on ecosystems to persist even after the herbivores are no longer present. -Authors",227,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,86,NA,NA

Prey behavioral time lags should depend on the quality of prey information about predation risk and on the costs and benefits of refuge use. Uncertainty can cause prey to always stay in refuge even though predators are only occasionally present.

However, in organisms with simple life cycles only a relatively restricted set of life-cycle phenotypes may be realized because genetic correlations between juvenile and adult morphology may constrain evolution. Such genetic correlations thus result in trade-offs between efficiencies of resource utilization of juveniles and adults. The evolutionary response to such trade-offs is examined with the help of evolutionarily stable strategy models. Ultimately, the genetic correlations themselves may be modified by selection. A disruption of genetic correlations permits the life stages to respond independently to the different selection pressures they experience. When the niches of the life stages differ greatly, the most probably way to break up the ontogenetic covariance structure and hence the trade-offs in performance between the life stages is through evolution of complex life cycles (metamorphosis). -from Author",108,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,110,NA,NA

The principal effect of nematodes on their hosts is a reduction in female fertility: females of Drosophila putrida and Drosophila testacea are sterilized by these parasites. The prevalence of parasitism varies substantially among host species and through time, showing evidence of seasonal as well as year-to-year variation. Because the principal effect of these parasites is on host reproduction and because they are not highly aggregated among hosts, this parasite-host system may be prone to unstable population dynamics. H. aoronymphium may influence the outcome of competition among its host species. Because these parasites and their hosts have similar population sizes, generation times, and rates of gene flow, they may interact evolutionarily in a dynamically interesting manner. -from Author",46,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,111,NA,NA

The most ecologically complex and interesting case, in which herbivore numbers are food limited and allowed to vary more or less naturally, is considered in detail. This analysis confirms the potential role of parasites as functional ""top predators' and in particular the potential of parasite-induced host mortality to increase the plant equilibrium of otherwise overgrazed systems. This result underlines the dangers of indiscriminate anthelmintic application in marginal grazing systems without consideration of the possible ecological consequences of parasite control. The analysis also underlines two unique features of parasitism in the context of grazing system dynamics. 1) The effect of the coupling of gut parasite transmission to food consumption simplifies grazing system dynamics by linearizing the herbivore's functional response near the parasite equilibrium. 2) The destabilizing impact of parasite-induced reductions in host reproductive rate can throw the system into chaotic plant-herbivore-parasite cycles. -from Author",60,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,112,NA,NA

The authors here cite evidence contradicting Ruben and Boucot's geological interpretation. The Wilder-Dunn hypothesis remains a robust one.
