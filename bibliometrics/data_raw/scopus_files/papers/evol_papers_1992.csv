A. platineum reproduces gynogenetically, that is, sperm from a sexual host species is required to activate egg development but makes no genetic contribution to the developing embryo. Nevertheless, eletrophoretic diversity in populations of some hybrid Ambystoma suggested continual in situ recreation of unisexual hybrids and bidirectional gene exchange between the parental species and the hybrids. A platineum usually lives with, and is sexually dependent on, one of its parental species, A. jeffersonianum. In C Indiana, however, A. platineum populations have shifted their host dependency to A. texanum. Because genome replacement in A. texanum-dependent populations of A. platineum is irreversible, the persistence of A. platineum in A. texanum-dependent populations demonstrates that the major mode of reproduction in A. platineum populations is clonal: A platineum produces mainly triploid eggs that develop gynogenetically. -from Authors",23,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,1

Indirect evidence (numbers of eggs deposited in nests) suggests that the timing of spawning among females was also negatively related to female size.

Larvae of New Mexico spadefoot toads Scaphiopus multiplicatus often occur in the same pond as a large, rapidly developing carnivorous morph and as a smaller, more slowly developing omnivorous morph. Carnivores can be induced by feeding tadpoles live fairy shrimp. Morph determination is reversible. The ability of an individual to become a carnivore or an omnivore is maintained evolutionarily as a response to variability in pond longevity and food abundance. Carnivores survived better in highly ephemeral artificial ponds, because their larger fat reserves enhanced postmetamorphic survival. The two morphs also occupy different trophic niches. Increased competition for food among individuals of the more common morph made the rarer form more successful. Morph frequency within each pond was stabilized at an equilibrium by frequency-dependent morph reversal, which reflected frequency-dependent natural selection on size at metamorphosis; larger metamorphs had higher survival, and individuals reared at a frequency above the pond's equilibrium frequency were smaller at metamorphosis than were individuals of that morph reared at a frequency below the pond's equilibrium. Because neighboring ponds often differed in pond longevity and food abundance, each pond possessed a unique equilibrium morph frequency.

However, nonconspecific brood care may also allow the parasite larvae to control their own development to a greater extent than possible in nonparasitic species. An evolutionary consequence of this may be the loss of the parasite's worker caste if the larvae can increase their fitness by developing into sexuals rather than workers. This loss is particuarly likely in species in which there is little inclusive fitness benefit in working. Retention of a worker caste correlates with characteristics that increase the fitness of working relative to becoming a sexual, such as worker-production of males, high intracolony relatedness, and seasonal environments where the hosts of potential parasite queens are not always available. When the worker caste is evolutionarily lost in perennial species like ants, it disappears rapidly and through a reduction in caste threshold and queen size, so that parasite larvae become queens with less food than required to produce host workers. This evolutionary process, however, appears to lower overall population fitness, resulting in workerless parasite species having small populations and being geographically restricted. In annual species like bees and wasps, workerless social parasitism evolves with no size reduction in queens, which is consistent with an expected lower level of queen/offspring conflict. -Authors",72,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,11

Morphological features used by plants to attract biotic pollinators can be considered in this light, because such ""attractive;' structures are prerequisite for both pollen donation and receipt. A model involving allocation of a limiting resource between attractive structures benefiting both sex functions, structures benefiting male function only, and structures benefiting female function only, is constructed and analyzed using the evolutionary stable strategy approach. Contrary to expectation, conditions resulting in large allocation to attractive structures tend to destabilize hermaphroditism, although the effect is slight. Substantial asymmetry in the benefits accruing to male and female feritlity for a given investment in pollinator attraction produces more pronounced effects, reducing the parameter space in which hermaphroditism is expected. Results of this model are used to assess the importance of ""accelerating grain' curves previously suggested for the evolution of dioecy in flowering plants. Accelerating gains associated with fruit production and dispersal represent female function only, and can be sufficient to initiate eovlution toward dioecy. Accelerating gains associated with pollinator atrraction may contribute to the evolution of separate sexes only if male function benefits from increased investment in attractive structures at a disproportionate rate compared to female function.

Changes in larval form in response to food appear to be adaptive, with increased allocation of growth to the larval apparatus for catching food when food is scarce and earlier allocation to juvenile structures when food is abundant. This phenotypic plasticity among full siblings is similar in direction to the heterochronic evolutionary changes in species that have greater nutrient reserves within the ova and do not depend on particulate planktonic food. This similarity suggests that developmental plasticity that is adaptive for feeding larvae also contributes to correlated and adaptive evolutionary changes in the transition to nonfeeding larval development. If endogenous food supplies have the same effect on morphogenesis as exogenous food supplies, then changes in genes that act during oogenesis to affect nutrient stores may be sufficient to produce correlated adaptive changes in larval development. -from Authors",177,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,21

Average Ne based on isozyme data was 15.8, range 3.4-70.6, and represented a fraction (mean Ne/N = 0.106) of the census number of individuals (mean N = 762.8; range 30.5-5040). Temporal variation in N and variance in flower number each reduced Ne to about a half of N, whereas mating type frequencies and selfing rate caused only small reductions in Ne relative to N. All estimates of Ne based on demographic variables were considerably larger than those obtained from genetic data. The two kinds of estimates were in general agreement, however, when all demographic variables were combined into a single measure. Monte Carlo simulations indicated that effective size must be fewer than c40 for drift to overcome the frequency-dependent selection that maintains the polymorphism for mating type. Applying the average Ne/N value to 167 populations censused in NE Brazil indicated that 72% had effective sizes below this number.

Simulations that included size-biased extinction rates, especially those that incorporated anagenetic size change within species between speciation and extinction events, regularly produced skewed distributions. Although cladogenetic processes, probably play a significant role in body size evolution, there must also be a significant anagenetic component.

This result contrasts with Wright's classical conclusion, based on inbreeding coefficients, that at least one immigrant per island every other generation (Nm>1/2) is necessary for the genetic variance within local populations to approach that under panmixia. The expected genetic variance maintained among islands is inversely proportional to m and increases with the number of islands, but is independent of N. Local extinction and colonization diminish the genetic variance maintained within islands by reducing the effective size of island populations through the founder effect, although the expected genetic variance within islands is nearly as large as that in a panmictic poulation of the same total effective size. If the founders of new colonies originate from more than one island, rates of local extinction and colonization larger than about twice the migration rate will substantially reduce the genetic variance maintained among islands.

These models also lead directly to statistical tests which can be used to compare predictions with phylogenetic trees that are estimated from data.

On the mutational load model there is a positive covariance between the pollen and zygote fitnesses, but it is likely to be small.

Isolation by distance can substantially increase the total variation maintained in continuous populations over a wide range of dispersal patterns, but only if more than one genotype produces the optimal phenotype (genetic redundancy). Isolation by distance alone has only a slight effect on the variation maintained in the total population for neutral alleles. The combined effect of isolation by distance and genetic redundancy, however, allows maintenance of substantial variation despite strong stabilizing selection. Isolation by distance allows mutation and drift to operate independently in different parts of the population. Because of their independent evolutionary histories, different parts of the population independently draw from the available set of redundant genotypes. Because the genotypes are redundant, selection does not discriminate among them, and they will persist until eliminated by drift. The population as a whole maintains many distinct genotypes. This process allows mutation to maintain high levels of variation, even under strong stabilizing selection, and over a moderate range of dispersal patterns the amount of variation maintained in the entire population is independent of both the strength of selection and the variance of the dispersal distance.

In temperate areas where many insects have partial second generations, males should enter diapause developemnt at an earlier date than should females, as a result of late-emerging males being penalized in terms of fewer mating opportunities. The decision to diapause or to develop directly is usually mediated by response to environmental stimuli of which day length is the most important. Hence the mechanism by which males enter diapause at an earlier date than females should be that of the male reaction norm for diapause development being shifted toward longer day legnths when compared to that of females. As a result of the greater tendency of males to enter diapause development, partial second generations that develop directly should be female biased. First generations should be male biased because some males of the first generation are from the previous year. The prediction that males should enter diapause development earlier in the season (at longer day lengths) compared to females was corroborated by rearing Pieris napi under a variety of critical day length regimes producing mixed broods of directly developing and diapausing individuals, and by outdoor rearing of cohorts of larvae of P. napi and P. rapae initiated throughout the season. The prediction that partial second generations should be female biases was corroborated by rearing at constant temperature of P. napi (Pieridae), Polygonia c-album (Nymphalidae), and Pararge aegeria (Satyridae) under critical day length conditions, producing female-biased sex ratio under direct, and male-biased sex ratio under diapause development. -from Authors",52,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,70

The C. nevadensis complex apparently is either an artificial group or else it is monophyletic and its genetic history includes loss of the original mtDNA in either Owens Valley or Ash Meadows-Death Valley following genetic introgression after an invasion by a pupfish carrying a divergent mtDNA. -from Authors",42,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,80

Presence of cryptic unisexuals that are functionally unisexual, but retain the appearance of hermaphroditism in both sexes, is strong evidence for the ancestral status of hermaphroditism. Production of nonfunctional pollen, by female cryptic unisexuals, is a new instance of a phenomenon which has previously been reported for a few other species. The two forms of dioecy are also morphological markers which are useful in hyvbridization studies for tracing the genetic basis of their inheritance. Crosses were made between cryptically unisexual individuals, between morphologically unisexual individuals, and between the two types of unisexuality. The offspring of crosses between individuals with the same sex type usually resulted in offspring with that sex type, but most of the progeny of between-sex type crosses were perfect-flowered hermaphrodites. Genetic control of sex determination is not homologous in all populations, suggesting that dioecy has evolved at least twice in Hawaiian Wikstroemia. Genetic data further suggest that males are the heterozygous sex. -from Authors",18,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,81

Future reproduction can be decreased through 1) decreases in the organism's survival rate, and/or 2) decreases in the organism's growth (and hence subsequent fecundity). The latter tradeoff (potential fecundity cost) should affect the evolution of RE only in species with relatively high survival rate, a relatively high rate of fecundity increase with body size, or a relatively high reproductive frequency per annum. Published data on survival rate, reproductive frequency and relative clutch mass suggest that many lizard species fall well below the level at which natural selection can be expected to influence RE through such ""potential fecundity' tradeoffs. Hence, the relative allocation of resources between growth and reproduction is unlikely to be directly optimized by natural selection. Instead, energy allocation should influence the evolution of RE only indirectly, via effects on an organism's probability of survival during reproduction. Survival costs of reproduction may be the most important evolutionary determinants of RE in many reptiles. -from Authors",127,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,82

Three disturbance treatments (open, annual vegetation, perennial vegetation) were imposed to test the hypothesis of stronger selection on seedlings in competitive environments. Selection was most heterogeneous early in the life cycle, with significant spatial heterogeneity in the magnitude of selection on a local scale. Disturbance affected only fecundity selection gradients and selection was strongest in open plots. Significant variation in the sign of selection differentials on emergence date was observed for establishment and fall viability selection episodes; at later stages selection varied in magnitude but not direction. Seedlings in the earliest cohort experienced high mortality during establishment, but increased size and fecundity later in the life cycle. Both stabilizing and disruptive selection on emergence date were observed during establishment, but in general selection was purely directional. There were persistent effects of both seedling emergence date and rosette diameter on adult fitness components; October rosette diameter explained 18% of the total phenotypic variance in fecundity. Overall, viability fitness components were much more important than fecundity selection. Winter survivorship was the single most important episode of selection. -from Author",54,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,83

Floral polymorphism increased both outcrossing rate and fecundity but the magnitude of the differences varied among morphs.

Both wetland and dry-site floras occur in the Late Pennsylvanian, but floristic overlap is minimal, which implies strong environmental controls on the distributions of the component species. Drier habitats appear to be the sites of first appearance of orders that become prominent during the Late Permian and Mesozoic. Higher taxa originated in physically heterogeneous, drier habitats, which were geographically marginal throughout most of the Pennsylvanian. They then moved into the lowlands during periods of climatic drying in the Permian, replacing older wetland vegetation. This pattern is analogous to the marine onshore-offshore pattern of origination and migration.
