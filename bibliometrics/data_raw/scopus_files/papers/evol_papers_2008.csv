Little is known, however, about whether geographically variable selection acting on traits that mediate species interactions is consistent or strong enough to influence patterns of nucleotide variation at individual loci. To investigate this question, we examined patterns of nucleotide diversity and population structure at 16 plant innate immunity genes, with putative functions in defending plants against pathogens or herbivores, from six populations of teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis). Specifically, we tested whether patterns of population structure and within-population diversity at immunity genes differed from patterns found at nonimmunity (reference) loci and from neutral expectations derived from coalescent simulations of structured populations. For the majority of genes, we detected no strong evidence of geographically variable selection. However, in the wound-induced serine protease inhibitor (wip1), which inhibits the hydrolysis of dietary proteins in insect herbivores, one population showed unusually high levels of genetic differentiation, very low levels of nucleotide polymorphism, and was fixed for a novel replacement substitution in the active site of the protein. Taken together, these data suggest that wip1 experienced a recent selective sweep in one geographic region; this pattern may reflect local adaptation or an ongoing species-wide sweep. Overall, our results indicate that a signature of local adaptation at the molecular level may be uncommon - particularly for traits that are under complex genetic control. © 2008 The Author(s).",34,18786191,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Host-parasite interactions | Local adaptation | Natural selection | Nucleotide variation | Population structure,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA,NA,NA

By experimentally manipulating photoperiod cues and measuring the flowering responses and photoperiod plasticity of 138 Eurasian accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana, we detected strong longitudinal but not latitudinal clines in flowering responses. The presence of longitudinal clines suggests that critical photoperiod cues vary among populations occurring at similar latitudes. Haplotypes at PHYC, a locus hypothesized to play a role in adaptation to light cues, were also longitudinally differentiated. Controlling for neutral population structure revealed that PHYC haplotype influenced flowering time; however, the distribution of PHYC haplotypes occurred in the opposite direction to the phenotypic cline, suggesting that loci other than PHYC are responsible for the longitudinal pattern in photoperiod response. Our results provide previously missing empirical support for the importance of PHYC in mediating photoperiod sensitivity in natural populations of A. thaliana.

However, when applied to population genomic datasets from human, fly, and yeast, the tests using polymorphism data were actually weaker in two of the three datasets.

Two hypotheses explaining reductions in brain size are tested, using phylogenetically controlled correlations and evolutionary pathway analyses. In a novel approach, the pathway models are combined to build the most likely evolutionary sequence of trait changes correlating with changes in brain size. Brain size changed before brood parasitism, followed by a shift toward less-productive habitats and an increase in migration. This sequence shows that brain size was not reduced as a consequence of a loss of cognitive skills related to chick provisioning, and it offers no support for the hypothesis that an increase in energetic demands or a reduction in energy availability selected for a reduction of brain size. Instead, the sequence suggests that the reduction in energetic demands due to the smaller brain size and parasitic breeding strategy may have enabled parasitic cuckoos to colonize new niches. © 2008 The Author(s).",13,18752619,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Brain size | Brood parasitism | Cognition | Comparative analysis | Evolutionary pathway analysis,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,11,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Gene arrangement frequencies in the six different niches were able to reach a stable meta-population equilibrium that matched the observed gene arrangement frequencies when recursions used the estimated fitnesses with a variety of initial inversion frequencies.

This approach is demonstrated using a case study of skulls in sister clades within the South American fish superfamily Anostomoidea. Unequal morphological diversification in this system resulted not from the morphologically diverse clade changing more on each phylogenetic branch, but from that clade distributing an equal amount of change more widely through morphospace and innovating continually. Although substantial morphological evolution occurred throughout the less diverse clade's history, most of that clade's expansion in morphospace occurred in the most basal branches, and more derived portions of that radiation oscillated within previously explored limits.

Although that pattern was congruent with a clear difference in Cytochrome B sequences between worms on the south and east coasts of Australia, we also detected some indication of interpopulation incompatibility within the genetic grouping on east coast, between two populations separated by only 220 km. We then assessed whether commonly proposed gametic compatibility arms-races could account for these patterns. Our results suggest reduced gametic compatibility may reduce a female's maximum fertilization potential, resulting in a cost to this potential mechanism for reducing polyspermy. Consequently, the apparently rapid development of reproductive barriers here seems unlikely to have been driven by arms-races involving sexual conflict over fertilization rate. © 2008 The Author(s).",22,18803690,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Fertilization | Polychaete | Polyspermy | Reproductive divergence | Sexual conflict,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,17,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Earlier studies have shown that males and females of the same ecotype copulate for longer than mates of different ecotype. Here we report a new mechanism that further contributes to reproductive isolation between ecotypes in the presence of gene flow.

We show that cliff ecotype males follow the trails of females of the same ecotype for longer than females of the alternate (boulder) ecotype. In addition, cliff males are more likely to follow the mucous trail in the correct direction if the trail is laid by a cliff-female.

Actinomycete bacteria are of special interest because they are metabolic mutualists of diverse organisms (e.g., in nitrogen-fixation or antibiotic production) and because Pseudonocardia actinomycetes are thought to serve disease-suppressing functions in attine gardens. Phylogenetic information from culture-dependent and culture-independent microbial surveys reveals (1) close affinities between free-living and ant-associated Pseudonocardia, and (2) essentially no topological correspondence between ant and Pseudonocardia phylogenies, indicating frequent bacterial acquisition from environmental sources. Identity of ant-associated Pseudonocardia and isolates from soil and plants implicates these environments as sources from which attine ants acquire Pseudonocardia. Close relatives of Atta leafcutter ants have abundant Pseudonocardia, but Pseudonocardia in Atta is rare and appears at the level of environmental contamination. In contrast, actinomycete bacteria in the genera Mycobacterium and Microbacterium can be readily isolated from gardens and starter-cultures of Atta. The accumulated phylogenetic evidence is inconsistent with prevailing views of specific coevolution between Pseudonocardia, attine ants, and garden diseases. Because of frequent acquisition, current models of Pseudonocardia-disease coevolution now need to be revised. The effectiveness of Pseudonocardia antibiotics may not derive from advantages in the coevolutionary arms race with specialized garden diseases, as currently believed, but from frequent recruitment of effective microbes from environmental sources. Indeed, the exposed integumental structures that support actinomycete growth on attine ants argue for a morphological design facilitating bacterial recruitment. We review the accumulated evidence that attine ants have undergone modifications in association with actinomycete bacteria, but we find insufficient support for the reverse, modifications of the bacteria resulting from the interaction with attine ants.

With over a dozen color morphs, ranging from bright red to dull green, D. pumilio provides an ideal opportunity to examine the evolution of color polymorphism and evolutionary shifts to cryptic coloration in an otherwise aposematic species. We constructed a phylogenetic tree for all D. pumilio color morphs from 3051bp of mtDNA sequence data, reconstructed ancestral states using parsimony and Bayesian methods, and tested the recovered tree against constraint trees using parametric bootstrapping to determine the number of changes to each color type. We find strong evidence for nearly maximal numbers of changes in all color traits, including five independent shifts to dull dorsal coloration. Our results indicate that shifts in coloration in aposematic species may occur more regularly than predicted and that convergence in coloration may indicate that similar forces are repeatedly driving these shifts. © 2008 The Author(s).",107,18764916,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Amphibian | Morphological radiation | Phylogeography | Warning signal,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,33,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We investigated the potential for such postcopulatory mechanisms of inbreeding avoidance in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a promiscuous livebearing fish. We used artificial insemination as a method of delivering to a female the combined ejaculates from a first cousin (relatedness coefficient r = 0.125) and an unrelated male.

Predators do this by generalizing between the appearance of prey they have previously sampled and the appearance of prey they subsequently encounter. Mimicry arises when such generalization occurs between individuals of different species. Our aim here is to explore whether the specific shape of the generalization curve can be expected to be important for theoretical predictions relating to the evolution of aposematism and mimicry.

To assess the importance of genetic constraints for the evolution of character displacement, we examined the genetic architecture of a suite of floral traits previously shown to be under selection in the annual plant Ipomoea hederacea when this species co-occurs with Ipomoea purpurea.

Such arguments emphasize on the role of both local demography and metapopulation processes. We developed a model for the evolution of self-fertilization in a structured metapopulation in which local densities are not steady because of population growth. Reproduction by selfing is density-independent (reproductive assurance) but selfed seeds endure inbreeding depression, whereas reproduction by outcrossing is density-dependent (Allee effect). First, we derived an analytical criterion for metapopulation viability as a function of the selfing rate and metapopulation parameters. We show that outcrossers can develop a viable metapopulation when they produce a high amount of dispersal seeds that counterbalances their incapacity to found new populations from low densities. Second, the model shows there is a positive feedback between demography and outcrossing rates, leading to either complete outcrossing or selfing. Specifically, we illustrate that inbreeding depression can paradoxically favor the evolution of selfing because of its negative effect on density. Also, complete outcrossing can be selected despite pollen limitation, although it does not provide a full seed set. This model underlines the influence of the mating system both on demography and gene dynamics in a metapopulation context. © 2008 The Author(s).",44,18637959,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Allee effect | Baker's law | Evolution of self-fertilization | Metapopulation dynamic | Reproductive assurance,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,49,NA,NA,NA,NA

In species where females mate with more than one male, sexual selection also continues after copulation in the form of sperm competition and cryptic female choice. Theory suggests that sperm competition should favor traits such as testes size and sperm production that increase a male's competitive fertilization success. Studies of experimental evolution offer a powerful approach for assessing evolutionary responses to variation in sexual selection pressures. Here we removed sexual selection by enforcing monogamy on replicate lines of a naturally polygamous horned beetle, Onthophagus taurus, and monitoring male investment in their testes for 21 generations. Testes size decreased in monogamous lines relative to lines in which sexual selection was allowed to continue. Differences in testes size were dependent on selection history and not breeding regime. Males from polygamous lines also had a competitive fertilization advantage when in sperm competition with males from monogamous lines. Females from polygamous lines produced sons in better condition, and those from monogamous lines increased their sons condition by mating polygamously. Rather than being costly for females, multiple mating appears to provide females with direct and/or indirect benefits. Neither body size nor horn size diverged between our monogamous and polygamous lines.

To deal with this indeterminacy, the present study outlines a framework for testing a priori hypotheses of modularity in which putative modules are mathematically represented as multidimensional subspaces embedded in the data. Model expectations are computed by subdividing the data into arrays of variables, and intermodular interactions are represented by overlapping arrays. Covariance structures are thus modeled as the outcome of complex and nonorthogonal intermodular interactions. This approach is demonstrated by analyzing mandibular modularity in nine rodent species.

Five modules common to all species are identified, which approximately map to the developmental modules of the mandible.

Here we examine sister species of the monkeyflowers Mimulus cardinalis and M. lewisii to identify traits that might contribute to the evolution of the species' ranges and to ask whether adaptive trade-offs between environments can limit their geographic distribution. In the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, M. cardinalis is found from low to mid elevation and M. lewisii is found from mid to high elevation. We transplanted segregating populations of interspecific hybrids to low and high elevation and cross-pollinated those that survived to flowering to create selected populations that evolved at low or high elevation. When grown in a common environment, the progeny of hybrids selected at high elevation flowered earlier compared to a greenhouse control population, whereas hybrids selected at low elevation displayed increased warm-temperature photosynthetic capacity. If adaptation to one environment entails a cost to adaptation in other environments, then selected hybrid populations should display reduced fitness, relative to an unselected control population, when grown in an environment in which they were not selected. Two such trade-offs were observed in this study, where hybrids selected at high elevation displayed reduced biomass when grown in temperatures characteristic of low elevation and hybrids selected at low elevation showed reduced resistance to freezing.

First, we conducted an intensive study of Costus pulverulentus and Costus scaber, two recently diverged species that co-occur and share hummingbird pollinators. The hummingbird pollinators transfer pollen between these Costus species, but hybrids are rarely found in nature. By performing pollinations between populations of C. pulverulentus and C. scaber from three sites across the species' geographic ranges, we find that pollen-pistil incompatibilities acting prior to fertilization have evolved only between locally sympatric populations, whereas geographically distant populations within the region of sympatry and allopatric populations remain fully interfertile. Second, we conducted a comparative study of isolating mechanisms across the genus. We find lower seed set due to pollen-pistil incompatibility between species pairs that co-occur and experience pollen transfer in nature compared to species pairs that are otherwise isolated, regardless of genetic distance. Taken together, these studies indicate that crossing barriers prevent potentially maladaptive hybridization and effectively reinforce the speciation process. Our results add to mounting evidence for reinforcement from animal studies and show that plant speciation may also involve complex mate recognition systems.

We created two replicate serially inbred populations perpetuated by full-sib matings and paired with outbred controls. The genetic load for the probability that an egg produces an adult was purged at ∼0.45-0.50 lethal equivalents/generation, a reduction of more than half after only three generations of sib-mating. After serial inbreeding we outcrossed all beetles then measured (1) larval survival of outcrossed beetles and (2) inbreeding depression. Survival of outcrossed beetles evolved to be higher in the serially inbred populations for all periods of development. Inbreeding depression and the genetic load were significantly lower in the serially inbred than control populations. Inbreeding depression affecting larval survival of S. limbatus is largely due to recessive deleterious alleles of large effect that can be rapidly purged from a population by serial sib-mating. However, the effectiveness of purging varied among the periods of egg/larval survival and likely varies among other unstudied fitness components. This study presents novel results showing rapid and extensive purging of the genetic load, specifically a reduction of as much as 72% in only three generations of sib-mating.

Therefore, we applied the joint scaling principle to assess epistasis and other nonadditive genetic components of two resistance traits, survival, and parasite spore load, in population crosses of the red flour beetle Tribolium castanaeum under infections with the microsporidian Nosema whitei. We found nonadditive components only in infected populations but not in control populations. The genetic architecture underlying survival under parasite infection was more complex than that of spore load. Accordingly, the observed negative correlation between survival and spore load was mainly based on a correlation between shared additive components. Breakdown of resistance was especially strong in F2 crosses between resistant lines indicating that multiple epistatic routes can lead to the same adaptation. In general, the wide range of nonoverlapping genetic components between crosses indicated that parasite resistance in T. castanaeum can be understood as a multi peaked fitness landscape with epistasis contributing substantially to phenotypic differentiation in resistance. © 2008 The Author(s).",28,18564375,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Epistasis | Fitness landscape | Genetic architecture | Host-parasite coevolution | Microsporidian | Nosema whitei,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,65,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Here I address these issues by integrating observation and manipulation to study condition- and sex-related color variation in a butterfly. The focal species, Eurema hecabe (Pieridae), possesses three sexually homologous and morphogenetically discrete dorsal wing color elements - coherently scattered ultraviolet (UV), pteridine yellow, and melaninic black. The UV is most strongly sexually selected, and is also the only color element with restricted distribution across female wings. Condition dependence and sexual dichromatism were pervasive, characterizing all color traits except the melanic black, and acting such that low condition males resembled high condition females. Although female coloration tended to exhibit greater phenotypic variation, size-scaled UV was more variable and condition dependent in males. Importantly, manipulation of larval resources was sufficient to closely reconstruct the extent and patterns of field-observed phenotypic variation in condition, and color trait expression, which implicates larval resource acquisition as a primary driver of condition dependence. These results support theories regarding phenotypic variation in sexually selected traits. © 2008 The Author(s).",44,18637962,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Dichromatism | Dimorphism | Eurema | Iridescence | Ornamentation | Sexual selection,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,66,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Here we combine an analytical framework with individual-based simulations to generate novel predictions about long-term adaptation of epistatic networks. We find that relative to traits governed by independently evolving genes, adaptation with epistatic gene networks is often characterized by longer waiting times to selective sweeps, lower standing genetic variation, and larger fitness effects of adaptive mutations. This may cause epistatic networks to either adapt more slowly or more quickly relative to a nonepistatic system. Interestingly, epistatic networks may adapt faster even when epistatic effects of mutations are on average deleterious. Further, we study the evolution of epistatic properties of adaptive mutations in gene networks. Our results show that adaptive mutations with small fitness effects typically evolve positive synergistic interactions, whereas adaptive mutations with large fitness effects evolve positive synergistic and negative antagonistic interactions at approximately equal frequencies.

We then test the empirical support for the cis-regulatory hypothesis with a comprehensive survey of mutations responsible for phenotypic evolution in multicellular organisms. Cis-regulatory mutations currently represent approximately 22% of 331 identified genetic changes although the number of cis-regulatory changes published annually is rapidly increasing. Above the species level, cis-regulatory mutations altering morphology are more common than coding changes. Also, above the species level cis-regulatory mutations predominate for genes not involved in terminal differentiation. These patterns imply that the simple question ""Do coding or cis-regulatory mutations cause more phenotypic evolution?"" hides more interesting phenomena.

We address this question through analysis of the recursion equations for gene identity under the infinite allele model of mutation, and derive conditions describing when the effect of mutation on GST can be ignored under mutation-migration-drift equilibrium conditions and during the preceding transition phase. An important result is that during the transition phase GST is not only affected by mutation, but also by the heterozygosity in the base population from which the subpopulations diverged. The effect of mutation on GST is significant from the very start of the divergence process when initial heterozygosity is low, whereas GST is only weakly affected by mutation in the early phases of differentiation when initial heterozygosity is high. Thus, differentiation following a severe bottleneck is strongly dependent on mutation. The standardized measure of differentiation, G′ST, suggested by Hedrick (2005), may be helpful when comparing amounts of divergence at loci with different mutation rates under steady-state conditions, provided that migration is very low. In many other situations the use of G′ST might be misleading, however, and its application should be exercised with caution. © 2008 The Author(s).",35,18616569,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,G ST | Gene flow | Gene identity | Heterozygosity | Migration | Mutation | Population structure,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,72,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Any interaction between males or females that generates variation in fitness, whether due to conflict, competition or mate choice, can potentially influence sexual selection acting on a range of male traits.

We manipulate a major source of sexual conflict in the black field cricket, Teleogryllus commodus, and quantify the resulting changes in the nature of sexual selection using formal selection analysis to statistically compare multivariate fitness surfaces. In T. commodus, sexual conflict occurs over the attachment time of an external spermatophore. By experimentally manipulating the ability of males and females to influence spermatophore attachment, we found that sexual conflict significantly influences the opportunity, form, and intensity of sexual selection on male courtship call and body size. When males were able to harass females, the opportunity for selection was smaller, the form of selection changed, and sexual selection was weaker.

In contrast, mutualists increase their reproductive output by increasing host fitness. Very often the distinction between parasites and mutualists is not discrete but rather contingent on the environment in which the interaction occurs, and can shift along a continuous scale from parasitism to mutualism.

Here, we explore the significance of resource allocation trade-offs between primary and secondary sexual traits in shaping early morphological divergences between four recently separated populations of the horned beetle Onthophagus taurus as well as macroevolutionary divergence patterns across 10 Onthophagus species. We show that resource allocation trade-offs leave a strong signature in morphological divergence patterns both within and between species. Furthermore, our results suggest that genital divergence may, under certain circumstances, occur as a byproduct of evolutionary changes in secondary sexual traits. Given the importance of copulatory organ morphology for reproductive isolation our findings begin to raise the possibility that secondary sexual trait evolution may promote speciation as a byproduct. We discuss the implications of our results on the causes and consequences of resource allocation trade-offs in insects. © 2008 The Author(s).",43,18616574,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Aedeagus | Horned beetle | Onthophagus | Resource allocation trade-off | Speciation,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,80,NA,NA,NA,NA

These estimates suggest that selection is relatively constant within, but fluctuates between seasons. However, the strength of selection depends on demographics, and because demographics can vary within seasons, there is a gap in our understanding regarding the extent to which seasonal fluctuations in demographics may cause variation in selection. Here we use two populations of the golden orb-web spider (Nephila plumipes) that differ in density to examine how demographics change within a season and whether there are correlated shifts in selection. We demonstrate that there is within-season variation in sex ratio and density at multiple spatial and temporal scales. This variation led to changes in the competitive challenges that males encountered at different times of the season and was correlated with significant variation in selection gradients on male size and weight between sampling periods. We highlight the importance of understanding the biology of the organism under study to correctly determine the relevant scale in which to examine selection. We also argue that studies may underestimate the true variation in selection by averaging values, leading to misinterpretation of the effect of selection on phenotypic evolution. © 2008 The Author(s).",98,18564373,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Demographic variation | Nephila plumipes | Selection gradients | Sexual selection,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,81,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the transient neutral clines at the nuclear or organelle sites can be reinforced by the cytonuclear disequilibrium generated by diploid seed and haploid pollen dispersal. In this study, the spread of a neutral allele in an ecological zone of hermaphrodite plants is examined under three cytonuclear systems for genomes with contrasting modes of inheritance (paternal, maternal, and biparental inheritance). The results show that the transient neutral clines can exhibit the spatial pattern similar to the selective clines from separate genomes although discordance between them exists. The spread of a neutral allele is not only related to the vectors of seed and pollen dispersal but also to the mode of its inheritance. Pollen dispersal facilitates the direct effects of the selective organelle sites with paternal inheritance on the spread of a neutral nuclear allele. It also enhances its indirect effects on the spread of a neutral organelle allele with maternal inheritance via modifying the cytonuclear disequilibrium. A positive relationship exists between the barriers to the spread of selective nuclear (or organelle) and neutral organelle (or nuclear) alleles. An asymmetric barrier to the spread of the neutral alleles exists on the two sides of the physical barrier, given the presence of symmetric barrier to the spread of the selective alleles.

Also, ossification rank position of marsupial forelimb and shoulder girdle elements is more conservative than that of placentals; in placentals the hind limb area is more conservative. The differing ossification patterns in marsupials can be explained with a combination of muscular strain and energy allocation constraints, both resulting from the requirement of active movement of the altricial marsupial neonates toward the teat. Peramelemorphs, which are comparatively passive at birth and include species with relatively derived forelimbs, differ little from other marsupials in ossification sequence.

We also demonstrate that introgression occurs almost exclusively from the local to the invading species, especially for populations located far away from the source of the invasion, and this irrespective of the relative densities of the two species. This pattern is strongest at markers experiencing reduced gene flow, in keeping with the observation that organelle genes are often preferentially introgressed across species boundaries.

However, a more recent model suggests that parental care patterns result from sexual selection acting on one sex favoring mating competition and lower parental investment.

By applying this approach to real phylogenies with explosive-early diversification and by modeling features of lineage-accumulation curves under both declining speciation and increasing extinction scenarios, we show that a signal of explosive-early diversification in phylogenies of extant taxa cannot result from increasing extinction and can only be explained by temporally declining speciation rates.

Further, we show that despite being geographically adjacent, urban and desert populations are nevertheless genetically distinct corroborating findings of early developmental divergence between them.

Here we investigated the role of two pre- and two postzygotic mechanisms of RI in a system comprising two interdependent Pogonomyrmex harvester ant lineages (the H1 and H2 lineages) of hybrid origin and one of their parental species (P. rugosus). Similar to most other ants, P. rugosus is characterized by an environmental system of caste determination with female brood developing either into queens or workers depending on nongenetic factors. By contrast, there is a strong genetic component to caste determination in the H1 and H2 lineages because the developmental fate of female brood depends on the genetic origin of the parents, with interlineage eggs developing into workers and intralineage eggs developing into queens. The study of a mixed mating aggregation revealed strong differences in mating flight timing between P. rugosus and the two lineages as a first mechanism of RI. A second important prezygotic mechanism was assortative mating. Laboratory experiments also provided support for one of the two investigated mechanisms of postzygotic isolation. The majority of offspring produced from the few matings between P. rugosus and the lineages aborted at the egg stage. This hybrid inviability was under maternal influence, with hybrids produced by P. rugosus queens being always inviable whereas a small proportion of H2 lineage queens produced large numbers of adult hybrid offspring. Finally, we found no evidence that genetic caste determination acted as a second postzygotic mechanism reducing gene flow between P. rugosus and the H lineages.

We used experimentally evolved populations of the naturally promiscuous Drosophila pseudoobscura, in which the numbers of potential interactions between the sexes, and therefore relative fitness, were manipulated by altering natural levels of female promiscuity. We considered two different mating interactions between the sexes: mating speed and copulation duration. We investigated the evolutionary trajectories of means and (co)variances (P) and also the influence of genetic drift on the evolutionary response of these interactions. Our sexual selection treatments did not affect the means of either mating speed or copulation duration, but they did affect P.

Like Sumner, we found significant variation among populations: mice inhabiting coastal sand dunes had larger feet, longer tails, and lighter pigmentation than inland populations. Most striking, all seven pigmentation traits examined showed a sharp decrease in reflectance about 55 km from the coast, with most of the phenotypic change occurring over less than 10 km. The largest change in soil reflectance occurred just south of this break in pigmentation. Geographic analysis of microsatellite markers shows little interpopulation differentiation, so the abrupt change in pigmentation is not associated with recent secondary contact or reduced gene flow between adjacent populations. Using these genetic data, we estimated that the strength of selection needed to maintain the observed distribution of pigment traits ranged from 0.0004 to 21%, depending on the trait and model used. We also examined changes in allele frequency of SNPs in two pigmentation genes, Mc1r and Agouti, and show that mutations in the cis-regulatory region of Agouti may contribute to this cline in pigmentation.

Weak selection under strong competition arises when competition causes the extinction (for self-reproducing resources) or depletion (for abiotic resources) of the most rapidly caught resources. Weak selection under weak competition is a consequence of minimal effects of consumers on resources. The precise relationship between intensity of competition and strength of disruptive selection is sensitive to the shape of the consumer's resource utilization curve and the nature of resource growth. The most strongly unimodal competition-selection relationships result from utilization curves with long tails.

Previous comparative studies have suggested several functional explanations for interspecific variation in both the total time spent asleep and in rapid-eye movement (REM) or ""quiet"" (non-REM) sleep. In support of specific functional benefits of sleep, these studies reported correlations between time in specific sleep states (NREM or REM) and brain size, metabolic rate, and developmental variables. Here we show that estimates of sleep duration are significantly influenced by the laboratory conditions under which data are collected and that, when analyses are limited to data collected under more standardized procedures, traditional functional explanations for interspecific variation in sleep durations are no longer supported. Specifically, we find that basal metabolic rate correlates negatively rather than positively with sleep quotas, and that neither adult nor neonatal brain mass correlates positively with REM or NREM sleep times. These results contradict hypotheses that invoke energy conservation, cognition, and development as drivers of sleep variation. Instead, the negative correlations of both sleep states with basal metabolic rate and diet are consistent with trade-offs between sleep and foraging time. In terms of predation risk, both REM and NREM sleep quotas are reduced when animals sleep in more exposed sites, whereas species that sleep socially sleep less. Together with the fact that REM and NREM sleep quotas correlate strongly with each other, these results suggest that variation in sleep primarily reflects ecological constraints acting on total sleep time, rather than the independent responses of each sleep state to specific selection pressures.

We assessed both prospective gender of individuals in terms of their allocations and actual parentage using microsatellites; we found that most matings in A. opalus occur disassortatively.

Seeds produced later in the reproductive season were smaller than those produced earlier; this should compromise reproduction through ovules in protandrous individuals, rendering them male biased in gender. Time-dependent gender and paternity analyses indicate that the sexual morphs are specialized in their earlier sexual functions, mediated by the seasonal decrease in seed size.

The reduction in sperm competitive ability due to SR is large enough to potentially stabilize the spread of sex ratio drive through populations.

We exposed individual Daphnia to single- and mixed-isolate infection treatments, both simultaneously and sequentially. Virulence was assessed by monitoring host mortality and fecundity, and parasite spore production was used as a measure of parasite fitness. Consistent with most assumptions, in multiply infected hosts we found that the virulence of mixed infections resembled that of the more virulent competitor, both in simultaneous multiple infections and in sequential multiple infections in which the virulent isolate was first to infect. The more virulent competitor also produced the vast majority of transmission stages. Only when the less virulent isolate was first to infect, the intrahost contest resembled scramble competition, whereby both isolates suffered by producing fewer transmission stages. Surprisingly, mixed-isolate infections resulted in lower fecundity-costs for the hosts, suggesting that parasite competition comes with an advantage for the host relative to single infections.

We found significant floral morphological differences among species that were generally associated with different groups of floral visitors. Floral evolution has been highly labile and also directional. Some specialized systems such as hawkmoth or bat pollination are likely evolutionary dead-ends. In contrast, specialized pollination by hummingbirds is clearly not a dead-end. We found evidence for multiple reverse transitions from presumed ancestral hummingbird pollination to more derived bee or insect pollination. These repeated origins of insect pollination from hummingbird-pollinated ancestors have not evolved without historical baggage. Flowers of insect-pollinated species derived from hummingbird-pollinated ancestors are morphologically more similar to hummingbird flowers than they are to other more distantly related insect-pollinated flowers. Finally, some pollinator switches were concomitant with changes in floral morphology that are associated with those pollinators.

Thus, adults experience transient cold stress primarily during the spring. We show that adult cold tolerance (chill coma recovery) is enhanced in spring-like conditions via thermal acclimation but is unaffected by diapause state. Moreover, adult mosquitoes from northern populations were more cold tolerant than those from southern populations largely because acclimation responses were steeper in the north. In contrast to cold tolerance, there was no significant acclimation of heat tolerance (heat knockdown), and no significant differences in heat tolerance between northern and southern populations. Field temperature data show that because of evolved differences in diapause timing, adult exposure to cold stress is remarkably consistent across geography.

Rhynchosporium secalis, originally described from rye, causes an important disease on barley called scald, although it also infects other species of Hordeum and Agropyron. Phylogenetic analyses based on four DNA sequence loci identified three host-associated lineages that were confirmed by cross-pathogenicity tests.

We studied levels of inbreeding depression in allotetraploid and diploid species of Clarkia (Onagraceae) that vary in mating system (each cytotype was represented by an outcrossing and a selfing species).

We studied sex-specific forms of selection acting in Anolis lizards in the Greater Antilles, a group for which the importance of natural selection has been well documented in species-level diversification, but for which less is known about sexual selection. Using the brown anole (Anolis sagrei), we measured fitness-related variation in morphology (body size), and variation in two traits reflecting whole animal physiological condition: running endurance and immune function. Correlations between body size and physiological traits were opposite between males and females and the form of natural selection acting on physiological traits significantly differed between the sexes.

Sympatric individuals experience reinforcement of female preferences and male display traits, whereas allopatric individuals do not, creating the potential for divergent sexual selection in sympatric and allopatric populations. Sexual selection operates on the cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) of Drosophila serrata, and reinforcement on the CHCs of populations sympatric with D. birchii. Here, we manipulate sexual selection in D. serrata populations generated by hybridizing natural sympatric and allopatric populations. Under the influence of sexual selection, male CHCs evolved from an intermediate phenotype to resemble an allopatric phenotype, which was driven by female choice. Additionally, female choice resulted in evolution of an allopatric female preference, so that allopatric males were preferred to sympatric males. Allopatric CHCs and preferences represent a sexual selection optimum via female choice. Sympatric populations display suboptimal phenotypes relative to their allopatric conspecifics.

However, the selective mechanisms generating many such patterns remain unresolved, and there is relatively little information regarding how basic life-history components such as fecundity, life span and mortality rates vary across environmental gradients. Here, it is shown that four life-history traits vary predictably with geographic origin of populations sampled along the latitudinal gradient in the eastern United States. Although such patterns are indicative of selection, they cannot distinguish between the direct action of selection on the traits in question or indirect selection by means of underlying genetic correlations. When independent suites of traits covary with geography, it is therefore critical to separate the widespread effects of population source from variation specifically for the traits under investigation. One trait that is associated with variation in life histories and also varies with latitude is the propensity to express reproductive diapause; diapause expression has been hypothesized as a mechanism by which D. melanogaster adults overwinter, and as such may be subject to strong selection in temperate habitats. In this study, recently derived isofemale lines were used to assess the relative contributions of population source and diapause genotype in generating the observed variance for life histories. It is shown that although life span, fecundity and mortality rates varied predictably with geography, diapause genotype explained the majority of the variance for these traits in the sampled populations. Both heat and cold shock resistance were also observed to vary predictably with latitude for the sampled populations. Cold shock tolerance varied between diapause genotypes and the magnitude of this difference varied with geography, whereas heat shock tolerance was affected solely by geographic origin of the populations. These data suggest that a subset of life-history parameters is significantly influenced by the genetic variance for diapause expression in natural populations, and that the observed variance for longevity and fecundity profiles may reflect indirect action of selection on diapause and other correlated traits. © 2008 The Author(s).",117,18298646,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Aging | Clines | Diapause | Drosophila | Life span | Trade-offs,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,160,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

His logic was straightforward and rested on the assumption that colonization was infrequent; thus, mate limitation favored the establishment of self-fertilizing individuals. In support of Baker's rule, many authors have documented high frequencies of self-compatibility on islands, and recent work has solidified the generality of Baker's ideas. The genus Lycium (Solanaceae) has ca. 80 species distributed worldwide, and phylogenetic studies suggest that Lycium originated in South America and dispersed to the Old World a single time. Previous analyses of the S-RNase gene, which controls the stylar component of self-incompatibility, have shown that gametophytically controlled self-incompatibility is ancestral within the genus, making Lycium a good model for investigating Baker's assertions concerning reproductive assurance following oceanic dispersal. Lycium is also useful for investigations of reproductive evolution, given that species vary both in sexual expression and the presence of self-incompatibility. A model for the evolution of gender dimorphism suggests that polyploidy breaks down self-incompatibility, leading to the evolution of gender dimorphism, which arises as an alternative outcrossing mechanism. There is a perfect association of dimorphic gender expression, polyploidy, and self-compatibility (vs. cosexuality, diploidy, and self-incompatibility) among North American Lycium. Although the association between ploidy level and gender expression also holds for African Lycium, to date no studies of mating systems have been initiated in Old World species. Here, using controlled pollinations, we document strong self-incompatibility in two cosexual, diploid species of African Lycium. Further, we sequence the S-RNase gene in 15 individuals from five cosexual, diploid species of African Lycium and recover 24 putative alleles. Genealogical analyses indicate reduced trans-generic diversity of S-RNases in the Old World compared to the New World. We suggest that genetic diversity at this locus was reduced as a result of a founder event, but, despite the bottleneck, self-incompatibility was maintained in the Old World. Maximum-likelihood analyses of codon substitution patterns indicate that positive Darwinian selection has been relatively strong in the Old World, suggesting the rediversification of S-RNases following a bottleneck. The present data thus provide a dramatic exception to Baker's rule, in addition to supporting a key assumption of the Miller and Venable (2000) model, namely that self-incompatibility is associated with diploidy and cosexuality. © 2008 The Author(s).",49,18315577,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Baker's rule | Gametophytic self-incompatibility | Genetic bottleneck | Mating systems | Molecular adaptation | S-RNase gene | Solanaceae | Transgeneric evolution,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,163,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Although clonal decay is likely to be an important mechanism that limits the temporal and spatial distribution of asexual lineages, we argue here that contemporary phylogenetic analyses, which are mostly restricted to simple comparisons of ""recent"" and ""ancient"" clones, need to be tested against an appropriate null model of neutrality. We use computer simulations to show that many empirical observations of the distribution of asexuality do not in fact reject a null model of the neutral turnover of clones spawned by sexual relatives. In particular, neutral clonal turnover results in qualitatively similar pattern of clonal spatial distribution and age structure, as does a process that includes clonal decay. Although there are important quantitative differences between predictions made by the two models, we show that published empirical data are still inadequate to distinguish between them.

Declines in lifetime fitness were observed in both the field (1.7% per generation; P = 0.27) and the greenhouse (0.6% per generation; P = 0.07). Significant increases in additive genetic variance for fitness were found for stems per day, flowers per stem, fruits per flower and seeds per fruit in the field as well as for fruits per flower in the greenhouse. Lack of significance of the fitness decline may be due to the short period of mutation accumulation, the use of outbred populations, or both. The percent declines in fitness are at the high end of the range observed in other mutation accumulation experiments and give some support to the idea that mutational effects may be magnified under harsher field conditions.

We found that nonphylogenetic models typically fit the data better than phylogenetic models (Brownian motion, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck), and thus results varied little across trees. Our results indicated that species with high nectar reward and large displays are significantly more likely to be pollinated by hummingbirds and less likely to be pollinated by all groups of insects.

These correlations arose because males with specific phenotypes were more closely related to the female population (and therefore more likely to pair with closer relatives under random pairing), and because males with specific phenotypes paired with closer relatives than expected.

Body size increased in a clinal fashion along this gradient: animals were smaller in size at the coast, but became larger in the inland areas.

Previous studies clearly showed benefits to the association for the nematode during the parasitic stage, but preliminary data suggest the existence of costs to the association for the nematode in free stage.

In the absence of competition, there is stabilizing selection toward a locally best-adapted trait that changes gradually along the gradient. According to traditional ideas, gradual spatial variation in environmental conditions is expected to lead to gradual variation in the evolved trait. A contrasting possibility is that the trait distribution instead breaks up into discrete clusters. Doebeli and Dieckmann (2003) argued that competition acting locally in trait space and geographical space can promote such clustering. We have investigated this possibility using deterministic population dynamics for asexual populations, analyzing our model numerically and through an analytical approximation. We examined how the evolution of clusters is affected by the shape of competition kernels, by the presence of Allee effects, and by the strength of gene flow along the gradient. For certain parameter ranges clustering was a robust outcome, and for other ranges there was no clustering. Our analysis shows that the shape of competition kernels is important for clustering: the sign structure of the Fourier transform of a competition kernel determines whether the kernel promotes clustering. Also, we found that Allee effects promote clustering, whereas gene flow can have a counteracting influence. In line with earlier findings, we could demonstrate that phenotypic clustering was favored by gradients of intermediate slope. © 2008 The Author(s).",62,18248636,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Allee effects | Asexual populations | Disruptive selection | Parapatry | Pattern formation | Quantitative characters,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,187,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

This knowledge of the populations' ancestry allows us to draw inferences about the rate of change in rDNA composition. The rDNA data have, in turn, been revealing about the populations' ancestry, indicating a previously unsuspected route of postglacial colonization. The two chromosomal races were found to have genetically distinctive rDNA composition, demonstrating the persistence of differences for thousands of generations. It follows that the hybrid zone represents a natural experiment in which repeated crossing and backcrossing between these different rDNA lineages has occurred for over 8000 generations. The association between chromosomal race and rDNA composition has been broken down within the zone.

Apparent contradictions across scales and levels have been neglected, including (1) the individualistic geographic shifts of species on centennial and millennial timescales versus evidence for fine-tuned coevolutionary relationships; (2) the extensive and dynamic networks of interactions faced by most species versus the evolution of costly enemy-specific defenses and finely attuned mutualisms; and (3) the macroevolutionary lags often seen between the origin and the diversification of a clade or an evolutionary novelty versus the rapid microevolution of advantageous phenotypes and the invasibility of most communities.

On the other hand, natural selection often favors a social learning strategy without exploration when the environmental states overlap.

Following chemotherapy, the negative density-dependent processes restricting parasite population growth will be relaxed, increasing the genetic contribution of resistant parasites to the next generation. Simple deterministic models of directly transmitted nematodes that merge population dynamics and genetics show that the frequency of drug-resistant alleles may increase faster in species whose population size is down-regulated by density-dependent parasite fecundity than in species with density-dependent establishment or parasite mortality. A genetically structured population dynamics model of an indirectly transmitted nematode is used to highlight how population regulation will influence the resistance allele frequency in different parasite lifestages. Results indicate that surveys aimed at monitoring the evolution of drug resistance should consider carefully which life stage to sample, and the time following treatment samples should be collected.

I quantified the selection exerted on 10 plant traits by a mutualistic (pollinators) and antagonistic (gall-makers, predispersal and postdispersal seed predators, mammalian herbivores) multispecific assemblage acting sequentially throughout eight selective episodes of the plant, from floral bud to juvenile production. Variation in lifetime female fitness (quantified as number of juveniles) was related mostly to variation in number of flowers, fruit initiation, and seedling establishment. The direction of selection changed among different selective episode for many traits. Most importantly, conflicting selection was frequent in the study system, with half of the phenotypic traits experiencing opposing selection in different selective episodes. Selection at individual life-cycle stages diverged remarkably from selection based on total fitness.

I analyze a population genetic model of endosymbiont evolution, and demonstrate that substitution rates will increase, and the effect of those substitutions on endosymbiont fitness will become more deleterious as horizontal transmission among hosts decreases. Additionally, I find that there is a critical level of horizontal transmission below which natural selection cannot effectively purge deleterious mutations, leading to an expected loss of fitness over time.

Consistent with previous studies our model predicts maximum diversity at intermediate levels of disturbance and productivity in the absence of parasitism. However, parasites break down these unimodal diversity relationships with productivity and disturbance, as selection for parasite resistance reduces the importance of growth rate-competitive ability trade-offs. We tested these predictions using the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, which undergoes an adaptive radiation into spatial niche specialists under laboratory conditions. This is the first study of adaptive radiation in response to experimental manipulation of the three-way interaction between productivity, disturbance, and natural enemies. As hypothesized, unimodal diversity relationships with disturbance and productivity were weakened or disappeared in the presence of parasitic phages. This was the result of phages increasing diversity at environmental extremes, by imposing selection for phage-resistant variants, but decreasing diversity in less stressful environments, probably through reductions in resource competition.

Here it is shown that interspecific competition may slow down rates of adaptation substantially and fundamentally change patterns of adaptation to long-term environmental changes. In the model investigated here, species compete for resources distributed along an ecological niche space. Environmental change is represented by a slowly moving resource maximum and evolutionary responses of single species are compared with responses of coalitions of two and three competing species. In scenarios with two and three species, species that are favored by increasing resource availability increase in equilibrium population size whereas disfavored species decline in size. Increased competition makes it less favorable for individuals of a disfavored species to occupy a niche close to the maximum and reduces the selection pressure for tracking the moving resource distribution. Individual-based simulations and an analysis using adaptive dynamics show that the combination of weaker selection pressure and reduced population size reduces the evolutionary rate of the disfavored species considerably. If the resource landscape moves stochastically, weak evolutionary responses cause large fluctuations in population size and thereby large extinction risk for competing species, whereas a single species subject to the same environmental variability may track the resource maximum closely and maintain a much more stable population size. Other studies have shown that competitive interactions may amplify changes in mean population sizes due to environmental changes and thereby increase extinction risks. This study accentuates the harmful role of competitive interactions by illustrating that they may also decrease rates of adaptation. The slowdown in evolutionary rates caused by competition may also contribute to explain low rates of morphological change in spite of large environmental fluctuations found in fossil records. © 2007 The Author(s).",65,18031306,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Adaptation | Competition | Ecological communities | Environmental change | Evolutionary response,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,210,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Neutral evolutionary models present good fits to the data and we find no evidence for heterogeneity in the rate of evolution in recombination across the mammalian tree. These results suggest that observed interspecific variation in average genomic rates of recombination is largely attributable to the steady accumulation of neutral mutations over evolutionary time.

We addressed the relative importance of sperm competition and male mating rate by taking an experimental evolution approach. We subjected populations of Drosophila melanogaster to sex ratios of 1:1, 4:1, and 10:1 (female:male). Female bias decreased sperm competition but increased male mating rate and sperm depletion. After 28 generations of evolution, males from the 10:1 treatment had larger testes than males from other treatments.

Here, we examine both these processes by combining an AFLP genome scan of two host plant ecotypes of Timema cristinae walking-sticks with existing data on adaptive phenotypic divergence and ecological speciation in these insects. We found that about 8% of loci are outliers in multiple population comparisons. Replicated comparisons between population-pairs using the same versus different host species revealed that 1-2% of loci are subject to host-related selection specifically. Locus-specific analyses revealed that up to 10% of putatively neutral (nonoutlier) AFLP loci exhibit significant isolation-by-adaptation. Our results suggest that selection may affect differentiation directly, via linkage, or by facilitating genetic drift. They thus illustrate the varied and sometimes nonintuitive contributions of selection to heterogeneous genomic differentiation. © 2007 The Author(s).",343,17999721,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,AFLPs | Differential gene exchange | Ecological speciation | Genome scan | Natural selection | Speciation | Timema stick insects,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,218,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Following initial hybridization, the genomes of parental species recombine and junctions between chromosomal blocks of different parental origin leave a record of recombination and the time period before homogenization of the derived genome. We use detailed genetic maps of three hybrid species of sunflowers and models to estimate the time required for the stabilization of the new hybrid genome. In contrast to previous estimates of 60 or fewer generations, we find that the genomes of three hybrid sunflower species were not stabilized for hundreds of generations. These results are reconciled with previous research by recognizing that the stabilization of a hybrid species' genome is not synonymous with hybrid speciation. Segregating factors that contribute to initial ecological or intrinsic genetic isolation may become stabilized quickly. The remainder of the genome likely becomes stabilized over a longer time interval, with recombination and drift dictating the contributions of the parental genomes. Our modeling of genome stabilization provides an upper bound for the time interval for reproductive isolation to be established and confirms the rapid nature of homoploid hybrid speciation. © 2007 The Author(s).",67,18039323,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Admixture | Helianthus | Hybrid speciation | Junction theory | Linkage disequilibrium | Recombination,22104,R01GM059065,1,TRUE,220,all,All Open Access,NIGMS,National Institute of General Medical Sciences

We demonstrate this mechanism using a genetic model with two primary assumptions: the expression of a trait depends upon success in social competition for limited resources; and competitive success of a genotype depends on the genotypes that it competes against. We find that such social competition generates heritable (additive) genetic variation for ""competition-dependent"" traits. This heritable variation is not eroded by continuous directional selection because, rather than leading to fixation of favored alleles, selection leads instead to allele frequency cycling due to the concerted coevolution of the social environment with the effects of alleles.

In particular, sexual selection is predicted to trade-off with immunocompetence because the extra investment of resources needed to increase sexual competitiveness reduces investment in immune function. Additional possible immunological consequences of intensifying sexual selection include an exaggeration of immunological sexual dimorphism, and the reduction of condition-dependent immunological costs due to selection of 'good genes' (the immunocompetence handicap hypothesis, ICHH). We tested for these evolutionary possibilities by increasing sexual selection in laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster for 58 generations by reestablishing a male-biased sex ratio at the start of each generation. Sexually selected flies were larger, took longer to develop, and the males were more sexually competitive than males from control (equal sex ratio) lines. We found support for the trade-off hypothesis: sexually selected males were found to have reduced immune function compared to control males. However, we found no evidence that sexual selection promoted immunological sexual dimorphism because females showed a similar reduction in immune function. We found no evidence of evolutionary changes in the condition-dependent expression of immunocompetence contrary to the expectations of the ICHH. Lastly, we compared males from the unselected base population that were either successful (IS) or unsuccessful (IU) in a competitive mating experiment. IS males showed reduced immune function relative to IU males, suggesting that patterns of phenotypic correlation largely mirror patterns of genetic correlation revealed by the selection experiment. Our results suggest increased disease susceptibility could be an important cost limiting increases in sexual competitiveness in populations experiencing intense sexual selection. Such costs may be particularly important given the high intersex correlation, because this represents an apparent genetic conflict, preventing males from reaching their sexually selected optimum. © 2007 The Author(s).",35,18070086,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Drosophila melanogaster | Experimental evolution | Immune function | Life history | Sexual selection,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,225,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

In natural populations, performance-related traits such as limb length are subject to correlational and disruptive selection driven by differences in habitat use. Experimental manipulations in the wild verify the same pattern of selection and indicate that both the targets and forms of selection are consistent through time.

Parasperm have been hypothesized to perform a number of roles in place of fertilization, predominantly focused on their potential function in postcopulatory sexual selection. However, the evolutionary significance of parasperm remains unknown. Here we measured several male and female morphological, behavioral, and life-history traits in 13 obscura group species to test competing hypotheses of parasperm function using comparative methods. We found that parasperm size was unrelated to female reproductive tract morphology but was negatively related to our two indices of sperm competition, suggesting that postcopulatory sexual selection may indeed have shaped the evolution of parasperm. We also found abundant coevolution between male and female reproductive traits.

Female mussels are predominantly homoplasmic with only the F-type expressed in both somatic and gonadal tissue; males are heteroplasmic with the M-type expressed in the gonad and F-type in somatic tissue for the most part. An unusual evolutionary feature of this system is that an mt genome with F-coding sequences occasionally invades the male route of inheritance (i.e., a ""role reversal"" event), and is thereafter transmitted as a new M-type.

To investigate whether this replacement process could be due to an advantage in sperm swimming behavior, we measured differences in motility parameters and found that sperm with the recently masculinized M-type had significantly faster curvilinear velocity and average path velocity when compared to sperm with standard M-type. This increase in sperm swimming speed could explain the multiple evolutionary replacements of standard M-types by masculinized M-types that have been hypothesized for the mytilid lineage. However, our observations do not support the hypothesis that DUI originated because it permits the evolution of mitochondrial adaptations specific to sperm performance, otherwise, the evolutionarily older, standard M genome should perform better. © 2007 The Author(s).",33,18039328,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Adaptive evolution | CASA | Computer-assisted sperm analysis | Doubly uniparental inheritance | Mitochondrial DNA transmission | Mytilus,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,234,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Among many terrestrial insects, host range is strongly affected by herbivore phylogeny and long historical associations between particular herbivore and plant taxa. For small herbivores in marine environments, it is known that the evolution of host use is sculpted by several ecological factors (e.g., food quality, value as a refuge from predators, and abiotic forces), but the potential for phylogenetic constraints on host use remains largely unexplored. Here, we analyze reports of host use of herbivorous amphipods from the family Ampithoidae (102 amphipod species from 12 genera) to test the hypotheses that host breadth and composition vary among herbivore lineages, and to quantify the extent to which nonpolar secondary metabolites mediate these patterns. The family as a whole, and most individual species, are found on a wide variety of macroalgae and seagrasses. Despite this polyphagous host use, amphipod genera consistently differed in host range and composition. As an example, the genus Peramphithoe rarely use available macrophytes in the order Dictyotales (e.g., Dictyota) and as a consequence, display a more restricted host range than do other genera (e.g., Ampithoe, Cymadusa, or Exampithoe). The strong phylogenetic effect on host use was independent of the uneven distribution of host taxa among geographic regions. Algae that produced nonpolar secondary metabolites were colonized by higher numbers of amphipod species relative to chemically poor genera, consistent with the notion that secondary metabolites do not provide algae an escape from amphipod herbivory. In contrast to patterns described for some groups of phytophagous insects, marine amphipods that use chemically rich algae tended to have broader, not narrower, host ranges. This result suggests that an evolutionary advantage to metabolite tolerance in marine amphipods may be that it increases the availability of appropriate algal hosts (i.e., enlarges the resource base). © 2007 The Author(s).",67,18039329,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Amphipods | Herbivory | Macroalgae | Plant-animal interactions | Specialization,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,237,NA,NA,NA,NA

Results from an expression study of a gene involved in early gonadogenesis in GSD (Apalone mutica) and TSD (Chrysemys picta) turtles, support the hypothesis that Wt1 in A. mutica displays such a relic thermal sensitivity. This retention is likely enabled by Sf1, a gene immediately downstream from Wt1 whose expression is independent of temperature in this species. My results constitute the first empirical evidence of a GSD vertebrate exhibiting thermal sensitivity in the expression of a gene regulating gonadogenesis.

At the phage population level, coevolution led to the evolution of broader infectivity range, but without an associated decrease in phage growth rate relative to the ancestor, whereas phage evolution in the absence of bacterial evolution led to an increased growth rate but no increase in infectivity range. In contrast, both selection regimes led to phage adaptation (in terms of growth rates) to their respective bacterial hosts. At the level of individual phage genotypes, coevolution resulted in within-population diversification in generalist and specialist infectivity range types. This pattern was consistent with a multilocus gene-for-gene interaction, further confirmed by an observed cost of broad infectivity range for individual phage. Moreover, coevolution led to the emergence of bacterial genotype by phage genotype interactions in the reduction of bacterial growth rate by phage.

The fitness consequences of different family compositions determine the evolutionarily stable mating strategy and depend on the interplay of genetic features, the nature of mating, and factors that govern offspring development. This theoretical article considers the relative contributions of these influences and their interacting effects on mating-system evolution, given a fixed genetic load within a population. Strong inbreeding depression after offspring gain independence selects for exclusive outcrossing, regardless of the intensity of predispersal inbreeding depression, unless insufficient mating limits offspring production. The extent to which selfing evolves under weak postdispersal inbreeding depression depends on predispersal inbreeding depression and the opportunity for resource limitation of offspring production. Mixed selfing and outcrossing is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) if selfed zygotes survive poorly, but selfed offspring survive well, and maternal individuals produce enough ""extra"" eggs that deaths of unviable outcrossed embryos do not impact offspring production (reproductive compensation). Mixed mating can also be an ESS, despite weak lifetime inbreeding depression, if self-mating reduces the number of male gametes available for outcrossing (male-gamete discounting). Reproductive compensation and male-gamete discounting act largely independently on mating-system evolution. ESS mating systems always involve either complete fertilization or fertilization of enough eggs to induce resource competition among embryos, so although reproductive assurance is adaptive with insufficient mating, it is never an ESS. Our results illustrate the theoretical importance of different constraints on offspring production (availability of male gametes, egg production, and maternal resources) for both the course and outcome of mating-system evolution, whereas unequal competition between selfed and outcrossed embryos has limited effect. These results also underscore the significance of heterogeneity in the nature and intensity of inbreeding depression during the life cycle for the evolution of hermaphrodite mating systems. © 2007 The Author(s).",50,18067573,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Inbreeding depression | Mating system | Mixed mating | Outcrossing | Selfing,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,240,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Although the well-studied Alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) polymorphism makes a contribution to the clines, it accounts for only a small proportion of the phenotypic variation. We describe an amino acid replacement polymorphism in Aldehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh), the gene encoding the second enzyme in the ethanol degradation pathway, that shows hallmarks of also contributing to the clines. The derived Aldh allele, like the Adh-Fast allele, increases in frequency in laboratory populations selected for ethanol resistance, and increases in frequency with latitude in wild populations. Moreover, strains with the derived allele have significantly higher ALDH enzyme activity with acetaldehyde (the breakdown product of ethanol) as a substrate than strains with the ancestral allele. As is the case with the Adh-Fast allele, chromosomes with the derived Aldh allele show markedly reduced molecular variation in the vicinity of the replacement polymorphism compared to those with the ancestral allele, suggesting a single, relatively recent origin. Nonetheless, the Aldh polymorphism differs from the Adh polymorphism in that the ethanol-associated allele remains in relatively low frequency in most populations. We present evidence that this is likely to be the result of a trade-off in catalytic activity, with the advantage of the derived allele in acetaldehyde detoxification being offset by a disadvantage in detoxification of other aldehydes. © 2007 The Author(s).",38,18070084,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Adaptation | Molecular evolution | Physiology | Selection - experimental | Selection - natural | Trade-offs,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,242,NA,NA,NA,NA

Alternatively, dimorphism alleles could initially be expressed in both sexes, but subsequently be repressed or promoted in only one sex by the evolution of modifier genes or regulatory elements. We investigated these alternatives by looking for the expression of sexually dimorphic traits in female hybrids between bird species whose males show different types of ornaments. If modifier alleles or regulatory elements involved in sex-limited traits are not completely dominant, the modification should break down in female hybrids, which might then show dimorphic traits resembling those seen in males. Of 13 interspecific hybridizations examined, we found not a single instance of the expression of male-limited ornaments in female hybrids. This suggests that male ornaments were sex limited from the outset or that those traits became sex limited through the evolution of dominant modifiers - possibly cis-dominant regulatory elements.

This finding demonstrates that there are generalized benefits to adaptation in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes even though the underlying processes are mechanistically different. © 2007 The Author(s).",77,17976191,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Adaptation | Experimental evolution | Genetic exchange | Helicobacter pylori | Natural transformation,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,249,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

The presence of genetic variation in pleiotropy is necessary for natural selection to shape patterns of covariation between traits. We examined the contribution of differential epistasis to variation in the intertrait relationship and the nature of this variation. Genetic variation in pleiotropy was revealed by mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting the allometry of mouse limb and tail length relative to body weight in the mouse-inbred strain LG/J by SM/J intercross. These relationship QTLs (rQTLs) modify relationships between the traits affected by a common pleiotropic locus. We detected 11 rQTLs, mostly affecting allometry of multiple bones. We further identified epistatic interactions responsible for the observed allometric variation. Forty loci that interact epistatically with the detected rQTLs were identified. We demonstrate how these epistatic interactions differentially affect the body size variance and the covariance of traits with body size. We conclude that epistasis, by differentially affecting both the canalization and mean values of the traits of a pleiotropic domain, causes variation in the covariance structure. Variation in pleiotropy maintains evolvability of the genetic architecture, in particular the evolvability of its modular organization. © 2007 The Author(s).",101,18005158,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Canalization | Evolvability | Genetic architecture | Modularity | Mouse | QTL,22104,P30DK056341,1,TRUE,250,all,All Open Access,NIDDK,National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases

In this species, the dominant female is the only mated worker (gamergate) and monopolizes reproduction. We experimentally induced conflicts by splitting each colony into two groups, a control group containing the gamergate and an orphaned group displaying aggressions until a new dominant worker arises. Immunocompetence was assessed by the clearance of Escherichia coli bacteria that we injected into the ants. Time budget analysis revealed a lower rate of labor and especially brood care in orphaned groups, supporting the existence of a cost of conflicts on labor. Fifteen days after splitting, a lower immunocompetence was also found in orphaned groups, which concerned workers involved and not involved in conflicts.

It has received support from both empirical studies and a meta-analysis, which concludes that polyandrous females enjoy increased reproductive success through improved offspring viability relative to monandrous females. In this study we investigate whether polyandrous female Drosophila simulans improve their fitness relative to monandrous females in the face of severe Wolbachia-associated reproductive incompatibilities. We use the results of this study to develop models that test the predictions that Wolbachia should promote polyandry, and that polyandry itself may constrain the spread of Wolbachia. Uniquely, our models allow biologically relevant rates of incompatibility to coevolve with a polyandry modifier allele, which allows us to evaluate the fate of the modifier and that of Wolbachia. Our empirical results reveal that polyandrous females significantly reduce the reproductive costs of Wolbachia, owing to infected males being poor sperm competitors. The models show that this disadvantage in sperm competition can inhibit or prevent the invasion of Wolbachia. However, despite the increased reproductive success obtained by polyandrous females, the spread of a polyandry modifier allele is constrained by any costs that might be associated with polyandry and the low frequency of incompatible matings when Wolbachia has reached a stable equilibrium. Therefore, although incompatibility avoidance may be a benefit of polyandry, our findings do not support the hypothesis that genetic incompatibilities caused by Wolbachia promote the evolution of polyandry. © 2007 The Author(s).",25,18067571,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Cytoplasmic incompatibility | Drosophila | Evolution | Genetic incompatibility avoidance hypothesis | Model | Multiple mating | Sperm competition,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,252,NA,NA,NA,NA

Traditionally, male-biased OSRs and high population densities have been thought to increase the opportunity for sexual selection on male sexual traits due to increased male competition for mates. Recent experimental evidence, however, suggests that male-biased OSRs might reduce the opportunity for sexual selection due to increased sexual coercion experienced by females. How OSR, density, and any resultant changes in the opportunity for sexual selection actually affect selection on male sexual traits is unclear. In this study, we independently manipulated OSR and density in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata) without altering the number of males present. We recorded male and female behavior and used DNA microsatellite data to assign paternity to offspring and estimate male reproductive success. We then used linear selection analyses to examine the effects of OSR and density on directional sexual selection on male behavioral and morphological traits. We found that females were pursued more by males in male-biased treatments, despite no change in individual male behavior. There were no differences in sexual behavior experienced by females or performed by males in relation to density. Neither OSR nor density significantly altered the opportunity for sexual selection. Also, Although there was significant multivariate linear selection operating on males, neither OSR nor density altered the pattern of sexual selection on male traits. Our results suggest that differences in either OSR or density (independent of the number of males present) are unlikely to alter directional evolutionary change in male sexual traits. © 2007 The Author(s).",44,18067568,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Density | Guppies | Microsatellite paternity analysis | Operational sex ratio | Opportunity for sexual selection | Selection analysis | Sexual coercion,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,253,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

The dimensions of the fly's proboscis and the flower's corolla tube length varied significantly among sites and were strongly correlated with each other. In addition, the match between tube length of flowers and tongue length of flies was found to affect plant fitness. The relationship between flower tube length and fly proboscis length remained significant in models that included various alternative environmental (altitude, longitude, latitude) and allometric (fly body size, flower diameter) predictor variables.

These are important results for marine animals like coral reef fish, where ocean currents can carry planktonic larvae over broad ranges, interconnecting populations and slowing genetic divergence. The Caribbean hamlets (genus Hypoplectrus) are a flock of reef fish morphospecies with highly distinct color pattern that mate like with like, but show little mitochondrial or microsatellite DNA differentiation. Here, we broadly screen genomic diversity using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) and survey mating pair formation between two morphospecies in the Florida Keys, the butter hamlet (H. unicolor) and the blue hamlet (H. gemma). No AFLP was species-diagnostic (fixed), and neighbor-joining analyses revealed no clustering of individuals consistent with morphospecies boundaries. Assignment tests, however, placed most individuals within their morphospecies of origin. Field surveys showed that > 98% of mating pairs, including those of rare morphospecies, were of like color pattern. Spawning by a single mixed pair adds to earlier observations suggesting that infrequent hybridization may be a genetically homogenizing force in Hypoplectrus.
