Summer-flowering woodland annuals do not colonize old fields due to physiological intolerance of light and soil-moisture conditions in some areas in the old field, as well as other unexamined factors (but not pattern of biomass allocation). Differences between old-field and woodland annuals in shoot and root architecture, rather than percentage biomass allocation, appear more likely to explain the restricted distribution of these woodland annuals. -from Authors",14,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,72,NA,NA
