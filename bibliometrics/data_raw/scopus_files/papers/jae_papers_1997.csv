The effects of predator reduction on the breeding performance and sex ratio of Microtus voles were studied in a cyclically fluctuating vole assemblage in western Finland, where the field vole (Microtus agrestis) and the sibling vole (M. rossiaemeridionalis) are the main prey of small mustelids. 2. The densities of small mustelids [the least weasel (Mustela nivalis nivalis) and the stoat (M. erminea)] were reduced experimentally in three large (2-3 km2) unfenced areas in 1992, during a crash phase of the vole cycle, and in three different areas during the following crash phase in 1995. The reproductive performance of Microtus voles was compared between control and manipulation areas before and after reducing predators. 3. The reduction of predators increased the productivity of female voles, mainly due to an increased proportion of pregnancies, whereas the body condition of voles was not affected by the manipulation. This suggests that high predation risk in control areas suppressed the breeding of free-living voles. 4. The sex ratio of trapped voles before the manipulation did not differ between reduction and control areas, but after predators were reduced the sex ratio was more male-biased in the control areas. This indicates that small mustelids selectively killed female voles. 5. Our results suggest two possible mechanisms which may have operated concurrently. An adaptive explanation is that voles traded their current reproductive investment against future breeding under high predation risk. A simpler explanation is that small mustelids selectively preyed on pregnant female voles. Both suppressed breeding and selective killing would lead to a lower proportion of reproducing individuals in the vole population. Therefore, our results show that the presence of small mustelid predators slowed the population growth of Microtus voles.",Least weasel | Predation risk | Reproductive investment | Selective predation | Stoat,NA,NA,NA

The influence of food supply on avian egg production has been investigated in many studies by the experimental provision of supplementary food. Most such studies, however, have considered food only in terms of energy supply. 2. In this paper we investigate the possibility that other nutrients may proximately constrain egg production. This was achieved through the experimental provisioning of breeding blue tits (Parus caeruleus L.) with two different qualities of supplementary food prior to and during the egg laying period. One group received a pure energy food (animal fat) and the other cooked eggs (on the assumption that this would contain all the necessary nutrients for egg formation). 3. Supplementary lipid and supplementary egg resulted in the same degree of laying enhancement compared with control birds. 4. The provision of supplementary egg resulted in a significant increase in egg volume (≃ 7%), whilst supplementary lipid had no significant effect on egg size. The eggs laid early in the laying sequence showed the greatest size increase, with eggs from the egg-fed treatment group being significantly larger than those in both the fat-fed and control groups. Clutch size declined through the season, but was unaffected by supplementary feeding. 5. We discuss the hypothesis that energy supply may influence the initiation of laying, whilst specific nutrients may proximately constrain egg production. The possible identity of these specific nutrients is considered.",Birds | Breeding | Diet quality | Energy | Protein,NA,NA,NA

Natal dispersal of seven cohorts (1988-94) of the colonial lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) was studied in southern Spain. We ringed 1852 nestlings and resighted 321 (17.3%) which survived at least the first migration to Africa. Of the returning individuals, 57% settled in their natal colonies and the remaining 43% dispersed to other colonies. Resights fell off markedly with increasing distance from the natal colony; more than 90% of resights were within 30 km of the birthplace. 2. Contrary to most avian studies, dispersal from the natal site was not sex-biased in our population. The proportion of dispersing males (41%, n = 171) did not differ significantly from that of females (45%, n = 150). Excluding philopatric individuals, the median dispersal distance for males (19 km) did not differ from that of females (18.5 km). 3. Siblings (72 twos) dispersed or were philopatric independently of each other. This result provides no support for either a genetic basis of dispersal (which predicts the same strategy for both siblings) or the inbreeding avoidance hypothesis (which predicts greater dispersal in one sex than the other). This latter hypothesis also conflicts with our observation that the presence of the parent of the opposite sex in the natal colony has no effect on whether returning individuals disperse. 4. Generalized linear models (GLMs) showed that the probability of dispersal for an individual increased when the absolute growth of its natal colony decreased and also from beginning to end of the study, coincidental with a general population increase. These results point to a link between colony saturation and dispersal. GLMs also showed that dispersal distances tended to increase with size of the natal colony and higher breeding success. These results are also consistent with intraspecific competition for resources. 5. Some individuals were observed in two different colonies in their year of first return. These observations, and the lack of active inbreeding avoidance, suggest a scenario for the dispersal process: individuals would prefer to settle in their natal colonies. If they cannot secure a nest site or a mate, they will have to decide whether to stay as nonbreeders or to disperse in search of another breeding chance elsewhere. The actual decision to disperse could be triggered by the level of aggression the unmated individuals encounter in their natal colonies.",Dispersal | Falco naumanni | Generalized linear models | Philopatry | Raptors,NA,NA,NA

Individuals in many social species are attracted to feeding conspecifics. The profitability of conspecific attraction is negatively frequency-dependent and can be modelled as a producer-scrounger (PS) game for which the ESS solution predicts some mixture of producer (no attraction) and scrounger (attraction) tactics in the population. Current models for the spatial distribution of rate-maximizing foragers, which learn the quality of habitats as they exploit patches, ignore the possible effect of conspecific attraction on the stable distribution of foragers. 2. We used simulations of a population with ESS levels of attraction to investigate the effect of conspecific attraction on the spatial distribution of learning foragers which incur travel costs. In habitats where patches depleted slowly, ESS levels of attraction helped foragers which experienced no interference reach the expected ideal free distribution (IFD) by facilitating aggregation to the richest patches. Large aggregations also occurred with interference and thus reduced the fit to the IFD, which in this case predicts a scatter of foragers across patches of varying quality. 3. In habitats where patches depleted rapidly, ESS levels of attraction prevented foragers from reaching the IFD, irrespective of interference levels, Foragers failed to learn habitat quality and thus often aggregated in poor patches, especially in large populations which depleted patches faster and had fewer opportunities to learn quality. 4. Predictions of the model in habitats where patches deplete slowly are supported by several studies. More work is needed for habitats where patches deplete more rapidly. We conclude that conspecific attraction can have important, and often disruptive effects on spatial distributions.",Conspecific attraction | Ideal free distribution | Interference | Learning | Scrounging,NA,NA,NA

The grasshopper Bryodema tuberculata requires open and dry habitats. In Central Europe, it survives only on gravel bars along braided rivers in the Northern Alps. Even there, many populations of B. tuberculata have become extinct in the last 50 years. 2. The dynamics of braided rivers are characterized by succession and floods. Catastrophic floods occur at irregular intervals. They are capable of washing away entire gravel bars and of building new, vegetation-free gravel bars. Succession eventually leads to an almost complete loss of habitat suitable for B. tuberculata on each single gravel bar. 3. Bryodema tuberculata can persist only as metapopulations, i.e. when local extinctions due to succession or flood events are compensated for by colonization of newly created gravel bars. 4. A stimulation model was used to examine how the spatial and temporal dynamics of succession, flood regime and colonization determine the ability of B. tuberculata to survive in flood-plains. 5. The results show that small populations on relatively old gravel bars are important to the persistence of B. tuberculata, even though they usually only survive for a short time, due to demographic noise. 6. The effect of catastrophic floods is ambivalent: persistence is low if time intervals between floods are too short or too long. If floods are too frequent many subpopulations are extinguished at the same time and if floods are to infrequent, local populations are eliminated by succession. 7. It is concluded that most extinctions of B. tuberculata populations in the Northern Alps are due to changes in the flood regime caused by humans. 8. Many other spatially dynamic animals and plants occupy successional habitats. We suggest that the form of model outlined in this paper, based on dynamic habitat mosaic, be used for such organisms.",Braided river | Disturbance regime | Mean persistence time | Simulation model | Succession,NA,NA,NA

Male and female European robins, Erithacus rubecula, defended separate territories from August to January. Pairs formed between January and March. 2. The benefits of early pairing were twofold: first, as 20% of males failed to pair there was strong competition for females; second, although pairing was initially costly in terms of individual foraging success, bachelors invested more time advertising in the long term. 3. Birds on individual territories encountered large food items more frequently than those on pair territories. This decrease in foraging success within pairs was identified as a cost of territory sharing. 4. To test the hypothesis that food availability underlies the defence of individual territories in winter, and the timing of switches to pair territoriality, I manipulated food supply and recorded individual behaviour. 5. Compared to controls, males provided with extra food were forced to repel intruders more frequently, yet advertised for mates earlier and paired earlier. 6. Pair members whose supplementary food supply was temporarily withdrawn spent less time consorting than controls. This suggests that an elevated food supply helped individuals to afford the costs of sharing their food resources, and thus to pair and lay clutches early. 7.

A migratory breeding population of Eurasian wigeon Anas penelope L., was studied over the period 1975 95 on 54 km2 of freshwater habitat at Lake Myvatn, northern Iceland. Spring numbers of males averaged 1076 (range 526 1887). The sex ratio was 0.97 females per male and the proportion of yearling males averaged 0.21. The mean brood was 3.93 and a mean of 2.83 young per female (range 0.09-.14) was produced. Production of young was positively related to chironomid abundance and negatively to cold and wet weather. 2. Both sexes seem to be faithful to their winter range, but males are much less faithful to the summer range than are females. The apparent return rate of males is presumably an expression of the return rate of females, which had previously bred locally or been produced at Myvatn. 3. The apparent return rate of old males (2 years or older), mean 0.84 (range 0.58 1.22), was positively correlated with chironomid abundance in the previous summer, which varied greatly. It is suggested that abundant chironomids in late summer may provide a source of highly nutritious food which would increase the probability of wigeon returning to Myvatn or favour the survival of Myvatn wigeon on winter grounds shared with birds originating from other breeding areas. Chironomid numbers showed serial correlation, hence it may be advantageous for the birds to assess the food supply before departure and return accordingly. 4. The apparent return rate of yearling males, mean 0.22 (range 0.06 0.56), was negatively related to the number of young produced in the year before. 5. The density of breeding wigeon at Lake Myvatn was mainly determined by food conditions in the breeding area, as experienced by the adults 1 year previously, and events in the winter range appeared to have less influence.

The most common form of cooperative breeding in birds involves a pair and their adult offspring ('helpers') provisioning young. Many studies show that pairs with helpers have higher reproductive success than pairs alone, but the differences could be due to confounding variables, like parental or territory quality, rather than to helping behaviour. 2. One method of testing whether helping increases reproductive success is to compare the success of intact groups with those from which helpers have been removed. The disadvantage is that variables other than provisioning by helpers (e.g. group size) are affected, which themselves could affect reproductive success. Alternatively, one can attempt to control statistically for confounding variables, but this is difficult in territorial species because it may be impossible to ensure that all confounding variables are measured. 3. We took advantage of natural variability in provisioning behaviour among sub-ordinate white-brewed scrubwrens, Sericornis frontalis, to assess the effect of helping. Scrubwrens are a small passerine in the family Pardalotidae in which male offspring may remain on the natal territory as adults. We compared the reproductive performance of pairs, groups with nonhelping subordinates and groups with helping subordinates, using data from 4-years' study of an individually colour-banded population resident in the Australian National Botanic Gardens, Canberra. 4. The total rate of feeds to nestlings was greater when helpers were present, but we could detect no increase in nestling weight. Furthermore, we found no effect of helping behaviour on reproductive performance or reproductive success. Our measures included: (i) duration of the nesting cycle and interval between nesting attempts; (ii) success of individual nesting attempts, measured in over 20 ways; and (iii) reproductive success over the whole breeding season, measured as the total number of fledglings and independent young. 5. There was also no effect of helping on survival of the female or dominant male. 6. We conclude that helping behaviour does not have a substantial, consistent effect on reproductive success, but cannot eliminate the possibility that it might increase reproductive success by a small amount or in some territories or years. Alternatively, helping behaviour might be the nonadaptive consequence of gene flow from populations in which it is adaptive. Nonetheless, we reject Jamieson's hypothesis that helping behaviour is a nonselected consequence of strong selection on parental behaviour, because, unlike many other species, helping is not an invariant consequence of natal philopatry.",Cooperative breeding | Helpers-at-the-nest | Philopatry | Sericornis frontalis,NA,NA,NA

The hypothesis that mass reduction in breeding passerines results from energetic stress was evaluated using data on body mass changes in female blue tits Parus caeruleus. 2. In accordance with both the adaptive adjustment and the physiological stress hypotheses, females with experimentally enlarged broods lost more mass than females rearing reduced or control broods. However, the ability to allocate energy to self-maintenance (as measured by the regrowth rate of a tail feather removed during incubation) was negatively correlated with the amount of lost body mass. 3. In one of the study years, loss of body mass was more pronounced among small females, suggesting that larger females are better able to cope with poor food conditions during breeding. 4. In a poor-weather year, 30% of the females deserted their clutches, compared with 8% in a good year. Females that deserted their clutches before hatching were significantly lighter during incubation than non-deserters, indicating that good body condition is important for successful reproduction. 5. In one year young females lost more mass than older females and therefore the ability to maintain adequate body condition in the face of energetic stress appears to be age-dependent. 6. Taken together, these results suggest that mass loss in breeding blue tits is to some degree, attributable to energetic stress, although we have not ruled out the possibility that flight cost reductions may help explain the phenomenon.",Body mass | Energetic stress | Flight costs | Mass loss | Parus caeruleus,NA,NA,NA

Last-hatched females suffered greater mortality than last-hatched males, although the difference was only significant in three-chick broods.

Self-thinning, the reduction in density (N) as a consequence of the increase in the mean weight (W) of individuals, occurs widely in populations of plants when their growth is constrained at high densities, but has only recently been reported to occur within populations of wild mobile animals. It has been suggested that a self-thinning relationship in which the gradient (Δlog(W)/Δlog(N)) approximates to -1.33 describes concomitant changes in W and N within cohorts of a population of anadromous brown trout (sea trout) Salmo trutta throughout their lives as juveniles in fresh water. This apparent self-thinning occurs with no evidence of density-dependent growth or mortality (as measured by key-factor analysis) after the critical period. 2. Here, the relationship between weights and densities of trout has been examined further. A linear model incorporating log(N), year class and time of year explained 99.5% of the variation in log(W), giving a significantly better fit than incorporating only log(N) and year class. Variation in log(N) explained 85% of the variation in log(W); the addition of year class increased this value by 6% and the addition of monitoring period increased it by a further 8.5%. 3. The gradients for the relationships between log(W) and log(N) within years varied significantly with time of the year. Pooled thinning trajectories for the first winter of the life of trout differed significantly from a gradient of -1.33, while those for the second summer were highly variable and sometimes positive (suggesting that immigration could exceed mortality). Thinning trajectories over the first summer of life were related inversely to the densities of trout at the start of the monitoring period in that summer (N(s)), but this relation appeared to approach an asymptote at high values of N(s). The mean of the thinning trajectories for cohorts with high N(s) (exceeding 300 fish 60 m-2) was not significantly different from -1.33. However, these slopes were shown to result primarily from the presence of high numbers of failed non-territorial fish early in the summer rather than true thinning throughout the summer. 4. The apparent absence of a simple consistent thinning relationship after a critical period in the first couple of months of the lives of cohorts can be explained by three factors. First, the total availability of limiting resources, such as space and food, is not constant but changes with the mean size of the trout. Secondly, there is a winter cessation of growth. Thirdly, trout switch to use different habitats during their development. The implications for interpreting thinning relationships for salmonid fishes in general are discussed.",Density dependence | Growth | Mortality | Population dynamics | Salmo trutta,NA,NA,NA

Trophic niche overlaps were calculated monthly for all possible intraspecific and interspecific pairs of individuals from sympatric populations. Niche breadth was estimated from: (i) every faecal sample; (ii) all the faecal samples collected per month in a given population (geographical area). 3. In every population, the bulk of the diets of M. myotis and M. blythii consisted of, respectively, terrestrial (e.g. carabid beetles) and grass-dwelling (mostly bush crickets) prey. All intraspecific trophic niche overlaps were significantly greater than the interspecific one, except in Switzerland in May when both species exploited mass concentrations of cockchafers, a non-limiting food source. This clearcut partitioning of resources may allow the stable, intimate coexistence observed under sympatric conditions. 4. Relative proportions of ground- and grass-dwelling prey, as well as niche breadths (either individual or population), did not differ significantly between sympatry and allopatry, showing that, under allopatric conditions, niche expansion does not take place. This suggests that active interspecific competition is not the underlying mechanism responsible for the niche partitioning which is currently observed between M. myotis and M. blythii.",Chiroptera | Community ecology | Cryptic species | Dietary niches | Niche displacement,NA,NA,NA

We develop an individuals-based model that predicts the strength of interference between foraging animals from basic elements of their behaviour. The model is based on the same principles as previous behaviour-based interference models, but extends and adds further realism to these models. One key difference is that in our model the responses of animals to competitors are not fixed, as is assumed in previous models. Instead, animals use optimal decision rules to determine responses which maximize their intake rate. 2. The general shape of interference function generated by the model is similar to that predicted by previous behaviour-based models. Interference is insignificant at low competitor densities, but steadily increases in intensity as density rises. However, comparison with the observed level of interference between oystercatchers, Haematopus ostralegus, feeding on mussels, Mytilus edulis, shows that the model's predictive power is substantially increased through the addition of optimal decision rules. When animals have a fixed response to encounters, too much interference occurs because dominant animals waste time avoiding subdominants and subdominants waste time attempting, but failing, to steal prey from dominants. When animals use optimal decision rules, only subdominants avoid, and only dominants initiate attacks. Interference is therefore reduced and is much closer to that observed. 3. The conditions under which optimal decision rules will lead to interference are described in terms of basic elements of foraging behaviour. Interference is predicted to occur when handling time and the probability of winning fights are high, and when prey encounter rate and the duration of fights are low. These parameters are used to predict successfully the presence or absence of interference in a range of shorebird-prey systems. 4. We suggest that behaviour-based interference models will need to incorporate optimal decision rules if they are to predict accurately the strength of interference observed in real predator-prey systems.",Avoidance behaviour | Individuals-based model | Interference competition | Kleptoparasitism | Optimal foraging behaviour,NA,NA,NA

Immature insect stages that are hosts for parasitoids usually increase in size as they age. Parasitoid responses include feeding on the smallest stages and laying progressively more female-biased and larger clutches as host size increases. Among koinobiotic parasitoids, eggs laid in older hosts tend to develop faster and survive better us larvae. Additionally, the parasitoid's decision concerning host feeding and sex allocation can also depend on her egg load. Except for the pure development rate effect in koinobionts, these processes all result in a larger gain to the future female parasitoid population from attacks on older hosts. 2. We introduce a framework for evaluating the dynamical consequences of these processes by summarizing existing models describing an invulnerable adult host stage, host size-dependent sex allocation and host feeding, and parasitoid state-dependent attacks when the host has no stage structure. 3. We introduce new models of host size-dependent clutch size, a combination of that and host size-dependent sex allocation and host feeding, and a combination of the latter and parasitoid behaviour that depends on her egg load. A model in which the parasitoid responds to the mean egg load of the population is a good approximation to one that follows each egg load class individually. Finally, we incorporate the two aspects of koinobiotic parasitoids. All of the behaviours examined, except for faster parasitoid development on older hosts, have the same qualitative effect on dynamics: they introduce or increase the strength of delayed density-dependence in the parasitoid population. This arises because when the parasitoid attacks younger hosts, which produce a relatively small gain to the future female parasitoid population, these hosts are not available later, when they would have produced a larger gain. 4. We discuss how the results provide a unified framework that brings together an apparently disparate set of processes in parasitoid host interactions and thus simplifies and generalizes the theory. We incorporate these with related modelling results on stage-structured parasitoid -host interactions into a general framework.",Cycles | Insects | Models | Population dynamics | Stage structure,NA,NA,NA

Timing of breeding, clutch size and egg size did not differ between the two food supplements. Thus, the hypothesis that a low protein content of supplement restricts laying in great tits cannot be supported. 3. Food supplementation, independent of food type and year, led to an advancement of laying by 5-6 days. Average clutch size of supplemented birds, corrected for laying date and year, was 0.55 eggs above the population average. 4. Supplementary fed great tits did not breed more successfully than controls. This suggests that by adding food early in laying, birds were induced to lay at a less favourable time and/or produced clutches that were too large to care for successfully under normal food condition. Thus food early in the season might not only energetically restrict laying birds, but also provide clues about future conditions during chick rearing. 5. The comparison of results of published supplemental feeding experiments shows that the birds responded more strongly to additional feeding in poor environments. Almost two-thirds of the variation in changes of clutch size due to experimental treatment can be explained by year quality. Thus, only in poor environments do reproductive traits seem to be limited by energy availability early in the season, but other factors become more important in good environments.",Clutch size | Egg formation | Food quality | Food supplementation | Parus major,NA,NA,NA

Life-history parameters (age and size at first reproduction, female age/size distribution, reproductive output) were compared between two populations of the viviparous water skink Eulamprus tympanum in temperate south-eastern Australia. The two populations were in close proximity to each other (6 km) but separated by 1000 m in altitude. 2. Age and size at first reproduction differed significantly between the two populations. Low-altitude females appear to start reproduction at 2 years of age and at a relatively small size (70 mm snout vent length) whereas high-altitude females start to reproduce at 5 years of age and at a larger size (90 mm snout vent length). The data suggest that size at first reproduction at high altitude is larger, not only because thermal conditions slow annual growth rates and therefore delay first reproduction, but because small size is a disadvantage for reproducing females under such conditions. 3. Reproductive output also differed significantly between the two populations, with low-altitude females producing relatively large litters with small young and high-altitude females producing relatively small litters with large young. The total offspring mass a female produced in relation to her body size was significantly smaller in high-altitude E. tympanum, suggesting strong environmental constraints on reproduction compared with low-altitude E. tympanum. 4. To test whether reproductive output can be influenced by local environmental conditions, or whether it requires natural selection to produce a change in this parameter, food intake was manipulated in high-altitude females during their pregnancy. Low-diet females produced a significantly smaller total offspring mass and smaller litters than high-diet females. There was no significant difference in mean offspring size between the two treatments. 5. Effects of age on reproductive parameters were examined to determine whether reproductive output increases with maternal age, for example as a consequence of more experience gained by older females, or decreases, possibly as a result of senescence. In neither population was there evidence for an increase or decline in reproductive output with the age of reproducing females independent of the effects of maternal size.",Fecundity | Life-history patterns | Maturity | Phenotypic plasticity | Reptilia | Scincidae,NA,NA,NA

Many temperate rodents appear to adjust reproductive effort with changes in density to optimize individual fitness, thereby conforming to predictions. 2. Populations of Neotropical rodents living in seasonal environments have not been studied for sufficient duration to examine relationships among resource abundance, density and reproductive activity.

Experimental tests with juvenile Atlantic salmon showed that there was no difference in foraging efficiency between fish held in high and low velocity water until light intensities dropped below 0.11x (similar to full moon with a clear sky); however, below this point fish were more efficient at intercepting food in slower flowing water. 3. When given a choice of foraging location, juvenile salmon exhibited the predicted shift towards slower velocity microhabitats as light level was reduced; the most profitable feeding habitat for the fish was therefore dependent on the night-time conditions (overcast vs. full moon).

Intra-brood competition and parental feeding effort are considered important determinants of survival of offspring in altricial bird species because they affect accumulation of fat reserves by nestlings. However, the causal relationship between rearing conditions and post-fledging survival might also be mediated by other mechanisms; for example, the amount and quality of food provided by parents to each nestling might affect development of immune system organs and functions and, hence, the ability of offspring to cope with parasites and pathogens. 2. The hypothesis that parental feeding effort, food quality and brood size affect immunocompetence of nestlings was tested for the first time in the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, Linnaeus. 3. The intensity of T-lymphocyte cell-mediated immune responsiveness was evaluated after intradermal inoculation of a lectin (phytohaemagglutinin) in a large sample of nestlings from unmanipulated broods and broods whose size had been manipulated immediately after hatching. 4. In unmanipulated broods, immune response, body mass and body condition were correlated negatively with brood size and positively with the rate of parental feeding to each offspring. Nestlings in enlarged broods had smaller immune response and body mass, and received less food per capita than those in reduced broods. 5. Broods artificially provisioned with a food rich in proteins showed larger immune response, but not larger body mass, as compared to unprovisioned controls. 6. We conclude that T-lymphocyte cell-mediated immune response as well as body mass is influenced by the level of parental investment and brood size, perhaps via its effect on competition for food. Since T-lymphocytes are fundamental components of avian immunity, and parasites are known to affect survival of their avian hosts, our results suggest a new pathway through which rearing conditions might influence offspring survival.",Brood size manipulation | Food quality | Parental care | Phytohaemagglutinin | T-lymphocyte-mediated immunity,NA,NA,NA

Legal protection since the 1950s, and the reductions in the use of DDT and other organochlorine compounds from around 1970, made recovery and resettlement of raptor species possible in both Britain (GB) and the +Netherlands (NL). Data on the distribution of various species between 1960 and 1994, are used for calculating the velocity of range expansion in both countries. 2. The relationship of the square root of the area occupied as a function of time is linear, which implies a constant rate of range reoccupation. The sequence in observed velocities of reoccupation from slowest to fastest is as follows: red kite, Milvus L. (GB); buzzard, Buteo L. (GB); osprey, Pandion haliaetus L. (GB); buzzard (NL); marsh harrier, Circus aeruginosus L. (GB); sparrowhawk, Accipiter nisus L. (NL); sparrowhawk (GB); goshawk, Accipiter gentilis L. (Wales); peregrine, Falco peregrinus Tunst. (GB); and goshawk (NL). 3. Expansion of the buzzard in Britain 1972-92 was lower than during the period 1915-54. This species is reported to be heavily persecuted, especially along the edge of the distribution range. For the same reason the goshawk in Britain expanded only in some areas, and disappeared in others. 4. Using the model of Van den Bosch et al. (1990), an expected velocity of range expansion was calculated based on published data on reproduction, survival and dispersal of new breeding birds. These three parameters sufficed to obtain a reliable fit to the observed velocities of range expansion for a part of the distribution range of a species. The expected velocities are about the same as the observed ones. 5. In the species under study, different types of range expansion are distinguished: (i) colonization of an island (an invasion sensu stricto; osprey, goshawk GB); (ii) colonization from a very small starting area (an invasion sensu lato; marsh harrier, red kite); and (iii) reoccupation of former breeding grounds in a part of the distribution range (recovery; goshawk NL, buzzard NL GB, sparrowhawk GB NL). In all three cases, the processes underlying the expansion as defined in the Van den Bosch model, proved to be sufficient to explain the observations. 6. Based on simulations with the model, the present study concludes that at levels in lifetime reproduction (R(o)) just above 1.0 fledglings per female, minor increases in survival or reproduction can accelerate the velocity of range expansion substantially. Moreover, the more a species shows long-distance dispersal, the faster its range will expand from levels of R(o) just above 1.0.

In order to examine the effects of food availability on parental care and brood reduction, we provided supplementary food to groups during late incubation and the nestling phase. 3. Food supplementation increased the rate of food delivery to the nest by both breeders and helpers, leading to increased chick survival and fledging, and reduced variance in chick size at fledging. Helpers with supplemental food appeared more responsive to the need of chicks, increasing food delivery rates as the chicks grew older, and as brood size increased. 4. Control groups fed larger chicks preferentially, while supplemented groups favoured small chicks. This suggests that choughs deliberately manipulate the survival of individual young to maximize the fledging of healthy chicks, consistent with Lack's hypothesis for hatching asynchrony. 5.

Carrion from fisheries discards will subsidize marine food webs, which can sometimes result in the enhancement of consumer populations. 2. This study examines the benthic scavengers that feed on fisheries discards in three habitats in the Irish Sea. We investigated the relationship between the abundance of scavengers feeding on carrion in terms of numbers of each species and the density of those scavenger species in the surrounding area. 3. Observations with baited time-lapse cameras at a site offshore from Anglesey showed that the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus was attracted to carrion in greatest abundance and aggregated at densities of up to 330 m-2. At Red Wharf ]Bay a wider range of species was observed: starfish Asterias rubens, hermit crabs P. bernhardus, whelks Buccinum undatum and swimming crabs Liocarcinus spp. There was relatively little scavenging activity at the Walney Island site where the edible crab Cancer pagurus appeared to consume the greatest proportion of the carrion. 4. Numbers of each scavenger species at the bait were only partially related to the background population density of each species at each site. The rate of consumption of carrion varied between sites and could be related to the abundance of different scavenger species at the bait. 5. Baited traps were used to investigate those benthic scavengers that were too small to be observed by time-lapse photography. The traps caught a variety of amphipod and isopod species. Some species were habitat-specific, whereas others were ubiquitous, but specialized in eating a particular type of carrion; for example, Orchomene nanus, which was only caught in traps baited with crab. 6.

The role of male and female Apodemus sylvaticus (L.) in population regulation was investigated by their removal in two independent, replicated, field experiments, carried out in mixed woodland during the breeding season. 2. The removal of adult male A. sylvaticus during the breeding season resulted in a decline in male numbers but an increase in the number of adult females in manipulated areas. The effect of treatment was influenced by density at the start of the experiment. During the breeding season, adult male and female A. sylvaticus may compete for food. Thus, the removal of male A. sylvaticus may reduce competition for food with a concomitant increase in female numbers. 3. There was no evidence that adult male aggression influenced recruitment of young as recruitment was unaffected by male density or removal during the breeding season. The role of males in population regulation in A. sylvaticus therefore is limited to their impact on females and possibly through infanticide of nest young, rather than having a direct effect on the survival of weaned young. 4. The removal of female A. sylvaticus resulted in a fall in numbers of females and a concomitant increase in immigration of males and females on manipulated grids. Reproductive success of female immigrants was enhanced on grids where females were removed but did not result in an increase in the overall proportion of females that were reproductively active. It is suggested that reproductive activity in immigrant females is inhibited by resident females. 5. The enhanced dispersal of the females into areas from where resident females have been removed suggests that there are dispersing females in the population that may establish themselves in areas with few females and, in time, become reproductively active 6. Male immigration during the female removal experiment was lowest on control grids where female density and numbers of reproductively active females were highest. Male A. sylvaticus may orientate towards areas that offer the greatest opportunity for copulation, regardless of absolute numbers of reproductively active females. 7. The results of the present experimental manipulations are consistent with the hypothesis that spatial density-dependent inhibition of breeding in female A. sylvaticus regulates population increase during the increase phase of the annual cycle. This mechanism may be overridden by superabundance of food in some years.",Dispersal | Female reproduction | Field experiment | Population egulation | Social behaviour,NA,NA,NA

This paper describes the colonization patterns of, and interactions between, three common species of British seaweed fly: the coelopids, Coelopa frigida and C. pilipes; and the sphaerocerid, Thoracochaeta zosterae. 2.

Two forms of resource were presented to the flies, minced and chopped seaweed (Fucus serratus), under controlled environmental conditions. The species interacted so as to produce a dominance series, with C. frigida being the strongest species and T. zosterae the weakest. All pairwise interactions were extremely asymmetric, adding support to the growing awareness that this phenomenon is common in interactions between insects. 4. On chopped seaweed only, C. pilipes facilitated C. frigida, more than doubling the latter's emergent population size. This facilitation, in conjunction with the inhibition of C. pilipes by C. frigida, produced a contramensal (+, -) interaction.

The relationship between body size (W), number of species, and population density (D) was investigated in tropical intertidal communities on the Pacific coast of Panama to address two main questions: (i) does an inverse relationship between body size and average population density like that observed in temperate Chilean rocky intertidal habitats occur in other intertidal communities at other latitudes? and (ii) to what extent does the body size density relationship depend on variation in predation in these habitats? 2. Like their temperate counterparts, intertidal communities in Panama exhibit a log-normal body size distribution: most species are of intermediate size, with smaller numbers of both smaller and larger species. Population abundances of Panamanian species are also log-normally distributed. However, in sharp contrast to the pattern observed in temperate communities, body size of Panamanian species is not correlated with average or maximum population density. 3. Densities of the most abundant species, those that fall on the upper boundary of the body size density distribution, also were not significantly correlated with body size. The 'predicted' upper boundary slope (UBS), obtained from combining the log-normal distributions of body sizes and of population abundances, was much more negative than the observed UBS. 4. Experimental exclusion of a morphologically diverse and species-rich (> 22 species) assemblage of subtidal fishes that forage on intertidal organisms led to a weak but significant negative association between body size and density. A steep negative D W relationship was observed for a subset of these species at sites in Costa Rica, where fish predation is low, suggesting that the differences in the body size density patterns represent regional rather than latitudinal trends. 5. The ability of fishes to suppress the population density scaling is probably linked to the low recruitment of tropical benthic invertebrate species and the 'energy-independence' of these fishes from the intertidal zone. This predator guild can have great impact on all intertidal invertebrates and yet they might be little affected by intertidal prey as they also feed and spend most of the time subtidally.",Abundance | Density body size scaling | Fish predation | Intertidal invertebrates | Latitudinal comparisons,NA,NA,NA

We examined the relative importance of food and predators in limiting Arctic ground squirrel (Spermophilus parryii plesius Richardson) populations in the boreal forest of the southwestern Yukon during the peak and early decline of a snowshoe hare cycle (Lepus americanus Erxleben). 2. Squirrels were live-trapped from 1990 to 1992 on two control grids and three experimental treatments (food addition, mammalian and avian predator exclosure, and food addition plus mammalian predator exclosure). Adult squirrels were radiocollared on all areas in 1992. 3. Food addition increased densities 3-8 times, generally increased reproductive traits (increased proportion of females lactating, doubled recruited litter sizes, resulted in earlier emergence of juveniles), increased immigration rates (but only in 1992), resulted in heavier females though not males at emergence in spring, and resulted in more rapid growth rates of juvenile males, but not of juvenile females. It had no effect on active season or overwinter survival rates. 4. Exclusion of predators had virtually no effect on any demographic variable measured, except for population densities in 1991 when they were approximately double those of the control populations. 5. Food addition plus exclusion of mammalian predators resulted in demographic changes that were comparable to those of food addition alone. 6. Thus, it appeared that food, not predators, limited ground squirrel populations at this stage of the hare cycle. However, independent of experimental treatment, active season survival of adult squirrels declined markedly from 1990 (high hare numbers) to 1992 (low hare numbers). Most of the radiocollared squirrels disappearing in 1992 were killed by predators and this was coincident with high densities of predators. In the predator exclosures, all predation mortalities resulted from avian predators which we could not exclude. 7.

A simulation model is used to examine the spatial pattern of resource depletion imposed by vertebrates foraging in a heterogeneous environment; this may have important consequences for the dynamics of resource populations. It is assumed that consumers distribute themselves to maximize intake rates, that mutual interference occurs between competing consumers, and that the coefficient of interference, m, is less than one. 2. Where individuals are equal in their susceptibility to interference, depletion is density-dependent and variation in resource density is reduced towards zero. However, individuals often differ in their susceptibility to interference and incorporating such individual variation modifies the expected pattern of depletion. Spatial variation in resource density is' no longer reduced to zero. After consumption of a given proportion of the total resource, spatial variation in the density of that remaining is greater when there is stronger interference, greater individual variation in susceptibility to interference, or a larger consumer population. With large individual variation and a large consumer population, domed or inversely density-dependent patterns of depletion are predicted, even where the coefficient of interference, m, is less than 1. 3. Field studies that quantify depletion of resource patches within the sampling range of a vertebrate population are reviewed and related to patterns predicted by the simulation model. The correlation between depletion and intial resource density is positive in 22 of 24 cases and significantly density-dependent (P < 0.05) in 11 of these, while only one correlation is significantly inversely density-dependent. The mean correlation in a meta-analysis of vertebrate predators of invertebrate prey (22 cases) is significantly positive, showing that these groups tend to impose spatially density-dependent depletion. In contrast, reviews of invertebrate parasitoids find that inverse and positive density dependence are equally common. This difference may result partly from greater mobility of vertebrates, allowing them to sample the environment and distribute themselves closer to a rate-maximizing optimum. It is also possible that studies of vertebrates measure depletion at scales appropriate to the aggregative response of the consumers more frequently than studies of invertebrates.",Density dependence | Foraging behaviour | Individual variation | Interference competition | Ratio dependence,NA,NA,NA

The decline in feeding rate was similar whether the individuals interacted aggressively or apparently ignored each other during feeding. When patch size was doubled, the effects on feeding rate of adding a single competitor remained similar. The high levels of interference recorded may therefore have been mainly a consequence of active rather than passive interference competition. 4.

Different size classes of the muricid Concholepas concholepas (Bruguiere)(small and medium subadult specimens inhabiting mainly the high- and mid-intertidal, and large adult ones inhabiting mainly the subtidal) were assessed for handling times and diet selection by offering them three different sizes of the high-intertidal mussel Perumytilus purpuratus (Lamarck). 2. The effect of experience on the foraging efficiency of the different size classes of the muricid was tested by comparing the handling times of specimens starved after collection from the field with those of specimens subjected to starvation after having been exclusively fed with this mussel. 3. Experienced predators showed a consistent reduction in handling time with corresponding increase in prey profitability, although this varied in magnitude in the nine distinct predator/prey size combinations. As a consequence, foraging experience changed the profitability ranking of different classes of prey. 4. Prey-size preferences changed with foraging experience in accordance with the associated variations in prey profitabilities. Particularly, the number of attacks per unit time and the average weight of the mussels consumed by the different size classes of C. concholepas increased with experience, while the total time devoted to foraging decreased slightly. 5. The exposure of experienced C, concholepas to effluent from a higher-order predator, the subtidal asteroid Meyenaster gelatinosus (Meyen), induced the muricid to reduce the time devoted to foraging. This reduction in foraging time was achieved differently, according to the size of the forager: small individuals reverted to their initial preference for smaller mussels, while medium and large individuals reduced the number of attacks.

Intraclutch egg-mass variation may be determined by nutritional constraints during the laying period, or may be adaptive. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and may act simultaneously on the same species. For this study, egg mass variation was analysed in the black kite, Milvus migrans (Bodd.), a mid-sized Falconiforme. 2. Egg size showed consistent patterns of variation with laying order and clutch size (2-3 eggs); egg size was larger in three-egg clutches, smaller in last-laid eggs, and relatively smaller in last-laid eggs of three-egg clutches. 3. Inexperienced breeders laid smaller eggs. There were no significant effects of year or laying date on egg size, once the confounding effect of breeder experience was removed. 4. Egg size affected hatchability only in two-egg clutches, and it affected the probability of survival of last-hatched chicks, after the confounding effects of hatching order and breeder experience were removed. There was no significant effect of egg size on growth rates or asymptotic body size. 5. The relative sizes of last-laid eggs and of first-laid eggs were not correlated with hatching asynchrony. 6. Factors reflecting the degree of nutritional constraint during laying (year, laying date, breeder experience) did not affect the degree of intraclutch egg-size asymmetry. The slight intraclutch egg-mass variation in this species (less than 0.5% of female weight) cannot impose serious energy constraints. Pairs nesting in high-quality territories laid clutches with relatively large last-laid eggs, which could be an adaptive variation of egg size to food availability. 7. Although there may be nutritional constraints on egg size at the time of laying, intraclutch egg-size variation in black kites cannot be explained exclusively by this factor. Rather, the variation may reflect distribution of resources among eggs, based on their reproductive value relative to laying order. This is determined by higher mortality of last-hatched chicks and lower hatchability of first-laid eggs in three-egg clutches. Also, it may be a component of the brood reduction strategy of raptors. 8. Relative importance of nutritional constraints or adaptation in determining intraclutch egg-size variation may depend on life history traits of each species, mainly on how the resources for laying are gathered. Adaptive patterns could exist in species storing most of the resources in the prelaying period, while nutritional constraints could hamper the appearance of any adaptive variation in species gathering those resources during the laying period.",Adaptation vs. constraint | Clutch size | Egg size | Hatchability | Hatching asynchrony | Nestling mortality,NA,NA,NA

In order to predict the spatial distribution of 'ideal' and 'free' predators, one needs to know how food intake rate of an individual predator is related to characteristics of the population of the prey as well as the predators themselves. 2. Surprisingly, a systematic theoretical investigation of models for the basic case, where both prey and predators are best characterized by their 'standing stock' density, is lacking. In these models intake rate is supposed to decrease with increasing predator density as a result of interference among predators, instead of immediate consumption of the prey. 3. This paper compares the various ways applied so far of incorporating interference in Holling's functional response model. It is shown that the different models of interference result in qualitatively different predictions for 'ideal' and 'free' predators on: (i) the form of the aggregative response; (ii) the trajectory of the aggregative response as prey is depleted; and (iii) the change in the aggregative response following an influx of predators. This sheds doubt on the general relevance of any one of these models, particularly if the mathematical formulation of interference is phenomenological and merely based on convention, instead of being derived from the underlying mechanism of interactions between predators. 4.

Few studies have examined density dependence or the mechanisms of population regulation in clonal marine organisms. Clonal organisms living on coral reefs have been particularly neglected. I examine the response of the tropical intertidal zoanthid Palythoa caesia to a density manipulation, where I decreased density from natural levels of 80-90% cover to a range of values down to 0% cover. 2. I found major differences in fission and fusion rates with density, with fission decreasing and fusion increasing as density increased. The growth rate of large colonies decreased substantially as density increased, although small colonies were unaffected. Mortality, on the other hand, was independent of density. Recruitment rates peaked at intermediate densities, but were low overall. 3. While density accounted for less than 10% of the variation in the demographic rates measured, it explained 62% of the variation in changes in cover within a given aggregation. Change in cover was greatest (30% in 2 years) for quadrats with 23-33% cover, and became negative for quadrats with over 80% cover. The highest density quadrat (90% cover) experienced an 18% decrease in cover over 2 years. 4. When the data on colony level dynamics for each density were integrated into population dynamics models, I found a steady decrease in population growth rates with density, along with an increase in the proportion of individuals in the largest size class. However, the proportional contribution of each size class to future generations (reproductive value) did not change with density. 5.

Under natural conditions, survival of young showed a decline with hatching date. This decline differed in level, but not in slope, between cohorts. 3. To test whether the seasonal decline in survival was caused by a general regress in environmental conditions (the date hypothesis) or by differences in parental or territory quality between early and late breeders (the parental quality hypothesis), we cross-fostered clutches differing in laying date between pairs, thus establishing 'delayed' and 'advanced' pairs over most of the season. 4. Survival of young fostered by experimental pairs differed significantly from control young of the same hatching date, which defied the date hypothesis. In contrast, survival of experimental young was similar to that of control young, which hatched on the foster parent's original brood hatching date. The results were therefore consistent with the parental quality hypothesis. 5. Survival was essentially independent of size (tarsus length) for early-hatched young. Late-hatched young showed an initial increase in survival with tarsus length. At large sizes, the curve flattened to the bevel of the early-hatched young. 6.

Due to varying selection pressures among host individuals, herbivorous insects may show local adaptation at the individual level. In the winter moth, synchrony of egg hatching and host tree (Quercus robur L.) budburst may have important illness consequences and, therefore, may result in a local adaptation to the hosts phenology. However, relatively high gene flow levels may disrupt such a fine-scale adaption. 2. We determined hatching dates of clutches laid by females collected during copulation, and variation in budburst dates of the trees on which these couples were collected. 3. In our study area, budburst date showed substantial variation within years and areas, as the first and last tree to start leafing were separated by up to 26 days. Relative budburst dates of individual trees were constant between years. Average hatching dates differed significantly among clutches and varied over 30 days, a range comparable to that of budburst. 4. Hatching dates were positively associated with budburst of the respective trees indicating individual synchrony, which may be mediated by two mechanisms. First, early active adults are captured more frequently on early trees and late adults on late trees. As adult activity period is positively correlated with date of egg hatch, early clutches will tend to be laid on earlier trees while late clutches will be laid more frequently on late trees.

The long interval between introduction and assessment of outcome provides a rare opportunity to examine the factors correlated with successful establishment without the uncertainty of long-term population persistence associated with studies of short duration. 2. The probability of successful establishment was strongly influenced by the number of individuals released during the main period of introductions. Eight-three per cent of species that had more than 100 individuals released within a 10-year period became established, compared with 21% of species that had less than 100 birds released. The relationship between the probability of establishment and number of birds released was similar to that found in a previous study of introductions of exotic birds to Australia. 3. It was possible to look for a within-family influence on the success of introduction of the number of birds released in nine bird families. A positive influence was found within seven families and no effect in two families. This preponderance of families with a positive effect was statistically significant. 4. A significant effect of body weight on the probability of successful establishment was found, and negative effects of clutch size and latitude of origin. However, the statistical significance of these effects varied according to whether comparison was or was not restricted to within-family variation. After applying the Bonferroni adjustment to significance levels, to allow for the large number of variables and factors being considered, only the effect of the number of birds released was statistically significant. 5.

I present a conceptual model that predicts the proximate and ultimate factors that determine whether a mammal species has the potential to be regulated by intrinsic (behavioural) or extrinsic factors. The model is based on three behavioural phenomena that purportedly regulate mammal populations: female territoriality, dispersal, and reproductive suppression. 2. The model predicts that intrinsic regulation can occur only in those species in which females are territorial, offspring-rearing space (or alpha status) is limited, and young females exhibit reproductive suppression. Female territoriality should occur in species that have altricial young and serve as a counter-strategy to infanticide from conspecific females. Female mammals that have precocial young or mobile altricial young that are not vulnerable to infanticide should not commit infanticide and should not be territorial. Thus, developmental state at birth would be an ultimate factor that determines whether offspring-rearing space potentially can be limited. 3. Dispersal should be density-independent in nonterritorial species and inversely density-dependent in territorial species and thus has limited potential to regulate population density in any species. 4. Behavioural reproductive suppression of young females is proposed us an adaptive mechanism to avoid inbreeding or to conserve reproductive effort in response to the threat of infanticide. 5. Intrinsic regulation should be most likely to occur in monogamous territorial species in which daughters grow up in the presence of male relatives (such as in canids and some primates). Polygynous species, in which females are territorial such as most rodents, have the potential for self-regulation; however, exposure to unrelated males and the fact that young females can breed on their mothers' territories usually preclude benavidural reproductive suppression. 6. Intrinsic regulation should not occur in species with precocial young, nonterritorial species, or in species in which daughters do not associate with mule relatives, such as the ungulates, marine mammals, bats and marsupials. 7. The model predicts that female territoriality, the threat of infanticide, and the presence of male relatives in the natal home range are the proximate mechanisms for intrinsic population regulation in mammals. These factors apparently occur only under n limited set of conditions; therefore, most mammal populations are probably controlled by extrinsic factors. The model is presented with u series of a priori predictions from which hypotheses can be formulated and tested.",dispersal | emigrate | extrinsic | infanticide | intrinsic | mammals | population regulation | reproductive suppression | territoriality,NA,NA,NA

These outbreaks may persist for several (> 10) years with little tendency to spread. 2. According to reaction-diffusion models, spatial patterns in population density may arise from the interaction between a mobile predator and a less-mobile prey. This occurs because predators 'spill over' around the edges of prey populations, creating zones in which ratios of predators to prey are elevated. 3. To test this 'predator diffusion' hypothesis for tussock moths, we placed their eggs and lavae along a 500-m transect leading away from the edge of a tussock moth outbreak, through suitable but sparsely occupied habitat. We measured attack rates by a wasp egg parasitoid and four species of tachinid fly larval-to-pupal parasitoids on these experimental immature moths. 4. As predicted, rates of parasitism were elevated in the zone surrounding the outbreak. For some parasitoid species, the relationship between parasitism and distance from the outbreak was linear; for others it was parabolic. 5. These results are compatible with several explanations, including the predator diffusion hypothesis.

Species area and local regional species richness patterns in lacustrine fish in North America were investigated by reduced major axis regression, using a database of 651 lakes. 2. Small lakes (area < 1.5 km2) had steeper species area slopes than large lakes. In one area open water species declined in frequency in small lakes, suggesting that within-lake habitat diversity is partly responsible for the species area slope. Local lake characteristics (area, mean depth and altitude) explained only about one-third of the variation in species numbers. 3. Species-area slopes were not significantly different across regions but there were considerable differences between regions in local richness for standardized lake sizes. Local richness was linearly related to regional richness when the regional pool consisted only of native species. 4. Pseudosaturation, the detection of curvilinearity when the true relation is linear, was found when introduced species were included in the regional species pool. Introduced species tend to have more localized distributions than native species, and their inclusion over-estimated regional pool sizes but had little effect on local richness estimates. Additionally, undersampling of small species, coupled with an increase in the relative importance of small species in southern regions, led to pseudosaturation by underestimating local richness in species-rich regions. 5. Turnover diversity was not correlated with regional pool size. However, comparison of three eastern regions showed that the percentage of the region occupied per species was less in the more speciose, southern regions, consistent with increased turnover diversity and pseudosaturation. 6.

Prey preference is determined by active predator choice and by the relative vulnerability of prey taxa. In this study, we addressed the mechanisms of prey preference in the perlodid stonefly Diura bicaudata. 2. Components of the predator prey interaction between the stonefly and its prey were quantified in laboratory observations. These data were compared to prey selection in preference trials and to gut contents of field-collected stoneflies. Experiments were conducted in spring (May) and in autumn (September), using prey taxa commonly available in each season. 3. In the September trials, Diura exhibited positive selection for black fly larvae, whereas Heptagenia, Ephemerella and large Baetis mayflies were avoided. Encounter rates did not affect preference: these were highest for heptageniids and lowest for black flies. Once contacted, black flies were practically always attacked with a high capture probability. Attack propensity and capture success were very low for all other prey types, including Baetis mayflies. 4. In May, female Diura avoided Ephemerella mayflies and Asellus isopods, but showed a positive, albeit non-significant, preference for Nemoura stoneflies. Males did not select any of the prey types. Again, encounter rate was the least important determinant of preference: nemourid stoneflies were encountered less frequently than other prey, especially by female Diura. Females attacked Asellus more frequently than other prey types. Baetis was not a preferred prey for either of the sexes. 5. Our results show that D. bicaudata prefers sedentary or slowly moving prey types. Preference was determined both by active predator choice and differential prey vulnerability. We suggest that although mobile prey such as Baetis are encountered frequently, they are difficult to capture, and are thus relatively safe from stonefly predation when sedentary prey are also available. 6. Microhabitat overlap between predator and prey may determine encounter rates in the field, but this may not translate into prey preferences. Prey with efficient antipredatory behaviours can risk predator encounters, whereas prey with less efficient escape mechanisms may have to select microhabitats avoided by the predator. It is thus essential that laboratory systems incorporate at least some of the structural complexity of natural streams. However, even relatively simple laboratory systems may provide the complexity needed, as long as they contain prey refuges.",Diura bicaudata | predatory stoneflies | prey preference | prey vulnerability | streams,NA,NA,NA

This work investigates how cohort survivorship predictions are affected by the rides used for moving individuals between habitats in a variety of prey and predator environments. 2. We present an individual-based simulation model of the survival of a juvenile, planktivorous fish cohort over the growing season in a spatially explicit environment. The model represents the environment as a 10 x 10 grid of cells (habitats) that can vary in food density and predator number. 3. Juvenile fish begin with identical characteristics, then grow, move between cells. and die based on their individual experiences. Juveniles use one of four moving-between-cell (cell-departure) rules: random, maximize growth, minimize mortality risk, and minimize the ratio of mortality risk to growth. The model includes size-dependent rules for juvenile consumption, encounters between juveniles and predators, and juvenile death. Predators have three different distributions: uncorrelated, correlated with zooplankton, and correlated with juveniles. 4. Three simulation experiments were conducted to address how cohort survivorship is affected by the environment's spatial heterogeneity, the cell-departure rule of juveniles, and tire initial cohort number (Experiment 1); which cell-departure rule individual juveniles should use (Experiment 2): and how survivorship predictions differ between this explicit, spatially heterogeneous model and a similar, spatially homogeneous model (Experiment 3). 5. Experiment 1 showed that predator distribution, juvenile number, zooplankton density and cell-departure rule had important effects on cohort survivorship. Experiment 2 showed that no single cell-departure rule was consistently the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), and that survivorship of cohorts using the ESS cell-departure rule(s) was lower than that of cohorts using the cell-departure rule with tile highest single-year survivorship. Experiment 3 showed that density effects on juvenile survivorship can be much greater in a spatially explicit model, with individuals using fitness-based cell-departure rules than in an analogous, spatially homogeneous model. 6. The results of this work indicate that the cell-departure rule used by individuals can have fill important effect on cohort survivorship. In addition, none of the state- and time-independent cell-departure rules investigated was an ESS, suggesting that such static rules may not be an appropriate mechanism for modelling individual habitat selection in a dynamic environment.",computer simulation | density-dependent survivorship | ESS | habitat selection | individual-based model | spatial covariance,NA,NA,NA

However, eagle hatching dates were significantly related to both winter severity and jackrabbit abundance. Eagles hatched earlier when jackrabbits were abundant, and they hatched later after severe winters. 3. Jackrabbit abundance influenced the proportion of pairs that laid eggs, the proportion of pairs that were successful, mean brood size at fledging, and the number of young fledged per pair. Weather interacted with prey to influence eagle reproductive rates. 4. Both jackrabbit abundance and winter severity were important in predicting the percentage of eagle pairs that laid eggs. Percentage laying was related positively to jackrabbit abundance and inversely related to winter severity. 5. The variables most useful in predicting percentage of laying pairs successful were rabbit abundance and the number of extremely hot days during brood-rearing. The number of hot days and rabbit abundance were also significant in a model predicting eagle brood size at fledging. Both success and brood size were positively related to jackrabbit abundance and inversely related to the frequency of hot days in spring. 6. Eagle reproduction was limited by rabbit abundance during approximately two-thirds of the years studied. Weather influenced how severely eagle reproduction declined in those years. 7.

The British song thrush (Turdus philomelos Brehm) population suffered a marked decline between 1975 and 1993, falling by 65% at an average rate of 5.7% per annum on farmland. We used ring recoveries to investigate whether this could have been brought about by changes in annual survival probabilities of fully grown birds. 2. The annual survival probabilities of first-year song thrushes averaged 0.484 prior to the population decline (1962-75), but dropped to an average of 0.405 in the years 1975-93. A long-term non-linear decrease accounted for 32% of the variance in the logit-transformed estimates of first-year annual survival probability. Adult annual survival probabilities did not show a similar decline; they increased then decreased over the same period, with 28% of this variance being described by a quadratic equation. 3. The changes in first-year annual survival probabilities alone were sufficiently large to account for the observed changes in population size. 4. First year annual survival probabilities were lower in years with cold (r2 = 11%) or dry (r2 = 20%) winters and together with the long-term decrease these effects explained 49% of the variance in the logit-transformed estimates of first-year annual survival probability. Adult annual survival probabilities were lower in years with cold winters (r2 = 34%), and together with the long-term trend, this accounted for 51% of the variance. These relationships with weather conditions explained part of the variation about the long-term trends but did not explain the trends themselves. 5.

Group hunting in social carnivores is generally thought to have evolved through natural selection for improved efficiency of prey capture, increased prey size apprehended or defence of the kill against intra- and interspecific kleptoparasitism. 2. We used a simple model to explore how variation in hunting group size of wild dogs in the Serengeti influences defence of kills against kleptoparasitism from spotted hyenas and the trade-off effects this has on intake rate per dog for a given prey size selected. 3. The analysis presented suggests that while kleptoparasitism substantially influences the amount of time a hunting group can access a kill, increases in access time with increased hunting group size rarely fully compensate for the reduction in each dog's share of the carcass due to scramble competition among the dogs. 4. A profitability index, which includes limitations of the probability of capturing different sized prey, gut capacity, food depletion and access time, suggests that small hunting groups (1 2) would be particularly vulnerable to kleptoparasitism because they are unable to fully satiate themselves before spotted hyenas take over their kills. Intermediate-sized hunting groups may be most effective at meeting nutritional demands over a range of prey sizes. 5. While reasons for the recent extinction of the Serengeti wild dog population remain speculative, this paper contributes to the debate by proposing that kleptoparasitism by spotted hyenas would have placed a major constraint on the ability of individual wild dog packs to recover from episodic disasters.",competition | group size | hyena | kleptoparasitism | predators | wild dog,NA,NA,NA

Although spacing behaviour in small mammals has been studied extensively, the ultimate function of territoriality in females is frequently under debate. Furthermore, almost no data exists on how territorial behaviour of females changes during reproductive cycles and how that affects their reproductive success. We studied these questions in large outdoor enclosures using the bank vole Clethrionomys glareolus as a study species. 2. Home range dynamics of females and behaviour of territory owners against intruder females were determined during four distinct periods of the reproductive cycle: (i) when females were non-pregnant, (ii) in early pregnancy, (iii) in late pregnancy and (iv) when females were lactating. 3. Home range size and home range overlap of females decreased from period (i) to period (iv) simultaneously when nearest neighbour distance increased. So, at the time of parturition female home range size (foraging area) was at its smallest but territory size (breeding area) at its largest. 4. Attacks of owner females increased and amicable behaviour decreased during the reproductive cycle. Attacks tended to correlate positively and amicable behaviour negatively with home range size. 5. The size of a female's home range significantly correlated with her litter size. However, the weight of females did not correlate with their home range size or litter size. 6. During lactation, nearest neighbour distance correlated negatively with the number of weanlings. Further, home range overlap did not have an effect on the number of weanlings. So, in contrast to an earlier study by Mappes et al. we did not find support for infanticide directly affecting reproductive success of females. That might be due to synchronous breeding in our study females in contrast to females in Mappes et al. 7. Our results indicate that space-resource (large home range) and thus probably food may be an important determinant of litter size in the bank voles. Aggressive defence of a territory may have a role in determining the amount of resources available for reproduction and thus the reproductive success. 8. Our study gives new evidence both for and against the two hypotheses for function of female territoriality and suggests that they are not necessarily mutually exclusive.",home range | infanticide | reproductive cycle | space defence | spacing behaviour,NA,NA,NA

Weather conditions are known to influence insect behaviour and population dynamics. We investigated how wind and rain affect reproductive success and parasitization patterns of the aphid parasitoid Aphidius rosae in rose bushes. 2. A model was developed to simulate the life history of females foraging in the field under different environmental conditions. The model was parameterized using field and laboratory data on foraging behaviour of A. rosae. Field data on the daily occurrence of wind and rain were used for the simulation of different weather conditions. 3. When 1 day in the life of a female was modelled, both wind and rain reduced the number of aphid colonies and rose bushes visited. During rain, the parasitoid ceased all foraging activities, resulting in a negative correlation between the number of eggs being laid in visited aphid colonies, and the duration of rain during a day. During wind, the parasitoid continued to forage at a reduced rate, which led to increasing rates of parasitism in encountered aphid colonies during long wind intervals. 4. In a field study, we linked patterns of parasitism in aphid colonies to the weather conditions at the time when the eggs were laid by the parasitoids. The results confirmed the predictions of the model and showed that wind and rain change the distribution of parasitism among host colonies. 5. When the lifetime reproductive success of foraging females was simulated, both wind and rain affected parasitoid reproductive success. Even if weather conditions were benign, the reproductive success of females was greatly reduced compared to the maximum achievable oviposition numbers in the absence of any bad weather periods. Weather conditions had a less pronounced effect on parasitoid life history if travel mortalities between patches were taken into consideration. 6. Both bad weather conditions and travel mortality led to a strong skew in the frequency distribution of female reproductive success.

Distribution and web characteristics were examined for the dune-burrowing spider Seothyra henscheli in the Namib Desert to determine how these spiders relate to spatially heterogeneous habitat features that influence foraging costs and benefits, growth rate and survival. In particular, we set out to determine the relative importance of (i) habitat selection, (ii) site-dependent growth and survival, and (iii) restricted dispersal, to the occurrence of S. henscheli in different macro- and microhabitats. 2. Spider webs were mapped along transects that crossed dune regions with dense vegetation hummocks, steep dune plinths and bare, gravelly interdune plains. Spiders were more abundant in the hummocks than in the interdunes and plinths. Translocation of spiders from the hummocks to the interdunes and plinths confirmed that spider density was correlated with habitat quality. 3. In a comparison of web sites with dummy sites in terms of factors related to sand stability and food availability, it was found that, except for the avoidance of extreme conditions, web-site characteristics did not differ from dummy sites. Web geometry indicated that good sites were characterized by stable sand and abundant ants. However, many spiders occurred at poor sites when good sites were vacant nearby. 4. It is concluded that S. henscheli do not actively choose web sites, but have restricted dispersal. Site-dependent growth and survival may explain the pattern of local abundance. Site tenacity may be a result of the spiders' inability to predict site quality coupled with high costs of relocation. It is inferred that spiderlings tend to remain near their mother's site, which has a previous record of success. 5.

A diverse array of predatory insects has evolved restricted prey associations, and yet life-history determinants of prey specialization have been examined in very few species. In a comparative experimental study, a pair of generalist and specialist sister-species showed significant developmental and reproductive responses to each other's prey. The results reveal evolutionary adaptations, as well as trade-offs, associated with predator prey specialization. 2. Hatchlings of the generalist Chrysopa quadripunctata suffered very high mortality in the presence of woolly alder aphids, the stout-bodied, colonial aphid species that constitutes the prey of its specialist sister-species C. slossonae. In contrast, the characteristically larger and more robust hatchlings of the specialist, and older larvae of both species, survived well on this prey. It appears that the evolution of large hatchlings and an associated set of traits (large adults, reduced fecundity, large eggs, reduced developmental rates) underlies the specialized prey association between C.slossonae and the woolly alder aphid. 3. The woolly alder aphid diet of the specialist caused four of the generalist's life-history traits to tend towards those of the specialist, i.e. size of adults and eggs increased, and rates of oviposition and preimaginal development decreased. Such diet-based phenotypic plasticity in the sister-species' ancestor could have helped facilitate the early evolutionary stages of C.slossnae's association with the woolly alder aphid. 4. In comparison, the generalist's prey did not negatively affect either survival or development of the specialist's immatures, but the resulting adults had significant reductions in body size, survival, oviposition and egg fertility. Thus, we conclude that a drastic diminution in the ability to reproduce on the presumed ancestral-like prey accompanied specialization on the woolly alder aphid. Although the physiological basis for the specialist's reduced ability to use the generalist's prey is unknown, it may contribute to a very stable dietary association with the woolly alder aphid.",adaptations and trade-offs | Chrysopidae | development and reproduction | phenotypic plasticity | predator prey associations | prey specialization,NA,NA,NA

We studied the effect of parasitism on snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) survival through a field experiment that reduced natural burdens of sublethal nematodes in a free-ranging hare population. We treated half the hares on each of six study areas year-round with an anthelminthic drug, and the other half with a placebo. Potential interactive effects of parasitism and nutrition were examined by supplementing the natural food supply on three of the six study areas during two winters. Survival was measured by radio-collaring a total of 612 hares with mortality-sensitive transmitters and monitoring survival daily between April 1991 and June 1993. 2. Overall, nematode burdens in hares were highest between March and October, and Obeliscoides cuniculi was the most abundant of the five species present. The proximate cause of 95% of mortalities (n = 318) during the study was predation. Predators killed hares with heavy burdens of O. cuniculi disporportionately during May June, but burdens of the four other species (Nematodirus triangularis, Trichuris leporis, Dirofilaria scapiceps, Protostrongylus boughtoni) were similar between predator-killed hares and the live population. 3. During May-October 1991, the anthelminthic treatment did not affect hare survival, but during May October 1992 survival of parasite-reduced hares was 2.4-times higher than that of controls. During November 1991 April 1992 survival of food supplemented hares was 21% higher than food-normal animals, but survival was similar during November 1992 April 1993. 4. The effect of parasite-reduction on hare survival was apparently contingent on overwinter food supplies between November 1991 and April 1992, with survival being highest in hares subjected to both treatments, intermediate in those receiving only food supplementation, and lowest in unfed hares.

Snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) populations typically exhibit 8-11 year cycles in abundance over most of their geographic range. Results of a parasite-reduction study suggest that sublethal effects of nematode infections may increase the vulnerability of hares to predation. We explored the potential role of parasite-induced vulnerability to predation in promoting hare population cycles using models of hare, predator and parasite dynamics. Results of long-term studies of hare populations were used to estimate most model parameters. 2. To ensure the generality of our results, we analysed three different models of increasing complexity. The basic model gave a simple description of the dynamics of hares, predators and parasites. The second model added a Type II predator functional response and parasite density-dependent reproduction. The final model added a time delay in hare natality and age structure in the predator population. 3. In all three models, adding parasites to the hare predator system made the population dynamics less stable. This demonstrates that parasite-induced vulnerability to predation acts in a destabilizing fashion and makes population cycles more likely. 4. To compare with a sublethal parasite that only acts through parasite-induced vulnerability to predation, we constructed a model with a hypothetical parasite that only affects hare natality. Although parasite-induced reductions in natality could in some cases destabilize the population dynamics, the effect was always weaker than the effect of parasite-induced vulnerability to predation. This highlights an important feature of parasite-induced vulnerability to predation. When the dynamics of both predator and parasite are coupled to those of the hare, roughly synchronous cycles occur in predator densities and parasite burdens. Because predators and parasites act multiplicatively on the predation rate, the synchronous cycles in predator densities and parasite burdens create a synergistic effect that destabilizes hare-predator parasite population dynamics.",nematode | parasite-host dynamics | parasite-induced effects | population cycles,NA,NA,NA

Variation in offspring sex ratio at the end of parental care may reflect passive sexual differences in offspring survival, or a facultative manipulation by parents to balance trade-offs between sex-specific offspring growth and survival and parental fitness. In contrast, among species with limited size dimorphism, there may be little reason to expect significant sexual differences in offspring survival, and the presence of offspring sex-ratio variation in such species may indicate sex-specific differences in parental investment at some stage. However, sex-ratio variation in monomorphic species with praecocial young may be more difficult to explain, since the decreased parental investment, which is largely shared between offspring of either sex, may reduce the opportunity for sex-ratio manipulation. 2. We examined this question by analysing annual variation in fledging sex ratio of an avian herbivore with strong female natal philopatry and praecocial young, the lesser snow goose Anser caerulescens caerulescens, using data from a 23-year observational study during a period of marked population growth. Although snow geese show limited sexual size dimorphism, with males being 2-6% larger at all ages posthatching, growth and survival of snow goose goslings has been shown previously to be extremely sensitive to variation in food supply. 3. The proportion of males at fledging has decreased from ≃51% in the early years, when food at the colony was abundant, to c. 48% in recent years, when food supply has been reduced. Concurrent with this change, the mass and condition of goslings have declined significantly over the years, with males showing a proportionately greater decline than females. Hatching sex-ratio data showed no systematic significant differences overall, and thus the most likely explanation for the change in sex ratio is increased mortality of male goslings between hatching and fledging. 4. The change in fledging sex ratio occurred only among broods from younger adults (age < 5 years). These age-specific differences were evident both among and within individual females. Younger adults may be less able to accommodate long-term changes in foraging conditions successfully, resulting in proportionately greater gosling mortality overall, and increasingly biased mortality of male goslings, which may be more susceptible to food restriction. 5. Despite potential differences in indirect costs of rearing male or female offspring, it is suggested that these results are more consistent with increased mortality of male goslings under increasing food restriction, rather than active parental manipulation.",body size | brood rearing | growth rates | philopatry | snow goose | survival,NA,NA,NA

A population of moorhens (Gallinula chloropus, Linnaeus) at Peakirk, Cambridgeshire, UK, was studied during three breeding seasons between 1991 and 1993. In the first 2 years, when rodent predators were controlled, the rate of nest predation was relatively low (37% and 36% of nests depredated, respectively), and the rate of brood parasitism was also low (10% and 13% of nests, respectively). However, in 1993, when rodents were not controlled, the rate of nest predation increased to 65%, and correspondingly, the rate of brood parasitism nearly doubled to 21% of nests. 2. The total number of eggs laid and the number of laying females did not differ greatly between the three years, but the proportion of eggs laid parasitically increased from 4% in 1991 and 1992, to 9% in 1993. 3. The increase in the rate of parasitism in 1993 was due primarily to a large number of females engaging in parasitic laying bouts immediately prior to nesting some time after clutch loss, and to a lesser extent, to females laying parasitically immediately after partial clutch loss. 4. Female moorhens tended to show local synchrony in clutch initiation. In 1993, females in neighbouring territories were significantly more likely to begin laying within a few days of one another than females in non-neighbouring territories. 5. Hosts were almost exclusively the immediate neighbours of the brood parasites. The high rate of nest predation observed in 1993 directly influenced the rate of brood parasitism because it increased the level of synchrony in laying between neighbours, giving them more opportunities to lay parasitically. 6. Together with other studies of brood parasitism, these results indicate that both low nest success rates and high nest availability can produce high rates of brood parasitism: the first, out of constraint when conditions are unfavourable, and the second as a bonus when conditions are particularly favourable.",brood parasitism | Gallinula chloropus | moorhen | predation | synchrony,NA,NA,NA

Simple models of optimal foraging, such as ideal free distribution models, are based on the assumption that foragers are omniscient with respect to the quality of all patches in the environment; they know how much food and how many competitors are present in each patch. 2. In contrast, simple population dynamic models treat predator-prey distributions in a phenomenological way, and do not take fitness consequences for individual foragers into account. Yet, the precise way in which these distributions come into being is what really matters to population dynamics. It is therefore necessary to study the behavioural mechanisms underlying the distributions of foragers over patches. 3. We studied the behaviour of a predatory mite, Phytoseiulus persimilis, in response to prey patches occupied by conspecifics. It is well known that high predator densities in prey patches promote dispersal of these predatory mites. Our question was to what extent predators can assess the presence of conspecifics from a distance. 4. Experiments with a Y-tube olfactometer showed that predatory mites avoid patches occupied by conspecifics. 5. This avoidance cannot be attributed to odours of conspecific predators, or of prey damaged by predation, as these odour sources both appear to be attractive. 6. Separating the prey patch from the conspecific predators in the odour source led to the avoidance response only when the predators in the odour source were positioned upwind from the prey patch, and not when they were positioned downwind. This suggests that predators release an odour that elicits the production of yet another odour by the prey. This was supported by the observation that removal of adult prey led to a quick disappearance of the avoidance response. 7. We argue that distant discrimination between patches with and without competing conspecifics may be quite common among predators and parasitoids, and that the use of odours instead of physical inspection of patches allows predators to instantaneously integrate information on the distribution of food and competitors. 8.

About 10% of the females do not lay at all. 3. Free-living great tits were supplied with an additional calcium source, i.e. snail shells and chicken eggshells. This treatment reduced the number of females without eggs, the frequency of clutch desertion, the proportion of nests with defective eggshells and the proportion of non-hatched eggs in clutches that produced young. The calcium supplements did not affect clutch size or laying date. 4. We suggest that possible adaptations to a limited calcium supply are not yet evident because the low calcium availability is a recent phenomenon caused by acid deposition and because a large part of the breeding population consists of immigrants from calcium-rich areas. 5. We provide evidence that calcium limitation in avian reproduction may be widespread on calcium-poor soils. 6. The results imply that the costs of egg formation in calcium-poor areas can be much higher than is currently estimated and that food conditions during egg-laying have a greater impact on avian reproduction than is presently believed.",eggshell | food availability | limiting nutrients | Parus major L. | reproduction,NA,NA,NA

In western North America, populations of the leaf-galling aphid Pemphigus betae are concentrated in natural zones of overlap and hybridization between species of cottonwoods (Populus). Averaged over seven drainages in four American states and one Canadian province, P. betae galls were 28-fold more abundant in hybrid zones than in adjacent pure zones of the narrowleaf host species. 2. The strength of this pattern is impressive in that it occurred in all of the river drainages surveyed and spanned a north south gradient of 1600 km (15 latitude). Furthermore, this pattern was not restricted to one species-pair of cottonwoods, but occurred in zones of narrowleaf x Fremont, narrowleaf x Eastern, and narrowleaf x balsam x Eastern cottonwood. 3. The concentration of galls in the hybrid zone was not influenced by the absolute size of the hybrid zone. However, there was a significant inverse relationship (P = 0.02) between relative gall density and the relative size of the hybrid zone. All else being equal, small hybrid zones supported higher concentrations of aphids than large hybrid zones. Three hypotheses, 'hybrid zones as aphid sinks', 'hybrid zones as aphid sources' and an 'introgression' hypothesis, are proposed which may explain this regional pattern. 4. Riparian cottonwood forests shelter a rich diversity of animal and plant species that is threatened by habitat loss through anthropogenic activities. If the concentration of P. betae in cottonwood hybrid zones is a pattern common to other hybridizing plants and their dependent species, preserving these relatively small areas could have it disproportionately positive role in preserving biodiversity.",bioconservation | hybrid zones | Pemphigus betae | Populus | riparian forests,NA,NA,NA

Relationships between distributions of animals and the resources they use can be expected to depend critically on the mobility of individual animals within populations. However, there is little information on the movements of individuals within populations of animals in most natural aquatic systems, so it is difficult to model accurately the processes that underlie their distributions. 2. Aspects of the processes involved in the colonization of vacant areas by stream-resident Atlantic salmon Salmo salar (69-114 mm length) were measured under near-natural conditions. In five separate trials over summer months, groups of salmon were introduced into enclosed 30-m long sections of stream, each comprising three distinct 10-m long regions of habitat. The subsequent movements of each individual fish within the enclosures were monitored remotely and continuously using a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tracking system. 3. Considerable variation was observed between the activity of different individual salmon. Some of the fish (range between trials, 3-33%) settled into localized home ranges without moving between regions, 10-38% of the fish moved within two regions, and 37-87% of the salmon moved through all three regions of their enclosure. A fraction (0-20%) of some of the populations was particularly mobile and never settled but continued to move throughout all three regions of the enclosure. Within the scale of this current study, it would appear that, for territorial animals such as salmon parr, certain members of the population will settle in new territories after very little exploration of their new environment. 4. The propensity to explore was independent of habitat type, but was directly proportional to the size of the fish. 5. The time from release until 50% of fish in populations settled (excluding the mobile fraction) ranged from 0.3 to 2.4 days. Activity levels were particularly high and initial movements by fish were directed upstream in trial 1, early in the summer, perhaps reflecting upstream migration by salmon parr within the population of the burn at this time.",colonization | distribution | passive integrated transponder tag | salmon parr | spatial redistribution,NA,NA,NA

Little is known about long-term effects of brood size on fitness components oF offspring. This is unfortunate because such information is needed to predict optimal brood size. Furthermore, ontogenetic circumstances are potentially important in explaining the large individual differences in lifetime reproductive success documented in many species. 2. In a laboratory study the long-term effect of brood size manipulation on mortality and morphological development of offspring was investigated. Young zebra finches Taeniopygia guttata were reared in small or large broods. Young were exchanged in such a way that natural siblings from different rearing conditions could be compared. 3. Manipulated brood size affected offspring morphology permanently (measurements were taken up to the age of 12 months). Individuals reared in small broods were heavier, had longer tarsi and wings, higher beaks, were in better condition, and males had redder beaks. The experiment did not affect beak length or female beak redness. Individuals from large broods had caught up on wing length and males from large broods on beak redness by 6 months of age, which may reflect priority of investment in traits important to fitness. 4. Mortality of offspring raised in large broods was higher both before and after independence. After independence the effect of manipulated brood size on mortality was sex specific; females were most likely to die. This suggests that the optimal sex ratio of offspring may depend on brood size. 5. The effect of brood size on mortality after independence was probably partly mediated by size and condition during the nestling phase and possibly by peer aggression among adult offspring. Sex-linked mortality could not be explained by a sex difference in morphological development.

Mycophagous drosophilids in Hokkaido, northern Japan, differ in fungal host selection from each other. Differences in life-history traits among them are explained by 'habitat' characteristics influential to the demography of adults and larvae. 2. Pleurotus fungi, to which three Hirtodrosophila species are specialized, produce fruiting bodies, usually in large clumps, intermittently throughout the fly breeding season on the large, dead logs or stumps of elms. On the other hand, the appearance of fruiting bodies is temporally unpredictable in fungi other than Pleurotus, being restricted, respectively, to particular seasons and influenced greatly by weather conditions. Newly emerging adults of polyphagous species have higher abilities to withstand starvation than those of the stenophagous Hirtodrosophila species, in order to cope with their temporally unpredictable habitats. However, habitat unpredictability for mature adults that have already found a fungal patch and fed and/or bred on it is reversed between the stenophagous and polyphagous species. The three Hirtodrosophila species specialized to Pleurotus fungi show significantly higher ratios of reproductive allocation than the other polyphagous species. There will be no chance for mature adult flies of the Hirtodrosophila species to find another breeding site. They are, therefore, regarded as living in spatially unpredictable habitats and to allocate more energy to current reproduction. On the other hand, mature adults of polyphagous species are expected to find another site more easily owing to their polyphagous nature, and invest some energy for residual reproductive value. 3. Five species preferring decayed fungi allocate nearly equal proportions of energy to reproduction, but partition is differently allocated to either large clutches or to large eggs. This differentiation of strategies is related to the difference in larval habitats. Larval habitats are regarded as more unstable for species utilizing fungi of shorter duration. In short-lasting habitats, larvae growing up within a short period would be favoured by natural selection. Larval developmental time is negatively correlated with relative egg size. Drosophila brachynephros and D. curvispina, which are somewhat specialized to soft, deliquescent Coprinus fungi, take the large-egg strategy to cope with their short-lasting larval habitats. On the other hand, H. histrioides, frequently using Polyporellus fungi with large, long-lasting fruiting bodies, take the opposite strategy, producing many small eggs. The same positive correlation between the developmental time and the duration of fungi preferred is also seen among species breeding on fresh fungi. However, the developmental time is always shorter in species preferring decayed fungi than in species preferring fresh ones if the relative egg size is the same. 4. The positive correlation between larval developmental time and adult survival, which is the basis for Sevenster and van Alphen's hypothesis that the difference in life histories promotes the co-existence of competing species in temporally variable environments, is tested for mycophagous drosophilids. It is demonstrated that there is a negative rather than positive correlation between larval developmental time and adult survival time under starvation. Adult starvation resistance is directly correlated with adult body size, and larval developmental time with relative egg size. This study suggests that the relations between larval developmental time and adult survival can be reversed according to the combinations of adult and larval habitats.",adult survival | clutch size vs. egg size | habitats | larval developmental time | reproductive allocation,NA,NA,NA

Recent reports indicate that microparasites might play an important role in the ecology and evolution of freshwater zooplankton. To quantify the impact of parasitism on Daphnia in natural populations we studied the microparasites of D. magna, D. pulex and D. longispina in three ponds in southern England for a 1-year period. Parasite prevalence and richness, epibiont prevalence and density of host food (planktonic algae) were quantified and their effect on host fecundity analysed. 2. Seventeen parasite species were detected, including eight microsporidia, one haplosporidium, one ameoba, three fungi, three bacteria and one unidentified parasite. The mean proportion of infected adults across the year and the three ponds was 84.7% for D. magna, 53.6% for D. pulex and 38.6% for D. longispina for the 11 most common parasites. Body size was generally positively correlated with parasite prevalence and richness. This relation was found both across and within host species. Multiple infections by different parasite species were common. 3. In all three Daphnia species, parasitism was associated with a reduction in fecundity. The small D. longispina was less affected per parasite compared to the two larger host species, D. magna and D. pulex. Clutch presence was more strongly reduced than clutch size, and the effect increased with parasite richness. The data suggest that parasites castrated their host completely, rather than reducing clutch size. 4. Host specificity varied between parasite species. Two parasite species infected only one or two of the three hosts investigated, and six parasite species showed differences in their specificity between ponds. 5. Four different epibiont groups were distinguished; algae, Protozoa, one fungus and one bacterium, Epibiont prevalence differed between ponds and species. Overall, epibionts were not host specific, but intensity of infection differed strongly between species and the three ponds. Epibiont infection was independent of parasite infection. The presence of epibiontic algae reduced clutch size in D. magna significantly. 6. Our results suggest that parasites can have important effects on Daphnia ecology and evolution. Differential susceptibility of the three host species to parasites suggests that parasites might play a role in determining competition and coexistence in our three study sites.",Cladocera | Daphnia | epibionts | fecundity reduction | microparasites | microsporidia,NA,NA,NA

Despite a wealth of studies for a wide variety of animal assemblages, the form of the interspecific relationship between abundance and body size is still contentious. At least three different patterns have been suggested, which can broadly be characterized as negative and linear, negative but non-linear, and polygonal. At least eight different mechanisms have been suggested whereby the linear (or non-linear) and polygonal patterns can be reconciled. 2. We collated data from the literature on over 500 interspecific plots of the abundance body size relationship with two aims. First, to examine the extent to which published studies support the different forms proposed for the relationship; and secondly, to test whether any of the mechanisms that have been suggested to reconcile linear and polygonal patterns actually do so. 3. The data revealed that abundance-body size relationships commonly assume both linear negative and polygonal forms. Around 25% of all plots of the relationship show a positive regression slope. 4. Of the eight mechanisms that have been suggested to reconcile linear and polygonal patterns, we were able to test five. Of these, only the measure of density used by a study explains none of the observed variation in abundance body size relationships. Variation in the regression slope between studies is only explained by the type of data used (compilations vs. samples) and the scale of study (local vs. regional): compilation studies at regional scales show more linear negative relationships, while sample studies performed at local scales show more polygonal patterns. General linear modelling indicates that study scale is the most important factor influencing when different relationships are likely to arise. 5. Our results show that different patterns tend to arise at different scales of study, but say nothing about whether the patterns are real or artefactual. Polygonal relationships potentially contain an artefactual component, resulting from sampling methodology inadequate to elucidate the abundances of the less common species in any given assemblage. However, the presence of a sampling artefact does not indicate the shape of the underlying relationship from which a sample is taken, or indeed whether samples would exhibit any other shape were artefacts excluded. 6. Linear and polygonal patterns are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but may both indicate the 'true' abundance body size relationship at different spatial scales. We conclude by suggesting that much more attention be paid to the effect of spatial scale on this relationship, especially given that scale of measurement can have subtle but severe consequences.",abundance | allometry | animals | body size | macroecology,NA,NA,NA
