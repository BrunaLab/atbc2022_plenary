The first suite consisted of strong positive correlations among twig thickness, leaf size, inflorescence length, and branch spacing (Corner's rules). Seed size and mature height were also weakly correlated with these traits. The second suite reflected aspects of sapling crown allometry, including crown size, stem diameter, and total leaf area, which appear to be related to shade tolerance. There was a weak negative correlation between sapling crown size and mature height, but no correlation with leaf or seed size. Most correlations were similar in magnitude for ahistorical and independent contrasts analyses, and discrepancies between these two measures were greater in traits with lower levels of convergent evolution.

Linked to these two approaches are two different timescales: population dynamics and behavior or physiology. Thus, the question of the relationship between classical and individual-based approaches is related to the question of the mutual relationship between processes on the population and the behavioral timescales. We present a simple protocol that allows the two different approaches to be reconciled by making explicit use of the fact that processes operating on two different timescales can be treated separately. Using an individual-based model of nomadic birds as an example, we extract the population growth rate by deactivating all demographic processes - in other words, the individuals behave but do not age, die, or reproduce. The growth rate closely matches the logistic growth rate for a wide range of parameters. The implications of this result and the conditions for applying the protocol to other individual-based models are discussed. Since in physics the technique of separating timescales is linked to some concepts of self-organization, we believe that the protocol will also help to develop concepts of self-organization in ecology.",NA,NA

I explored several versions of simple single- and multitrophic models to determine whether predictions of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH), derived from considering only a single trophic level, apply to multitrophic situations. The IDH was predicted by models of competing species at a single trophic level but did not hold in many situations with more natural trophic structure. In general, basal species in a food web tended to follow the IDH, whereas competitors at top trophic levels did not. Additional analyses indicated that outside immigration interacted with trophic structure to produce widely differing predictions about the consequences of disturbance and that density-dependent disturbance events could recapture the IDH in some multiple trophic level situations. Model predictions matched the results of empirical studies to date: the IDH has generally been supported for species competing for nondynamic basal resources but not for mobile aquatic invertebrates at higher trophic levels. The model analysis also verified basic predictions of verbal models addressing the effects of physical stress. Three different aspects of disturbance and their contributions to species coexistence were identified: changes in average mortality rates, changes in temporal variability, and changes in spatial heterogeneity.

In general, intraspecific aggregation of consumer individuals over the landscape of patches stabilizes competition. Oviposition behavior of individual females can generate aggregation of larvae across patches and, therefore, strongly influences the outcome of competition between co-occurring species. We used simulation models to evaluate the consequences (for the coexistence of competitors) of different movement behaviors by females before and between oviposition events. Coexistence times increase when females are more likely to travel among neighboring patches than among distant ones. Coexistence times are also longer when females begin egg laying near the site of their emergence. Preoviposition dispersal is, therefore, destabilizing. We also considered responses by females to edges of resource arrays.

Particle capture rate is predicted to increase with increasing speed of the feeding current. There should be a large feeding advantage when lophophores are tightly packed and excurrents are vented through chimneys. This prediction contradicts conclusions of an earlier model study and suggests that selection for colony integration has a basis in the acquisition of food. If lophophores are not tightly packed, particle-capture patterns depend on two key ratios: the advection ratio (feeding current velocity to shear velocity) and the separation ratio (lophophore spacing to lophophore diameter). At high separation ratios, particle capture rates should be fairly uniform among zooids. At high advection ratios, lophophores located near the upstream colony edge should experience higher rates of particle capture. Rates of particle capture in turbulent flows should greatly exceed those in laminar flows (of identical speed) when excurrent waters are locally remixed into the flow above lophophores. However, when lophophores are tightly packed and excurrents are vented through chimneys, feeding rates should be identical in turbulent and laminar flows.

We demonstrate that after a founder event a new adaptive combination of genes may rise to high frequencies in the presence of an old combination of genes. We compare the probabilities of speciation after a founder event with those in a stable population and with those when reproductive isolation is due to viability selection against hybrids. We argue that premating reproductive isolation is more efficient than postmating reproductive isolation in maintaining the integrity of sympatric species.

Because self-pollination is a heterogeneous process, pollen discounting and its evolutionary consequences vary with pollination conditions. In this article we model self-pollination as comprising discounting and nondiscounting components, and we consider the consequences of this heterogeneity for outcross siring success. Aided by this depiction of pollination, we then compare previous theoretical representations of pollen discounting and consider their relative virtues.

This study extended previous models of lactation in pinnipeds by explicitly taking into account all the energetic costs to mothers. Based on an analysis of time-energy budgets, the feasible lactation strategy for a species can be shown to depend on body mass. Due to increased metabolic costs of maintenance, species with a large body mass cannot normally sustain lactation by foraging during lactation unless they have access to rich local prey resources. Consequently, large pinnipeds must normally sustain lactation from body reserves. This disadvantage is compensated in large pinnipeds by freedom to forage in support of offspring at greater range whereas small pinnipeds are restricted to foraging within the locality of the pupping colony. In the absence of correlations between major life-history variables and body mass in pinnipeds, the principal patterns of lactation are likely to be different solutions to the trade-off between foraging on a relatively rich prey resource at long range and foraging on a poorer prey resource within a restricted range.

We develop and analyze a quantitative coevolutionary model for a predator-prey interaction. If the model is modified appropriately, the results could broadly apply to multispecies communities and to herbivore-plant, parasite-host, and parasitoid-host associations. Model populations are distributed over a gradient in prey birth rate (as a measure of productivity). Each population, in each patch, is made up of a suite of strains. Each strain of the predator has a certain ability to successfully attack each strain of the prey. We consider scenarios of isolated patches, global migration, and stepping-stone (i.e., local) migration over a linear string of patches. The most pervasive patterns are the following: Investments in predator offense and prey defense are both maximal in the patches of highest prey productivity; when there are no constraints on maximal investment, mean predation evolves to highest levels in the most productive patches; similarly, the predator has a greater impact (measured as the percentage reduction in prey density) on the prey population in high productivity patches as compared with low productivity ones in spite (even after evolution) of prey abundance being highest in the most productive patches; and migration has the net effect of shunting relatively offensive and defensive strains from productive patches to nonproductive ones, potentially resulting in the elimination of otherwise rare, low-investment clones. A modification of the model to gene-for-gene type interactions predicts that generalist strains (in terms of the range of strains the predator can exploit or the prey can fend off) dominate in productive areas of the prey, whereas specialists prevail in marginal habitats. Assuming a wide range of productivities over the prey's geographical distribution, the greatest strain diversity should be found in habitats of intermediate productivity.

It is based on the premise thai the ability of the parasite to overcome the resistance of different host species is to a large degree genetically independent that is, controlled by different loci. The intuitive rationale is that the genetic lineage of a parasite that evolves host preference becomes more consistently exposed to selection for performance on its preferred host. Such a choosy lineage can thus coevolve faster in response to evolving host defenses than a generalist lineage distributed among several host species. Given genetic variation in host preference, an initially generalist parasite population evolves toward specialized host races, each choosing one host species. This idea is supported by a series of multilocus models of coevolution between a parasite and two host species, in which the parasite virulence on each host is affected by a different set of loci and an additional locus or two loci control host choice.",NA,NA

To overcome this limitation, we measured behavioral and physiological responses of European starlings Sturnus vulgaris to changes in food availability in a laboratory environment. The birds lived in a dosed economy with a choice of two foraging modes (flying and walking) and were observed under two treatments (hard and easy) that differed in the work required to obtain food. Comparing the hard with the easy treatment, we found the following differences. In the hard treatment, daily amount of work was higher, but daily intake was lower. Even though work was greater, total daily expenditure was smaller, partly because overnight metabolism was lower. Body mass was lower, but daily oscillation in body mass did not differ. Feces' caloric density was lower, indicating greater food utilization. Energy expenditure rate expressed as multiples of basal metabolic rate (BMR) increased during the working period from 3.5 x BMR (easy) to 5.2 x BMR (hard), but over the 24-h period, it was close to 2.4 x BMR in both treatments. We also found that rate of expenditure during flight was very high in both treatments (52.3 W in easy and 45.5 W in hard), as expected for short (as opposed to cruising) flights. The relative preferences between walking and flying were incompatible with maximizing the ratio of energy gains per unit of expenditure (efficiency) but compatible with maximizing net gain per unit of time during the foraging cycle (net rate). Neither currency explained the results when nonforaging time was included. Time was not a direct constraint: The birds rested more than 90% of the time in both treatments.

This results in a strong pattern of negative correlation in the temporal distribution of colonizer and successor species. As disturbance rates were increased, the relationship shifted from being negatively correlated in time to being positively correlated-the dynamics became decoupled from the ecologically driven cyclic succession and were increasingly influenced by abiotic factors (e.g., rainfall events). Further analysis of the spatial relationships among colonizer and successor species showed that, without disturbance, periods of attraction and repulsion between colonizer and successor species alternate cyclically at intermediate spatial scales. This was due to the spatial 'memory' embedded in the system through the process of cyclic succession.

The ESS is solved separately for two assumptions: whether individuals wait to occupy a single territory or multiple territories and whether queuing rules are strict or if all waiting individuals are equally likely to obtain the next territory. The four combinations of these assumptions all give the same evolutionarily stable population size of both floaters and breeders. At the ESS, only territories with expected lifetime reproductive success (LRS) exceeding 1 should be occupied, which introduces a limit to ideal habitat selection. The behavioral decision to float alters the shape of the density-dependent response, reduces the equilibrium population size, and affects the response of the population to habitat loss.

I use field estimates of seed dispersal with an integrodifference equation and simulation models of population growth to show that dispersal data are compatible with rapid spread. Dispersal estimates lay to rest the possibility that rapid spread occurred by diffusion. The integrodifference model predicts that, if the seed shadow has a long 'fat' tail, then rapid spread is possible, despite short average dispersal distances. It further predicts that velocity is more sensitive to life history than is classical diffusion. Application of such models is frustrated because the tail of the seed shadow cannot be fitted to data. However, the data can be used to test a 'long-distance' hypothesis against alternative ('local') models of dispersal using Akaike's Information Criterion and likelihood ratio tests. Tests show that data are consistent with >10% of seed dispersed as a long (102 m) fat-tailed kernel. Models based on such kernels predict spread as rapid as that inferred from the pollen record. If fat-tailed dispersal explains these rapid rates, then it is surprising not to see large differences in velocities among taxa with contrasting life histories.

However, strategic models dealing with honesty have largely ignored the implications of noise and perceptual error for signal evolution (just as models dealing with signal detection in the presence of noise ignore strategic issues). Here, 1 analyze an extended version of Maynard Smith's strategic model of signaling of need between relatives, the Philip Sidney game, that incorporates the possibility of perceptual error. I show that even in the presence of noise, there exists over a wide range of parameter values a unique, continuously stable signaling equilibrium, at which the signaler employs a costly display when needy but refrains from doing so when healthy. For a subset of this range, there also exists a second, lower cost signaling equilibrium that is not continuously stable. At the former equilibrium, predicted signal cost is inversely related to the coefficient of relatedness (r) between signaler and receiver. Cost is not, however, predicted to drop to zero even when r = I and there is no conflict of interest between the two (as is the case in error-free models), because it serves to enhance the efficacy of communication as well as to discourage deceit. Equilibrium signal cost is inversely related to the probability that the signaler is needy, and tends to increase with the level of noise. If noise becomes too great (i.e., if a detectable signal is too costly to produce), signaling is no longer stable; surprisingly, it is also unstable if the level of noise is too low (i.e., if a detectable signal is too cheap to produce).",NA,NA

Control and hormone-treated (flightless) G. assimilis did not differ in the amount of food consumed or assimilated on any of three diets that differed in nutrient quantity. Thus, enhanced ovarian growth of flightless individuals resulted from increased allocation of internal nutrients to reproduction (i.e., a trade-off) rather than from increased acquisition of nutrients. Compared with flight-capable controls, flightless G. assimilis also had reduced whole-organism respiration, reduced respiration of flight muscles, and reduced lipid and triglyceride (flight fuel) reserves. These differences are remarkably similar to those between naturally occurring flightless and flight-capable morphs of other Gryllus species. Results collectively suggest that the increased allocation of nutrients to ovarian growth in flightless G. assimilis and other Gryllus species results from reduced energetic costs of flight muscle maintenance and/or the biosynthesis or acquisition of lipids. Reduction in these energetic costs appears to be an important driving force in the evolution of flightlessness in insects. Respiratory metabolism associated with flight capability utilizes an increasing proportion of the energy budget of crickets as the quantity of nutrients in the diet is decreased.

High competition with low similarity may occur whether competition is measured by a competition coefficient near equilibrium or is measured by the proportional increase in a species' population density when its competitor is removed. However, these two measures may differ considerably and may change in opposite directions with a given change in similarity. The general conditions required for such counterintuitive relationships between similarity and competition are that the consumer species have relatively low resource requirements for successful reproduction and that the resources be self-reproducing.

This prediction emerges from theory irrespective of the particular genetic mechanisms responsible for variation in aging. Yet this critical relationship has not been confirmed in comparative studies of natural populations. In the present analysis, rate of aging is estimated by the rate of increase in mortality rate (m(x)) with age (x). Comparisons between natural and captive populations of birds suggest that the Weibull model (m(x) = m0 + αx(β)) provides a better description of aging than the Gompertz model (m(x) = m0e(yx)). Rate of aging is quantified by the parameter to (dimension: 1/time), which is calculated from the Weibull parameters α and β (ω = α(1/(β+1))). In this analysis, rate of aging in birds and mammals is directly related to extrinsic mortality (estimated by the initial mortality rate, m(0)) independently of taxonomic group and of variation in body size and, by implication, metabolic rate. When time is expressed in years, rate of senescence is related to initial mortality rate by ω = 0.294m0(0.367). This result implies that natural selection in response to variation among taxa in m0 has resulted in the evolutionary modification of factors that influence the rate of aging in natural populations. The potential strength of selection on factors that could further reduce rate of aging is indicated by the proportion of deaths due to aging-related causes. Although species with low initial mortality rates also exhibit reduced rates of increase in mortality rate with age (i.e., delayed senescence), the relatively high proportion of aging-related deaths in such species suggests that further evolutionary responses leading to long life are severely constrained. This argues against mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy as genetic mechanisms underlying senescence and suggests, instead, that rate of aging represents a balance between wear and tear, on the one hand, and genetically controlled mechanisms of prevention and repair, on the other. Evidently, remedies for extreme physiological deterioration in old age either are not within the range of genetic variation or are too costly to be favored by selection.",NA,NA

The model for gain of the individuals is based on the waiting times between subsequent prey encounters by the group. These waiting times depend on the number of foragers in the group. A single parameter of this dependency encompasses a variety of foraging scenarios, from cooperation to scramble. With constant patch size, correlations between gains of any pair of foragers are negative. This dependency is most intense in small groups. Increased variation in patch size makes correlations in gains between group members positive irrespective of the group size. For a solitary forager, variance in gain approaches zero with increasing time in the patch. For an individual member in a group, variance grows monotonically. Thus, depending on the patch departure rule controlling the time to be spent in the patch, solitary foragers may have a smaller variance in gain than members in a group. As solitary foragers also potentially harvest all prey in the patch, it is hard to believe that grouping behavior would evolve solely on the basis of foraging.",NA,NA

Some resources are intrinsically easy to use and are widely preferred, while others require specialized phenotypic traits on the part of the consumer. This asymmetry allows optimally foraging consumers to evolve phenotypic specializations on nonpreferred resources without greatly compromising their ability to use preferred resources. The evolution of phenotypic specialization on nonpreferred resources can be driven by competition, but the specialists act as ecological generalists whenever their preferred resources are available. Our model identifies at least three different concepts of specialization that need to be distinguished, based on diet, prey utilization efficiencies, and phenotypic adaptations. The relationships among these concepts are complex and often counterintuitive. Specialists should often reject the very resources that they have evolved traits to use. The most extreme phenotypic specializations should occur in the absence of a trade-off between using preferred and nonpreferred resources.

Three principal means by which the parasites can be regulated are considered: reduction in host density as a result of parasite-induced host mortality, reduction in host density as a result of parasite-induced host sterility, and competition among parasites within multiply-infected hosts. The means by which parasites are regulated has a major effect on the degree to which they can depress host population densities. In particular, a parasite that sterilizes its host is expected to reduce host density more than one that causes an equivalent decline in host fitness through increased mortality. A special case of the model is developed for herbivorous insects that, in the absence of parasites, are limited by larval food resources. Parasites that are regulated via parasite-induced host sterility will control the insect populations below the level set by larval resources if the threshold host density for the parasites (N(T)) is less than the ratio of carrying capacity to net reproductive rate of the insects (K/R). Data are presented showing that all three means of parasite regulation, but especially parasite-induced host sterility, can operate in Howardula aoronymphium, a nematode parasite of mycophagous Drosophila flies. Data from a field cage experiment show that, if these nematodes are regulated primarily via reductions in host density due to this sterility, the parameters N(T), K, and R are such that Howardula is likely to play an important role in controlling Drosophila populations. However, this conclusion must be tempered by the fact that these nematodes also cause increased host mortality and experience within-host competition, making the conditions for parasite control of the flies more stringent.",NA,NA

The presumed basis of this cost is the diversion of limiting resources away from present and future growth and reproduction. Recent failures to detect allocation costs of resistance to herbivores have raised questions about whether costs exist and, thus, about the appropriateness of theories that postulate such costs.

If parental ability is the same between individuals of each sex, the evolutionarily stable mating pattern is always monogamy. If fe males differ in fecundity and males differ in paternal care capacity, monogamy with assortative mating is likely to be evolutionarily stable. If the male cost function increases at a strongly accelerating rate, however, polyandry is evolutionarily stable when the difference of female fecundity is very large, but the game may have no evolutionarily stable state when the difference of female fecundity is small. The care graph (in which females are connected to males giving paternal care to their chicks) is often much simpler than the mating graph (in which females are connected to males they accepted).

It is usually assumed that changes in pathogen virulence are the result of selection to increase pathogen fitness. However, in some cases, pathogens have acquired hypovirulence by themselves be coming infected with hyperparasites. For example, the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica has become hypovirulent in some areas by acquiring a double-stranded RNA hyperparasite that debilitates the pathogen, thereby reducing its virulence to the host. In this article, we develop and analyze a mathematical model of the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions with three trophic levels. The system may be dominated by either uninfected (virulent) or hyperparasifized (hypovirulent) pathogens, or by a mixture of the two. Hypovirulence may allow some recovery of the host population, but it can also harm the host population if the hyperparasite moves the transmission rate of the pathogen closer to its evolutionarily stable strategy. In the latter case, the hyperparasite is effectively a mutualist of the pathogen. Selection among hyperparasites will often minimize the deleterious effects, or maximize the beneficial effects, of the hyperparasite on the pathogen. Increasing the frequency of multiple infections of the same host individual promotes the acquisition of hypovirulence by increasing the opportunity for horizontal transmission of the hyperparasite. This effect opposes the usual theoretical expectation that multiple infections promote the evolution of more virulent pathogens via selection for rapid growth within hosts.",NA,NA

We investigate the evolution of transmission mode as a function of host social and mating structure using a model in which disease transmission is explicitly dependent on the numbers of sexual and nonsexual contacts (which are themselves a function of population density) and per-contact infection probabilities. Most generally, and in the absence of trade-offs between the degree of sexual transmission and effects on host fecundity and mortality, nonsexual transmission is favored above the social-sexual crossover point (the host density at which the number of nonsexual contacts exceeds the number of sexual contacts), while sexual transmission is favored below this point. When changes in allocation to the two transmission modes are accompanied by changes in mortality or fecundity, both mixed and pure transmission strategies can be favored. If invading genotypes differ substantially from resident genotypes, genetic polymorphism in transmission mode is possible. The evolutionary outcomes are predictable from a knowledge of the equilibrium population sizes in relation to the social-sexual crossover point. Our results also show that predictions about dynamic outcomes, based on rates of invasion for single pathogens into healthy populations, do not adequately describe the resulting disease prevalence nor predict the subsequent evolutionary dynamics; once invasion of a pathogen has occurred, the conditions for spread of a second pathogen are themselves altered.

In contrast, studies in central California have emphasized the importance of larval supply. In this article, we identify a gradient in percentage cover in the middle and upper intertidal zone that is consistent with an oceanographically based explanation for these differences: percentage cover of mussels and barnacles is much higher in Oregon, where nearshore circulation promotes high recruitment, than in California, where strong offshore currents inhibit recruitment.

We hypothesized that spacing of embryos by gel enhances delivery of oxygen but that gel is organically costly. A model of diffusion predicts that clutch thickness should scale inversely with the square root of embryo concentration, indicating a need to reduce embryo concentration (and increase gel volume) disproportionately with increasing clutch thickness.

Here I use various combinations of long-range dispersal for both the offspring and adult stages of both prey and predator species, providing a broad range of spatial and temporal dynamics, to compare and contrast the two model frameworks. Taking the individual-based modeling results as given, two examinations of the reaction-dispersal model are made: linear stability analysis of the deterministic equations and direct numerical solution of the model equations. I also modify the numerical solution in two ways to account for the stochastic nature of individual-based processes, which include independent, local perturbations in population density and a minimum population density within integration cells, below which the population is set to zero. These modifications introduce new parameters into the population-level model, which I adjust to reproduce the individual-based model results. The individual-based model is then modified to minimize the effects of stochasticity, producing a match of the predictions from the numerical integration of the population-level model without stochasticity.",NA,NA

Helpers of the opposite sex, especially when male, were significantly more likely to remain in their natal group and in about half the cases inherited and bred following reproductive vacancies.

Although a variety of hypotheses have been proposed to explain this behavior, most assume either that brood amalgamation is accidental (i.e., nonselected) or that adoption of young is selected for because of social benefits to the young and/or adopting parents. We propose, instead, that brood amalgamation is a function of two separate processes: brood desertion and brood adoption. To examine brood desertion, we develop a graphic model to predict when parents should abandon their young and we test this model experimentally for the Barrow's goldeneye (Bucephala islandica). As predicted, females deserted their offspring when the size of the brood was experimentally reduced. Brood adoption occurred when deserted ducklings joined other broods. However, the success of ducklings in doing so was strongly dependent on the availability of potential host broods and on the age of the recipient broods. Foreign ducklings were readily accepted into young broods (<10 d old) but invariably were rejected from old broods. We could detect no benefits or costs of brood adoption to the host females, contrary to the expectations of a social benefit hypothesis. Our experiments indicate that crèching behavior is driven by selection on adults to abandon their brood when the benefits of continued investment are outweighed by the reduction in future reproduction and selection on deserted ducklings to join other broods to obtain parental care. Rather than a form of cooperative brood care, crèching in goldeneyes is perhaps best considered as a form of reproductive parasitism, entailing parent-offspring conflict over brood desertion and intergenerational conflict over adoption of abandoned young. © 1998 by The University of Chicago.

Therefore, the positive frequency-dependent selection is relaxed, and reversal alleles persist longer in populations of tall-shelled species.

Herbivores with fixed diet preferences have the same effect regardless of seasonality, but there is a marked difference when the diet selectivity of herbivores conforms to a simple optimal-foraging model. An optimally foraging herbivore in a seasonal environment is able to promote plant coexistence among many species. The mechanism involves diet switching, occurring over narrow density intervals. For this to have an effect in a nonseasonal model, equilibrium resource densities must be in this interval, which requires close parameter fitting. In seasonal environments, resource densities change through the year and may frequently move across narrow regions in which diet changes occur.

Pollinators can learn to avoid deceptive plants and to favor nectariferous species. The reproductive success of these species is expected to be density dependent for two opposite reasons: the commoner cheating flowers are, the easier they are to avoid and the lower the quality of the patch, making it more difficult to recognize that unrewarding flowers are not profitable. When a deceptive species is made up of multiple floral variants, pollinators' learning could decrease the reproductive success of any particularly common floral variant. Within a population of deceptive plants, mean reproductive success could, therefore, vary with the number of floral variants. We investigate these three hypotheses by modeling the behavior of pollinators foraging in communities of deceptive and rewarding flowers. Simulations revealed that the reproductive success of deceptive flowers varies in a density-dependent manner and that floral variants can be submitted to negative frequency-dependent selection. We compare density dependence in nonmodel deceptive species to what is expected in Batesian mimics and discuss possible selection of morphological variants. Finally, we survey how pollinators' learning capacities can make mean reproductive success depend on morphological variability within a population.",NA,NA
