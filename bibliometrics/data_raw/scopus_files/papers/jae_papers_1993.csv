In 1991, penguins on average dived deeper (12.3±4.2m) and for longer durations (1.9±0.2 min) than they did in 1990 (7.1±1.6m depth and 1.5±0.2 min), but time under water, number of dive bouts per day and dive bout duration did not differ significantly between years. Foraging trip duration in mid to late January was longer in 1991 (861±419 min) than in 1990 (502±199 min) because travelling/searching time within trips in 1991 was about four times as long as it had been in 1990. Total dive bout duration within foraging trips did not differ between years. Thus, probability of locating a prey patch was lower in 1991, but once a prey patch was found total diving effort was similar to that in 1990. When food was less abundant Adelie penguin parents increased the duration of their foraging trips, thereby decreasing meal delivery rate, but did not increase total diving effort to compensate for poor food availability. Their foraging sites might have been highly restricted to small ice holes or tide cracks; therefore, prey abundance within sites might decrease rapidly by depletion and the penguins might not be able to get more food even if they forage for a longer period. Alternatively, they have a priority to maintain their body condition for their own future survival at the expense of offspring production. -from Authors",75,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,3

Females generally survived better than males, the survival rates of prime-age adults were the highest, and survival decreased after seven years of age. Only the severe winters affected markedly the survivorship of roe deer. In Chize only, juveniles survived markedly less well than prime-age adults. Since physical maturity was reached later in Chize, the length of the critical stage for survival may be sensitive to population dynamics. Survival of juvenile roe deer thus appears to be very sensitive to external influences. Despite their marked differences between the two populations, survival rates of prime-age adults were similar. Thus, survival of prime-age adult roe deer appears to be relatively insensitive to external influences. The differences in survival between sexes for prime-age adults was close to values observed in dimorphic and polygynous ungulates, but roe deer only exhibit a marginal sexual dimorphism in size, a small breeding group size and no sex differences in fawn mortality. Costs of sexual selection cannot account for this gender effect in roe deer, and changes in social interactions between females in these high-density populations could be involved.

During both winter-spring intervals survivorship was also 25% lower at the lowest density for both species. The type of mortality was one that resulted in disappearance of the empty shell.

A demersal fish is an alternative predator candidate. Recruitment of K. scalarina was greater around higher densities of adult bivalves in one of two tests.

This equality has been taken as evidence that a species' abundance is limited by its energetic requirements.

The authors test the hypothesis that concatenating the underlying frequency distributions of species' body size and species' abundance can directly account for observed patterns in plots of size versus abundance in assemblages of animals, comparing the negative slope of the upper boundary of plots of size against abundance from real assemblages, with the same slopes derived from models with no energy constraints. Models give estimates for the upper bound slopes that are very similar to slopes calculated from real assemblages.

The system may be stable even if hosts have high average rates of increase, provided that those hosts with the higher rates of increase are differentially afflicted by parasitism. The generality of this conclusion is assessed by numerical studies of a two-patch model in which the host and/or parasitoid show partial rather than complete mixing between patches in each generation. Such partially coupled refuges are most likely to be stabilizing if they are ""sinks', with relatively low host growth rates. A unique feature emerging from these partially coupled models, is that heterogeneity in the number of adult female parasitoids produced per parasitized host can be sufficient by itself to stabilize the system.

However, the most abundant species near the upper bound slopes of assemblages may be energy limited, because in only one assemblage does the upper bound slope differ from energetic model predictions.

Specialists were highly adapted, as indicated by their higher reproductive rate and similar or higher survival rate, compared with non-specialists.

An exception occurred when oceanic food supply was reduced, and the ratio of specialists to guillemots and cormorants increased, as did predation on guillemot eggs and chicks.

The effect of each factor was ultimately related to food supply. In years of favourable food supply, gull predation rate on guillemot eggs and chicks was moderate, and appeared to be selective on young and/or less-fit birds. In a food-poor, El Nino year, however, predation by gulls was non-selective and of very high rate. -from Author",63,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,40

A model is presented incorporating resource exploitation competition, cannibalism and mutual predation. The behaviour of the model agrees with intuitive predictions. Cannibalism in the absence of predation promotes coexistence, whereas mutual but differential predation in the absence of cannibalism may lead to elimination, depending on relative resource competitive ability. When cannibalism and predation occur together, predation of equal magnitude or greater than cannibalism leads to rapid elimination. Predation in favour of species 1 may overcome a competitive advantage for species 2, leading to elimination of species 2.

The geometric mean sizes of prey and predators increase as the habitat of webs changes from aquatic to terrestrial to coastal to marine. Within each type of habitat, mean prey sizes are always less than mean predator sizes, and prey and predator sizes are always positively correlated. Feeding relations order the metabolic types of organisms from invertebrate to vertebrate ectotherm to vertebrate endotherm. Organisms commonly eat other organisms with the same or lower metabolic type, but (with very rare exceptions) organisms do not eat other organisms with a higher metabolic type.

Similarly, the significant pairwise correlations in helminth abundance were rare (three of 10 pairs) and inconsistent. The rarity of significant overall associations among helminth species in the presence-absence data (two positive associations in seven data sets) and total absence in the density data support the idea of independence co-occurrence. Most helminth populations were independently aggregated in the host population, which is likely to promote their coexistence. Results suggest that evolution of competitive ability is favoured, especially in rare species whose populations are largely restricted to hosts with concomitant infections by the common species.

Presence of mites increased the cost of reproduction as evidenced from statistically significant interactions between clutch size treatment and mite treatment for the time of egg laying, clutch size and brood size at hatching and fledging, and the body mass of offspring. The increased costs of reproduction due to the parasite treatment of first clutches remained when the effects of the number of mites in second clutch nests were controlled statistically.

The composite measure of reproductive success increased among birds 2-6 yr of age. Increased reproductive success over these ages was due to significant increases in clutch size and gosling survival and significant reductions in probabilities of total nest and total brood failure. After age 6, the composite measure of reproductive success declined significantly. This resulted from a decrease in both hatchability and brood survival, the latter characterized by decreased gosling survival and increased frequency of total brood failure among older birds. The older age decline in reproductive performance with respect to brood-rearing may, in part, reflect senescence of physical abilities needed to competently provide parent care. However, in this philopatric species, the decline may also reflect the tendency of ageing females to continue using specific feeding areas regardless of changes in available forage. Under conditions of systematic deterioration of the environment, philopatric behaviours may become maladaptive. -from Authors",68,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,61

When rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus were killed by myxomatosis in the mid-1950s, this habitat became overgrown and H. comma declined to ≤46 localities in 10 refuge regions. By 1982, rabbits had recovered and many former sites again appeared suitable, but had not been recolonized. Between 1982-91, the number of habitat patches that were populated increased by 30% in the South and North Downs. Most of the increase was in East Sussex. Habitat patches were most likely to be occupied by H. comma if they were relatively large and close to other populated patches. Many patches of suitable habitat had still not been recolonized by 1991. If the habitat was not fragmented, H. comma could be expected to recover its status in South East England in 50-75 yrs. But, applying logistic equations for colonization and extinction to the real, fragmented landscape, the authors predict little or no further spread in 100 yr, except in East Sussex. In most areas, zones (>10 km wide) of unsuitable habitat are expected to prevent continued spread. The dynamics of H. comma over 100 yr demonstrate the importance of environmental events that are correlated over large areas, the importance of refuges during adverse periods, and the potential for alternative, stable regional distributions, depending on the locations of refuges and barriers to dispersal. Conservation of H. comma requires the protection of metapopulations in networks of habitat patches. -from Authors",140,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,62

In the first half of the season, an experimental advance of the timing of parental care reduced fledging success, while an experimental delay raised it. In the second half of the season the opposite was found. Fledgling production by experimental pairs did not differ systematically from that of control pairs raising young at the same time. Thus, results were consistent only with the date hypothesis; timing of breeding and fledging success are thus causally related.

Heavy young were more likely to be recruited in the study areas than lighter young. More young born early in a breeding season were recruited than young from later nests, but there was no difference in recruitment rate between juveniles from spring and summer litters. Differential local recruitment by body mass at weaning occurred from weaning to 6 months after birth. However, body mass at weaning was not correlated with body mass at 18 months old, and no differences in body mass were found between recruits that survived and those that disappeared before this age. In both spring and summer litters, significantly more early nests recruited young than did late nests, although no significant differences in mean body mass existed between young from early and late nests. Mean body mass of siblings was positively affected by the body mass of the mother while lactating (both areas) and negatively by litter size (coniferous area only). Hence, heavier mothers produced heavier offspring than mothers of lower body mass. Body mass at weaning of local recruits affected home range quality, suggesting that juvenile recruits of higher body mass settled in plots with a higher food abundance than lighter recruits. -Authors",60,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,65

The relationship between mean live weight and mean density was well described by a negative power function, using a functional regression (GMb); the power for the pooled data for all year-classes being 1.33, exactly as predicted. Functional regressions for separate year-classes showed that both b and the intercept log a varied between year-classes with overall weighted mean values of 1.35 and 3.01 respectively; exactly the same values were obtained for median estimators from non-parametric regressions. Apart from two outlying drought years, there was no significant variation in b: parallel lines with a common slope of 1.35 provided an adequate fit to the data. Apart from one high value for the 1981 year-class, intercepts varied between year-classes in the range 2.54-3.74. Intercepts of parallel lines ranged from 1.77-2.70. Differences between year-classes may reflect differences in the carrying capacity of the habitat. The ""self-thinning' relationship could therefore provide a useful method for comparing temporal and spatial variations in carrying capacity both within and between trout streams. -from Author",72,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,66

This behaviour was consistent throughout the winter until water temperatures rose in spring. Larger trout (25-60 cm) were actively aggregating in deep-slow stream areas during the day. During the night the trout exhibited a third behavioural strategy. Fish were exposed and holding positions above or on the substrate. The trout were active throughout the night from dusk to dawn, and this behaviour was consistent throughout the winter. Spatial niches at night were selected principally on the basis of focal microwater velocities. The fish minimized energy expenditure by selecting habitats with low water velocities (pools, back eddies, stream bank areas). When passively sheltering during the day, interstices in the substrate or macrophytes providing shelter were the more important microhabitat characteristic. Feeding continued at night during winter, but the nocturnal activity pattern was not principally determined by food availability, since invertebrate drift did not show such periodicity. The behaviour and spatial niche selection by brown trout is explained as an ecologically adaptive homeostatic behavioural response to buffer the energy deficit and adverse environmental conditions experienced by the wintering fish. The nocturnal activity strategy reduces the risk of habitat exclusion and microhabitat inclusion by ice formation, and sheltering in the day reduces the energy expenditure and the risk of predation. Thus, the behaviour in winter is best described as a cost-minimizing shelter-and-move strategy. Little aggression in trout during winter suggests that social interactions may be less important as a factor regulating populations in winter than in summer. -from Authors",299,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,67
