These estimates suggest that the available data for a large portion of amphibians occurring in Colombia is insufficient to assess extinction risk. Here we aim to (1) review the available information on the distribution of the Colombian Data Deficient (DD hereafter) amphibians, (2) analyze their geographic distribution, and (3) evaluate the relationship between anthropogenic impact and their current conservation status. For this, we first compiled geographical records for the DD amphibian species using primary sources. Geographical records were obtained mainly from taxonomic descriptions and non-systematic surveys. We then estimated the geographical range and inferred the potential distribution for each species using letsR and MaxEnt, respectively. We quantified the human footprint for each species and tested the relationship between spatial distribution and anthropogenic change across populations. Analyses are here based on 128 of the 129 DD amphibian species that occur in Colombia. We found that most of these species were recently described and have small geographic ranges. A large proportion of these DD amphibians inhabit the Colombian Andes, and their populations have been strongly affected by human activities. Overall, the spatial clustering suggests that many of these species have faced similar environmental and anthropogenic pressures that have contributed to their rareness.

Field samplings were conducted between 2012 and 2015 at 23 sites, located in 11 of the 19 districts of the province. Earthworms were collected following a standard methodology. The conservation of specimens was done with 4% formalin solution and their identification was performed according to taxonomy keys. Richness, similarity and complementarity of species between the phytogeographic provinces were analyzed. A total of 15 earthworm species were identified and grouped into ten genera and five families: Acanthodrilidae (Dichogaster bolaui, Microscolex dubius), Glossoscolecidae (Glossodrilus parecis), Lumbricidae (Aporrectodea caliginosa, Aporrectodea rosea, Aporrectodea trapezoides, Bimastos parvus, Eisenia fetida, Octolasion tyrtaeum), Megascolecidae (Amynthas gracilis, Amynthas morrisi, Metaphire californica), Ocnerodrilidae (Eukerria saltensis, Eukerria rosae, Eukerria stagnalis). From all the species found five, G. parecis, E. saltensis, E. rosea, E. stagnalis and M. dubius, are native to South America, and the rest were introduced from Asia and Europe. The Espinal presented the greatest richness of earthworms (12), while the Pampeana showed high values of complementarity (greater than 70%) with the Chaco Húmedo and Valle de Inundación del Río Paraná. Endogeic species were present in all environments surveyed. In particular, the exotic species A. trapezoides and A. morrisi showed a wide geographical distribution, having been found at 70 and 50%, respectively, of the total number of the studied sites. One species, E. rosea, which is in the list, was not recorded in the sampling of 40 years ago. The results of current survey show that the number of species was lower compared to study by Ljungström and collaborators (60% of the 23 species registered).

Gall-inducing species have a close relationship with their host plant, as their habitat is largely restricted to the gall and the plant organ in which it develops. All plant organs are susceptible to gall induction by insects, the leaves being the most vulnerable. Knowledge about interactions between gall-inducing insects and plants is fragmented and incomplete in Argentina. In this study, we completed an inventory of galls induced by insects on plants in Córdoba (central Argentina) using information from field surveys and a review of the literature. We also focused on the frequency of plant-insect taxonomic associations and plant organs most commonly attacked by gall-inducing insects. Field surveys were performed systematically in 26 sites of Chaco Serrano, which were visited five times in two consecutive years, and in 17 sites of the province, which were sampled one or two times each. A comprehensive literature search of electronic and conventional databases was also conducted to complete the inventory. A total of 99 gall morphospecies on 58 plant species (21 families and 44 genera) were recorded through both field surveys and a literature review, enlarging the list of species available for the region by almost 50%. Asteraceae and Fabaceae were the plant families most attacked by galling insects, in partial concordance with the most species-rich plant families in the region. Diptera, particularly the family Cecidomyiidae, was the most species-rich group in the community of galling insects, which is in agreement with different studies across the globe. Baccharis was the genus displaying the highest number of gall morphotypes, followed by Acacia, Condalia, Geoffroea, Prosopis and Schinus. Almost 60% of the morphotypes were stem galls, a pattern uncommon in the literature. Fusiform and globoid-shaped galls were predominant.

The Caroni Swamp Ramsar Site, the largest mangrove swamp along the west coast of Trinidad, has been subjected to high levels of anthropogenic impacts including hydrological alteration and pollution from land-based sources since the 1920’s. While most of these impacts have been well documented, limited information exists on the macrobenthic communities in the swamp. This study addresses the paucity of information. The macrobenthic fauna in the main waterways of Caroni Swamp was sampled at 12 locations using a Van Veen 0.025 m2 grab, once in the dry (April) and wet (August) season of 2015 with a total of 144 samples. The samples were sorted, counted and species were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level. A total of 55 taxa were identified with polychaetes being the most abundant taxa. The ecological status of the macrobenthos was assessed using AZTI’s Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) and the multivariate-AMBI (M-AMBI). Physicochemical parameters were measured with a YSI multiparameter metre. Chemical analyses were also conducted on nitrates, nitrites, ammonia and reactive phosphates using standard methods. Overall, AMBI characterised the Caroni Swamp as “slightly disturbed” with a macrobenthic community of “poor” ecological status according to M-AMBI. Generally, the quality of the environment improves from the dry season to the wet season. However, seasonal variations in AMBI and M-AMBI were found to be site specific as some showed improvement in ecological status and macrozoobenthos quality while others showed degradation from the dry season to the wet season. The stations to the North of the swamp showed improvement from the dry season to the wet season while the opposite was observed in the more Southern stations. One notable characteristic of the swamp was the high levels of pollutants, particularly ammonia, recorded in one of its major waterways, the Caroni River. This is in contrast to the other waterways within the swamp which experience much lower levels of pollutant input from land-based sources. The assessment of the Caroni Swamp using AMBI and M-AMBI may be useful for informing management strategies to conserve the wetland and improve environmental quality.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Caroni Swamp | Ecological status | Environmental quality assessment | Macrozoobenthos,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,6

Honeybees (A. mellifera) use these resources to feed and therefore as an ecosystemic service through beekeeping. The characterization of pollen flora of a region allows getting to know the food source and defining the importance of different plant species for colonies development and maintenance. The aim of the present study is to identify the pollen flora used by A. mellifera in the Yungas Western area in Jujuy (Argentina) by means of their pollen loads characterization and to analyze the variations of two consecutive productive periods throughout spring and summer. To do this, 14 samples taken monthly were analyzed over the periods from September 2011 to March 2012 and September 2012 to March 2013. The samples were obtained from pollen traps at the entrances of the hives and were treated in the laboratory under conventional melisopalinology techniques with subsequent acetolysis. A total of 46 pollen types belonging to 25 botanical families were identified. The most important ones according to the family importance index are Euphorbiaceae (35.54), Fabaceae (26.27), Asteraceae (20.77), Vitaceae (16.14), Myrtaceae (9.13). Zanthoxylum, Sebastiania, Mimosa, Euphorbiaceae, Cactaceae, Parapiptadenia excelsa, Eupatorium, Cissus, Eucalyptus y Viguiera were identified as dominant resources. The variations of the breadth Index trophic niche show a floral resources selection for the area, where the use of native species stands out.

It is a Ramsar site (wetland of international importance) and has been included among the 81 mangrove sites with biological relevance and ecological rehabilitation needs in Mexico. Although fish fauna composition is well known in BNL, little evidence exists that support seasonal and spatial changes of fish assemblages’ structure. The hypothesis tested in this study was that there are significant seasonal and spatial changes in BNL fish assemblages’ composition which can be explained, at least partially, by changes in salinity, water temperature and sediment’s granulometry. Fish assemblages were sampled monthly from October 2012 to September 2013 at four zones of BNL, using gill nets (7.62 mm stretched mesh). A sample was taken every month in a randomly selected area of each zone. Prior to each sampling operation, water salinity and temperature were measured using an YSI-30 probe. Samples of sediment were collected with a Van Veen grab sampler in three randomly selected points of each zone for granulometry and organic matter analyses. A total of 2 026 individuals belonging to 48 species were collected. Slightly more than 90% of all caught fish belonged to nine species: Peruvian mojarra (Diapterus brevirostris), Pacific crevalle-jack (Caranx caninus), White mullet (Mugil curema), Blue sea-catfish (Ariopsis guatemalensis), Oval flounder (Syacium ovale), Pacific lined sole (Achirus mazatlanus), Yellowfin mojarra (Gerres simillimus), Pacific bumper (Chloroscombrus orqueta) and Freckled porcupinefish (Diodon holocanthus). Generalized linear models yielded significant differences among zones for the mean abundance of each of these nine species, but only in two cases seasonal differences were significant (D. brevisrostris and C. caninus). Permutational multivariate analysis of variance yielded also significant differences among zones and between seasons for the composition of the fish assemblage. Redundancy analysis using salinity, temperature, and percentage mud in sediment as environmental variables showed that fish assemblage’s composition varies along two main gradients defined by mud fraction of sediments in a small spatial scale (~ 3 km) and salinity in a seasonal scale. Percentage of variation explained by canonical axes was less than 25%, indicating that other factors could be influencing changes in assemblage composition. As most species appear as juveniles in the lagoon, fluctuations in their abundances could be linked, at least partially, with recruitment events.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Coastal wetlands | Eastern Tropical Pacific | Fish assemblages | Mexico | Seasonal changes | Spatial changes,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,15

The cardiovascular effects of this poison are largely known and recently was shown that it is capable to affect the neuromuscular junction on avian and mice isolated preparation. In this work, we used transmission electron microscopy to investigate the ultrastructure of the motor nerve terminal and postsynaptic junctional folds of phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm preparations incubated for either 5 or 60 min with the methanolic extract of R. schneideri (50 μg/mL). In addition, the status of the acetylcholine receptors (AChR) was examined by TRITC-α-bungarotoxin immunofluorescence location at the endplate membrane. The results show that 5 min of incubation with the gland secretion extract significantly decreased (32%) the number of synaptic vesicles into the motor nerve terminal, but did not decrease the electron density on the top of the junctional folds where nicotinic receptors are concentrated; however, 60 min of incubation led to significant nerve terminal reloading in synaptic vesicles whereas the AChR immunoreactivity was not as marked as in control and after 5 min incubation. Muscle fibers were well-preserved but intramuscular motor axons were not. The findings corroborated pharmacological data since the decrease in the number of synaptic vesicles (5 min) followed by recovery (60 min) is in accordance with the transient increase of MEPPs frequency meaning increased neurotransmitter release. These data support the predominant presynaptic mode of action of the R. schneideri, but do not exclude the possibility of a secondary postsynaptic action depending on the time the preparation is exposed to poison.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,ACh receptors | Neuromuscular junction | Neurotransmitter release | Presynaptic action | Synaptic vesicles,13567,OSU,undefined,Ohio State University,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,16

Chironomid assemblages are likely to provide a useful measure of biotic integrity in estuaries of Costa Rica, which lack an intensive estuarine bioassessment tool to support environmental monitoring and regulatory programs. We characterized the taxonomic composition of Chironomidae, tested a Chironomidae Index of Biotic Integrity (CIBI) developed from extrinsic pollution tolerance values for its efficacy in evaluating the surface water quality and physical habitat, and made recommendations for increasing the sensitivity of the CIBI to detect differing degrees of stress across a range of estuaries in Costa Rica. Specifically, we selected nine estuaries within six different watersheds across a land use gradient located on the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica and collected Chironomidae surface-floating pupal exuviae (SFPE) samples biannually for two consecutive years (July 2012, Jan. 2013, July 2013, Jan. 2014).

The CIBI successfully differentiated between estuaries with poor versus good biotic integrity, indicating that CIBI could be used to evaluate the surface water quality and physical habitat of Costa Rican estuaries.

In the present study, we evaluated prey selectivity for the tropical gar Atractosteus tropicus in the larval stage (first 8 weeks) using the zooplankton Artemia fransiscana, Daphnia pulex and Moina macrocopa as prey following the hypothesis that prey selection of the fish species is related not only to prey species preferences but to the difference in prey densities present in the environment. Functional responses were tested at prey densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 and 8.0 ind. mL-1 and analyzed using Manly’s α. For prey selectivity, we used the three zooplankton species at three different densities. In these two experiments the fish larvae were allowed to feed for 45 min. To quantify feeding behavior (encounters, attacks, captures, ingestions, rejections) we used a density of 1 ind. mL-1 using each prey species based on 10 minutes of direct observation. Our results showed a functional response Type II for A. tropicus preying mostly on A. franciscana and M. macrocopa. The Manly’s α index showed that M. macrocopa and A. franciscana are the most preys selected. The values for encounters for the three prey species were relatively constant during the eight weeks. Encounter values for the cladocerans were low in comparison to A. franciscana; however, high success in capture and ingestion was observed for all prey species used. Our results from the functional response experiments supports the hypothesis that A. tropicus is an active predator presenting a functional response of a carnivorous fish and the shift in prey selection suggests that even at low prey availability, A. tropicus is able to manipulate and feed on zooplankton of wide range in size. Also, according to our results, we suggest the use of a mix of A. franciscana and M. macrocopa to feed A. tropicus in culture systems in concentrations ≈ 2 ind. mL-1 during the first 3 weeks of age and then shift to M. macrocopa from the 4 week.

With a sampling period from January 2015 to December 2016 and 26 camera-trapping stations (with in a set of two camera traps opposite to each other) and located along roads and animal trails, we determined the activity pattern and habitat use of L. wiedii (margay), L. pardalis (ocelote) y P. yagouaroundi (yaguarundi). All independent photographs of each species were grouped into three temporal categories (day, night and twilight) and six habitat categories; Oak Forest, Oak-Pine Forest, Cloud Forest, Pine-Oak Forest, Tropical Deciduous Forest and Medium Forest. Temporal and spatial overlap between species (i.e. interactions) was obtained with the Czekanowski index and the Pianka index, respectively. These indices are symmetrical and take values from zero to one, where the results close to zero indicate that there is no overlap between species and values close to one indicate overlap. We obtained a total of 379 independent photographs, of which 239 corresponded to margay, 118 to ocelot and 22 to yaguarundi. Margay and ocelot were nocturnal, with 75% of their records in this category showing a high temporal overlap (0.85); whereas yaguarundi was fully diurnal, suggesting it may be able to coexist with the other two species (margay and ocelot). Moreover, the yaguarundi used habitat similar to ocelot and margay (with high spatial overlap of 0.81 and 0.72, respectively), while the spatial overlap between the margay and ocelot was intermediate (0.53), since they used in most cases different habitat types. Our results suggest that there is no interspecific competition among these tropical mesocarnivorous species, probably due to antagonistic interactions among them on the temporal and spatial axis.

We also sought to find out which variables of habitat and human influence are related to the presence of the most common species.

Regression analyses suggest that the variables of season, the cover of secondary vegetation and distance to the nearest human locality were related to the record of these species. Despite the anthropogenic pressure in Pastorias, tropical dry forest remnants still maintain high species richness, which is very similar to that of a site as preserved as Cuicatlan.

Stable isotopes are valuable tools to describe the trophic structure of such assemblages, providing useful information for conservation and ecological management. This study aimed at estimating the relative contribution of the different basal carbon sources to the diet of primary consumer fishes (herbivores and detritivores), and determining the trophic position (TP) of the dominant fishes from each trophic guild (herbivores, detritivores, invertivores and piscivores). For this purpose we analyzed stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) in potential food sources, and muscle tissue of fishes in five oxbow lakes located in the floodplain of River Ichilo, Bolivia. Terrestrial plants and C3 aquatic macrophytes were the major carbon source contributing to the diet of herbivorous fishes, whereas particulate organic matter (POM) contributed more to the diet of detritivore fishes. In general, C4 aquatic macrophytes contributed little to the diet of herbivores and detritivores. However, we found a relatively high contribution of C4 macrophytes (28%) to the diet of the herbivores Mylossoma duriventre and Schizodon fasciatus. We found a good agreement between our estimated TP values and the trophic group assigned based on diet composition from literature. The herbivore M. duriventre was at the bottom of the food web, being the baseline organism (TP = 2). The remaining primary consumers (herbivores and algivore/ detritivores) exhibited relatively high TP values (2.3-2.9), probably due to their opportunistic feeding behavior. Omnivore/invertivore species studied displayed TP values near the 3.0 value expected for secondary consumers.

The epiphytic ferns studied in this work belong to the Polypodiaceae family: Microgramma mortoniana and Pleopeltis macrocarpa. Plant communities are subject to high levels of anthropization and introduction of exotic species. The goals of this work are to provide information on the morphogenesis of epiphytic gametophytes and to extend knowledge of their life cycles, contributing to their conservation. Sowing was carried out in Dyer medium. In both species the spores are monolete, ellipsoidal, yellowish and with verrucate sculpture. The equatorial diameter is 60-61 μm, the polar diameter is 39-42 μm. The germination is the Vittaria type; in M. mortoniana occurs at 20 days, while in P. macrocarpa occurs at six days. The filaments are uniseriate of 3-6 cells in length. The gametophyte development is Drynaria type. The cordated form is given after 40 days. In M. mortoniana, buds originated after 40 days. In P. macrocarpa, after 120 days, clathrate trichomes scale-like appear mainly on the margins of the gametophyte. The gametangia are typical of leptosporangiate ferns. The sporophyte of M. mortoniana emerged after 120 days and that of P. macrocarpa arose after 500 days, its blades are simple, spatulate and unicellular and multicellular branching hairs were observed. The germination pattern, gametophyte development, the presence of a lipid globule in the prothalic cell and the formation of unicellular capitated hairs are relevant characters that could be considered for systematic group.

Five samplings were made between September 2014 and February 2016 considering each phase of the flood pulse. The fish were sampled using traditional fishing gear such as nets and trawls. The index of food importance (IAi %) was used to establish the dietary habits of the species, and the variation of the diet at interspecific level, and the vacuity coefficient (CV %) was also calculated. The Levins index standardized by Hurlbert (BA) was used to evaluate the amplitude between sizes, sex and hydrological phases. The oropharyngeal structures and the digestive tract were characterized, which together with morphological measurements, allowed and analyze 11 ecomorphological traits related to the use of habitat, such as position in the water column, and the exploitation of a particular trophic resource. The relationship between the ecomorphological traits and the diet of the species was analyzed by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). We analyzed 89 individuals (34-124 mm SL). Triportheus magdalenae was classified as carnivore/zooplanktivore, and has a narrow trophic niche (BA = 0.12). Showed a high exploitation of zooplankton (95.9% IAi), mostly Cladocera (Ceriodaphnia sp.) and Copepoda (Notodiaptomus sp. and Thermocyclops sp). The youngest juveniles (34-190 mm SL) also consumed allochthonous insects (3.4% IAi). The ecomorphological traits that contributed the most to this trophic specialization were the relative length of the gillrakers (LRBE). The number of gillrakers (NBE), which varied significantly from the smaller to the larger ones, increase in both number as well as in length as individuals grow, which explains the strongly marked degree of specialization on zooplankton in adults, since they present a greater degree of efficiency in the process of filtering. The vacuity coefficient was high (54%), which could be associated with a decrease in the density of zooplankton populations, especially during the time of lower waters strongly influenced by the El Niño event, however the observed diet (22 items food) corresponded to 80% of the diet estimated (28 estimated food items).",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Diet | Diversity | Ecomorphological traits | Endemic fish,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,28

The strongest effect on germination rates was by temperature, enhancing the difference in responses in substrate types (up to 90% in commercially prepared media at 25 ºC). The low proportion of germinated seeds in soil (< 39%), together with external local stress factors (e.g. grazing impact by herbivores), may be the critical factors contributing to the nearly total absence of seedlings and saplings of E. vargasii in the study area despite abundant seed production.

Taking this into account, seed germination and seed storage behavior of a pioneer species of tropical dry forest (Tecoma stans) were studied in the laboratory, to establish the effect of different environmental conditions on a local tree population. Two seed lots collected in July 2011, from Cali (Colombia), were evaluated under three alternating temperatures (20/30, 20/25, 25/30 ºC; 16/8 h) and four light qualities (12-hour white light photoperiod, darkness, and 15 minutes of red light -R and far red light -FR). Final germination was recorded for all treatments; for white light treatment the daily germination was recorded to calculate mean germination rate, mean germination time, and two synchronization indices. To assess the effect of light quality on physiological variables, a destructive germination test was carried out. For this test, another seed lot was evaluated under the same light conditions using an alternating temperature of 20/30 °C - 16/8 h, recording germination during six days for every treatment. In addition, seeds were stored at two different moisture contents (7.7, 4.1 %) and three storage temperatures (20, 5, -20 ºC), during two time periods (one and three months); a seed germination test was conducted for each treatment. Four replicates of 35 seeds per treatment were used for all experiments. Germination was high (GP > 90 %) with all alternating temperatures under white light, whereas under R, FR, and darkness germination was evenly successful at low temperatures, but at higher temperature, half of the seeds entered into secondary dormancy (GP= 45-65 %). However, mean germination rate and synchronization under R and FR decreased significantly in comparison to white light treatment and, consequently, mean germination time increased. Seed storage behavior of this species is orthodox due to the high germination (GP > 90 %) obtained under all treatments. In conclusion, T. stans seeds have a negative germination response at high incubation temperatures in the absence of white light, entering into a secondary dormancy. In contrast, an environment with a lower temperature and without white light delays the germination, but at the end seeds are able to reach the same germination values. This seed dependence on incident light in limiting conditions suggests a physiological mechanism on the seed tissues of this species, probably mediated by phytochromes. Finally, the orthodox seed storage behavior of T. stans is a reason to include this species in ex situ seed conservation programs for restoration and recovery of the tropical dry forest; however, long-term studies should be conducted in order to evaluate the maintenance of this characteristic throughout longer periods of time.",4,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Climate change | Ex situ conservation | Phytochrome | Secondary dormancy | Seed storage behavior | Soil seed bank,13567,Univalle,undefined,Universidad del Valle,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,33

To reach T50 degradation, R. mangle and L. racemosa required more time (133 and 138 days, respectively) than A. germinans (74 days). Organic matter and soil humidity were significantly correlated with the decay constant of A. germinans (r= 0.65 p< 0.05 and r= 0.55 p< 0.05, respectively). Total nitrogen content was highest in the Pajaral site (2 683 mg.kg) and was also highly correlated with organic matter content (r= 0.9 p= 0.003). Total phosphorus content was highest in the Boca site (2 031 mg.kg) and was also negatively correlated with pH (r= -0.61 p= 0.004). In conclusion, differences in the rate of mangrove leaf degradation depend on the involved species (leaf composition), time of exposure or immersion in water (flooding patterns) and sediment heterogeneity (i.e., texture, pH, humidity content and bulk density).",5,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Degradation | Hydroperiod | Leaching | Litter | Mangrove,13567,CONACYT,269540,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,38

However, Cuban Dytiscidae remain scarcely studied, and there is need to identify those species and habitats that urgently require effective conservation actions. Here we aim to identify the threatened taxa of the family Dytiscidae in Cuba according to their degree of vulnerability. For that, we compiled distributional data on the Cuban fauna, including data from literature, collections and own samplings carried out between the period 2000 and 2014. In addition, the vulnerability of the species was evaluated using a methodology that combines six criteria regarding both species and habitat attributes. This analysis of vulnerability was completed to 50 (94 %) out of 53 Cuban species. Five species (9 %) were identified as highly vulnerable, 20 (38 %) moderately and 25 (48 %) as having low conservation status. The five most threatened species were Laccodytes cobrinae, Laccophilus alariei, Copelatus barbouri, C. darlingtoni, and Desmopachria glabella. These species are endemic to Cuba and characterized by highly localized populations and low abundance as well as high habitat specificity. Thus, we propose the inclusion of these five species in both the red list of Cuban fauna and the IUCN Red List (under the category of “Vulnerable”). In addition, not all areas where these species were found belong to the National System of Protected Areas of Cuba. Thus, we suggest the inclusion of the Laguna Base Julio A.

Laguncularia racemosa is a typical tree species in mangroves and transitional zones. This study aimed to compare the wood anatomy of L. racemosa (Combretaceae) in two different forests (mangroves and transitional forests), which have different soil conditions. For this, we obtained wood and soil samples in March 2016. We analyzed soil nutritional contents in one 15 cm deep soil sample per forest type. In addition, we selected five mangrove trees in each formation for wood anatomy analysis and took one wood sample per individual, per area. We prepared histological slides and separated materials following standard methods for wood anatomy studies. Soil analysis showed that mangrove soils had higher phosphorus, potassium and calcium contents. The transitional soil had lower pore water salinity and soil pH, probably due to high aluminum levels. Anatomical attributes differed between different forest populations. In the different wood aspects evaluated, we obtained higher values in mangrove individuals when compared to the transitional forest population: vessel elements length (375.79 μm), tangential vessels diameter (75.85 μm), frequency of vessels (11.90 μm) and fiber length (889.89 μm). Moreover, parenchyma rays height was larger in the samples of the transitional forest (392.80 μm), while the mangrove population presented wider rays (29.38 μm).

The objectives of this study were to describe the life history and phenology of Phylloicus pulchrus in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. Eggs and larvae were reared to determine the species lifespan and time in each instar. Larval instars were determined based on a head width vs. pronotal suture length correlation (N= 120). Larvae and benthic leaf litter were sampled monthly at a headwater stream for a year; all specimens were classified into instars based on their case size. Adult P. pulchrus were sampled monthly for a year with a light trap and at various times with a Malaise trap. Monthly environmental variables were related to species and sex abundance. There was a gradient of egg development where eggs (within compound masses) closest to the water were more developed. There were five larval instars and reared larvae showed longer development times and more variable body measurements in later instars. The best correlation for larval instar determination was case length-head width (Pearson= 0.90, P= 2.2e-16, N= 120). Phylloicus pulchrus has a multivoltine life cycle, with asynchronous larval development. Adult abundance was low. First to third instar larvae were influenced significantly by rainfall and rainfall seasonality had a negative significant effect on second instar larval abundance (ANOVA= 7.45, P= 0.02). Compound egg masses were probably oviposited by different females that gathered for oviposition. Phylloicus pulchrus follows the predominant developmental characteristic of Trichoptera of having five larval stages. Development times were longer than expected (longest times for a Phylloicus species) and may be an effect of laboratory rearing. The influence of rainfall (and seasonality) on different larval instars highlights the importance of this variable on early larval development.

The environmental variables included temperature, salinity, oxygen and chlorophyll a of the water column, and were used to calculate the stratification with the Brunt-Vaiisala frequency; this information was complemented by satellite images of temperature, surface chlorophyll, geostrophic currents and sea level, obtained from MODIS and AQUA products. The association between environmental variables and the zooplankton community structure was determined using Spearman’s correlation ranges with the Bioenv routine and a stepwise regression model, and Principal component analysis (PCA). Our results showed spatial and temporal patterns in the oceanographic conditions of the study area, such as upwelling in the Northeast region, strong stratification in the Southwest, and mesoscale activity. The abundance of zooplankton exhibited differences between the two climatic seasons and zones. Temporal differences were also evident in the size and diversity of taxa (ANOVA 2-way p <0.05). These changes were related to the moderate upwelling and the activity of mesoscale eddies. Cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies of variable size can either transport or retain zooplankton over cross-shelf and oceanic areas, thus modifying the taxonomic structure of the community. According to the Bioenv analysis, the main variables that explained the abundance and composition of zooplankton were sea level and chlorophyll a (Spearman correlation = 0.49). The stepwise regression showed that stratification, oxygen and chlorophyll a were the most important predictors of zooplankton abundance and size.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Distribution | Mesoescale | Mesozooplankton | Size spectrum | Stratification,13567,CONICYT,1120478,Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,51

The oil is extracted from the seeds and, for the production to be feasible, utilization of the residual seed cake is crucial. Although the cake could be employed as a protein source in animal feed, it is rich in phorbol ester, which is toxic for animals. Therefore, breeding programs have been working to reduce or eliminate the phorbol ester content in physic nut. In this context, the present work aimed to evaluate the physic nut oil of toxic and non-toxic varieties (containing known or undetectable amounts of phorbol ester, respectively) with regards to phytotoxicity in a model experiment with Lactuca sativa L. For this, the percentage of germinated seeds was evaluated after 8, 16, 24, 36 and 48 hours of exposure to the treatments with toxic and non-toxic oil at concentrations of 22.5 %, 45 % and 67.5 % of emulsion (physic nut oil energetically mixed with distilled water). Root growth was determined after 48 hours of exposure and the germination speed index was obtained. The different stages of mitotic division as well as possible chromosomal and nuclear alterations were also recorded. The mitotic index was calculated as the number of dividing cells, as a fraction of the total number of cells, and the frequency of chromosome and nuclear alterations, expressed as the percentage of number of alterations divided by the total number of cells. Both varieties exhibited phytotoxicity, inducing significant reductions in percentage of germinated seeds (reduction of 98 %), germination speed index (reduction of 24.44) and root growth (reduction of 8.54 mm). In microscopic analysis, a mitodepressive effect was observed for both oils at the three concentrations used when compared to the negative control; however, it was possible to distinguish between the toxic and the non-toxic varieties based on the more expressive reduction of division promoted by the first, 2.19 %. Significant increments in the frequency of mitotic cells showing chromosome alterations as well, as the presence of condensed nuclei, were observed in the treated cells. However, these parameters were not significantly different from the control in the cells treated with both physic nut oils. In conclusion, the evaluation of root growth and cell division in the plant model L. sativa, can be proposed as an alternative to animal tests to distinguish the varieties with high and low phorbol ester concentration, thus contributing to the detection of toxicity in varieties used in breeding programs.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Mitodepressive effect | Phorbol ester | Phytotoxicity | Root growth | Seed germination,13567,CNPq,undefined,Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,52

Currently, more than half of the Earth’s surface is used for the establishment of production systems; in this context, live fences can generate positive effects on the environment and provide environmental goods and services. In this work, we reviewed the effects of live fences on production systems from the tropical regions of America, Africa, Asia and Australia, analyzing the uses and perceptions of farmers that have made use of these fences. It was found that live fences were mainly related to the delimitation of farms and pastures. However, their uses and benefits are manifold, among which we found: provide forage, wood extraction, fruit supply, windbreaks, medicinal, to avoid soil erosion, moisture retention and nutritional support. In addition, other positive perceptions were: increasing landscape connectivity, increasing economic incomes, reducing production costs, reducing pressure on remaining vegetation, keeping maintenance costs down, contributing to pest control, and improving fertility. However, negative perceptions included the excessive work in repairing or pruning them, shade negative impact on agricultural production, lack of information discourages establishment, high establishment costs, generation of property conflicts and management difficulty. It was found that the uses by farmers are focused on improving the yields of productive systems, but also on the conservation of natural resources especially soil and biodiversity. We proposed research topics for the future, as determining the criteria in the selection of native species to establish and enrich living fences valuing ecological and socioeconomic aspects; in additionally, we must deepen the benefits they produce on the yields of productive systems. We suggest the development of live fences studies in the tropical region of Australasia, because no data was found for this region, in order to know the biodiversity and services status that they provide to the rural communities. As a conclusion, it will be important to generate initiatives that encourage the formulation of rural policies, the creation of programs that encourage the establishment of live fences, whether through payments for environmental services, tax compensation or other mechanisms.

These areas provide different ecosystem services, but with the increase of population and of the varied economic activities, the barely known local natural resources may be negatively impacted. Thus this research aimed to study plankton dynamics, productivity and ecological balance for the area during the dry season of 2012. For this, we established 17 stations and studied the monthly variation and spatial distribution of inorganic nutrients, temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, photic zone, plankton and fish larvae abundance and composition with standard methods, while spatial and temporal patterns where identified using cluster and multidimentional scaling analyses. Obtained results of biotic and abiotic parameters defined a pattern characteristic of productive estuarine zones as well as the existence of three specific areas associated with the natural and anthropic conditions of the area, such as: a) inner part of the Jambelí Archipelago and in front of Puná island influenced by productive activities and the hydrography of the area; B) an area, formed by the stations located in the outer estuary where the oceanic influence is evident and c) the Jambelí channel, characterized by mixing processes resulting from tides flow. This was supported by the presence of oceanic, neritic and estuarine phytoplankton; copepods with uniform distribution in the study area, and dominance of Engraulidae fish larvae, representative of this type of aquatic ecosystem. Temporally, rainfall records in May exceeded normal values, which would have influenced the high concentrations of nutrients, decrease of salinity and of the photic zone registered during this month. However, the availability of nutrients throughout the study period, allowed to maintain the composition and abundance of phytoplankton, with changes in representative species, recorded periods of greater (June to August) and lower (October to December) zooplankton abundance, could be the result of specific population patterns of present species, and the influence of the tide and the flows of the contributing river basin. A similar behavior was recorded for ichthioplankton, as a result of Anchoa macrolepidota concentrations, species, characteristics of this type of ecosystem.

Most scientific work about road kill has been done in temperate ecosystems, but some authors have suspected that they have different characteristics in tropical ecosystems. In this review, I summarize publications that focus on road kills in tropical countries from Africa, America, Asia and Oceania. I found 73 studies that focus on tropical road kills. Output increased after 2011 and the most productive countries, in articles per capita, are Costa Rica, Colombia and Brazil. Most studies report that mammals are the main victims, but bird deaths are severely underestimated and amphibians suffer mass mortality in reproductive concentrations. Every road victim is itself a small ecosystem that contains thousands of microscopic species, but “Road Kill Microbiology” is yet to be developed as a new branch of research. No generalization can be made about the role of season or habitat in road kills because pooled data hide individual trends: researchers should keep separate records by age, sex, species, time of day, season and place; otherwise important patterns will be missed. There is not a single study, tropical or temperate, that can completely answer how many animals are killed, where, or when, because many victims are removed by scavengers, end outside the road or are too small to be noticed. Significant contributions from the tropics include emphasis on the ethical use of road kill for research, inclusion of species other than wild vertebrates, study of often overlooked phenomena like hour of day and failed versus successful crossing attempts, and the value of speed control in mitigation. The so-called “citizen science” can identify the most affected species but produces data that are very different from those generated by professional scientists in terms of the proportion of affected groups. Real speed limitation is the simplest effective mitigation measure. Tropical scientists should concentrate on monitoring and experimental studies to fully understand the ecology of road kills and to make a contribution that matches what rich countries do.",18,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Collision | Mortality | Road kill microbiology | Tropics | Vertebrate | Wildlife,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,55

Narcine entemedor differs from its congeners by the extensive branching of the SO and IO canals, which converge in the inter-orbital region; in N. vermiculatus these canals present a similar condition, but are less branched. In contrast, N. bancroftii has divergent canals (directed outwards from the inter-orbital region). HYO canals are located on the periphery of the electric organs in these species; in N. bancroftii the branches extend towards the posterior region, whereas in the other species are reduced (N. entemedor) or almost absent (N. vermiculatus).

The aim of this research was to evaluate how the patch size distribution of vegetation influences the species-area relationship and species abundance distribution of a community in an inselberg of the “Piedra La Tortuga” Natural Monument of the Guayana region, Venezuela. In this context, three research questions were established: What is the effect of patch size on species richness? What species-area model (SAR) has the best fit in those vegetation patches? How is the distribution of species abundances (SADs) induced by the patch size distribution? A stratified random sampling was performed in patches ranging from 0.34 to 14.8 m2, totaling 40 sampling units (226 m2). All individuals found in the 40 patches were identified at species level. The floristic composition in the different samples was represented by 19 families, 22 genera and 24 species, of which 50 % are endemic to inselbergs and two, are threatened of extinction. Two groups of patch sizes were identified (large 8-15 m2and small ≤ 7.9 m2) in relation to the abundance and composition of species. The species accumulation curves for each patch size group show a contrasting tendency with marked differences in the observed richness among patch size groups. The curves of the SADs models had a significant adjustment of the geometric series in the two categories of patches. The SAR model of the power function presented the best species-area adjustments, where the increase in patch area accounted for 82 % of the variation in the increase in the number of species. The results of this study demonstrate for the first time how vegetation patches of a tropical inselberg have a strong influence on richness, abundance distribution and species composition. Likewise, it was determined that the SAD geometric model presented the best fit in the community as a function of patch size as a resource indicator, where the abundance of a species can be equivalent to a proportion of the space occupied. It is also presumed that changes in patch sizes could be associated with nutrient and water availability, as has been demonstrated in other dryland environments. In some studies it has been argued that variation in species composition among vegetation profiles of tropical inselbergs is mainly conditioned by habitat structure and water deficit. However, it had not been discussed how the size of patches of vegetation has an effect on richness.

The objective of this work was to know the effect of light, soil fertility and seed origin on the growth of Magnolia pugana seedlings. The relative growth rate (RGR) and its components (Net Assimilation Rate: NAR and Leaf Area Ratio: LAR), as well as the root-shoot ratio (R/S) were estimated. Seedlings were obtained from seeds collected in two localities in Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico, the first is a wild population in San Nicolás (SN) and the second is a plantation located in the gardens of the Centro Universitario de Ciencias Biológicas y Agropecuarias (CUCBA). The experiment was conducted under greenhouse conditions. In September 2015, 96 seedlings of approximately three months old were subjected to the following treatments in a factorial experiment (2x2x2): light level (high = 1 120 μmol m-2s-1and low = 136.3 μmol m-2s-1), seedling origin (SN and CUCBA) and soil fertility (high fertility = SN soil, low fertility = CUCBA soil) with 12 replicates for each combination of factors and levels. Growth was estimated in two harvests: the first harvest after 30 days of starting the experiment and the second at 60 days. Light and soil fertility levels, as well as seedling origin influenced growth through physiological and morphological adjustments. In general, Magnolia pugana showed higher RGR and NAR in high light, while LAR decreased. Soil fertility and seedling origin did not affect RGR or its components. However, these were affected by the light level, seedlings from SN grew more in high light. Stem height varied due to soil fertility and seedling origin, in low fertility soil (CUCBA) the seedlings of SN were 35 % higher than those of CUCBA. Low fertility soil under high light caused greater investment in seedling root biomass. The physiological component (NAR) was the major determinant of intraspecific variation in RGR. SN seedlings showed greater phenotypic plasticity due to coming from a wild population, which possibly has higher genetic variation than the cultivated population from CUCBA. The results suggest that Magnolia pugana is a species capable of adapting to diverse environments due to its phenotypic plasticity in response to different light and soil fertility levels.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Endangered species | Growth analysis | Leaf area ratio | Magnolia pugana | Net assimilation rate | Relative growth rate,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,62

Thus, conservation of key riverine habitats for fish reproduction may be essential for the recruitment of new native species of fish. The present study aimed to identify key habitats for fish spawning and early development in the Paranapanema River basin, as well as to determine the taxonomic composition, reproductive and life-history strategy, and to report spatial distribution of eggs, larvae and juveniles. The importance of lagoons, tributaries, and sub-tributaries was evaluated in the Paranapanema River basin between October 2012 and March 2013. Eggs and larvae samples were collected at dawn and dusk with conical plankton nets (0.5 mm mesh size), whereas juveniles were captured during the day with seine and sieve (0.5 cm mesh size). A total of 547 eggs, 904 larvae and 1 228 juveniles were captured. We observed that 2 larvae and 288 juveniles of non-migratory species, parental care, and equilibrium life-history strategy, predominated in lagoons and tributaries. On the other hand, 13 larvae and 60 juveniles of short migratory distance, no parental care, and periodic life-history strategy predominated in sub-tributaries. The highest densities of eggs were recorded in tributaries and sub-tributaries (Tukey’s test, P = 0.001 and P = 0.03, respectively), and the highest densities of larvae were recorded for lagoons and tributaries (P = 0.005 and P = 0.0001, respectively). Captures of eggs and larvae were higher at night; while the highest catches per unit effort of juveniles were recorded for tributaries and sub-tributaries. Fish species that adopt different life-history strategies can use diverse types of habitats during the early stages. Lagoons, tributaries and sub-tributaries of the Paranapanema River play different roles in the reproductive success of fish fauna in a heavily modified basin.

The under-explored relationship between turtle carapaces and the diatom assemblages inhabiting them was investigated and characterized in terms of taxonomic and biological traits (bio-volume, life-form, and attachment).

In this work we analyze the distribution of spider assemblages at three microhabitats (canopy, tree trunk and soil) in Citrus sinensis orchards (Rutaceae) in the Province of Corrientes, Argentina. Spiders were collected monthly using four sampling techniques: beating foliage, leaf litter sifting, pitfall traps and direct capture by hand. A total of 2 160 samples were examined and 7 194 spiders were collected (2 462 on the canopy, 983 on trunk and 3 749 on the floor) belonging to 34 families and 200 species/morphospecies of Araneomorphae. There were significant differences among microhabitats and months in the structure of the spider communities, according to analysis of similarity (ANOSIM). The diversity was highest on the canopy, followed by soil and tree trunk. Araneidae, Salticidae and Anyphaenidae were the most abundant taxa in the canopy; the dominant species were Jessica erythostoma and Cheiracanthium inclusum, a predator of the leaf herbivore Phyllocnistis citrella (Lepidoptera) a pest of Citrus spp. The most abundant families on the tree trunk were Tetragnathidae, Hersiliidae and Theridiidae, Iviraiva pachyura was a species specialist in such microhabitat; and Leucauge venusta was an opportunistic species, because their abundance increaseds markedly in anthropic environments that modified by man. The most abundant families on the floor were Lycosidae, Linyphiidae and Coriniidae. In this habitat, Lycosa erythrognatha and Pardosa plumipedata were dominant species. The Chao-Jaccard similarity index was highest between the canopy and trunk (J-C = 0.95), likewise ordination by nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed strong differentiation between assemblages of soil spiders and canopy and trunk spiders. Also, on the soil the temporary replacement of species was greater and the seriation method was significant (z = 3.82, P = 0.00) therefore there was a succession of species during the year. The different species in each microhabitat probably avoided competition by using different hunting strategies and different ecological resources, in addition to specific patterns of temporal distribution.

Seasonal variability of the community structure of copepods in the Eastern tropical Pacific off central Mexico was studied during three distinct hydrodynamic periods in 2010 using statistical and multivariate analyses. The survey period included the second half of the 2009-2010 El Niño (January), the neutral transition period (May-June), and the first half of the 2010-2011 La Niña (October). Seventy-eight copepod species were identified; richness ranged from 11 to 47 species per station, with seasonal averages from 25 species in May to 35 species in January. Cluster analysis indicated that there were four principal groups present across the surveyed periods, defined by January (El Niño), October (La Niña), May offshore stations, and May upwelling stations (cyclonic eddy and coastal stations). There were no significant differences in abundance, but the January (El Niño) cluster was most diverse with 32 species, May offshore and October (La Niña) clusters each had 25 species, and the May upwelling was the least diverse cluster with 18 species. Mesoscale processes were strongest during May, which was the only period with a significant inshore-offshore gradient of species richness and diversity. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that variability was primarily driven by subsurface (75-200 m) ammonium, and surface (0-50 m) temperature, nitrates+nitrites, salinity and phosphorus. Copepodites and adults of the primarily herbivorous Eucalanidae dominated the stations of the upwelling cluster, while copepodites and adults of the carnivorous Euchaetidae dominated the January (El Niño) station cluster. The higher Chl a levels during the less productive (reduced upwelling) El Niño period were probably due to reduced grazing activities and increased ammonium availability through increased zooplankton metabolism. The horizontal distribution of copepods in the Eastern Tropical Pacific off Mexico appears to be principally defined by mesoscale eddy processes (offshore) and upwelling (coastal). These mesoscale processes were affected by El Niño - La Niña transitions, which subsequently disrupted the inshore-offshore gradient and in the case of El Niño likely caused reductions in copepod abundance across the entire region which persisted for the entire study period, and possibly longer.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Eddies | Eucalanidae | Euchaetidae | Mesoscale processes | Upwelling | Zooplankton,13567,UCOL,329882,Universidad de Colima,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,85

Tools like the maturity indexes, food web diagnostics and metabolic footprints are used in assessing the ecosystem in relation to the impact contaminants and other stressors, as well as monitoring and measuring changes in the structure and dynamics of the food webs and, more recently, to study the impact of climate factors on the nematode community. Costa Rica is a tropical country with a variety of miroclimates in a small area; this attribute is reflected in the different life zones described by Holdridge for Costa Rica, which differ in their patterns of precipitation, temperature and evapotranspiration. In this research, the diversity of climates was exploited in order to contribute with the knowledge of the nematode communities of several ecosystems within different life zones. For this purpose, samples were taken in several ecosystems located in different life zones in the Region Huetar Norte from Costa Rica. High variation in taxa abundance between different management types within ecosystems was obtained. However, the low availability of replicates for proper statistical analyzes made the mean estimations numerically unprovable. The maturity indexes and the food web diagnosis did not show statistical differences between the studied zones, while, the metabolic footprints were positively correlated to life zones. The metabolic footprint decreased in the different life zones in correspondence with the increase of the average annual temperature reported for each one. The metabolic footprints associated with the decomposition of organic matter (fungivores, bacterivores, and enrichment) had the strongest correlations. The proposition is that the increase in metabolic footprints while the temperature decreases, reflects a change in the dynamics of chemical and biological decomposition of organic matter and in the energy flow in the food networks.

The objective of this research was to determine the environmental conditions of green areas, using indicators as tool for urban management in two cities of Costa Rica. The study area corresponded to the districts of Heredia and Carmen, Costa Rica. The existing GA were determined using Rapid Eye satellite images, 2012 through spatial analysis and remote sensing. Eleven indicators of urban green areas were applied, the species was identified, the height, the diameter at breast height (DBH) and the number of trees in parks and streets were measured. In addition, surveys were conducted to users of public GA, on issues related to accessibility and use of GA. Five types of GA were identified in Carmen and six in Heredia. The percentage of public and private green areas corresponded to 36 % and 64 % in Carmen and 13 % and 87 % in Heredia respectively. The green area per capita (m2/hab) was 24.6 in Carmen and 2.7 in Heredia. Sixty-two species of trees were identified in the Carmen parks and 23 in Heredia. There were 1 105 trees of 61 species in the streets, sidewalks and avenues of Carmen and 278 individuals of 47 species in Heredia. Regarding the existence of riparian vegetation, it was determined that Pirro, Burrio, Torres and Negritos streams maintain 82, 51, 81 and 14 % of margin protection areas in conforming use. Eleven of the public GA’s were evaluated, nine presented a high physical accessibility. In both districts, the surveyed citizens indicated the necessity to have more GA, highlighting the recreational, ecological and touristic value of these spaces. It is concluded that the indicators of urban green areas showed that there are differences between the environmental conditions in both of the evaluated cities.

We analyzed the dendrochronological potential of Pinus oocarpa Schiede for reconstructing climatic variables in the Northwest portion of Lagunas de Montebello, Chiapas. We used a selective sampling approach and collected 65 increment cores from 34 trees. While our samples showed a high frequency of false rings (8 to 60 %), we were able to date 30 samples from 22 trees (46 %) using standard dendrochronological techniques and developed total chronologies for total ring width, earlywood, and latewood for a period of 91 years (1925-2015). We found a significant influence of mean precipitation and mean maximum and minimum temperature over the annual ring growth of P. oocarpa in the period 1961-2004. Our results show that winter-spring precipitation (January-May) was the most important for the species’ annual ring growth. However, we found the highest correlation between spring (March-May) precipitation and the earlywood chronology (r = 0.719, P < 0.05). The earlywood chronology also showed potential for reconstructing minimum temperatures (March to May) (r = 0.732, P < 0.05), while the latewood chronology had the potential for reconstructing the maximum temperature (September to January) (r = 0.714, P < 0.05).

Four-nested domains, d01, d02, d03 and d04 with a grid-resolution of 90 km, 30 km, 10 km, and 3.3 km respectively, were configured over this region. The runs were reinitialized every 5 days with 6 h of spin-up time for adjustment of the model. A total of eight experiments (four per month) were tested in order to study: a) two important Cumulus Parameterization Schemes (CPS): Kain-Fritsch (KF) and Grell-Devenyi (GD); and b) the physical interaction between nested domains (one-and two-way nesting), during each simulated month. The modeled precipitation was in agreement with observations for January 2000, and also captured the mean climate features of rainfall concerning magnitude, and spatial distribution, such as the particular precipitation contrast between the Pacific and the Caribbean coast. Outputs of the coarse domains (d01, d02, and d03) for September 2007 revealed differences between experiments within the domains when a visual comparison of the spatial distribution was made. However, for the inner grid (d04), all the experiments, showed a similar spatial distribution and magnitude estimation, mainly in those runs using one-way nesting configuration. The results for the month of September differed substantially with the observations, which could be related to associated deficiencies in the boundary condition that do not reproduce well the transition periods from warm to cold ENSO episodes for the selected periods of study. In all the experiments, the KF scheme calculated more precipitation than the GD scheme and it was associated to the ability of the GD scheme to reproduce spotty but intense rainfall, and apparently, this scheme was reluctant to activate, showing frequent events of low intensity rain. However, when rainfall did develop, it was very intense. Also, the time series did not replicate specific precipitation events. Thus, the 5-days integration period used in this study was not enough to reproduce short-period precipitation events. Finally, physical interaction issues between the nested domains were reflected in discontinuities in the precipitation field, which have been associated with mass field adjustment in the CPS.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Central america | Cumulus parameterization schemes | Dynamical downscaling | Reanalysis | Regional models,13567,Sida,A9-532,Styrelsen för Internationellt Utvecklingssamarbete,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,103

The Pacific continental margin of Costa Rica includes cold seeps that are inhabited by vesicomyid clams, which are expected to accumulate metals. Data on metals from cold seep clams are scarce. Thus, the objective of this study is to present the concentrations of Al, Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb, Mn, Ni, Sb and Zn in samples from seven clams, a mussel, sediment, and a rock, together with clam morphometric data. The bivalves (Archivesica sp.?) were collected in 2005 at a depth of 1 888 m on the Jaco Scar (09o06' N - 84o50' W) during DSRV Alvin dive 4 129. Metals were analyzed by Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (FAAS) and Graphite Furnace (GFAAS). Concentrations are in µg/g dry weight. The order of decreasing maximm concentrations and range in tissues of seven clams, were: Zn (43.4 - 266.3) > Fe (27.2 - 100.0) > Al (5.0 - 69.9) > Cd (0.1 - 12.2) > Sn (2.8 - 9.5) > Cu (4.0 - 7.3) > Mn (1.1 - 2.2) > Pb (0.2 - 0.8) > Ni (0.19 - 0.58).

Fe was below the range reported for hydrothermal vent clams, while concentrations of other metals were near the lower range. Fe, Cd, Mn, and Pb in mussel tissues were lower than those in mussels from hydrothermal vent sites, while Cu and Zn were within the range. Metals in the sediment and rock samples appeared very rich in certain metals like Al and Fe and very poor in others, such as Cd.

The main goal of the present study is to describe the abundances and distribution of the benthic fauna in the lower intertidal level of a sandy beach at Pacuare Reserve, Caribbean Coast, Costa Rica. The count data of five taxa (in 29 cores) was analyzed to determine their spatial distribution. Two species of polychaetes were found: the first, Scolelepis (Scolelepis) squamata (O. F. Mueller, 1806) was common in the center of the beach in an aggregated pattern. The second, Pisionidens indica (Aiyar & Alikunhi, 1940) was present in low densities with a random distribution pattern. Moreover, two isopods were found: Excirolana braziliensis Richardson, 1912 was randomly distributed along the beach while Ancinus brasiliensis Lemos de Castro, 1959 appeared only in two stations. A meiofaunal nemertean attached to grains of sand was the most common organism in the intertidal zone, showing a clumped pattern. The patches of abundance within the beach could be due to a morphologic change that imposes the influence of the strong surf conditions. Moreover, food resource distribution, niche partitioning or competition within the same tide level could influence the different patterns of distribution found in the sediment among the species.

The north Pacific of Costa Rica has been characterized as one of the best regions for the coral reefs development in the country. However, many of these ecosystems are being lost as a result of eutrophication, overfishing, invasive species and others impacts that affect the region. In the present study, live coral cover in the north Pacific was 5.0 ± 10.4(s.d.) %, with a domination in the ecosystems by turf algae. Twenty-six invertebrate taxa were registered in the region with the predominance of the sea urchin Diadema mexicanum. Ninety-four species of reef fish were identified. Snappers and some planktivores species were the groups with the highest frequency and abundance. The localities previously studied in the 1990 decade, presented a mean live coral cover between 40-50 %, whereby the actual state of the reef reflect a significant deterioration. This decline in coral cover is due to natural events like the El Niño, as well as the decrease in water quality in the region. In recent years, proliferations of the invasive seaweed Caulerpa sertularioides and high densities of bioerosive sea urchins have been reported, mainly associated with HAB events. Likewise, fish communities have low biomass, especially in the vicinity of fishing villages. The state of the reefs in the North Pacific is worrying and requires actions for its recovery and conservation, for which there must be better planning of the development of projects and activities on the coast.",14,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,Coastal alteration | El niño | Harmful algal bnooms | Invasive species | Overfishing,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,107

Composition, abundance, biomass, distribution and some ecological features of the zooplankton for each system is discussed. Pacific coastal zooplankton composition has been described in Bahía Salinas and Bahía Culebra. The local oceanography of these bays is heavily influenced by the Papagayo wind jet, which produces seasonal coastal upwelling and most likely drives the seasonal changes in zooplankton abundance and biomass. Copepods and ostracods were the dominant taxonomic groups throughout the year with a strong seasonality, furthermore 53 hydromedusae species has been found, where Liriope tetraphylla (Chamisso & Eysenhardt, 1821), Solmundella bitentaculata (Quoy & Gaimard, 1833) and Aglaura hemistoma (Péron & Lesueur, 1810), were the most abundant species. Zooplankton herbivory rates at Gulf of Nicoya estuary was estimated over 50 % removal of primary production. This is a typical value for tropical productive environments. Copepods numerically dominated zooplankton community from the Gulf of Nicoya. Other dominant taxa includes merozooplanktonic decapod larvae and ichthyoplankton. Biomass is high and there are strong crossshelf gradients in the Gulf. Zooplankton collected in the southern Pacific coast (close to Isla del Caño) is also dominated by copepods, while Bahía Coronado has a mixed zooplankton composition of oceanic and coastal transition waters. In Golfo Dulce, zooplankton is highly diverse and dominated by copepods, appendicularians, and ostracods. About 35 % of daily primary production is consumed by microzooplankton, and zooplankton adapt to anomalous conditions of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Coco´s Island, and other oceanic islands in the Eastern Tropical Pacific are “hot spot” of zooplankton diversity, where > 160 zooplankton species have been reported (predominantly copepods). The biomass is dominated by mesozooplankton, and new species records for the Eastern Tropical Pacific have been found in this insular ecosystem. In the other hand, early works of 1980 carried out at Caribbean coast (Cahuita National Park), show a considerably low zooplankton diversity and abundance while research at the end of the 2000 decade recognized a significant increase in zooplankton diversity, specially fish larvae. Recent zooplankton studies have added six new copepod species and several new records of species from different taxonomic groups such as appendicularians, amphipods, chaetognats, euphausiids, gastropods, and polychaetes. Future work should focus on monthly long-term monitoring programs to investigate the effects of ocean acidification and the trophic dynamics associated with fisheries. Alike, longterm studies are needed to see trends of change in planktonic communities, especially comparing areas under human activity in the coastal zone (tourism, port, urban development) with protected areas as targets for study. An increase of sampling efforts must be done in the relatively understudied Northern Caribbean coast.",2,Journal,re,Review,100,6,6,Abundance | Biomass | Composition | Ecology | Tropical East Pacific | Vertical migration,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,108

Despite the species’ economic importance, knowledge about its biology is limited, hindering the development of an appropriate management plan for a sustainable extraction of this resource. The goals of this study were to estimate the size at onset of maturity (SOM) and to describe the reproductive dynamics of S. agassizii in order to provide information that will help to establish a minimum legal landing size and a possible fishing closure during its reproductive period. A total of 4 273 specimens (2 175 females: 2 098 males) were analyzed between January 2007 and January 2008. The overall average size was 30.8 mm CL (carapace length), with females larger (32.4 ± 5.7 mm CL) than males (29.1 ± 4.0 mm CL). SOM was estimated with a logistic regression for females (SPM: size at physiological maturity) and as the breakpoint in the CL-TL (total length) regression for both sexes (SMM: size at morphological maturity). Males reached the SMM at a larger size (32.4 mm CL) than females (30.3 mm CL), whereas the SPM for females was 37.8 mm CL. The percentages of specimens caught below the estimated SMM were 77.4 % (males) and 52.1 % (females), whereas 79.2 % of the females were below the estimated SPM. Mature females were obtained on a monthly basis, indicating a continuous reproduction of S. agassizii with peaks between July and October. These peaks coincide with months with high precipitation and coastal upwelling. In 2013, Costa Rica prohibited the granting of new commercial shrimp trawl licenses, as well as the renewal of existing licenses. Consequently, unless the sustainability of this fishery is scientifically proven, all existing licenses will expire in 2018. The results of this study indicate that the current fishery of S. agassizii in the Pacific coast of Costa Rica is not sustainable. Hence, the assessment of mesh selectivity for this fishery - to ascertain catches were the average size caught is equal to or greater than the SOM - is urgent, as well as the establishment of a MLS of 112.6 mm TL (37.8 mm CL) and a fishing closure period in June and July. These recommendations aim to protect the spawning population and immature individuals of S. agassizii. Nevertheless, it is recommended to study the viability of employing alternative fishing gears to reduce the percentage of immature individuals captured and to avoid an overexploitation of the resource.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Deep-water fishery | Eastern Tropical Pacific | Reproduction | Size at onset of sexual maturity | Trawl,13567,UCR,111-A4-508,Universidad de Costa Rica,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,113

Turnover was dominated by the loss of species rather than gain; the higher species loss was registered between the river mouth and the lower river reach (< 100 m.a.s.l.). Seven species can be classified as typical or core species (Astyanax aeneus, Sicydium altum, Agonostomus monticola, Poecilia gillii, Brycon costaricensis, Rhamdia laticauda and Joturus pichardi) along the elevation gradient. The habitat availability and the integration of ecomorphological, feeding and reproductive traits help to explain better the elevation distribution of the complete set of species observed. Although it is possible to identify groups of species characteristic of each reach of river, this does not mean that they are isolated from each other. Natural drift and movement along the river of some species during their life cycle, especially S. altum, A. monticola and J. pichardi, are key processes linking the whole watershed. The present study constitutes a first step in documenting and understanding the distribution and composition of fish assemblages in a watershed that is relatively intact and well-conserved in the Caribbean versant of Costa Rica.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Caribbean versant | Elevation gradient | Freshwater fishes | Pacuare River,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,114

Understanding the dynamics of these meadows is urgent in order to establish adequate management and conservation strategies. Here, we analyzed the current knowledge on the seagrass meadows in the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Costa Rica, Central America.

We report a total of five genera and seven species for Costa Rica: Thalassia testudinum, Syringodium filiforme, Halophila decipiens, Halophila baillonis, Halodule wrightii, Halodule beaudettei, and Ruppia maritima. Six species are reported for the Caribbean, and four species for the Pacific. Thalassia testudinum, S. filiforme, and H. decipiens have only been reported for the Caribbean. Halodule beaudettei has only been reported for the Pacific coast. Halophila baillonis, H. wrightii and R. maritima have been reported for both coasts. Seagrasses were found at a total of 31 locations in Costa Rica, most from the Pacific coast; 16 of which are reported here for the first time. Seagrass meadows from both coasts are vastly different. Along the Caribbean coast, meadows are often dominated by the robust T. testudinum, they are extensive and stable, persisting for decades. In contrast, the meadows along the Pacific coast are more dynamic and are dominated by pioneer and smaller ephemeral species, such as H. baillonis and H. beaudettei. The number of studies on Costa Rican seagrasses is scarce but has been increasing over time, and mostly concern taxonomic reports and basic descriptions of the dynamics of T. testudinum meadows from the Caribbean.

This comparison expects to identify changes that could be attributed to incipient effects of global climate change. We studied the limnology and conditions of its drainage area for three years (2013-2016) to compare with previous data. Vertical profiles of temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, chlorophyll a, dissolved H2S were performed several times per year, for a total of 22 samplings. Aerial photographs taken since 1950 were analyzed to describe land use changes. The lake had a shallow Secchi depth (< 5 m) at all times. It was stratified on all occasions, with a thermocline that fluctuated between 10 and 20 m. It has a monimolimnion, with a chemocline at 14 to 22 m. Below the chemocline it was always anoxic, and during annual partial mixing events in the mixolimnion, oxygen levels decreased compared to stratified periods. There was a continuous presence of H2S from 20 m downwards, with annual fluctuations, being lower during partial mixing events. A peak in chlorophyll was detected on all occasions just below the thermocline. Land use around the lake hasn’t changed much since 1952, when only a rim of tree cover was left around the steep margins of the lake. The lake has maintained its limnological characteristics, with the only exception that it didn’t cooled down to historical levels.

In Mexico, A. danaeifolium grows further in land wet soils and is much more common than A. aureum, which is typically found in brackish or saline habitats near the coast, and is restricted to coastal saline mangrove communities. The purpose of this paper was to describe and compare the morphogenesis of the sexual phase of A. aureum and A. danaeifolium for systematic purposes. For this, spores of each species were sown in Petri dishes with agar, previously enriched with sterilized Thompson’s medium. To avoid contamination and dehydration, the dishes were kept in transparent plastic bags under laboratory conditions. For the micro-morphological observation with SEM, the gametophyte development phases were fixed in FAA with 0.8 % sucrose for 24 h. Photomicrographs of spores, development stages of gametophytes and young sporo-phytes were observed with scanning electron microscope. Our results showed that the spores of both species are triletes, globose and positive photoblastic. Germination is Vittaria-type; the germinate filaments are short and uniseriate (5 to 7 cells), and prothallial development is Ceratopteris-type. The adult gametophytes of both species have asymmetrical wings. Adult gametophytes in culture are cordiform-spatulate. Antheridia have a broad basal cell, an annular cell, and an asymmetric opercular cell. Archegonia have short necks and four triangular cells at the mouth of the neck. The first leaf of the sporophyte is lobed, with dichotomous veins and anomocytic stomata. The gemmae are formed in adult gametophytes in both species. The development of the gametophyte of A. aureum, A. danaeifolium and A. speciosum share many similarities such as the development of a lateral meristem, asymmetric nature of the mature prothallus, lack of hairs on the prothallus, and undivided asymmetrical opercular antheridia morphology.

Shrimp farming is an aquaculture activity taking place along the tropical Pacific coast of the Americas, and represents the most important culture business of Northwestern Mexico. In this study, wild and farmed whiteleg shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei from the State of Sinaloa were genetically evaluated to determine admixture levels. A newly developed set of 14 microsatellite markers (mean number of alleles per locus 11.8, and 0.836 expected heterozygosity) was obtained by Next Generation Sequencing to characterize samples. Sampling consisted of 32 wild shrimps collected during three years (2002, 2012, and 2013) and three different sites, and two hatchery stocks from 2007. No significant differences were observed among years in the wild samples, but cluster analyses showed that hatchery-produced individuals were different from wild specimens. Deviations from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium and genotype assignment tests indicated that a fraction from each sample could contain individuals from hatchery origin. Even though the estimated fraction of escaped farmed individuals in the most recent samples (2012-2013; mean = 7.1 %) is considered of low genetic risk, management recommendations for hatcheries and farms were provided.

Podonomopsis was represented only by one species, P. illiesi, only found in high altitude rivers in Perú (above 3 500 masl). Morphotypes richness and abundance of Parochlus were higher in rivers from Ecuador and Colombia (P. incaicus, Parochlus sp. 1 and Parochlus sp. 2 were the most common species). Conversely, Podonomus was more diverse and abundant in rivers from Perú (P. caran-qui, P. fittkaui and P. fastigians were the most common species). We found a clear pattern of distribution of morphotypes in the latitudinal gradient. First, we confirmed an evident decrease in the morphotypes richness in relation to the South Andes. Second, we found species such as Podomopsis illiesi, Podonomus fittkaui and Podomus fastigians that only were present in Perú, but not in Ecuador and Colombia.

We sequenced the DNA of 153 muscle samples collected from specimens obtained from six fishing ports. The results showed 21 haplotypes for COI and 116 haplotypes for the control region, divided into two lineages that do not exhibit a pattern of geographical distribution. For mitochondrial control region, the estimated haplotype diversity (Hd) presented relatively high values (Hd= 0.99 and = 0.1), while for COI results were Hd = 0.68 and = 0.01; the relationship between haplotype and nucleotide diversity and the neutrality test revealed that C. hippos experienced bottlenecking and a subsequent rapid population expansion. Estimates of genetic structure were low and insignificant, indicating no differentiation between samples collected from geographical isolation. This suggests that for the Colombian Caribbean there is a panmictic population of C. hippos. However, variations were found at population levels, especially in La Guajira, Turbo and San Antero, which, when compared to those included for Brazil and México, demonstrated that unique haplotypes in La Guajira are more aligned to the Brazilian populations, by means of the influence of the Caribbean Current, whilst those from Turbo and San Antero are more frequent in haplotypes originating from Mexico.

In addition to transport, preliminary observations suggest that the ants provide masses of scraped parenchyma (possibly fertilized with feces) as a substrate for bacteria upon which the nematodes presumably feed. We also found S. neotropicalis associated with Azteca in another myrmecophyte, Cordia alliodora, suggesting that this ant/nematode association is not restricted to Cecropia.

Particularly, the study of the spider fauna in the North of Argentina is scarce in ecoregions with priority interests of conservation. Generally, spiders are used as indicators to compare biodiversity patterns, and here we tested whether the spider family-level can act as a substitute of the species-level in biodiversity rapid assessments. For this, we analyzed the alpha and beta diversity of the epigeal spider communities in three separate sites of three ecoregions of Salta province (Chaco Serrano, Monte de Sierras and Bolsones, and Puna), during the fall, winter, spring and summer of 2005-2007. In each site, 10 pitfall traps, located along a linear transect and 10 meters apart, were placed for seven days per season of continuous activity.

Alpha and beta diversity showed that ecoregional spider communities were different, sharing few species (0.7 %). The Chaco reported a high dissimilarity of its assemblage with respect to the other ecoregions. The colder seasons (autumn and winter) are important in assessing the diversity of spiders, contributing to regional diversity in conjunction with the diversity of warm seasons (spring and summer). Four guilds were reported (ground hunters, specialists, other hunters and ambush hunters), but the latter was absent in Monte, and the specialists dominated Chaco. Zodariidae was dominant in Chaco Serrano, where Leprolochus birabeni is an indicator of native environments. On the other hand, Lycosidae, Philodromidae, Anyphaenidae and Oonopidae were important for Monte and Puna.

Our results demonstrated that the spatial distribution of gaps was random. Various gap attributes were strongly associated with gap size. The number of tree species per stem at the gap edge was negatively correlated to the gap size. Gap sizes up to 50 m2 were mostly sufficient to generate tree species-rich forest stands. Assuming that our results were representative for an old-growth neotropical rainforest in Ecuador, our study remarks the following management recommendations: 1) Rainforests have a very complex spatial and diversity structure and logging activities should preferably be omitted because of adverse effects. 2) If logging is inevitable, this should mimic a random choice of trees and tree species, to prevent special selection of tree dimension and species; and a random distribution of trees to be logged, to produce gaps smaller than 50 m2 and never larger than 400 m2. Additionally, we suggest cutting not more than 5 % of the tree biomass per 10-20 years period, to preclude stronger alterations of ecosystem processes, and the reduction of existing dead wood from the ecosystem.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Agglomerative approach | Gap size | Gini evenness index | Size differentiation | Species mingling | Sørensen similarity index,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,139

Laboratory bioassays involved increasing concentrations of the crude extract (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.2 and 10.0 % w/v) as well as each one of the partitions (in accordance to the yield obtained from the partitioning process). A randomized complete block design, with four replicates, was used.

In addition, a single bioassay was performed to compare a single concentration (0.38 % w/v) of the alkaloid scopolamine, which reduced consumption in 90 % with respect to the controls. Also, mortality and sublethal effects were assessed in larvae exposed to the crude extract, the hexane partition and scopolamine, with no evidence for them, which confirmed their phagodeterrence. Moreover, the crude extract was submitted to a phytochemical screening by means of a number of qualitative tests, which showed that alkaloids, tannins, triterpenes and cumarins were the most important secondary metabolites. Finally, the presence of scopolamine was confirmed in both the crude extract and the hexane partition, by means of the gas chromatography-spectrometry (GC-MS) analytical method.

Additionally, they are appreciated for their potential to restore tropical environments; hence, the objective of this study was to model the present and potential distribution of these taxa. In 2014, species registers were obtained from two databases (CONABIO and MEXU); each register was taxonomically, geographically and statistically validated. Once validated, the present and potential distribution of M. aculeaticarpa var. aculeaticarpa (based on 99 registers) and M. luisana (based on 50 registers) were obtained using the MAXENT algorithm.

In this study, we investigated the effect of macroinvertebrate exclusion on leaf breakdown rates in two upland streams in Colombia. The study was carried out between January and April of 2009, including the dry season and the beginning of the wet season. We measured leaf mass loss using coarse- (15 mm; accessible to macroinvertebrates) and fine- (200 µm; macroinvertebrates excluded) mesh litter bags that were anchored with wood stakes to the bottom of each stream and recovered after 7, 14, 21, 28, and 56 days. We selected leaves from two dominant plant species and used three leaf treatments: two single species (Palicourea cuatrecasasii and Critoniopsis ursicola) and mixed-species (P. cuatrecasasii and C. ursicola). We compared leaf breakdown rates between the Peña Bonita and Marianela stream, mesh-sizes, and leaf treatments. Macroinvertebrates that colonized the litter bags were measured for density and biomass and categorized in functional feeding groups. In general, there were no significant differences in breakdown rates between the streams and the mesh-sizes. In contrast, leaf breakdown rates had significant differences between all leaf species, where C. ursicola had higher breakdown rates than mixed-species, and P. cuatrecasasii. Macroinvertebrate exclusion did not affect leaf breakdown rates and their assemblages were composed by high densities of collectors (mainly Chironomidae) and few shredders with a large body size. The similar macroinvertebrate colonization between leaf species, the relatively slow breakdown rates, and the shredder scarcity, suggest that leaves were a refractory substrate.

These systems reduce native biodiversity and its associated ecosystem services. Simultaneously, shaded coffee plantations operate as potential shelter of such biodiversity, favoring its dispersal in the landscape, because they offer high-quality habitat for the movement of wild organisms through natural vegetation relicts. Therefore, it is important to document its biological value. In Colombia, Cauca department is the fourth coffee producer and although its cultures were mainly based on the model of using trees’ shade on coffee shrubs, in last 10 years, sun coffee plantations have doubled their extension in this department and have almost equated the shaded coffee extension. Thus, it is necessary to document if these land use changes at landscape scale may derivate in consequences for the wild biota dwelling these productive systems. Given the above considerations, and in order to test for the biological importance of coffee plantations, the present study compares the effect of three land uses (sun coffee, shaded coffee and natural vegetation patches; eight of each one) in terms of ants’ species richness and the abundance of their trophic guilds at Caldono municipality, between August 2015 and January 2016. Captures were carried out with pitfall traps, mini-Winkler sacs and direct capture. We found that ants’ richness was higher in natural vegetation patches, followed by shaded coffee plantations and sun coffee plantations, in these last ones, the omnivore-generalist ants were more abundant, and ground-foraging arboreal ants were less abundant. We found that shaded coffee plantations, despite belonging to a transformed land use, have greater similarity with some natural vegetation patches. Using only ants from the lowest stratum (soil and understory), our findings confirm that shaded coffee plantations maintain an important part of the ant diversity of the locality, while sun coffee plantations offer less habitat quality to it.

In six representative sites of each system we set up three parallel 80 m line-transects, separated by a distance of 25 m. Each coffee farm and forest fragment (FR) was surveyed during 1.5 hours to record butterflies. All sites were sampled once a month from May to July 2007. We obtained 4.5 hours of sampling/ site, and 27 hours of sampling/habitat. Both CP and CPM together had a butterflies’ species composition which differed from CPL and FR. The indicator species of both CP and CPM together were Hermeuptychia hermes and Anartia jatrophae which are typical of open areas. CPL resulted with the species of secondary forests Heliconius erato petiverana and Pareuptychia ocirrhoe as indicators. In contrast, FR resulted with several indicator species typical of closed canopy forests such as Pierella helvina incanescens, Caligo eurilochus, and Morpho peleides limpida. Moreover, the richness of species was similar among coffee AFS. Furthermore, the richness of species of each coffee AFS was lower in comparison with FR. However, among coffee AFS, CPL harbored higher diversity (Exp(H’)) of forest butterflies than CP. Also, CPM was higher in abundance of frugivorous butterflies in relation with CP and CPL. In fragmented forests, coffee farms with exotic shade species combined at least with a native tree or fruit species, can be a better habitat for forest butterflies than those dominated by an exotic monospecific shade.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Agroforestry systems | Coffee matrix | Guilds | Habitat preferences | Indicator species | Papilionoidea,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,151

The present work was carried out to evaluate the seasonal population fluctuation of S. p. piceifrons and vegetation diversity and their association with weather factors and edaphic conditions in the gregarious zone of the Yucatán Península. The study was performed in seven sites during three seasons: North-wind (December 2013), rainy (June 2014) and dry (April 2014). The locust density was sampled in transect of 100 m2, as well as the vegetation in 16 m2: plant species richness (PSR) and relative species density (RSD), and analyzed by generalized linear models. Additionally, soil samples were obtained at 10 cm depth into a 4 × 6 m quadrat, land use in the sites was classified and temperature, precipitation and evaporation of each site were obtained from the database and they were analyzed with multiple factor analysis. The population density of S. p. piceifrons was higher in the sites Panaba, Tizimin, Tunkas and Cenotillo (F= 74.3, P < 0.0001). Characterization of vegetation showed that PSR and RSD were higher during the rainy season relative to those in the dry season (F= 50.4, P < 0.0001). RSD was identified as the most important group associated with locust density (0.86), followed by isotherm/isohyets (0.63), maximum precipitation and temperature (0.60), as well as the land use (0.65); no correlation between locust density and soil characteristics was found. Locust density was positively correlated with the abundance of the grass Panicum maximum (Sr2= 0.85, PC5= 0.87). This work shows that the population of S. p. piceifrons is high in the rainy season and influenced primarily by the abundance of the grass P. maximum and the precipitation. The results indicate that surveys for early detection and control of the locust on the Yucatán Península can focus on areas with the grass P. maximum to predict risk areas and target survey efforts.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Locust density | Plant community | Plant-insect interaction | Soil conditions | Weather factors,13567,NWC,169452,National Water Commission,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,152

The objective of this study was to analyze the diversity indices of these fish communities potentially affected by lionfish predation and to compare with pre-invasion data. The study was undertaken in two Caribbean marine protected areas (MPAs): Guanahacabibes National Park (PNG) in W Cuba and Xcalak Reefs National Park (PNAX) in S Quintana Roo. We carried out visual censuses of fish species in reef habitats during the dry and rainy seasons of the period 2013-2015. For this, nine sites were defined and evaluated using stationary counts. Our results showed higher species richness (43.47 ± 5.14) and mean abundance (0.76 ± 1.25) in PNG than in PNAX (40.22 ± 4.96, 0.19 ± 0.46, respectively). Diversity decreased after the arrival of lionfish in a single site of PNG and in two sites of the PNAX, but apparently, these results are more related to the fishing activity effect than to the lionfish presence. Based on the results and assuming that changes in the native fish communities by lionfish may not yet be detected, we recommend to continue the monitoring community descriptions in order to detect future changes in native fish communities.",9,Journal,ar,Article,100,12,12,Coral reef | Diversity | Invasive species | Marine fishes | Predator effects,13567,NA,undefined,Idea Wild,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,153
