Infra-red photography and LANDSAT imagery have been used to examine their interrelationships. The importance of surface drainage in the maintenance of mire patterns is suggested by the localized effects of drainage ditches on the vegetation and landforms. Water flow is channelled across broad surfaces of peat to initiate the development of water tracks, bog drains, and islands that have an ovoid, horseshoe or teardrop shape. -from Authors",181,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,1

Nutrient compartmentation,Marrs R.,Journal of Ecology,00220477,69,1,163-169,1981-01-01,1981,10.2307/2259823,"The compartmentation of organic matter and nutrients in a successional series of naturally-colonized china clay workings was studied. Organic matter and nutrients accumulated in plant, root, litter and soil (except for potassium and phosphorus in the soil). Ecosystem development was, therefore, not driven solely by redistribution of soil nutrients to the developing vegetation. The importance of nutrient cycling, and the amounts of nutrients in each compartment is discussed in relation to the successional development of ecosystems on these wastes. The soil, although the largest store of most elements, contains a much lower proportion of the total nutrients than it does in most other well-developed ecosystems, and this may be a characteristic feature of new and developing ecosystems. It is suggested that the nitrogen content in the soil must reach 700 kg ha-1 before non-leguminous trees and shrubs, such as Salix atrocinerea, can invade. The relevance of this for reclamation schemes is noted.",23,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,2
