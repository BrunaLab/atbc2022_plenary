The models are based on simplified assumptions concerning planktonic and benthic predation and the relations between egg size and method of larval nutrition and between egg size and duration of larval life. The model's predictions include: only the extremes of the possible range of egg size and method of nutrition (i.e., planktotrophy, lecithotrophy) are evolutionarily stable; over a certain range of environmental parameters, the 2 developmental modes are both evolutionarily stable; planktotrophy is more efficient than lecithotrophy when planktonic food is abundant and planktonic predation low, and lecithotrophy more efficient when either or both of these conditions is reversed; and benthic prefeeding development results in greater efficiency when lecithotrophic development time is long and/or planktonic predation more intense than benthic predation, and planktonic prefeeding development is more efficient when these conditions are reversed.",453,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA

The primary difference is the introduction of the possibility of starvation by feeding planktonic larvae. The introduction of starvation changes none of the qualitative conclusions of the earlier models: only completely planktotrophic and completely lecithotrophic larvae can exhibit maximum reproductive efficiency; in any one environment one mode is likely to be more efficient than the other, and in some environments the evolutionary stability of both forms is possible. These conclusions concern both developmental patterns with planktonic and with benthic prefeeding development. The degree of a larva's susceptibility to starvation affects relative efficiency of planktotrophic and lecithotrophic development. Larvae which can withstand only short periods of food deprivation during the feeding phase are more likely to evolve lecithotrophy than larvae which can survive longer periods. This starvation effect is probably more pronounced in forms with planktonic prefeeding development.",139,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA

Size and shape components of anthropometric differences among Yanomama Indian villages,Spielman R.,American Naturalist,00030147,107,957,694-708,1973-01-01,1973,10.1086/282868,"This study of anthropometric resemblance between men and women from the same and different villages shows the significance of the distinction between differences in size and differences of shape. Expecting that it might be possible in spite of size differences to detect similarity of shape between men and women from the same local population, the author develops a partition of Mahalanobis' D2 into size and shape components and illustrates it with a geometric example. The partition is used with anthropometric data on men and women for 11 villages of the Yanomama Indians, and results are presented in an analysis of variance, modified to accommodate multidimensional observations. The analysis demonstrates that once gross size differences have been partitioned out, men and women from the same village are morphologically (i.e., in shape) more similar than men and women from different villages. It is inferred that this observation of within group similarity for anthropometric data is a counterpart to the known genetic differentiation among Yanomama villages.",19,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,5,NA

This analysis showed that the α esterases conform to a four locus model with a high frequency of a null allele at each locus. Over 90% of the flies had an active esterase produced at only three or four of the possible eight loci; 75% of the chromosomes had two active alleles, presumably the optimum number. Extremely similar frequency distributions of the common allozymes were observed in all populations studied and over 3 years. From this analysis the frequencies of chromosomes of different allozyme types could be calculated. From these chromosome frequencies the probability of an active or a null allele at each locus was calculated. This, in turn, allowed determination of whether the presence of an active or null allele at one locus was independent of the activity at another locus. Analysis indicates extreme linkage disequilibrium between the lumped active and null alleles of loci 1 and 2, and between loci 3 and 4, the nature of the disequilibrium being the presence of an excess of chromosomes with an active allele at either locus 1 or 2 and an active allele at either locus 3 or 4. It is postulated that loci 1 and 2 specify one essential esterase (Ex) and loci 3 and 4 another (Ey). A crossover study showed that the four loci were located within a total distance of less than 1 centimorgan, and that their linear order was 1,3,2,4. Linkage disequilibrium occurred between alleles of all pairs of loci except between alleles of the outer pairs (1-3 and 2-4), which were in linkage equilibrium. The polymorphism observed between active and null esterase alleles appears to be the result of two selective balancing forces: a chromosome with only two of the four loci active has a selective advantage; there is an advantage to a chromosome which produces both essential esterases, one produced by locus 1 or 2 and the other by locus 3 or 4. It is postulated that the four loci are evolutionarily related through a process of duplication of the original locus, then divergence in activity, followed by a tandem duplication of the previous duplication, to give the present genetic constitution 1(Ex) 3(Ey) 2(Ex) 4(Ey).",25,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,8,NA
