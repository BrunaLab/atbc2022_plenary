Objective: To define a potential diagnostic protocol to increase testing capacity in current and post-pandemic conditions. Methods: We reviewed the literature, patents and commercial applications, for alternatives. Results: We found a good potential in saliva samples, viral inactivation and quick RNA extraction by heating; the use of an isothermal technology such as loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and naked eye test-result visualization by in-tube colorimetry or turbidity.

Objective: To visually quantify threats to marine mammals in Colombia, and to identify mitigation actions. Methods: We georeferenced threats based on the literature, covering 35 species in the period 1991-2020, and superimposed them on species range maps. Results: 22 species had at least one threat. Bycatch and interactions with fishing gear affected 16 species, followed by direct capture (8 species), vessel traffic/transit (6 species) and alteration of ocean physics (6 spe-cies). The most affected species, in terms of the greatest diversity of threats, are: humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae), Caribbean West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), marine tucuxi (Sotalia guianensis) and bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus). Nearly all of Colombia’s marine territory presents some degree of risk for marine mammals. High-risk areas are Buenaventura, Guapi, Cupica Gulf and Tumaco in the Pacific; and Urabá Gulf, Darién Gulf, Morrosquillo Gulf, off Barranquilla, Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta and Coquivacoa Gulf in the Caribbean. Conclusion: Marine mammals in Colombia are currently at risk due to several threats, especially related to fish-ing, hunting/capture and shipping activities, mainly in coastal areas.

Objective: To describe histological and cytological characteristics of Porites panamensis larvae. Methods: During August-July 2019, at Islas Marias Biosphere Reserve, Central Mexican Pacific, we made 14 collections of coral larvae and identified the species with cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 gene. We used a scan-ning electron microscope and other techniques. Results: The ectoderm was composed by heterogeneous, mono-ciliated, columnar epithelial cells. Nematocysts were clustered at the oral pole of the ectoderm, and cells were evident in the aboral pole of the ectoderm gland. The endoderm had secretory cells, lipids and symbionts.

Objective: Evaluate the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and identify the fatty acids of the methanolic extract of the marine sponge Tetilla rodriguesi collected in Cispatá bay, Colombian Caribbean. Methods: T. rodriguesi specimens were subjected to extraction to obtain the methanolic extract, of which the fatty acids were obtained, esterified and identified it using chromatographic techniques. With the methanolic extract, the antioxidant activity was carried out against the radicals ABTS+• and DPPH•, and the antimicrobial activity by the microdilution method against reference strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans; in addition to clinical isolates of Candida albicans (obtained in blood) and Candida krusei (obtained in catheter). Result: The results yielded the identification of 19 fatty acids of different nature. In the analysis of the antioxidant activity could be found that inhibition of radical evaluated was moderate (296.98 ppm for ABTS+• and 3 523.62 ppm for DPPH•). The evaluation of antimicrobial activity showed that the methanol extract of T. rodriguesi managed to greatly reduce the growth of all microorganisms tested. Conclusions: Despite the fact that porifers tend to have large fatty acids, in this study the presence of fatty acids with a carbon chain greater than 20 members was not found. The result of antioxidant activity is largely resembled that found in other species of the same phylum.

Modularity refers to the degree of compartmentalization of food webs and varies between-1 and 1. A network with a modular-ity value close to 1 is resilient to disturbances and can be interpreted as an indicating factor for the stability of communities. Objective: In this study, we analyzed the trophic structure of benthic macroinvertebrates in La Nitrera stream, the San Juan River, and the Cauca River in the Colombian Andes. Methods: The study was supported by ecological networking techniques using Gephi software. We studied nine sites in dry, rainy, and transition seasons in 2017 and 2018, monitoring changes in the altitude gradient. At each of the sites, the organisms were captured and determined, and physicochemical and hydraulic information was obtained. Results: The variance component analysis allowed to explain the variability of the data by relating the following environmental variables: FFG, diversity, richness, modularity, season, and time. Simple multifactorial ANOVA indicated that significant changes in FFG were associated with altitude, and modularity to time. The allocation of the FFG was done by stomach analysis and secondary information. Conclusion: The transition season had the highest modularity, possibly due to the recolonization of some biotopes caused by the decrease in the velocity of water currents. La Nitrera and San Juan presented higher values than the Cauca, which may indicate that the altitudinal change and velocity of water currents affects the compartmentalization of the network.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,altitudinal gradient | invertebrate trophic structure | modularity | network analysis | stomach analysis,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,5,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

These effects are well documented in neotropical lowland forests but have been studied little in Andean forests. Objective: To evaluate how the attributes of the dung beetle assemblages and three of their ecological functions differ in three types of vegetation cover, and to determine the relationships between attributes and functions, and among functions. Methods: Dung beetles were captured with pitfall traps, and ecological functions were measured through a field experiment in the farm “El Ocaso” (Colombia), in three types of vegetation cover: secondary forest, mixed forest and cattle pasture (three independent sites per cover). The assemblage attributes that were evaluated were abundance, number of species, biomass, and weighted mean body length; functions measured were dung removal, soil excavation, and secondary seed dispersal. Results: It was found that both the assemblage attributes and the ecological functions were negatively affected in the more disturbed vegetation covers, particularly in cattle pastures. Most of the assemblage attributes correlated positively with functions; soil excavation and secondary seed dispersal had a strong positive correlation with dung removal. Conclusions: Dung beetle assemblages play important ecological functions and they are sensitive to ecosystem disturbances.

Objective: In order to contribute to this discussion, we analyzed how the bait amount and pitfall trap operating time influence the collection effectiveness of dung beetles in a TDF fragment at Reserva Campesina La Flecha, San Jacinto, Colombia. Methods: For the collection of beetles, we utilized pitfall traps baited with three different amounts of attractants: small (34.6 g), medium (53.8 g), and large (114.9 g), which remained active in the field for 48 h., 4 samplings between March and September 2015 were carried out, covering both, dry and rainy seasons. Results: A total of 4 563 individuals were recorded, grouped into 10 genera and 27 species of dung beetles. The highest values of richness, abundance and biomass were registered in the large bait, at 48 h, during the rainy season. However, the trap operating time had no effect on the estimation of beetles’ richness, abundance, and biomass, regardless of bait sizes. The three diversity orders (0D,1D y2D) showed similar values between the bait amounts during rainy season, but in the dry season, the largest baits displayed the highest diversity values. On the other hand, with the largest bait, significantly more richness, abundance, and biomass of small and large body beetles were registered, especially during the dry season. Conclusions: The results of this research show that, for the study of beetles’ assemblages in the BST, the use of a larger bait contributes to a better estimate of richness, abundance, diversity and biomass, especially during the dry season, when environmental conditions promote a more rapidly loss of baits attractiveness.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,attractant size | capture technique | diversity | experimental design | seasonal variation,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,7,all,All Open Access,NA,NA
