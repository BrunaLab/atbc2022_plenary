Under classical competition theory, increased ecological variability can, in many cases, be an advantage to individual sexual genotypes and to the sexual species as a whole. Although asexuality confers an advantage, it is much less than a 2-fold advantage because minor increases in the overall species niche width of the sexual species will offset the reproductive advantage of the asexual species. This occurs since 1) an increase in species niche width increases the resource base of the sexual species, and 2) to the extent that the increase in niche width is due to increased differences between individuals, a reduction in intraspecific competition will result. The prime conditions that enable sexual species to stably coexist with or even supplant an asexual sister species are: 1) relatively high between-genotype (but within-species) niche differentiation; 2) significant niche differences between the species; 3) low environmental variance; 4) severe resource exploitation; 5) larger within-phenotype niche width in the sexual species than in the asexual species.-from Authors",108,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,33,all,All Open Access

The reaction norm for maturation should take 1 of at least 4 shapes that depend on specific relations between changes in growth rates and changes in adult mortality rates, juvenile mortality rates, or both. Most organisms should mature neither at a fixed size nor at a fixed age, but along an age-size trajectory. The model makes possible a clear distinction between the genetic and phenotypic components of variation. The evolved response to selection is reflected in the shape and position of the reaction norm.
