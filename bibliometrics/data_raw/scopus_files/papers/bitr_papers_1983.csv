Most seedlings produced at all sites were secondary species or weeds of the forest margins. The characteristic abundance of some secondary species at one or two sites could be explained usually in terms of the prevalence of those species in the standing rainforest on the sites. Only a few large-seeded primary forest species were germinated; most of these were fruiting at the time of sampling. The absence of many primary forest trees from the seed banks can be explained by the obligately quick-germinating, short-lived nature of their seeds. The large size of the potentially longer-lived seeds of some primary forest species was important in preventing their incorporation in the soil profile and, hence, affecting their susceptibility to predation and longevity on the forest floor.-from Authors",82,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,29,NA,NA
