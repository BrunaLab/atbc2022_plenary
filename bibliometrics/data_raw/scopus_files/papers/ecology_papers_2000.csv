We present results from a study of ecological mechanisms to explain parapatry in closely related species. These include competition, spatially varying performances, and dispersal that depends on the densities of both species. We use a model consisting of two coupled nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations with density-dependent diffusion terms and space-dependent Lotka-Volterra-like competing interaction terms. The model is analyzed by using a mixture of phase-plane analysis and numerical simulations. Results show that competition and dispersal can lead to completely segregated species ranges. Spatial variation favored and provided stability to parapatric distribution. Parapatry occurred under several conditions, including when both species were identical in dispersal, intrinsic rate of growth, and competition but differed in their spatial performances. Results indicate that overlapping distributions and parapatry are equally expected for close species. Moreover, similar species in parapatry tend to exhibit equivalent range sizes. This model explains how species can coexist regionally while maintaining spatial exclusion. It also describes how a species that is rare in distribution can invade the range of a similar and widespread species. We discuss the limitations of using present species distributions for recognizing modes of speciation, and we suggest studying more extensively the relationship between density-dependent dispersal and interspecific competition.

Ants and an egg-loaded bug were enclosed with an unloaded bug, with a mating pair, or with a mating pair and an unloaded bug. Both mating and egg carrying increased predation risk. Mating increased predation risk because mating pairs were attacked more often than single egg-loaded bugs. When a mating pair was enclosed with an egg-loaded bug and an unloaded bug, the pair was attacked significantly more often than the two single individuals together, even though ant visitation rates did not differ among prey items. Ants attacked egg-loaded bugs significantly more often than unloaded bugs. Egg-loaded individuals suffered lower predation risks when in the presence of a mating pair than when in the presence of a single unloaded bug. Thus, predation risk depends on the mating status of nearby individuals.

Since the causality of the relationship was unknown, we simultaneously manipulated both hen flea (Ceratophyllus gallinae) infestation and nest humidity in order to investigate: (1) the effect of flea infestation on nest humidity, (2) the effect of nest humidity on the prevalence of flea infestations, (3) the effect of nest humidity on adult flea survival and reproduction, (4) the interaction between flea infestations and nest humidity on Great Tit reproductive performance, and (5) the effect of both factors on secondary infestations by ectoparasitic Protocalliphora flies. The present study provides the first example of an ectoparasite acting as a physical ecosystem engineer where nest humidity increased as a result of flea infestations. In experimentally uninfested nests, infestation of hosts by immigrant fleas was more frequent in nests with reduced humidity. In experimentally infested nests, manipulation of humidity did not significantly affect the number of adult fleas or larvae. Hen flea infestation reduced Great Tit nestling body mass, tarsus length, and wing length, as well as the number of young fledged. The detrimental effect of the fleas on Great Tit reproduction was not altered by our modifications of nest humidity. The effect of fleas on nestling growth parameters and the number young fledged did not vary significantly with the seasonal decrease in reproductive performance of the birds, or with the number of young in the brood. The prevalence of secondary infestations by Protocalliphora was higher in nests with reduced humidity, and in nests experimentally infested with fleas. The numbers of Protocalliphora pupae were lower in flea-infested nests.

In general, pairs and broods used and avoided the same lakes, but in both study areas, the proportion of lakes that were unoccupied every year was higher for broods (71% and 69%) than for pairs (26% and 31%). We hypothesized that lakes without breeding Mallards, and especially broods, were too poor to raise young in, and we tested that in field experiments on 22 lakes in boreal Sweden. Based on concentration of total phosphorus in the water, these lakes were divided into two groups: 11 'poor' lakes and 11 'rich' lakes. Mallard ducklings imprinted on humans were used to address brood-stage food limitation by studying mass change. Thirty-one individually marked ducklings were divided into three experimental groups: 12 ducklings were used in poor lakes, 12 ducklings in rich lakes, and 7 ducklings were used as controls receiving no experimental treatment in the field. Each group was studied in 11 daytime trials on 11 different lakes, except the control group which was kept in a pen with free access to food. Ducklings of all groups spent nights together as a big 31-individual group in the same pen and with free access to food. Ducklings foraging on poor lakes gained significantly less body mass than those feeding on rich lakes. At night, when ducklings of both groups had equal and free access to food, ducklings that had been feeding in a poor lake that day gained more mass than those that had been feeding in a rich lake. Overall, ~95% of daily mass gain was accounted for by daytime gain in the control group, the corresponding percentage was 35% in the rich-lake experimental group and 11% in the poor-lake experimental group. Thus, we have observational, as well as experimental, evidence to conclude that many boreal lakes are inferior breeding habitat for Mallards, especially during the brood stage. Our results suggest (1) that it is important to recognize at what stage of the yearly reproductive cycle food limitation may occur, (2) that brood stage may be more important than nesting stage for possible population limitation and regulation in breeding Mallards, and (3) that the reason why so many lakes in the boreal region lack breeding Mallards may be food limitation.",Anas platyrhynchos | Finland | Food limitation | Habitat saturation | Mallard | Mass gain | Population limitation | Sweden,NA,NA

Factors shaping seedfall patterns have been typically explored from the tree perspective (seed shadow) or from the population perspective (seed rain). However, the seed rain is actually composed of multiple seed shadows. In this paper, we use this framework to explore the variables shaping the seedfall pattern of the wild olive tree (Olea europaea var. sylvestris), a fleshy-fruited tree of the Mediterranean scrublands. We monitored the movement patterns of avian seed dispersers and the seedfall around each fruit-bearing O. europaea tree in two contrasting sites, differing in the degree of human management and abundance of scrub cover. None of the seed dispersers moved between microhabitats (different shrub species and open interspaces) as a function of microhabitat relative abundance. All dispersers foraged preferentially at O. europaea; only the smaller species visited open interspaces, and these only sporadically. Avoidance of open sites by frugivores, especially larger species, and their attraction to source trees were the major determinants of the seedfall pattern. Regarding seed size distribution among microhabitats, we found that only small seeds were significantly overrepresented in open interspaces. From the seed shadow perspective, seed density under trees was similar in the two study sites, but it decreased with distance at a higher rate in the disturbed scrubland. From the seed rain perspective, seed density was significantly different among microhabitats, with open interspaces collecting few, if any, seeds, and places under source trees receiving the highest densities. Results from seed shadow and seed rain analyses were integrated to construct a path model to explore the relative contribution of spatial, microhabitat, and individual tree features to the seedfall pattern. Factors related to microhabitat were identified as having a major role in shaping seedfall pattern. Open interspaces collected few seeds, points under shrub species with sparse foliage collected moderate seed densities, and points under shrubs with dense foliage collected the highest seed densities. The comparison between sites suggests that habitat alteration (a reduction of the scrub layer) can lead to contrasting seedfall patterns. The occurrence of an abundant scrub layer in the well-preserved scrubland allowed a complex pattern of seed rain. In contrast, the sparse scrub cover in the disturbed scrubland yielded a seedfall pattern composed of multiple seed shadows constrained to the vicinity of tree crowns. Thus, our sampling design and analytical approach have proved useful in describing the relative importance of the set of variables that shapes the complex seedfall pattern of a bird-dispersed plant. This seedfall pattern, in turn, is central to the understanding of the spatial patterns of plant recruitment and the efficiency of the dispersal mutualism.",Bird-dispersed plants | Habitat alteration | Mediterranean scrubland | Microhabitats | Olea europaea var. sylvestris | Seed dispersal | Seed rain | Seed shadow | Seed size | Wild olive,NA,NA

Measurements of 13C and 15N in roots showed that, in all plants, part of the glycine N was taken up in the form of intact amino acid. Hence, regressions of plots of excess 13C against excess 15N showed that a minimum of 19-23% of the glycine-derived N was taken up as intact amino acid; possible losses of labeled C atoms of glycine during its metabolism in the plants implies that these estimates are conservative.

Because of its large body size and conspicuousness, Bythotrephes is a preferred prey of freshwater fish. We observed seasonal changes in life history and morphology and diel vertical migration, all best understood as a response to fish predation. Bythotrephes population dynamics were characterized by pronounced population growth in late spring, maximum abundances in June, and a steady decline toward the end of the season. In late spring, high population growth rates were achieved by means of large clutches, low investment in individual offspring, and small size at first reproduction. While the population was still increasing, a marked life history shift occurred. The reproductive strategy of females switched toward high per-offspring allocation at the expense of clutch size. This change in reproductive behavior resulted in an increase in the size of neonates and was accompanied by an increase in the size at first reproduction. Such a life history shift is typically observed in the presence of gape-limited predators, which points to the importance of juvenile fish as the principal vertebrate planktivores in Lake Constance. The length of Bythotrephes defensive spina increased throughout the season, reflecting increasing predation pressure, probably owing to seasonally increasing mouth gape size of juvenile fish. In contrast to the predictions of the predator-avoidance theory, the migration amplitude of large and conspicuous Bythotrephes was small as compared to other zooplankton species. We argue that theory and data can be reconciled if the migration behavior of Bythotrephes is considered as a result of an interaction of predator defenses in the presence of predominantly juvenile, gape-limited fish. As Bythotrephes achieved protection because of its life history and spina, the costs of large diel migrations may outweigh the benefits.","Alternative antipredator defenses | Bythotrephes | Diel vertical migration | Gape-limited predation | Juvenile fish | Lake Constance, European Alps | Life history | Morphological defense | Offspring allocation | Reproductive investment",all,All Open Access

There is now a broad consensus that the balance between negative and positive interactions should shift along environmental gradients, with competition prevailing under environmentally benign conditions and positive interactions dominating under harsh conditions. A commonly cited example of the importance of facilitation in harsh environments is the preference of desert annual plants for the areas under the canopy of shrubs. The recognition of apparently positive effects of desert shrubs on annuals, however, has been mostly based on density measurements, while fitness parameters of the understory plants have been ignored. Also, the temporal consistency of such effects has not been previously tested. Based on conceptual ideas about the balance between interference and facilitation, we predicted that positive effects of the shrubs on the understory should dominate in dry years, while in favorable years, negative effects would be stronger. We tested our hypothesis by measuring the direction and magnitude of the shrub effect on demographic responses of four desert annual plant species during four consecutive seasons of differing rainfall. The results contradicted our initial hypothesis. Depending on the species, the effect of the shrubs shifted from either negative to neutral or from neutral to positive with increasing annual rainfall. However, this trend was stronger for the effect of shrubs on plant reproductive success than on their densities. Our data highlight the importance of measuring fitness parameters in studies of plant-plant interactions. We suggest that the negative effects of shrubs on plant fitness were due to rainfall interception, while positive effects were related to increased nutrient availability beneath shrubs. However, the mechanisms by which the shrubs and annuals interact can only be resolved using an experimental approach. Our results contradict previous hypotheses about the relative importance of positive and negative interactions along environmental gradients.

Neighboring plants can reduce herbivore damage (1) by their effects on the predator community, (2) by reducing the ability of herbivores to find their host plants, and (3) by reducing the time herbivores remain on their host plants. We examined how the presence of the aromatic low shrub Myrica gale and of predatory lady beetles affected herbivore damage and reproductive output in a population of the perennial herb Lythrum salicaria in northern Sweden. An observational study showed that L. salicaria growing in Myrica thickets were less damaged by herbivores, had a lower abundance of the monophagous, leaf-feeding, chrysomelid beetle Galerucella calmariensis, and had higher flower and seed production than L. salicaria outside Myrica thickets. To test whether these differences could be explained by (a) differences in some aspect of plant quality, or (b) differences in predator abundance, we placed potted L. salicaria within and outside Myrica thickets. To determine whether differences in the abundance of G. calmariensis were primarily the result of different rates of colonization or emigration, we marked adult beetles and placed them on a second set of potted plants in the two microhabitats. The results show that differences in herbivore abundance, plant damage, and reproductive output between potted L. salicaria placed within and outside Myrica thickets were in the same direction and of the same magnitude as those observed for naturally occurring plants, indicating that the observed patterns were not an effect of differences in the chemical composition of the host plant. Moreover, we found no support for the hypothesis that a higher abundance of insect predators could explain the lower abundance of G. calmariensis on L. salicaria in Myrica thickets. On the contrary, lady beetles (Coccinella quinqempunctata and Coccinella septempunctata) were observed on a greater proportion of the plants placed outside the Myrica thickets. The monitoring of marked beetles indicated that differences in the abundance of G. calmariensis were the result of a markedly higher colonization rate and a somewhat lower emigration rate from L. salicaria outside Myrica thickets. Outside the Myrica thickets, the survival of G. calmariensis and the magnitude of herbivore damage were lower, and fruit and seed output were higher on plants with observations of lady beetles than on plants without lady beetles. The results indicate that the abundance of the specialist herbivore G. calmariensis, and the herbivore damage and reproductive output of its host plant, L. salicaria, are affected both by the presence of the nonhost Myrica and by predation from lady beetles. We suggest that the most likely mechanism causing decreased feeding on L. salicaria growing in Myrica thickets is that Myrica affects the ability of G. calmariensis to find its host, either through visual or olfactory interference.",Associational defense | Coccinella | Galerucella calmariensis | Herbivory | Lythrum salicaria | Myrica gale | Nanophyes marmoratus | Plant reproduction | Predation | Trophic cascade | Trophic interaction,NA,NA

The primary sources of organic matter for the food web in the reference stream were leaf tissue, bacterial carbon, and animal prey, with ∼25-30% of total secondary production derived from each. In-stream primary production led to <1% of invertebrate secondary production. A higher fraction of food web production in the litter-excluded stream was derived from wood. Magnitudes of detrital flows were lower in the litter-excluded stream, and some taxa were missing compared to the reference stream. The fraction of predator ingestion approached 100% of total secondary production for both streams, but this predation was distributed diffusely among several taxa. Flows to predators were fewer and smaller in the litter-excluded stream, yet these flows had higher per-biomass consumption coefficients, suggesting stronger interactions among the remaining common taxa. These food webs enabled us to examine interactions among taxa in the streams; hence, we found responses of the stream ecosystem to litter-exclusion that we would not have considered had we only measured changes in invertebrate population sizes or system-level changes in organic matter flow.",Bacteria | Coweeta hydrologic laboratory | Detritivory | Detritus | Food webs | Macroinvertebrates | North carolina | Organic matter flow | Predation | Resource redaction | Streams,NA,NA

We gathered published and unpublished data from various tropical forests where bird species forage (1) exclusively alone or in pairs (2) in heterospecific flocks some of the time (facultative flock members), or (3) exclusively in heterospecific year-long associations (obligate flock members). We controlled statistically for effects of body size, nest type, clutch size, and phylogeny, and tested whether survival rates differed among these three groups. The survival rates of the obligate flock members (mean survival rate 68.7%, range 48.0-87.0%) were significantly higher than estimates for the species feeding alone or in pairs (mean survival rate 58.3%, range 33.0-79.0%). However, survival rates of the facultative flock members (mean survival rate 60.4%, range 40.0-79.0%) did not differ from those of the nonflocking species. Nevertheless, causes of such differences in survival can be explained by an alternative hypothesis. Life history theory predicts that higher survival for the obligate flocking species may be a response to low fecundity and productivity. Yet, the pattern ""high survivorship, strikingly low fecundity"" documented in obligate flocking species has never been observed among their solitary or facultative flocking counterparts. This result suggests that permanent obligate flocking can be an alternative ecological factor that may drive the evolution of life histories in tropical birds.",Adult survival | Facultative flocking | Foraging efficiency | Life history traits | Mixed-species flocks | Neotropical forest | Obligate flocking behavior | Passerine | Predator avoidance | Tropics,NA,NA

In addition, we examined the effect of longevity on production of recruits and lifetime reproductive success (LRS). In both sexes, breeding performance improved with age. In females, this was mainly the result of disproportionate mortality of inferior breeders, with less evidence to support performance changes within individuals.

Production of recruits was not dependent on parental age at the time of breeding for either sex. Recruit production and LRS were both influenced by longevity, so that longer-lived birds produced more offspring over their lifetimes and thereby had a greater probability of producing recruits. The differences between the sexes in terms of age-dependent breeding performance are likely a consequence of the differing roles the two parents play in reproduction.

By addressing both persistence and dynamics, the model increases the testability of mechanisms of extinction. Population-level equations modeled the functional response and prey growth. For individual predators, we simulated time since dividing and feeding, and number of prey consumed; these influenced the timing of division and death. We tested the model by comparing simulated dynamics to data from three experiments: (1) an experiment initiated with low predator-prey ratios in 30-mL bottles; (2) an experiment similar to Experiment 1, but in which immigrant predators, prey, or both were added during the first density cycle; (3) an experiment in 30-mL bottles, initiated with various predator-prey ratios. Using only nine parameters measured in independent experiments, simulations gave satisfactory predictions of the period and amplitude of cycles of predator and prey densities, and predator and prey densities through time for Experiment 1. Adding stochasticity to the model also allowed it to reproduce observed prey and predator persistence and the proportion of replicates with prey extinctions. We used the improved model to forecast the results of Experiments 2 and 3. In Experiment 2, persistence changed with immigration. The model qualitatively reproduced these changes but underestimated their magnitude. Increasing the initial predator-prey ratio reduced persistence in Experiment 3.

For some species' dynamics, however, it is possible to determine over a restricted period whether density-dependent factors are involved in reducing population densities. I use a new Return Trajectory Likelihood Ratio Test (RTLRT) to determine whether a population perturbed to high density (e.g., by periodic recruitment) exhibits density dependence by returning to a positive asymptote (or leveling density, L) or is density independent and, through proportional hazards, approaches zero exponentially. In a series of simulations, declines after recruitment were mimicked by creating sequences that changed due to a combination of density-dependent and density-independent factors. Until the sequence dropped below L, losses due to each mortality type were combined; after that point the density-dependent component was discontinued. The power of the test was assessed over a range of decline rates (e-b, where b = 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.9, 1) to zero and to L, initial density values (2, 4, and 6 times higher than L), and observation and process errors (eσ where σ = 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5). Test size was assessed by generating trajectories with no density-dependent decline. These simulations identified four critical parameters that influence the likelihood of detecting density-dependent decline. (1) Detection rates change with the ratio of initial recruitment peak to leveling density: high peaks generally increase detection, although they may decrease detection of slow density-dependent declines. (2) High rates of density-dependent decline relative to density-independent decline also improve detection, except that populations rapidly dropping below L will appear density independent regardless of dynamics governing change prior to that time. (3) Error reduces detection of density dependence, except when declines are shallow and process error is assumed. (4) Slow rates of density-independent decline (to <10% of original value) cause the RTLRT to detect density dependence when it is not present (i.e., size is excessive for slow declines). As an example of how the RTLRT may be used, I apply it to four years of monthly counts of an intertidal isopod, Idotea wosnesenskii, which recruits annually to high densities under boulders. Based on the RTLRT, subsequent declines were density dependent in some years, although detection differed with the assumption of process or observation error, and with the use of separate or averaged samples. In addition to density dependence, selective mortality of one class of individuals or mortality balanced by continuing low immigration could also cause steep declines to L. For isopods, however, densities were higher under boulders with small depressions than under smooth controls, suggesting that declines may occur when densities exceed the number of safe sites available.

The life cycle of most barnacles has three distinct phases: (1) a planktotrophic nauplius, (2) a non-feeding, planktonic cyprid that subsists on energy reserves, and (3) a benthic juvenile and adult. We conducted a series of experiments to measure the effects of variable food concentration during the naupliar phase on the age, size, and lipid reserves of Balanus glandula cyprids. When food shifted during only the first ∼25% of the naupliar phase (the first three instars), the initial food level did not affect the timing of metamorphosis to the cyprid. Shifts in food that were restricted to the final ∼40% of the naupliar phase (the sixth instar) also did not affect age at metamorphosis. During the intermediate portion of the naupliar phase, enhanced food decreased the age at metamorphosis, while reduced food lengthened the naupliar phase. Cyprid size generally correlated positively with changes in food, but a maximal size appeared to result when food increased during the intermediate portion of the naupliar phase (when the timing of metamorphosis was plastic). Amphibian models adequately describe the effects of variable food on the size and age at metamorphosis to the cyprid, provided that the model specifies an upper limit to size at metamorphosis when food is enhanced prior to fixation of development rate. In contrast to effects on size and age at metamorphosis, cyprids' lipid concentration (lipid per unit body size) only responded to shifts in food that occurred during the sixth instar. This resulted because shifts in food during the sixth instar affected both cyprids' size and lipid content (lipid per cyprid). Earlier shifts in food greatly affected a cyprid's size, but had little effect on lipid content or lipid concentration. Because the size, age, and lipid reserves of cyprids all have fitness implications, the net effects of food variability are complicated and depend on exactly when the variability occurs. Short-term changes in food encountered after the third instar and before the sixth will alter the length of the naupliar period and the size of cyprids. Variability restricted to the sixth instar will not alter the age at metamorphosis, but will affect the cyprid's size, lipid content, and lipid concentration.",Balanus glandula | Complex life cycle | Cyprid | Food variability | Larval development | Larval ecology | Life history | Marine invertebrate | Metamorphosis | Timing | Wilbur-Collins model,NA,NA

This study is an attempt to examine the population-and community-level implications of integration in a spatially explicit model. We have simulated different resource patterns in a cellular automata, varying the proportion (p) and size (s) of resource-rich patches and the average resource level in the area (h). We compared the efficiency of integrator to splitter genets in exploring and utilizing the resource patches. In the integrator, ramets that belonged to the same genet were physiologically connected and shared the resource taken up by any part of the genet. In the splitter, all ramets were autonomous, i.e., survival and reproduction of each ramet only depended on the local resource conditions. Thus, the integrator sensed and responded to environmental heterogeneity on a larger spatial scale than the splitter. Integration can be interpreted as sharing the risk of genet mortality among interconnected ramets, while splitting represents risk spreading among autonomous ramets. In each simulated habitat type, we followed the course of competition between splitter and integrator genets for 500 generations. First, we examined the effect of environmental heterogeneity on the result of competition. We fixed the average resource level in the area and changed the spatial distribution of the resource by varying p and s. We found that the smaller the proportion of favorable sites, the better it is to integrate. But already a small deviation from random to clumped resource distribution (i.e., relatively small s) made the integrator competitively inferior to the splitter. In the next step, we varied the overall resource richness in the area. High productivity of the habitat promoted the dominance of integrators. The simulations demonstrated that there were habitat types in which one of the strategies (the integrator or the splitter) rapidly excluded its competitor. But at the medium range of environmental parameters, long-term coexistence of the strategies became possible. As integration proceeded simultaneously with horizontal growth and exploration of new patches, integrators remarkably differed from splitters in their pattern of space occupation. A spatial statistical analysis revealed that splitters maintained strong spatial association with the resource: splitting promoted habitat selection. Integration, on the other hand, led to gap-filling, fugitive spatial behavior. For a range of realistic habitat patterns, we need not expect the exclusion of any of the pure strategies - splitters and integrators can coexist.",Cellular automata | Clonal plants | Community structure | Competition for gaps | Environmental heterogeneity | Physiological integration | Population dynamics | Resource uptake | Risk spreading | Spatial interactions,NA,NA

Assembling a collection of 90 plants without any dispersal barriers (a super-island experiment) does not modify the persistence of the predator-prey system. Subdividing the system into a metapopulation with barriers for dispersal (a collection of eight islands with 10 plants per island) leads to persistence of the predator-prey dynamics for many generations. In this paper, we use the time series of colonization events and prey and predator densities from the super-island and metapopulation experiments to understand how colonization processes of prey and predatory mites are altered by spatial subdivision. Using survival analysis, we estimate how prey and predator colonization probability is affected by densities of the colonist pool at different distances from the target plant. Contrasting the results from the super-island and metapopulation experiments reveals that spatial subdivision affects the discovery rate of prey outbreaks by predatory mites and differentially affects colonization by prey and predators. Prey colonization is primarily determined by local densities of prey in spatially subdivided systems, whereas predator colonization retains primarily ""global"" influences. Our analysis of colonization processes suggests mechanisms accounting for stability in the metapopulation experiments and provides the quantitative basis for the development of colonization functions to explore these mechanisms in predator-prey models of acarine systems.",Colonization | Logistic regression | Metapopulation | Phytoseiulus persimilis | Predator-prey dynamics | Spatial subdivision | Survival analysis | Tetranychus urticae,all,All Open Access

We investigated the effects of ant tending on life history traits of aphids feeding singly on a host plant, in the absence of natural enemies. A factorial design allowed us to control for variation in the level of tending effort among individual ant colonies. The presence of workers of the ant Lasius niger had a strong positive effect on the fitness of individuals of the aphid Metopeurum fuscoviride. Ant-tended individuals lived longer, matured earlier, had a higher rate of reproduction, and a higher expected number of offspring than aphids not tended by ants. An aphid's longevity was significantly correlated with the daily mean number of workers tending it. The strong dependence of aphid fitness on the level of ant tending shows that ants can influence aphid life history traits even when aphids occur singly on plants.",Ant | Ant tending | Aphid | Homoptera | Honeydew | Lasius niger | Metopeurum fusco viride | Mutualistic relationship | Myrmecophily.,all,All Open Access

In addition to these facilitative effects, Carex is also hypothesized to compete with the associated species, and thus limit their size and reproduction. To evaluate these hypotheses, I followed the performance of transplanted individuals of Mimulus guttatus, M. cardinalis, Juncus covillei, Conocephalum conicum, and Brachythecium frigidum and naturally occurring individuals of Epipactis gigantea on Carex tussocks with dense, thinned, pinned back, or completely clipped Carex stems. The five transplanted species were also planted directly onto the emergent streambed. Though streambed transplants grew as well as those on tussocks over the summer, they experienced significantly greater winter mortality, up to 100%, supporting the hypothesis that tussocks provide a critical stable substrate. In contrast, growing season competition by Carex reduced biomass by over 50% for five of the six species and reduced reproductive performance by over 60%. Also, over the growing season, Carex protected M. guttatus and Epipactis from insect larvae and deer, respectively, reducing herbivory by >75%. Additional results from a deer exclosure treatment showed that the positive effects of this ""associational defense"" were equal in magnitude to the negative effects of Carex competition on Epipactis biomass.

Changes in plant community productivity or composition, for example, may alter ecosystem resource dynamics, trophic structures, or disturbance regimes, with subsequent positive or negative feedbacks on the plant community. At northern latitudes, where increases in temperature are expected to be greatest but where plant species diversity is relatively low, climatically mediated changes in species composition or abundance will likely have large ecosystem effects. In this study, we investigated effects of infrared loading and manipulations of water-table elevation on net primary productivity of plant species in bog and fen wetland mesocosms between 1994 and 1997. We removed 27 intact soil monoliths (2.1 m2 surface area, 0.5-0.7 m depth) each from a bog and a fen in northern Minnesota to construct a large mesocosm facility that allows for direct manipulation of climatic variables in a replicated experimental design. The treatment design was a fully crossed factorial with three infrared-loading treatments, three water-table treatments, and two ecosystem types (bogs and fens), with three replicates of all treatment combinations. Overhead infrared lamps caused mean monthly soil temperatures to increase by 1.6-4.1°C at 15-cm depth during the growing season (May-October). In 1996, depths to water table averaged -11, -19, and -26 cm in the bog plots, and 0, -10, and -19 cm in the fen plots. Annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP) of bryophyte, forb, graminoid, and shrub life-forms was determined for the dominant species in the mesocosm plots based on species-specific canopy/biomass relationships. Belowground net primary production (BNPP) was estimated using root in-growth cores. Bog and fen communities differed in their response to infrared loading and water-table treatments because of the differential response of life-forms and species characteristic of each community. Along a gradient of increasing water-table elevation, production of bryophytes increased, and production of shrubs decreased in the bog community. Along a similar gradient in the fen community, production of graminoids and forbs increased. Along a gradient of increasing infrared loading in the bog, shrub production increased whereas graminoid production decreased. In the fen, graminoids were most productive at high infrared loading, and forbs were most productive at medium infrared loading. In the bog and fen, BNPP:ANPP ratios increased with warming and drying, indicating shifts in carbon allocation in response to climate change. Further, opposing responses of species and life-forms tended to cancel out the response of production at higher levels of organization, especially in the bog. For example, total net primary productivity in the bog did not differ between water-table treatments because BNPP was greatest in the dry treatment whereas ANPP was greatest in the wet treatment. The differential responses of species, life-forms, and above- and belowground biomass production to the treatments suggest that bog and fen plant communities will change, in different directions and magnitudes, in response to warming and changes in water-table elevation. Further, results of this and complementary research indicate that these peatlands may mediate their energy, carbon, and nutrient budgets through differential responses of the plant communities. Thus, predictions of the response of peatlands to changes in climate should consider differences in plant community structure, as well as biogeochemistry and hydrology, that characterize and differentiate these two ecosystems.",Aboveground net primary productivity | Belowground net primary productivity | Climate change | Global warming | Land use change | Peatlands | Soil warming | Water-table | Wetlands,NA,NA

Thus, sustainable productivity and C sequestration may depend on species composition. We measured soil N and P availability and ecosystem N and C sequestration in a 17-yr-old replicated replacement series of Eucalyptus and Albizia in Hawaii. Species composition included pure plots of each species and four proportions of mixtures. Soil N availability increased with the proportion of Albizia in the plot, but soil P availability declined.

These findings were consistent with our predictions that H. helluo is limited in colonization ability when compared to P. milvina. The addition of prey attractants significantly elevated numbers of both species, but the effect was far stronger for the superior colonist (P. milvina). This indicates that P. milvina is able to track resource abundance (both habitat structure and prey), a trait correlated with colonization ability.

Attempts to separate the effects of various environmental factors on invertebrate populations in shallow fluctuating lakes through field study are hampered by the typically large temporal and spatial variation in species abundances and the long time scale of climate-driven habitat restructuring relative to the period of study. We used paleolimnological techniques to document long-term dynamics of the benthic invertebrate community inhabiting a shallow fluctuating lake in Kenya where during the period 1870-1991 lake depth fluctuated between 4 and 19 m, and lakewater conductivity between ~250 and 14000 μS/cm. Analyses of sediment texture, plant macrofossils, and fossil diatom assemblages in a 210Pb-dated sediment core were combined with historical lake-level data to reconstruct continuous records of past changes in salinity and the distribution of various types of benthic habitat. Fossil invertebrate faunas recovered from the same core comprised 58 species of Ostracoda, chydorid Cladocera, and Chironomidae, with 26 common species together accounting for >95% of the recovered fossils. Uni- and multivariate statistical analyses of the faunal and environmental data revealed distinct species-specific responses to lake level, salinity, and papyrus-swamp development. Redundancy analysis and variation partitioning showed that salinity and swamp development together explained 51% of the observed historical variation in benthic community composition, and that their effects were independent. In the univariate analyses, six species (23%) showed a strong response to salinity. Nine species (35%) responded strongly to swamp development, which determines availability of submerged vegetated substrates and turbulence-free, littoral mud bottoms. Five species (19%) responded primarily to lake level, which affects the general distribution of sand and mud bottoms and the intensity of subaqueous spring discharge. The remaining six species (23%) showed no distinct pattern or correlation with the selected environmental factors. These results suggest that a significant portion of the documented correlation between salinity and invertebrate community structure along the full gradient of inland aquatic ecosystems may be an indirect effect of broad but diffuse relationships between salinity and the distribution of various types of benthic microhabitat. Decade-scale environmental change experienced by individual closed-basin lakes tends to remain limited to a relatively narrow portion of this gradient, where covariance between salinity and other ecological determinants may be weak.

Direct effects on female plant fitness occur when decreased seed production is due to decreased resource availability from loss of leaf area and its attendant photosynthesis or through consumption of reproductive structures. Indirect effects occur when folivore- and florivore-mediated changes in floral traits influence pollinator preference and/or pollinator efficiency, thus reducing pollen receipt. We examined the effects of both leaf and floral herbivory (bud damage) and determined the relative contribution of direct and indirect effects of damage on female fitness through changes in floral traits for Oenothera macrocarpa (Onagraceae). The experiment was a two-factorial design that manipulated both leaf damage (~25% leaf area removed by hand) and pollen receipt (supplemental hand pollination). We then measured effects of leaf damage on floral traits (corolla diameter, floral tube length, and flower number) and fruit and seed set. Because herbivores damaged corollas in the bud stage in this experiment, we were also able to determine the effect of florivores on subsequent female reproduction. Plants in the increased leaf damage treatment (33.4% leaf area loss) produced fewer flowers than natural leaf damage plants (6.5% leaf area loss), and their flowers had smaller corolla diameters and shorter floral tube lengths. Experimentally damaged plants also had 18% lower fruit set and produced 33% fewer seeds compared with natural leaf damage plants. Hand pollination increased fruit set by 60% and total seed number by 38% above that of naturally pollinated plants, demonstrating that female fitness was pollen-limited. Bud damage significantly decreased corolla diameter and floral tube length, and it led to a 68% reduction in fruit set. Hawk moths were observed preferentially visiting flowers with larger corollas, and study flowers with larger corollas had significantly increased probability of setting fruit. Additionally, seed number per fruit was positively related to floral tube length. In path analysis, we found no significant path between percentage leaf damage and female reproduction, suggesting that herbivores did not reduce seed production directly through decreased resource availability. Instead, we found a significant indirect path from percentage leaf damage to seed number through corolla diameter. We conclude that decreased female reproduction was due to changes in floral traits from both leaf and floral bud damage, which affected hawk moth preference (flowers with smaller corollas received fewer visits) and hawk moth efficiency of pollen delivery (flowers with shorter floral tubes had fewer seeds).

We tested the hypothesis that oviposition experiences of female S. limbatus on native plants affects the ability of their larvae to develop on seeds of the nonnative Texas ebony. We demonstrate that females that encounter the native C. floridum while they are maturing their eggs produce progeny that have survivorship 10 times higher on seeds of the introduced Texas ebony than that of progeny produced by females that do not encounter C. floridum during egg maturation. However, this result cannot be explained entirely by egg-size plasticity; survivorship of larvae differed among treatments even in the range of egg sizes that overlapped between treatments.

In this set of field experiments, we evaluated the interactive, dynamic effects of limited food supply and predation from wolf spiders (Lycosidae) on mortality in Ageneotettix deorum, a common grasshopper (Acrididae) from North American sandhills grasslands. We attempted to determine whether the combined effects of food availability and spider predation on mortality were (1) noncompensatory, with the effects of each factor summing to determine ultimate population size, or (2) compensatory, where the effect of one mortality factor alters the impact of subsequent factors so that the ultimate population size changes little, despite variation in specific sources of mortality. We also investigated whether changes in nutritional quality encountered by grasshoppers would result in different dynamic responses to predation in the context of noncompensatory vs. compensatory responses. Both food availability and predation risk contributed to mortality rates. Individuals of A. deorum were food limited. Survival of grasshoppers feeding on fertilized plants was 50% higher than that of grasshoppers feeding on unfertilized plants over a 3 1-d period. Most of the mortality due to limited food occurred 12-14 d into the experiment. Predation from lycosid spiders decreased the numbers of individuals by 49% in the first 10-15 days of the experiment. Either noncompensatory or compensatory responses resulted from the combined effects of food availability and predation on population size, depending upon the nutritional status of host plants. At ambient-level food quality (no fertilizer), spider predation and food limitation were compensatory; the same numbers of grasshoppers were recovered in treatments with and without spider-predation risk after 31 d. However, with higher food quality (N fertilizer), spider predation reduced the numbers of surviving individuals as compared with the no-spider-predation treatment, a noncompensatory response. In separate, preplanned experiments, individuals surviving spider-predation treatments lived longer than did individuals protected from spider predation when they were caged individually over vegetation of ambient quality. Combined, these experiments emphasize the importance of food quality as a determinant of how this predator-prey system responds, and the results suggest a mechanism underlying the response. After predation, survivors are likely to encounter more food per capita and to exhibit higher individual quality, which promotes longevity, presumably from reduced competition. This leads to a compensatory response. Under high food quality regimes, predation and food probably act in a noncompensatory fashion because grasshoppers are less food limited, and the release of additional food on a per capita basis by predation has less effect on the subsequent number of survivors.","Ageneotettix deorum | Developmental rates | Food chain | Food limitation | Food quality | Grasshoppers | Herbivory | Lycosid spiders | Mortality, compensatory vs. noncompensatory | Nebraska sandhills grassland | Predator-prey interaction | Stage-specific responses",all,All Open Access

When high- and low-quality diets were simultaneously offered, the more mobile, non-tube-building amphipods, Gammarus mucronatus and Elasmopus levis, both fed preferentially on the high-quality diet. The more sedentary, tube-building amphipod Ampithoe longimana did not discriminate between these foods. When confined to a single food type, all three species exhibited compensatory feeding on the low-quality diet. Despite compensatory feeding, when Elasmopus levis were cultured on the low-quality food, they experienced reduced survivorship, growth, and fecundity during two successive ovulations, compared to individuals feeding on more nutrient-rich foods. Low-nutrient foods caused similar declines in growth and female gonad size for Gammarus mucronatus. In contrast, the survivorship, growth, and fecundity of Ampithoe longimana was not affected by any of the diets tested. Thus, compensatory feeding allowed the more sedentary species, Ampithoe longimana, to completely circumvent the effects of low nutritional quality, but the same behavior was ineffective for both of the more mobile species, Gammarus mucronatus and Elasmopus levis.

This study tests the prediction that L. latifolia flowers exposed to pollination regimes differing in pollinator composition should differ in their expected contribution to population recruitment in the field, as measured in terms of established seedlings, because of differences in seed production, progeny quality, or both. Using a randomized complete block design, two pollination regimes were induced during a 3-wk period on each of 15 L. latifolia plants by alternately exposing flowers in the two halves of each shrub to natural pollinators during two nonoverlapping diurnal periods (0930-1630, MD regime; dawn to 0930 and 1630 to dusk, R regime). The two pollination regimes differed in pollinator composition. The importance as flower visitors of butterflies and small bees was greater during the MD regime, which was also characterized by higher flower visitation rate and higher probability of visitation per time unit of individual flowers. MD flowers set proportionally more fruits, and each fruit contained more seeds, than R flowers. Seed production per inflorescence was also greater in MD than in R half-plants. Seeds from the MD and R regimes did not differ significantly in either mean mass, probability of germination under laboratory conditions, or probability of producing a seedling when planted in a greenhouse. When planted in the field, seeds originating from MD flowers had a greater probability of producing a seedling than those originating from R flowers, the difference being greatest where soil characteristics were most adverse for early seedling growth. In the field, MD and R seedlings did not differ in post-emergence survival rate and size of eventual survivors. The estimated average probability (± 1 SE) of one ovule eventually producing one third-year, established seedling in the home environment was significantly greater for MD (0.0192 ± 0.0041) than for R (0.0085 ± 0.0020) flowers. This demographic advantage of MD ovules was mainly accounted for by the greater seedling emergence rate of MD seeds, and only secondarily by the greater fruit- and seed-set of MD flowers. Observed patterns may be explained by a combination of increased outcrossing derived from the greater relative importance of small bees and butterflies as pollinators, and increased gametophytic competition resulting from increased overall visitation rates to individual flowers during the MD pollination regime.

At both sites, the quantity of plant litter was decreased by herbivory following a vole population peak in 1992. At Crystal Bench, removal of voles caused a decrease in the nitrogen concentration and an increase in the C:N ratio of plant litter over the four years of the study. The higher quality litter produced in the presence of voles at Crystal resulted in a larger pool of potentially mineralizable nitrogen in soil from control plots relative to soils from plots that had not been accessible to voles. At Crystal, vole removal did not cause a change in plant community composition. However, at Blacktail, after several years of vole exclusion, legumes became more common in exclosures than in control plots that were accessible to voles. Selective herbivory on high-nitrogen legumes kept the litter quality outside exclosures low, whereas higher legume biomass caused a decrease in C:N ratio of plant litter inside exclosures. The removal of voles at Blacktail caused a 15% increase in the fraction of the soil nitrogen that was rapidly mineralizable. Our results show that voles increased nitrogen mobility, especially during and after population peaks. However, that increase was offset by decreases in nitrogen mineralization over longer periods when voles caused a decrease in high-quality plant litter produced by preferred forage plants, especially legumes. Thus, both the mechanisms by which voles affected nitrogen dynamics and the net effects of voles varied over time and space. The balance of direct and indirect effects may provide a general mechanistic explanation of whether herbivores increase or decrease the rate of nitrogen cycling.","Herbivory | Legumes | Microtus | Mineralization | Nitrogen cycling | Nitrogen, potentially mineralizable | Plant litter | Riparian | Soil organic matter | Trifolium | Voles | Yellowstone National Park",all,All Open Access

Motivated by observations from lakes, where the pelagic food web is often linked to the littoral food web by mobile predators, we constructed a simple model to evaluate the dynamics of two food chains linked by a top predator with prey preference. Linking the two food chains had no qualitative effect on model dynamics, although it did increase the density of the top predator. Instead, the prey preference of the top predator changed the system dynamics. We found a range of prey preferences that could eliminate chaos, dampen oscillations, and even produce point stability in a previously oscillatory system.

Second, we directly observed dynamics of carbon and nitrogen over a 12-yr period in 1900 permanent plots in these fields. These observed dynamics were used in a differential equation model to predict soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. The two methods yielded similar results. Resampling the 1900 plots showed that the rates of accumulation of nitrogen and carbon over 12 yr depended on ambient carbon and nitrogen levels in the soil, with rates of accumulation declining at higher carbon and nitrogen levels. A dynamic model fitted to the observed rates of change predicted logistic dynamics for nitrogen and carbon accumulation. On average, agricultural practices resulted in a 75% loss of soil nitrogen and an 89% loss of soil carbon at the time of abandonment. Recovery to 95% of the preagricultural levels is predicted to require 180 yr for nitrogen and 230 yr for carbon. This model accurately predicted the soil carbon, nitrogen, and carbon: nitrogen ratio patterns observed in the chronosequence of old fields, suggesting that the chronosequence may be indicative of actual changes in soil carbon and nitrogen. Our results suggest that the rate of carbon accumulation was controlled by the rate of nitrogen accumulation, which in turn depended on atmospheric nitrogen deposition and symbiotic nitrogen fixation by legumes. Our data support the hypothesis that these abandoned fields initially retain essentially all nitrogen and have a closed nitrogen cycle. Multiple regression suggests that vegetation composition had a significant influence on the rates of accumulation of both nitrogen and carbon; legumes increased these rates, and C3 grasses and forbs decreased them.

In addition, we detected a significant interaction between the clipping and emasculation treatments when considering four components of fitness simultaneously; emasculation led to an increase in the fitness of unclipped plants but not clipped plants. We propose two nonexclusive mechanisms to explain this pattern. First, damaged plants may experience reduced self-pollination due to reductions in pollinator visitation or effectiveness. Alternatively, damaged plants may simply lack the resources (or the ability to allocate resources) to benefit from emasculation. Our results support the notion that herbivory can have indirect effects on plant fitness through effects on other plant-animal interactions.",Geitonogamy | Herbivore-pollinator interaction | Ipomopsis aggregata | Plant-animal interaction | Pollination biology | Scarlet gilia | Self-pollination | Ungulate grazing,NA,NA

We quantified these properties for phytoplankton in lakes using pulsed nutrient loading as the perturbation. Theory predicts that grazer community structure should influence how phytoplankton respond to pulsed nutrient loading. In particular, phytoplankton in lakes with large, effective grazers such as Daphnia are expected to be less sensitive to, but recover more slowly from, nutrient perturbations than phytoplankton in lakes with smaller grazers. We tested these predictions by adding standardized small and large pulses of nutrients (~ 10 and ~ 100 μg P/L of epilimnion, with N at an N: P ratio of ~25:1 by mass) to two natural ponds with contrasting grazer communities that resulted from the deliberate addition of planktivorous fishes to one pond. Site-specific responses were examined by conducting the experiment in the same ponds over two consecutive summers (1994 and 1995), but switching the fish treatments between years. In both years, phytoplankton in the pond with large-bodied zooplankton grazers were less sensitive to small pulses of nutrients than were phytoplankton in the pond with small grazers, confirming the expectation that large zooplankton can buffer lakes against nutrient perturbations. However, responses to the large nutrient pulse were less consistent: phytoplankton in the pond with large zooplankton were less sensitive to the large perturbation only in 1995. This unexpected result appears to be due mainly to a 2.6 times greater total zooplankton biomass in the pond with small grazers on the day of the large pulse in 1994. Thus, although the presence of large-bodied zooplankton appears to reduce phytoplankton sensitivity to small nutrient pulses, other factors, including zooplankton biomass, need to be incorporated into predictions for phytoplankton responses to large perturbations. Consistent with expectations, larger zooplankton appeared to slow recovery from nutrient perturbations, since the pond with fish and small grazers had faster return rates following the large nutrient pulse in both years of the experiment. Differences in life history traits between small and large species of zooplankton appear to account for these differences in recovery rates. Our results thus provide some support for theoretical expectations that management activities which alter grazer community structure may also affect the stability of phytoplankton communities to nutrient perturbations; additional experiments are needed to confirm the generality of this result.",Bayesian time series analysis | Daphnia | Grazing | Nitrogen | Phosphorus | Phytoplankton | Pulse perturbation | Resilience | Resistance | Stability | Zooplankton,NA,NA

There was temporal variability in Ar on time scales of one to a few weeks, indicating rapid changes in resource availability.

The carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis (CNB) explains environmentally induced variation in both constitutive and delayed herbivore-induced resistance (DIR) in terms of variation in soil fertility and light regime. The CNB hypothesis predicts that an increase in the availability of nutrients (e.g., fertilization) decreases both constitutive and induced resistance against herbivores. We tested the relative roles of plant genotype, defoliation, and soil fertility in determining herbivore resistance of cloned silver birch Betula pendula Roth saplings. As indicators of insect and mammalian resistance we conducted bioassays with a geometrid moth, Epirrita autumnata (Borkhausen), and counted the resin droplets on the shoot of the saplings, respectively. In addition, we measured rapid induced resistance (RIR) against the insect herbivore. Finally, we analyzed leaf secondary chemistry to investigate the correlations of secondary chemicals with the level of resistance measured using the performance of E. autumnata. With respect to the constitutive resistance against an insect herbivore, our results support the CNB hypothesis; the larvae of E. autumnata had a higher relative growth rate and pupal mass on fertilized saplings compared to nonfertilized saplings, i.e., the fertilized saplings had a lower resistance level. However, the relative growth rate of E. autumnata was significantly decreased by defoliation only when the larvae were grown on fertilized saplings. The number of resin droplets increased due to fertilization and, in fertilized saplings, following defoliation, but these responses were highly determined by the genotype of the sapling. Altogether, the results on resin droplets are not in accordance with the CNB hypothesis. The concentration of condensed tannins correlated negatively with E. autumnata growth rate and pupal mass in both fertilization levels, whereas the concentration of total nontannin phenolics correlated positively with the E. autumnata growth rate in nonfertilized saplings. In addition, the concentration of myricetin glycosides correlated negatively with the pupal mass of E. autumnata, whereas the correlations between E. autumnata performance indices and other groups of flavonol glycosides were either significantly positive (kaempferol glycosides) or nonsignificant (quercetin glycosides). Further, the concentration of 3,4'-dihydroxypropiophenone 3-glucoside (DHPPG) correlated positively with the magnitude of induction in E. autumnata growth rate and pupal mass in fertilized saplings, where the significant induction in resistance occurred. The correlations of secondary chemistry and E. autumnata performance indices suggest that the constitutive level of resistance of B. pendula against E. autumnata is mainly determined by the concentration of condensed tannins, whereas the induced resistance is determined by the concentration of nontannin phenolics, such as flavonol glycosides and DHPPG. We observed significant differences among the clones in their insect and mammalian resistance (i.e., genetic basis for the resistance), which indicates that resistance can evolve as a response to herbivory. However, fertilization explained a higher proportion of variance in insect performance indices than the genotype of the plant, whereas the opposite was true for the amount of resin droplets, which we used as an indicator of mammalian resistance.",Betula pendula | Carbon/nutrient balance | Clonal variation | Defoliation | Epirrita autumnata | Fertilization | Herbivore resistance | Plant-herbivore interactions | Resin droplets | Secondary chemicals,NA,NA

Hence, the superior larval competitor should be absent from patches of low host productivity. The metapopulation hypothesis, dispersal-competition trade-off, predicts coexistence if the inferior competitor is a superior disperser. Hence, the superior larval competitor should be absent from patches isolated by distance. Manipulative experiments demonstrate that coexistence does not require a dispersal advantage to the inferior larval competitor. Field surveys show that patches from which the superior larval competitor is absent are not the most isolated, but the least productive. In a natural experiment, loss of the superior larval competitor was not associated with habitat loss or fragmentation that increases distance among occupied patches, but with a large reduction in host productivity.

Although there was no significant difference in the I(b) of survivors with crown growth and those with crown reductions, a relationship was established between I(b) and the extent of crown area change. Canopy trees that intercept the most direct-beam irradiation and experience the least lateral shading have higher probabilities of survivorship and significant crown area changes that may be in the form of crown growth or crown reduction. Their laterally shaded neighbors have a lower survivorship probability, and those that survive persist in an inhibited state with limited crown area change. We conclude that the effects of lateral shading are not limited to the margins of treefall gaps and that lateral shading determined by crown position in the uneven upper canopies of nonequatorial tropical rain forests has a detectable effect on the long-term fates of neighboring canopy trees.",3-D model | Aerial stereopairs | Canopy trees | Crown dynamics | Crown position | Direct-beam interception | Lateral shading | Mortality | Survivorship | Tropical rain forest,all,All Open Access

This study identifies important direct and indirect effects of a coastal plant on its most common insect herbivore and assesses the relative importance of those effects. The direct effects of increased interstitial soil salinity and nitrogen on the abundance of Pissonotus quadripustulatus (Homoptera: Delphacidae), which feeds on Borrichia frutescens (Asteraceae), are reported. Also reported are the indirect effects of these treatments on parasitism of P. quadripustulatus eggs laid in plant stems by the fairyfly parasitoid Anagrus sp. nr. armatus (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae). Soil salinity was experimentally elevated by the addition of salt pellets, and plant foliar nitrogen was increased by the addition of fertilizer. Both salt and fertilizer increased the abundance of P. quadripustulatus. There was a significant salt x fertilizer interaction, suggesting that salt stress may be more important when plants are more nitrogen limited. Salt, by increasing the frequency of tough B. frutescens stems, decreased the rate at which Anagrus parasitized P. quadripustulatus eggs. Fertilizer, by increasing the frequency of B. frutescens stems that were softer and easier to penetrate, increased the rate of parasitism. Changes in parasitism, however, did not affect P. quadripustulatus density. Tests for density dependence showed that the results reported here were attributable to application of the treatments and not to spatial density dependence. This study suggests that, in a stressful salt-marsh system, the direct effects of plant quality on herbivores are more important than indirect effects of plant morphology mediated by natural enemies.","Abiotic factors | Affected by salinity | Borrichia frutescens | Community structure | Direct vs. indirect effects | Effects of salinity and nitrogen | Egg parasitism | Herbivores, affected by host-plant variation | Host plant nitrogen | Pissonotus quadripustulatus | Plant morphology | Plant quality | Salt marsh community | Soil salinity",NA,NA

Lesser Black-backed Gulls were capable of producing, on average, almost three times the normal clutch of three eggs. Although egg mass did not fall below that of the last laid egg in normal clutches, as the clutch extended beyond three, experimental eggs contained relatively less lipid and relatively more water. Overall the percentage of eggs that gave rise to fledged chicks (when reared singly by a foster parent) declined significantly with position in the experimental laying sequence; about two-thirds of the eggs laid at the beginning of the laying sequence gave rise to fledged chicks, whereas only about one-third of the last laid eggs did so. This was not due to any seasonal change in the capacity of foster parents to rear the chicks, and neither hatching nor fledging success of the eggs was related to their fresh mass.

The proposed mechanism is a land-tenure system that results in exclusion of individuals from the population through territoriality and temporal avoidance. In the absence of mortality from intraspecific aggression, social behavior can regulate a population only by limiting reproduction. Successful reproduction among large mammals is related to the availability of food. Four states of nature must hold if a population is regulated by social behavior via a land-tenure system in mountain lions: (1) individuals should not be distributed randomly, but each should have its own distinct distribution, and those individuals should maintain regions of exclusivity; (2) use of food within the distribution of an individual should not be random, but should be clumped as individuals try to exclude each other from access to prey; (3) those clumps of prey must not be simply the result of prey distribution, but of social interactions among lions; and (4) social interactions and defense of food should occur in regions where distributions of individuals overlap; therefore, prey use by individual lions in areas of overlap should be less than expected based on the distribution of prey. We tested hypotheses regarding social regulation for a population of mountain lions that co-occurred on a winter range with a population of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) in the eastern Sierra Nevada, California, from 1991 to 1997. Individual mountain lions (n = 10) exhibited distinct distributions, and deer killed by individuals (n = 112) were not distributed randomly within the distribution of the lion that did the killing. Furthermore, the nonrandom distribution of lion-killed deer could be explained by the distribution of live deer alone, but that result was marginally not significant (P = 0.06) and indicated that something else affected the locations of kills made by lions. Results from tests of whether the presence of another mountain lion affected where individuals chose to kill prey indicated that social interactions had no effect. The distribution of deer killed by individual mountain lions in areas of exclusive use and areas of overlap was identical to that expected based on the distribution of live deer alone. That outcome indicated social behavior was not regulating the population of mountain lions via partitioning of prey, and temporal differences in use of space could not explain the distribution of mountain lions we observed. A system of land-tenure and mutual avoidance did not limit the population of mountain lions in Round Valley via partitioning of prey. Our results are concordant with other studies of large mammalian carnivores, which reported that populations were not limited primarily by territoriality but by the supply of food.",Land-tenure system | Mountain lion | Mule deer | Odocoileus hemionus | Population regulation | Predation | Puma concolor | Social organization | Spatial distribution | Territoriality,NA,NA

They usually calculate the variance of the mean as if the sample were a simple random sample, using the unbiased estimator under this sampling design, that is, σ2/n. This practice leads to a selection bias, i.e., incorrect inclusion probabilities of population units in the sample are used in the estimator of variance of the mean. The magnitude of the bias varies with the underlying spatial autocorrelation structure. Design-based inference and model-based inference are two conceptual frameworks for tackling estimation of variance of the mean in a systematic sample. This paper reports use of the geostatistical estimation variance σ(E)/2 with the model-based approach. This variance of the overall spatial mean depends on the spatial autocorrelation structure of the data. We illustrate the method by considering the density of acorns fallen under a sessile oak during one season. Acorns were numbered in square quadrats of 0.25 m2; the data set was exhaustive. We drew nine one-start systematic samples from the whole population of quadrats. We computed semivariograms for the whole population and each sample and fitted them to exponential models without nugget. Using geostatistical theoretical results, we calculated a variance of the mean density of acorns by Monte Carlo integration. We show that our variance estimate depends on (1) the origin of the systematic sample, the central sample being the most accurate, (2) quadrat size, with a decrease in the variance when quadrat size increases, (3) the semivariogram model, (4) discretization of the domain used in Monte Carlo integration, and (5) the random number generator. Considering all sources of variation, the variance estimate we calculated ranged from ~2 to 36 in our example, for an overall mean equal to 95 acorns per quadrat. Geostatistical variance mainly reflects the locations and size of the sampled quadrats, and the spatial autocorrelation function. In our example, using the variance estimator of a simple random sample leads to a high selection bias. The bias can be neglected only in the absence of significant spatial autocorrelation in the sample. Otherwise, we advocate a geostatistical model-based approach that accounts for spatial autocorrelation.",Acorn density | Geostatistics | Model-based inference | Random sampling | Semivariogram | Stationarity | Superpopulation model | Systematic sampling | Variance estimation,NA,NA

We report that the supercooling capacity of hatchling C. picta is reduced by direct contact with nest soil which, in samples from northwestern and north-central Nebraska, Indiana, and Ontario, contained potent ice nuclei active in the range of -3.5°to -5°C. These nuclei were sensitive to autoclaving and extractable in water. The supercooling capacity of C. picta hatched in native nest soil, or hatched in sterilized vermiculite (which lacks water-extractable nuclei), and subsequently exposed to nest soil, was reduced by ~10°C relative to control turtles that were hatched and reared in sterilized vermiculite. The effect of these nuclei was potentiated by the presence of environmental moisture, although even transient exposure to dry nest soil markedly reduced supercooling capacity in ~50% of the turtles. Unlike turtle species that hibernate underwater (Sternotherus odoratus, Chelydra serpentina, Apalone spinifera), hatchlings of C. picta exhibited an extraordinary capacity for supercooling (temperature of crystallization, -16°to -20°C) when cooled in isolation from external ice nuclei. However, hatchlings of these four species were equally susceptible to inoculation by suspensions of the ice-nucleating bacterium, Pseudomonas syringae. Indirect evidence suggests that the soil nuclei are associated with such microbes. Nucleating activity was higher in soil collected within nests than in soil collected at the same depth, adjacent to these nests. Differences in the activities of ice nuclei in nesting soils may account for geographic and local variation in winter survival of hatchling C. picta. Our finding that similar agents occur in various other terrestrial habitats in central North America suggests that such nuclei may pose a formidable challenge to the overwintering survival of ectothermic animals that rely on supercooling to withstand frost exposure.",Chrysemys picta | Freeze tolerance | Geographic variability | Hatchling turtle | Ice nucleator | Microenvironment | Soil | Supercooling | Winter survival,all,All Open Access

In the obligate mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths, selective abortion of flowers that receive many moth eggs or receive poor pollen load has been suggested as a mechanism that can prevent evolution of excessive exploitation by moths. Using controlled pollinations, varying pollen amount and source, we asked whether variation in pollination quality of the magnitude seen among moths affects patterns of selective abortion. Pollination experiments in two Yucca filamentosa populations revealed that both pollen quantity (large/small) and quality (self/one-outcross/two-outcross donors) affected fruit retention, seed set, and seedling growth rate. A pollen load larger than that typically provided by moths increased fruit retention. Outcrossed flowers were selectively retained to fruit, and flowers receiving a mixed outcross load were selectively retained over single-outcross flowers in one population. Seed set per fruit was significantly lower with a small pollen load, and lower when a single outcross source was used than in self or mixed outcross treatments. Outcross seeds germinated at a greater frequency and produced plants that grew faster than those that resulted from self-pollination, yielding a cumulative inbreeding depression of 0.73-0.81. Early fruit abortion is a major mortality factor to the yucca moth's progeny, and the female can increase retention by providing high-quality pollinations. Nonetheless, individual pollen loads are usually below levels that provide higher probability of retention, and commonly observed geitonogamous pollinations also appear to conflict with expected strong selection on moths to provide pollinations that give high retention probability. Other factors, such as combined visits by multiple females, floral position effects on retention, and possible costs of moth movement among plants, may interact with the pollination-mediated effects in molding female behavior. These factors do not diminish the potential of selective abortion to promote evolutionary stability of the interaction as they do not provide the moth with a mechanism to circumvent selective abortion.",Fruit retention | Mutualism | Pollen load | Pollination | Pollinator behavior | Progeny performance | Seed quality | Selective abortion | Tegeticula | Yucca | Yucca moth,NA,NA

The stands studied are located in the forest surrounding Lake Duparquet in northwestern Quebec and originated from eight successive fires representing a chronosequence of 230 yr. Tree composition and ecological characteristics were assessed in 313 quadrats distributed systematically within the burned areas; one representative stand per fire, presenting the average species composition for clay soils with a moderate moisture regime, was selected for detailed dendroecological analysis. All living and dead stems (> 1 cm dbh) were mapped and cut down in a 20 x 20 m quadrat. Cross sections collected at the root collar and at every meter were analyzed using standard dendrochronological techniques. The age of the stand before the last fire was estimated using snags and logs located in, or in the vicinity of, each quadrat. A PCA (principal-components analysis) ordination of all quadrats shows a gradual change with time since fire from stands dominated by hardwoods (aspen and paper birch), to mixed stands with an important white spruce component, to coniferous stands dominated by balsam fir and white cedar. Despite variations in the age and composition of the stands before the last fire, they generally follow a common pattern characterized by post-fire hardwood dominance. Age structures show successive waves of aspen, birch, and fir recruitment, corresponding respectively to the post-fire cohort, the gradual dismissal of the first aspen cohort, and spruce budworm outbreaks. Each of these waves corresponds to a decrease in hardwoods and an increase in the conifer component of the stand. Suppressed white spruce individuals, recruited primarily as part of the post-fire cohort, experienced growth releases following the dismissal of the first aspen cohorts. White cedar increased in abundance late in succession and tended to outcompete balsam fir in old coniferous stands severely affected by spruce budworm outbreaks. The observed multi-cohort process contrasts with the simple replacement of hardwoods by conifers as suggested by observations of differential growth rates. The patchy distribution of conifer regeneration together with the poorer ability of conifers to rapidly fill gaps may explain why hardwoods are successfully recruited. This gradual rate of change, occurring over several generations, results in the maintenance of an important hardwood component in most stands even in the absence of fire. After 230 yr, stands are still mainly composed of trees originating from punctuated events such as fire, the gradual dismissal of the first aspen cohort, or spruce budworm outbreaks. This contrasts with old-growth boreal forests dominated by spruces in which a quasi-equilibrium is maintained by small canopy disturbances. The study confirms that changes in forest composition observed while sampling portions of the landscape originating from different fires may be explained by simple processes occurring at the stand level.",Aspen | Balsam fir | Boreal forest disturbance regimes | Canopy gaps | Dendroecology | Forest fire | Forest succession | Mixed woods | Old-growth forest | Post-disturbance species dynamics | Southern Quebec boreail forest | Spruce budworm | Stand dynamics,all,All Open Access

We measured differences in food abundance by comparing the biomass of surface-dwelling invertebrates in large and small fragments. We also determined whether food supply was associated with foraging efficiency and reproductive performance in an area-sensitive, ground-foraging insectivore, the Eastern Yellow Robin (Eopsaltria australis), breeding at these same sites. Invertebrate biomass in the small fragments was about half of that in the large fragments. Incubating female robins received 40% less food from males, females left their nests more frequently to forage on their own, and nestlings were provisioned with less food in the small fragments. Females in the small fragments also had a shorter breeding season (by three weeks), laid eggs that were 7% lighter, and reared smaller nestlings. Because our measures of invertebrate biomass, foraging efficiency, and reproduction produced corresponding results, we conclude that Eastern Yellow Robins experienced relative food shortage in these small fragments.

No distinct trophic structure could be derived from measurements of δ13C. In contrast, when the δ15N values of all animal species were grouped together, the hypothesis of an isotopically similar diet was rejected. Therefore, the community spreads over more than one trophic level and was subdivided into detritivores and predators. The potential detritivore food sources in the forest litter and soil showed a variety of isotopic ratios. Despite this fact, the variance of the isotopic ratios of the detritivorous species was not larger than what could be expected from interspecific variability of trophic isotopic enrichment alone. This was also the case for the predators in most of the sample sets. However, in some cases this variance was significantly larger, due to a small number of species with high δ15N values. The δ15N values of the detritivores indicated that the mean δ15N value of their food was close to that measured for the superficial litter layers. The difference in δ15N between detritivores and predators was highly significant and never significantly different from the value expected for one trophic transfer (3.4‰), although often slightly higher. Most of the litter macro-invertebrate community we studied can therefore be described as belonging to two trophic levels, one feeding on the superficial litter layers (or on soil fractions that have a similar δ15N value), and a second trophic level feeding on the first, with some indication of intraguild predation among the predators. Between-site differences of up to 7‰ were found for δ15N in the litter, and the δ15N values of the whole animal community were shifted in accordance with the local value of the litter δ15N.

Based on the asymptotic population growth rate λ, calculated from a projection matrix model as a descriptor of the population dynamics, we analyze published data of 49 species of birds to determine how λ is influenced by variation in different demographic traits. Across species, the mean elasticity of the adult survival rate was significantly larger than the mean elasticity of the fecundity rate. The contribution of the fecundity rate to the population growth rate increased with increasing clutch size and decreasing adult survival rate, while the greatest contribution of adult survival rate occurred among long-lived species that matured late and laid few eggs. This represents a continuum from 'highly reproductive species' at one end to 'survivor species' at the other end. In addition, a high contribution of adult survival rate was found in some relatively long-lived species with early age at maturity (and a large clutch size) which was assumed to represent a bet-hedging strategy, i.e., producing a large number of offspring in some occasional good years. In a retrospective analysis, interspecific differences in the effects of actual temporal variation in adult survival rate and fecundity rate on the variability of λ were analyzed. These effects are expected to be large when the variance or the sensitivity of the trait is large. Because there was a negative relationship among species, both for the adult survival rate and the fecundity rate between the variability and the sensitivity of the trait, contribution of a trait to the variance in λ decreased with sensitivity. Similarly, within species, less temporal variation was found in traits with high elasticities than in traits with less contribution to λ. In some species, covariance among matrix elements also influenced the contribution of a demographic trait to λ. Monitoring schemes of bird demography should be designed in such a way that temporal variances and covariances among demographic traits can be estimated. Furthermore, it is important in such schemes to include data from a combination of traits that either have large sensitivities or high temporal variation.",Birds | Demography | Elasticity analysis | Life history variation | Perturbation analysis | Population dynamics | Population growth rate | Projection matrix model | Temporal variation,NA,NA

This is especially true of processes mediated by the sense of olfaction, because wind and water currents control the dispersal of odor signals and act as ancillary cues during odor plume following. In the field, we examined how variations in the physical and chemical properties of odor plumes would alter the foraging behavior of the blue crab Callinectes sapidus, a common predator/scavenger in tidal marsh creeks in the southeastern United States. We video-recorded responses of naturally foraging crabs to odor plumes of varying composition and odor release rate (characteristic of clams of differing size). During each trial we presented crabs with an experimental plume that was a mixture of fluorescein-dyed seawater and clam mantle fluid, oyster mantle fluid, or a suite of amino acids, and a control plume which consisted of dyed seawater only. In addition to manipulating the chemical composition and odor release rate of the plume, we allowed flow speed to vary naturally with the tide. We tested for effects of odor composition, odor release rate, and flow speed on the success (i.e., finding the target) and efficiency (i.e., search path direction) of blue crab foraging. Mantle fluid solutions and wounded prey items elicited active search and upstream walking, while control and amino acid solutions had no effect on crab behavior. Odors released at a low rate (either low volume flow or low concentration) elicited fewer responses from crabs, and the resulting search was less efficient and less successful than responses to odors released at higher rates. Ambient current speed also affected both search success and efficiency. There was a decline in search success when current speed in the tidal channel was below 1 cm/s; search success remained constantly high, however, when current speed was above this threshold. Search efficiency was directly proportional to ambient current speeds. Such relationships between hydrodynamic and chemical properties of the environment and foraging success and efficiency suggest that variation in the physicochemical environment can influence the detectability of prey and strategies employed by foragers.

The simulated richness curve generated in this way can be compared to an 'average' random curve composed of many such simulations. The comparison involves measuring the mean displacement (D) of the simulated curve from the average random curve. By repeating these steps a specified number of times, one can obtain a distribution of D values. The displacement of the actual species richness curve from the average random curve can also be determined and compared to the distribution of D values of the simulated random curves.

One clade has its center of diversity in New England and radiated very recently from three species to give the current 18. Although most of this radiation involved the creation of new species in the ancestral fish-lake habitat, at least two independent lineages invaded and adapted to a new habitat: ponds and lakes lacking fish but supporting large numbers of large predatory dragonflies. The other clade, with greatest diversity in the southeastern United States, contains species that inhabit only water bodies that support fish populations. This 'southeastern' clade diversified at a much slower and more steady pace within the fish-lake habitat than the 'New England' clade, but four speciation events in this clade appear to have occurred at the same time as the northern radiation. Combined with our current understanding of local community structure in fish and fishless lakes, these results indicate that most of the species in this regional assemblage were created by speciation mechanisms other than filling empty niches, which have resulted in many locally coexisting species that are very similar in their ecological characteristics. Damselflies in eastern North American ponds and lakes appear to exemplify features of both a regulated component of the littoral food web (i.e., a functional group) and an assemblage whose local community composition is influenced by nonadaptive macroevolutionary processes that have operated on a much larger regional scale.",Biogeography | Community assembly | Damselflies | Diversification | Enallagma | Odonata | Phylogeny | speciation,NA,NA

In the polygynous Great Reed Warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus), the variation in territory quality may be associated with nest site characteristics or food supply. In this study, we examined the probability of nest predation in Great Reed Warblers in relation to an indirect measure of territory quality (territory attractiveness rank as indexed by settlement order) and to several variables of nest site structure. Artificial nests with attached soft plasticine model eggs were placed in Great Reed Warbler territories of different attractiveness. Marks in the soft model eggs were compared to marks from possible predator species. Both inter- and intraspecific predators were found to prey upon eggs in artificial nests. Marsh Harriers (Circus aeruginosus) predominantly preyed upon artificial nests located in territories of low attractiveness, in low-density reed beds, and early in the season, Bitterns (Botaurus stellaris) and Water Rails (Rallus aquaticus) showed a preference for artificial nests located inside the reeds. When all types of predators of artificial nests were pooled, the probability of nest predation was lower in more attractive territories. This pattern was corroborated in an analysis of predation on real nests. In general, polygyny occurred in territories with a low rate of nest predation, whereas unmated males held territories where the risk of predation was high. The low rate of nest predation in attractive territories on average compensated secondary females for the cost associated with sharing a male (i.e., reduced male assistance when feeding nestlings). The polygyny threshold model has been around for several decades, however, only few studies have identified the factors that may compensate secondary females for the cost of sharing a mate.

Here we discuss the extension of elasticity analysis to populations with density-dependent demographic parameters and examine the circumstances in which the standard density-independent analysis gives useful information for populations that are, in reality, density dependent. In the presence of density dependence the fitness of one strategy depends upon what the rest of the population is doing. Elasticities of fitness must therefore be calculated using invasibility methods, and the resulting elasticities of the invasion exponent θ are not necessarily identical with elasticities of mean or equilibrium population size. The former are of interest in evolutionary studies; the latter in population management. If a population has a stable equilibrium and density dependence is a function of the total number of individuals in the population, then elasticities of fitness are equal to elasticities of λ, and elasticities of equilibrium population size are proportional to these. Even at equilibrium, elasticities of population size are not necessarily proportional to elasticities of λ when density dependence is a function of the number of individuals in only part of the population, as in populations regulated by competition between juveniles. Elasticities of λ are also a relatively poor guide to elasticities of population size when population numbers fluctuate. Thus, if density dependence operates at any stage in the life history, ignoring it can result in elasticity analyses that are a misleading guide for population management. In the presence of stochastic environmental variation, elasticities of λ calculated for the observed mean projection matrix are often a quite accurate approximation to elasticities of fitness, even when population fluctuations are large. An elasticity analysis on an observed mean projection matrix will often give useful information regarding selection pressures on individual demographic parameters, although this approximation usually performs poorly for populations with nonequilibrium dynamics. Whether one is interested in life history evolution or population management, the amount of work involved in carrying out a density-dependent elasticity analysis is small, relative to the amount of work involved in quantifying demographic parameters in the field populations. It will therefore usually be worth carrying out some nonlinear analyses using plausible patterns of density dependence and environmental stochasticity to ensure that an appropriate elasticity analysis is used.",Analysis | Demography | Density | Dependence | Elasticity analysis | Elasticity of fitness | Elasticity of population size | Population growth | Population viability | Projection matrix | Sensitivity analysis | Stochasticity of the environment,NA,NA

On an individual level, stress-induced variation in a trait may be related to the strength of stabilizing selection that acts on the trait. We experimentally examined sensitivity of mandibular development to stress in a free-living population of common Shrews (Sorex cinereus), a short-lived insectivore mammal with very limited dispersal and nearly continuous foraging activity. We found a strong increase in asymmetry in shrews born under stressful conditions. Increased asymmetry was associated with lower physiological condition in both control and stressed populations, although the effect of asymmetry on fitness was more pronounced under stressful conditions. Males' developmental stability was more sensitive to stressful conditions than developmental stability of females, suggesting that their apparently faster and more variable growth is more sensitive to stress than is growth of females.

Before the hurricanes in the winter flowering season in 1994-1995, fruit set of P. bahamensis was 100% for most shrubs. After a mild hurricane, in 1995-1996, fruit set was 48%. After the severe Hurricane Lili (Category 2) in 1996-1997, mean fruit set was only 11%. In both years after the hurricanes, lower fruit set reflected resource limitation. In 1996-1997 after Hurricane Lili, fruit set was severely reduced an additional 74% by pollination limitation. Pollination limitation was caused by declines of the two bird pollinators, Bananaquits and Bahama Woodstars. In 1994-1995, both species were frequent visitors to flowers, but in 1996-1997 these birds were rarely seen on the island. A concurrent mist-netting study indicated that Bananaquit populations were decimated after Hurricane Lili in 1996. Nectar removal was virtually absent, and pollen deposition on stigmas was low. In 1994-1995, 98% of the stigmas had received pollen by the end of floral life. In contrast, in 1996-1997, 51% of the flowers had received no pollen, supporting the conclusion that pollination limitation of fruit set was strong. There was no compensatory pollination by other pollinators, either other bird species or insects. These results indicate that severe hurricanes can affect fruit set directly through resource limitation and indirectly through reducing bird pollinators and causing pollination limitation of fruit set. Reduced fruit set after a hurricane could be especially disadvantageous because hurricanes can create sites for plant recruitment. Although resource limitation of fruit set may affect many plant species, bird-pollinated species may be faced with a double jeopardy of resource limitation of fruit set and pollination limitation of fruit set.

In every species, survival was positively related to RGR. Moreover, each species differed in the relationship of survival to RGR, and these differences were related to seed mass: at any given RGR, large-seeded, shade-tolerant species had higher survival than smaller-seeded, intolerant ones. Across species, in most light and N treatments, seed mass was positively related to young seedling survival, but RGR was not. In very low light the relative benefits of greater seed mass to survival were temporary. As seedlings aged, interspecific mortality rates became more dependent on observational shade tolerance rankings than on seed size, but mortality was still unrelated to RGR. Our results indicate potentially important interactions among light, N, and species that could influence regeneration dynamics. For young seedlings in deeply shaded microsites, N supply does not matter, and only shade-tolerant species survive due, in part, to large seeds and physiological traits other than RGR. In moderate shade, RGR is greater, and survival is high for all species, except that small-seeded, broad-leaved, intolerant species have low survival and RGR at low N supply. This suggests that broad-leaved shade-intolerant species compete more effectively in moderate shade on richer soils than on poorer soils.

On the other hand, unique ecological conditions on each island, sporadic colonizations and extinctions, plus new genetic variation would lead to island-specific host-parasite relationships. We examined the distribution of three parasitic taxa among avian host species on three islands in the Lesser Antilles: St. Lucia, Martinique, and Dominica. Blood protozoa of the genus Haemoproteus were found in 34% of host individuals examined.

Epithelial lesions characteristic of avian papilloma virus were recorded in 4% of host individuals on Martinique only. The pattern of infection with papilloma virus or Sarcocystis (significant island effect) indicated that host species on a particular island are linked in transmission webs of these parasites. Such island-specific associations suggest a role for either history or unique local ecology in host-parasite associations. There was a statistically significant interaction between island and species effects in the prevalence of Haemoproteus. This may stem from the independent evolution of host-parasite interactions in the different island populations. We were able to assess the extent of genetic divergence of the host species by analysis of mitochondrial ATPase 6,8 sequences. There was little genetic divergence between island populations of the host species. Therefore, the variation in Haemoproteus prevalence is not likely to be related to genetic differentiation of the host populations. Birds infected with Haemoproteus exhibited elevated leukocyte levels indicative of immunological control of the parasite. After statistically controlling for the intensity of Haemoproteus infection and host species, leukocyte levels varied significantly among islands on which the host resided.

The indicators of breeding success were the proportion of grouse hens with a brood and brood size. Two study areas (each 45 000 km2) in the boreal zone were selected for investigation.

The extent of landscape accounting best for variation in nesting success was an order of magnitude larger (~100 km2) than the area most probably used by a grouse female and her brood during the summer, which suggests that landscape-scale factors may override local factors such as track size and distance from edge. The proportion of grouse hens with a brood was lower in heavily fragmented landscapes than in more continuous forest landscapes whereas only minor differences in brood size were detected. We suggest that the most likely cause of the observed spatial correlation was higher nest predation by generalist predators in fragmented forest landscapes.

We further determine how the magnitudes of these effects depend on density of the prey species. We develop a foraging model that predicts a predator will reduce the growth of a focal prey species at low prey density but have little effect at high prey density. The model also predicts that presence of the predator will indirectly facilitate growth of a competitor of the focal species, and that this effect will be negligible at low, and maximal at high, focal species density. Thus it is precisely where the effect of the predator on the growth of the focal species is minimum that the indirect effect on the competitor is maximum. We tested these predictions using a system of three species/size classes of anuran larvae and a larval odonate predator (Anax longipes) in cattle watering tanks. By caging the predator we isolated its effect on foraging behavior of the anuran larvae from that of density reduction. We manipulated the density of small green frog larvae (Rana clamitans) while holding density of small bullfrog (R. catesbeiana) and large green frog competitors constant. Small green frogs and bullfrogs reduce their activity in the presence of caged Anax whereas the large green frogs do not. Results were in accord with the model predictions. Caged Anax reduced small green frog and bullfrog growth at low small green frog density but had no effect at high small green frog density. In contrast, caged Anax had a positive effect on large green frog growth, but this effect was negligible at low small green frog density and maximal at high small green frog density. The results also showed that the indirect effects of the predator that arose through reduction in prey foraging activity were comparable in magnitude to those expected through reduction in prey density. These results suggest that the nonlethal effects of a predator on prey and, indirectly, on competitors of their prey, can be large in magnitude and depend strongly on relative species densities.",Anax | Anuran larvae | Behavioral induction | Density-dependence | Density-mediated indirect interaction | Odonate | Predation risk | Rana | Trait-mediated indirect interaction,all,All Open Access

GAMs are used to model trend as a smooth, nonlinear function of time, and they provide a framework for testing the statistical significance of changes in abundance.

Condition-specific competition, wherein competitive superiority varies with the abiotic environmental gradient, has been proposed as the major structuring force behind such distributions. However, few studies have elucidated the underlying mechanisms, such as behavioral and demographic processes. We conducted laboratory experiments to examine the effects of temperature on interspecific competition between two stream salmonid fishes, Salvelinus malma and S. leucomaenis. The two species have a largely allopatric altitudinal distribution on Hokkaido Island, Japan, proposed to be the result of temperature-mediated competition. We tested predictions that at a higher temperature (12°C), S. leucomaenis would dominate over S. malma in aggressive interactions, foraging performance, growth, and survival, but become subordinate at a lower temperature (6°C). Indeed, S. leucomaenis initiated a greater number of aggressive acts, attained greater food intake and greater growth, and finally excluded S. malma at the higher temperature. Although the two species initiated a similar number of aggressive acts and foraged equally well at the lower temperature, S. leucomaenis achieved a higher growth rate than S. malma; however, the latter eventually became numerically dominant. Clear competitive release in allopatry occurred for S. malma only at the higher temperature, providing direct evidence of condition-specific asymmetric competition. The lower distribution boundary of S. malma in Hokkaido streams may therefore be determined by temperature-mediated condition-specific competition. However, mechanisms determining the upper distribution boundary of S. leucomaenis could not be fully explained by the competitive results at lower temperature, but required an understanding of how effects of competition interacted with species-specific physiological traits. Thus, species distributions along an environmental gradient cannot be solely explained by a simple model of condition-specific competition without considering mechanistic linkages among behavioral and physiological responses to the environment, resource use, and demographic processes.",Altitudinal distributions | Competition | Condition-specific competition | Growth rates | Mechanistic approaches | Size-dependent mortality | Stream salmonids | Survival analysis | Temperature and competitive exclusion,NA,NA

In-stream LWD loads, relatively stable in undisturbed riparian zones, fluctuated sharply under catastrophic disturbance. Peak channel loads associated with natural perturbation occurred ~30 yr after the event while debris volumes under clear-cutting immediately declined. The postevent recruitment and in-stream LWD stocks of all disturbance scenarios eventually fell below undisturbed conditions, requiring decades to recover historical volumes. Catastrophic disturbances induced such steep oscillations in riparian LWD load that the systems experiencing frequent large-scale perturbations never achieved a long-term steady state, as some have postulated. Because of the inflation in cumulative LWD delivery, it may prove advantageous to encourage (or imitate) some catastrophic disturbance in forests along streams noticeably depauperate of LWD.",Catastrophic disturbance | Clearcut | CWD model | Fire | Forest Vegetation Simulator | Individualistic mortality | Large woody debris | Old-growth | Spruce beetle | Spruce-fir,NA,NA

We experimentally varied species evenness and the identity of the dominant plant species in an old field of Quebec to test whether plant productivity would increase with increasing levels of evenness, and whether relationships would be invariant with respect to species identity. Total and belowground biomass increased linearly with increasing levels of evenness after one growing season. These relationships did not depend on the identity of the dominant species. Relationships between aboveground biomass and evenness varied and depended on the identity of the dominant. Our results are largely consistent with the idea that human-influenced reductions in small-scale plant diversity, in this case evenness, will lead to indirect reductions in total primary productivity.

Denitrification is a major source of atmospheric N2O, an important greenhouse gas and a natural catalyst of stratospheric ozone decay. The major environmental controls on denitrification rate and the mole ratio of N2O produced during denitrification have been incorporated into mechanistic models, but these models are, in general, poor predictors of in situ N2O flux rates. We sampled two geomorphically similar soils from fields in southwest Michigan that differed in plant community composition and disturbance regime: a conventionally tilled agricultural field and a never-tilled successional field. We tested whether denitrifier community composition influences denitrification rate and the relative rate of N2O production [ΔN2O/Δ(N2O + N2)], or rN2O, using a soil enzyme assay designed to evaluate the effect of oxygen concentration and pH on the activity of denitrification enzymes responsible for the production and consumption of N2O. By controlling, or providing in nonlimiting amounts, all known environmental regulators of denitrifier N2O production and consumption, we created conditions in which the only variable contributing to differences in denitrification rate and rN2O in the two soils was denitrifier community composition. We found that both denitrification rate and rN2Ω differed for the two soils under controlled incubation conditions. Oxygen inhibited the activity of enzymes involved in N2O production (nitrate reductase, Nar; nitrite reductase, Nir; and nitric oxide reductase, Nor) to a greater extent in the denitrifying community from the agricultural field than in the community from the successional field. The Nar, Nir, and Nor enzymes of the denitrifying community from the successional field, on the other hand, were more sensitive to pH than were those in the denitrifying community from the agricultural field. Moreover, the denitrifying community in the soil from the successional field had relatively more active nitrous oxide reductase (Nos) enzymes, which reduce N2O to N2, than the denitrifying community in the agricultural field. Also, the shape of the rN2O curve with increasing oxygen was different for each denitrifying community. Each of these differences suggests that the denitrifying communities in these two soils are different and that they do not respond to environmental regulators in the same manner.

To test this hypothesis I manipulated snail densities in Bolinas Lagoon, California, to estimate their effects on, and responses to, food resources. For two size classes of each snail species I quantified (1) the effect of intraspecific density on food availability, and (2) the growth response of each size class to different food levels. These relationships were used to generate predictions of the exploitative competitive effect of each snail on the other species. These predictions were tested against direct measurements of the effect of interspecific competition on snail tissue growth using field experiments. The observed values of snail growth matched well the predicted relationships, suggesting that exploitative competition does occur. Although the two snails did not differ in their effect on resource levels at any experimental snail density, the introduced snail was always more efficient at converting limited resources to tissue growth. Similar results were obtained in three different experimental periods. Batillaria's enhanced resource conversion efficiency provides a sufficient explanation for its successful invasion and subsequent exclusion of Cerithidea. Theoretically, conversion efficiency of resources should be just as important as resource suppression and uptake to exploitative competitive ability, but it is rarely examined experimentally.

Mark-resighting data were collected on 1334 adult parrotlets over a decade. We expected adult survival to be low because this parrot lays a large clutch (mean = 7 eggs), is a cavity nester, and breeds in a highly seasonal environment. A two-age-class term in local survival was nonsignificant, indicating that an age or transience effect was unimportant. Local survival of males did not vary annually, but 19.3% of the yearly variation in female survival was explained by rates of nest loss during stages when females were incubating or brooding young. The overall local survival rate of parrotlets (φ = 0.565) was identical to temperate hole-nesting species of the same body size but was lower than that of tropical birds that lay smaller clutches. However, we also detected considerable heterogeneity in parrotlet survival. Females and males that were sighted but did not breed comprised a mean 23.5% and 52.9% of our population, respectively. Using multistate models, we found that breeders had significantly higher probabilities of local survival (φ = 0.678 vs. 0.486), of retaining their status as breeders (Ψ = 0.719 vs. 0.279), and of detection (p = 0.997 vs. 0.375) than did nonbreeders.

We recorded the postbreeding behavior (keep the territory, share it with juveniles, or bequeath it to juveniles) of mothers from 485 litters, and monitored the fates of eight cohorts of weaned juveniles (680 individuals). The proportion of mothers that bequeathed their territory to one of their offspring was roughly one-third of that keeping or sharing it. Breeding dispersal was a recurrent phenomenon that characterized a fraction of the population of reproductive females every year. Dispersing females did not improve the quality of their breeding environment. In contrast, by leaving their territory, mothers allowed some offspring to stay on the natal site, which increased juvenile survival. Breeding dispersal by female red squirrels was thus a form of parental investment. Dispersing females were older than others, had higher numbers of juveniles at weaning, and moved their breeding sites more frequently after reproducing when food availability was high. These patterns are consistent with the major predictions of parental investment theories. We detected no difference in survivorship or future reproduction between dispersing and resident mothers.

As is true for all the hyperdiverse soil taxa, the determinants of their diversity and species composition are virtually unexplored. This experiment tests whether heterogeneity of the litter habitat is a determinant of their local diversity, and whether litter composition is a determinant of their species composition. At a single site of temperate deciduous forest at the Coweeta Hydrological Laboratory in the mountains of North Carolina, USA, natural litterfall was excluded from a series of 42 1-m2 plots and, for three consecutive years, replaced with treatment litters that varied in their composition and complexity. Plots of pure yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), and red oak (Quercus rubra) litter comprised the monotypic or simple litter treatments. Two complex litters included a mixture of these three litter species and a mixture of seven litter species with pieces of small woody debris. Monotypic litters developed profiles of reduced thickness that contained lower numbers of invading roots and less humic and arthropod fecal material. Over 3 yr, oribatid abundance and richness declined substantially and to a similar degree in all simple litter treatments, though the dominant species, Oppiella nova, was unaffected by litter simplification. Similarity of species composition increased markedly among replicates within each litter treatment for two sectors of the assemblage: the large, litter-dwelling species and the endophagous and wood-associated species. Species composition among small litter-dwellers was unresponsive to litter type. Several characteristics of monotypic-litter habitats potentially contributed to the erosion of the oribatid assemblage. Loss of structure in monotypic litter likely led to reduced and less hospitable physical living space. It appeared to reduce recruitment of roots and retention of humic and fecal material in the litter layer. Each monotypic litter contained only a subset of the structural microhabitats that serve as refugia for eggs and juveniles. Finally, the synchronized decomposition of uniform substrates could have led to a 'boom-bust' economy in microbial resources that was unfavorable to oribatid mites and their conservative life histories.",Decomposition | Habitat heterogeneity | Leaf litter | Microarthropods | Oppiella nova | Oribatid mites | Red oak | Species composition | Species diversity | Sugar maple | Yellow birch,NA,NA

Thus, the understory vegetation in all patch types competed with tree seedlings. However, patch x clipping interactions were either absent or could not explain the greater inhibition of seedling establishment by bluestem or aspen than by horsetail. The strong inhibitory effect of bluestem and aspen on the establishment of spruce and birch seedlings is best explained by the unfavorable temperature and moisture microenvironments in these patches, rather than by differential competition in patches of bluestem, horsetail, or aspen.

Surprisingly, only a few studies have documented such trade-offs. In this paper, I present results from a selection experiment that demonstrates trade-offs in host plant use for a polyphagous spider mite. Although adaptation to a novel poor-quality host did not result in detectable costs on a favorable host, spider mites that had adapted to a poor-quality host lost their ability to tolerate the poor-quality host when they were reverted to the favorable host for several generations. Trade-offs in fitness on alternative hosts among herbivorous spider mites remains one of the classic empirical examples of constraints on the evolution of host range. Adaptation to the novel poor-quality host was not associated with adaptation to a related host-plant species or to particular host-plant chemicals that I assayed. Thus, the complexity of host-plant defenses may restrict host shifts to single species of novel host plants, and adaptive zone shifts onto entire groups of plants predicted by the Ehrlich and Raven Model may be rare. Spider mite performance was genetically associated with host-plant preference. Mites from the control population showed a significant preference for the favorable host plant, whereas mites adapted to the novel host plant showed no preference. Finally, although induced plant responses to herbivory in the poor-quality host decreased the fitness of unselected mites, induced responses resulted in higher fitness of adapted mites. These results suggest that spider mites that rapidly adapt to particular host plants can overcome constitutive and inducible plant defenses.","Cotton | Cucumber | Cucumis sativus | Cucurbitacins, reduction of mite fitness | Gossypium hirsutum | Herbivory | Host-range evolution and specialization | Induced plant resistance | Induced resistance, spider mites | Plant-insect interactions | Spider mites | Tetranychus urticae",all,All Open Access

The protracted weaning period provided the opportunity for examination of maternal care in relation to seasonal changes in the requirements of the mother-pup pair and environmental conditions. During the reproductive season 1995-1996, maternal care was investigated in terms of provisioning (maternal attendance) pattern while diving effort was investigated using time depth recorders in summer and winter. Maternal input was calculated in terms of the absolute rate of pup mass gain and, ultimately, pup growth rate and pup body mass at weaning. Lactating subantarctic fur seals perform one of the longest attendance cycles described in fur seals, spending on average 11-23 d at sea from summer to winter. The time mothers spend ashore suckling their pup is also long (~4 d) but remains constant throughout the year. Throughout the year, maternal input should be described as follows: mothers spending a long time at sea store a large amount of body reserves that provide them a good body condition. Consequently, they spend a long time ashore to transfer their body reserves to their pups. However, mothers spending short attendance periods increase the mass transfer efficiency, probably by decreasing their metabolic overhead. In summer, maternal care was mostly controlled by pup traits: maternal absences appeared to be controlled by pup fasting ability, while maternal input was controlled by pup ingestion ability, i.e., pup body size and the time the pup was suckling. In fall, pups were no longer limited in milk ingestion, and maternal input was mostly controlled by maternal traits (e.g., body length and experience). In winter, maternal input decreased as the pup became older despite an increase in maternal diving effort. We propose that, in winter, maternal requirements increase, probably in response to increasing costs of gestation and because of a decrease in food resource availability. Pups whose mother performed short and regular foraging trips grew faster and were heavier at weaning than other pups. This is discussed in term of pup fasting endurance and maternal experience. Finally, we found a window of foraging trip durations that maximizes the net rate of energy acquisition of the pup, suggesting that in subantarctic fur seals there may not exist one optimal maternal attendance pattern, but a range of patterns promoting the same maternal fitness.",Arctocephalus tropicalis | Foraging effort | Maternal care | Maternal input | Otariidae | Pinnipedia | Provisioning pattern | Pup growth rate | Subantarctic fur seal,NA,NA

Considerable year-to-year variation in temperature and precipitation occurred during the 10-yr study (1983-1992), with most extreme hot-dry conditions in 1988 during a 3-yr drought. Decreased stream temperature and reduced variation in temperature occurred downstream from the lake outlet because of increased groundwater inputs. Age-0 bass were captured in the stream in each of the eight years sampled, but bass abundance peaked in downstream reaches in 1988, concurrent with a large increase in the downstream density of age-0 chubs. Median length ratio of bass to chubs increased greatly in the 1988 drought year. The shift in relative length of bass and chubs during the drought was because chub length decreased in downstream areas, and bass shifted from feeding on invertebrates to feeding on chubs in downstream but not in upstream reaches. Comparison of bass and chub growth in the presence and absence of interspecific competition for invertebrate resources in an experimental stream revealed higher growth rates for chubs than for bass and little interspecific competition. Experiments in the artificial stream indicated that the presence or absence of chubs susceptible to bass predation had only marginal effects on bass survival, but growth rates of bass were substantially higher if chubs susceptible to predation were present. Only when chubs were present was the growth of individual bass dependent strongly on size, and this led to rapid divergence in the size distribution of bass in chubs vs. no-chubs treatments. Our results indicate that hot-dry climatic conditions associated with drought have potentially strong effects on size-structured trophic interactions between age-0 fish along lake-stream gradients. Hot-dry climatic conditions alter the spatial distribution of lake fish along temperature gradients in the stream, the reproductive success and synchrony of lake and stream fish development, and the eventual growth of predatory lake species.

In addition clones with larger domatia had significantly more mites than clones with smaller domatia. In the first experiment, the greater number of mites on plants with domatia relative to plants without domatia did not translate into reduced incidence of mildew; mites reduced mildew to very low levels in both treatments.

The advantages of plasticity seem particularly clear in organisms that show environmentally cued switches between alternative morphs. Information concerning the presence and nature of variation underlying the induction of these morphs, especially under field conditions, would be valuable. Here we examined the basis for variation underlying a predator-induced defense in an intertidal barnacle (Chthamalus anisopoma). In a previous experiment, juvenile barnacles were exposed to a predatory gastropod (Acanthina angelica). Some of these individuals were induced to develop as a predation-resistant form, but other individuals developed as the default, undefended morph. Here we tested two alternative explanations for this observation. One, the 'continuous-sensitivity' model, holds that there is normally distributed genetic variation for sensitivity to the cue. This model predicts that, given sufficient exposure to the predator, all individuals would develop as the induced form; it suggests that the previous findings resulted from an insufficient dose of the cue. The second model, the 'discontinuous-sensitivity' model, asserts that there is a genetic polymorphism for inducibility such that some individuals are not able to respond to the cue. This model suggests that, with repeated exposures to the predator, the resulting dose-response curve would reach an asymptote at <100%. We conducted a dose-response experiment in order to contrast these two alternatives, and to examine an expectation generated by life-history theory, namely, that repeated exposure to the predator would induce maturity at a younger age. With respect to the life-history prediction, we found no evidence to suggest that repeated exposure of juvenile barnacles to Acanthina affected the age at maturity, even though we found strong evidence for size-selective attack by this predator. With respect to variation underlying induction to the defended morph, we obtained a dose-response curve showing a significant asymptote at about 22% induction, which is inconsistent with the continuous-sensitivity model. Hence the results indicate the possibility of a developmental polymorphism in the barnacle, but no indication of life-history shifts in response to the predator.",Acanthina angelica | Barnacle | Chthamalus anisopoma | Conditional strategy | Defense | Genetic polymorphism | Gulf of California | Inducible defense | Life-history strategies | Phenotypic plasticity | Predator induced | Quantitative | Variation | Variation for inducibility,NA,NA

This community is dominated by halophytic forbs and is restricted to estuarine cobble beaches bordered by Spartina. Beds of Spartina can reduce mean water velocity by 50% and maximum velocity by nearly an order of magnitude, and they can substantially stabilize the cobble substrate. Specifically, I determined the importance of five life history stages (seed supply, seed germination, seedling emergence, seedling establishment, and adult survival) and four factors (water velocity, substrate stability, herbivory, and soil quality) in limiting lateral plant distribution. A seed addition experiment demonstrated that seedlings could only emerge behind Spartina, suggesting that seedling emergence is the proximate life history stage limiting adult distribution. Seed germination and adult survival do not appear to be limiting stages, at least in an absolute sense. Although seed supply was much greater (~10-100 x) behind Spartina, a substantial number of seeds were caught in seed traps placed between beds, suggesting that seed supply also does not limit absolute plant distribution. These results are supported by the presence of seedlings buried below the substrate surface between beds at the time when seedlings are naturally emerging behind beds. A manipulative field experiment was performed to test the effects of substrate instability, soil quality, and herbivory on seedling emergence between beds. Seeds of two annual cobble beach species (Suaeda linearis and Salicornia europaea) were added to plots behind Spartina and also between beds with and without substrate stabilization manipulations. This treatment was designed to stabilize the substrate in a manner that would not affect water velocity and soil characteristics or prevent access by potential herbivores. When not buffered by Spartina, seedlings of both species were only able to emerge and survive when the substrate was artificially stabilized.

In this study, we used exclosures to measure the impact of birds on arthropods in Guatemalan coffee plantations. Variation in shade management on coffee farms provides a gradient of similar habitats that vary in the complexity of vegetative structure and floristics. We hypothesized that shaded coffee plantations, which support a higher abundance of insectivorous birds, would experience relatively greater levels of predation than would the sun coffee farms. We found a reduction (64-80%) in the number of large (> 5 mm in length) but not small arthropods in both coffee types which was consistent across most taxonomic groups and ecological guilds.

In general, leaf chewers, phloem feeders, and leaf miners were more frequent on fertilized than on unfertilized trees. Predaceous arthropods were also more frequent on fertilized trees and were positively correlated with herbivore densities on Q. prinus saplings. Bird exclusion by itself had no detectable effects on the presence or absence of herbivores or predaceous arthropods. However, avian predation intensity on phloem feeders on Q. rubra did increase in the presence of nutrient addition to the bottom trophic level in July 1997.

The research presented here uses a survey, foraging observations, and a manipulative field experiment that test the included-niche competition hypothesis as a mechanism structuring the distribution of a generalist grasshopper, Melanoplus femurrubrum, along a food-resource gradient. A field survey of 10 old fields revealed a step-like reduction in M. femurrubrum abundance as the proportion of grass cover in the fields exceeded 60%. Furthermore, M. femurrubrum abundance and the abundance of a potential competitor, the grass specialist Chorthippus curtipennis, were negatively correlated among the fields. Experimental foraging observations showed that M. femurrubrum was a polyphagous feeder that preferred grass and consumed less grass in the presence of C. curtipennis. The pattern of grasshopper distribution and foraging data support an included-niche competition hypothesis. However, in a field experiment that manipulated C. curtipennis presence and absence and the composition of vegetation in which competition might occur, growth and mortality rates in M. femurrubrum did not respond to C. curtipennis competition. Performance was predicted to be lowest in grass-dominated conditions, those corresponding to the locations where M. femurrubrum does not exist. Instead, growth rates were highest and mortality rates were lowest in grass-only treatments. While the survey and foraging observations support the included-niche hypothesis, the experiments suggest that interspecific competition in adult grasshoppers is not the cause of the grasshopper distribution pattern. Similar experiments in western North American prairies indicate that interspecific competition can be important and that foraging ecology can be a good indicator of the interaction. This study contributes to the increasing body of knowledge about interspecific competition's role in organism distributions.

We hypothesized that the reduced acceptance of bark-reared scale may be due, in part, to reduced quantities of O-caffeoyltyrosine in their covers.

Using the barnacle-seaweed assemblage common in New England rocky intertidal habitats, I tested the hypothesis that species interactions switch from negative to positive at sites across the Cape Cod faunal barrier because of latitudinal variation in thermal stress and predation intensity between these regions. I manipulated Ascophyllum nodosum canopies in the high zone of two sites from each region and then determined the consequences for underlying Semibalanus balanoides recruits and adults for two years (January 1995 through January 1997). In both years, algal canopies reduced barnacle recruitment and growth rates at all sites but greatly increased survival rates only at the southern sites. When integrated in a demographic framework, these data showed that the reproductive fitness potential of individuals was facilitated by the algal canopy at southern sites but was reduced under similar conditions at northern sites. At southern sites, this was likely the result of buffering from physical stresses in the absence of predators. At northern sites, any buffering from physical stress was likely offset by an increase in mortality in the presence of predators. Interestingly, this variability in species interactions appeared to be associated with subtle variation in climate. Facilitation was evident only during 1995, the warmest year on record since 1900. In contrast, interactions were entirely negative during 1996, a slightly cooler year. These results suggest that species interactions in the intertidal zone may be sensitive to even subtle changes in climate.

In nitrogen (N)-limited environments the potential for bottom-up (plant resource) control is strong because plant quality may limit herbivore abundance. However, extremes in abiotic conditions, such as temperature and moisture, can mask such effects. I tested these hypotheses in an 8-yr field experiment that measured responses of plants and grasshoppers (Orthoptera) to N addition and exclusion of bird predators in an N-limited old-field prairie in east-central Minnesota. Plant biomass increased by 150-400%, and plant tissue N increased by 78% in response to N addition of 17 g · m-2 · yr-1. Total grasshopper density responded positively to N addition following warm years. However, multiple regressions suggested that grasshopper densities were related much more strongly to thermal conditions than to soil N. Bird exclusion yielded weak effects that varied over time and may have been influenced by compensatory responses of other grasshopper predators to bird exclosures. Grasshopper feeding guilds differed in the relationship between their in vivo dry-matter digestibility (DMD) and plant tissue N, and this physiological difference explained their drastically different responses to N addition. Plant quality (in vivo DMD) increased with plant tissue N for mixed-feeding grasshoppers, and accordingly, their density was positively correlated with soil N. Plant quality did not change with plant tissue N for grass feeders, and their densities were negatively correlated with soil N. Both guilds responded positively to warmer thermal conditions, but mixed-feeder densities were negatively related to previous year's precipitation, and grass-feeder densities were not affected by precipitation. These results support the hypothesis that bottom-up influences of insect herbivores can be important in N-limited systems but do not support the hypothesis that more productive environments necessarily support greater top-down influences. Thermal conditions may interact with or eliminate bottom-up effects. Furthermore, different guilds within the herbivore trophic level may be influenced differently by N addition, predators, and abiotic conditions. These results suggest that exploring the mechanisms of interaction between abiotic and trophic influences within components of food webs is likely to yield many new insights into the regulation of herbivore communities.",Abiotic factors | Community regulation | Food limitation | Grasshoppers | Grasslands | Insects | Nitrogen | Predation | Temperature,NA,NA

Free-tailed bats (Molossidae) show a distribution with a maximum latitudinal extension that appears to be intermediate between truly tropical and temperate-zone bat families. We therefore tested the hypothesis that Tadarida teniotis, the molossid species reaching the highest latitude worldwide (46°N), lacks the extreme physiological adaptations to cold that enable other sympatric bats to enter further into the temperate zone. We studied the metabolism of individuals subjected to various ambient temperatures in the laboratory by respirometry, and we monitored the body temperature of free-ranging individuals in winter and early spring in the Swiss Alps using temperature-sensitive radio-tags. For comparison, metabolic data were obtained from Nyctalus noctula, a typically hibernating vespertilionid bat of similar body size and convergent foraging tactics. The metabolic data support the hypothesis that T. teniotis cannot experience such low ambient temperatures as sympatric temperate-zone vespertilionid bats without incurring much higher energetic costs for thermogenesis. The minimum rate of metabolism in torpor was obtained at 7.5°-10°C in T. teniotis, as compared to 2.5°-5°C in N. noctula. Field data showed that T. teniotis behaves as a classic thermo-conforming hibernator in the Alps, with torpor bouts lasting up to 8 d. This contradicts the widely accepted opinion that Molossidae are nonhibernating bats. However, average body temperature 10°-13°C) and mean arousal frequency (3.4 d in one bat in January) appear to be markedly higher than in other temperate-zone bat species. At the northern border of its range, T. teniotis selects relatively warm roosts (crevices in tall, south-exposed limestone cliffs) in winter, where temperatures oscillate around 10°C. By this means, T. teniotis apparently avoids the risk of prolonged exposure to energetically critical ambient temperatures in torpor (<6.5°-7.5°C) during cold spells. Possibly shared by other Molossidae, the physiological pattern observed in T. teniotis may clearly be linked to the intermediate latitudinal extension of this bat family.",Bats | Body temperature | Ecophysiology | Metabolic rate | Molossidae | Radiotelemetry | Respirometry | Tadarida teniotis | Torpor | Winter foraging | Zoogeography,NA,NA

As an example of a pathosystem with metapopulation dynamics we investigated the impact of inbreeding in the host plant Silene alba on its interaction with the anthersmut fungus Microbotryum violaceum. Seeds from eight populations of S. alba were sampled, and five generations of sib mating resulted in 65 inbred lines, with inbreeding coefficients of f = 0, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, and 0.59 per line. In a first experiment these lines were tested for active, biochemical resistance against fungal infection, by artificially inoculating individuals. The percentage of infected individuals differed significantly among populations, lines, and inbreeding levels, and both population-by-inbreeding level and line-by-inbreeding level interactions were significant. The most striking result was the strong variance in inbreeding effects among lines; inbreeding resulted in increased resistance in some lines and decreased resistance in others. In a second experiment for 12 inbred lines, originating from one population, active resistance and flower traits associated with passive resistance (avoidance) to this insect-vectored, florally transmitted disease were measured. Significant inbreeding depression was demonstrated for petal size and nectar volume. Thus inbreeding might enhance avoidance of spore transmission by insects. For both active resistance and all flower traits, significant line-by-inbreeding level interactions were found. The results indicate that the effect of inbreeding on the interaction between host and pathogen in this pathosystem is unpredictable at the local population level, because: (1) strong genotypic differences in inbreeding effect exist for both active and passive resistance, making the effect of inbreeding at the population level dependent on the genotypic composition of the (founder) population; (2) effects of inbreeding on active and passive resistance were not correlated, making the net effect of inbreeding on field resistance unpredictable; and (3) in several lines, evidence for epistatic effects was found, making the effect of inbreeding dependent on the actual inbreeding level of the genotype.

Comparative studies conducted at multiple locations enable the general importance of processes to be assessed. However, spatial or temporal variation in the strength of local ecological relationships frequently makes it difficult to draw general conclusions, as increasing the extent of a study is likely to increase the physical and biological heterogeneity. To unravel the influence of differences in wave climate on local ecological interactions among adult and juvenile sandflat bivalves, an experiment was conducted at three sites in each of three harbors in the North Island of New Zealand. The selected sites covered a range of wind-wave exposures but were all mid-intertidal sandflats with macrobenthic communities dominated by bivalves. Four treatments were used: additions of 0, 15, 45, and 110 adults of the tellinid bivalve Macomona liliana. At each site a DOBIE wave gauge was used to provide time-series data on wave orbital speed at the seabed over the 35-d duration of the experiment. Significant experiment x location interactions indicated site-dependent variation in the strength and direction of treatment effects. However, multiple regression models based on site environmental characteristics were very successful in explaining differences between sites in the strength of experimental treatment effects (66-99% of the variance explained). We used the cube of the orbital wave velocity at the seabed (U(b)/3) as an index of energy dissipation by waves. Both the site average and maximum U(b)/3 were important variables explaining location-dependent treatment effects. Average U(b)/3 increased the strength of the negative effects of experimental additions of adult Macomona on juvenile bivalves, presumably by increasing the opportunity for juvenile bivalves to be resuspended by small waves and transported away from areas with high adult densities. Maximum U(b)/3 decreased the strength of the experimental effects, probably by increasing the purely passive transport of juveniles with sediment bedload and thus obliterating patterns in the distribution of juvenile bivalves relative to adult Macomona. Hence, different aspects of the wave climate influenced adult-juvenile interactions in different ways. Ambient density of adult Macomona around the experimental sites was also an important factor. This multisite experiment confirmed the importance of local adult-juvenile interactions and suggested ways in which these interactions are influenced by local environmental characteristics. Where the influence of such broad-scale variables can be identified, linking broad-scale information to small-scale studies that identify mechanisms can increase the generality of ecological experiments.",Adult-juvenile interactions | Bivalves | Broad-scale processes | Generality in field experiments | Intertidal sandflats | Local processes | Macomona | Meta-analysis | New Zealand | Postlarval movement | Scaling up | Wave climate,NA,NA

The subtle differences among the parameters of both approaches (sensitivities, elasticities, selection differentials, and gradients) can be confusing. I suggest a hierarchical framework for analysis using elasticity path diagrams, 'elastograms.' The framework combines selection analysis for the links between phenotypic traits (morphology, behavior) and fitness components (vital rates) with matrix analysis for the relationship between fitness components and population growth rate/fitness. Elasticities are often used to quantify the impact of a transition rate in the projection matrix on the population growth rate (λ). Elasticities for underlying fitness components such as fecundity and survival rates can be derived from their connection with the transition matrix entries. Yet other traits may affect λ due to a functional relationship with one or more components of fitness; for instance, the timing of flowering of a plant may affect its seed yield. Elasticities can also be used to quantify the effects of such traits: they can be interpreted as selection gradients for traits expressed on a proportional (mean-standardized) scale. 'Evolvabilities' (additive genetic variation in mean-standardized traits), rather than the heritabilities of traits, are needed to predict expected selection responses from the elasticities. Elasticities quantify the direct effect of a focal trait on λ. Integrated elasticities measure the impact of a trait through both its direct and indirect effects. This requires knowledge of the correlations among traits. Matrix projections and selection analysis (through multiple regression or path analysis) can be merged into an elasticity path diagram that summarizes the hierarchical relationships among traits and fitness. Such diagrams facilitate the identification of those traits that have the highest impact on the life cycle of the study organism and can be a tool to define the targets of management practices, as well as an aid in comparative life history research.",Demography | Elasticities | Elasticity path diagrams | Life history traits | Path analysis | Quantitative genetics | Selection | Selection gradients,NA,NA

We use these data under resampling simulations to establish random combinations of vital rates for a large number of matrix replicates and finally summarize results from the matrix replicates to estimate potential effects of each vital rate on λ in a probability-based context. Estimates of potential effects are based on a variety of summary statistics, such as frequency of replicates having the same vital rate of highest elasticity, difference in elasticity values calculated under simulated conditions vs. elasticities calculated using mean invariant vital rates, percentage of replicates having positive population growth, and variation in λ explained by variation in each vital rate. To illustrate, we applied LSA to vital rates for two vertebrates: desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) and Greater Prairie Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido). Results for the prairie chicken indicated that a single vital rate consistently had greatest effect on population growth. Results for desert tortoise, however, suggested that a variety of life stages could have strong effects on population growth. Additional simulations for the Greater Prairie Chicken under a hypothetical conservation plan also demonstrated that a variety of vital rates could be manipulated to achieve desired population growth. To improve the reliability of inference, we recommend that potential effects of vital rates on λ be evaluated using a probability-based approach like LSA.

At the level of individuals, historical effects in which past conditions influence future performance are particularly likely to occur in long-lived organisms that store resources between seasons and that form organs months or years before their elaboration. Such carryover mechanisms have been documented in several perennial plant species, but the implications for population processes are poorly known. In this study, I examine how the history of individuals influences their future performance, population dynamics, and life cycle structure in the long-lived herb Lathyrus vernus. Overall effects of plant history on population dynamics, in terms of growth rate, reproductive values, stable stage distribution, and elasticities, are examined by comparing an ordinary first-order matrix model with a second-order matrix model. In the latter, not only the present state of individuals, but also their past state is allowed to influence future fate. The results demonstrate that the history of individuals is sometimes important in models of population dynamics. Plant size change over a one-year period was negatively correlated among time intervals. Addition of the previous year's stage in population models shifted the growth rate from positive (λ = 1.010) to negative (λ = 0.986) and increased the proportion of small established individuals in the stable stage distribution. If historical effects are due to a capacity to buffer environmental variation and regain size or state, as in L. vernus, then recruitment contributes less and stasis more to population growth than suggested by ahistorical models. The presence of historical effects at the level of individuals, in any form, may have important consequences for population development and should be included in any interpretation of the life-cycle structure.",Carry-over mechanisms | Elasticity | Historical effects | Individual performance | Perennial plants | Population growth | Projection matrix model | Reproductive value | Second-order population models | Stable stage distribution,NA,NA

Laboratory microcosm experiments were conducted to characterize the feeding strategies of Ae. sierrensis larvae in the presence of multiple resource types (free-swimming protozoa and substrate-bound particulate material). In our experiment, we quantified the effects of varying instar numbers and profile, resource type, and refuge size on predation of protozoa. Refugia were explicitly modeled in our microcosms, representing the interstitial spaces of leaf litter and the wood lining of natural tree holes. Results from these microcosm experiments suggested that: (1) Even in the absence of larvae, the majority of protozoa resided in the small-volume, resource-rich refugia. There was, however, a strong nonlinear and negative relationship between larval densities in the upper compartment and the protozoan densities in the refuge, suggesting that there was continual movement of protozoa between the two spaces. (2) Fourth instars harvested resources by filter-feeding at a higher rate than second instars. (3) As the level of substrate-bound particulate food was increased, the predation pressure by filter-feeding on the protozoa decreased. (4) As the refuge volume increased, the predation pressure on the protozoa decreased. We constructed a three-state-variable mathematical model describing the generalist feeding behavior of Ae. sierrensis larvae. The model system, with constant predator densities and two prey groups, exhibited full cooperativity; i.e., an increase in protozoa density resulted in a shift toward predation by filter feeding, while an increase in substrate-bound resources resulted in a shift toward predation by browsing.

We considered spatial scales ranging from 1 m2 to 1 ha, and temporal scales ranging from 1 to 32 yr. Over the 32-yr study period there were six episodes of very high seedling recruitment (masts) at intervals ranging from 4 to 10 yr. Less than 2% of new recruits were found in the nine censuses in other years. We found no significant correlations between the numbers of seedlings per census and either seasonal or annual rainfall, number of dry months per year, or El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events but found two correlations with mean seasonal air temperatures in the years preceding flowering. There were long-term changes in abundance in both time and space. In 1965 there were 163 seedling-sized plants in two dense patches, whereas in 1996, there were 4000 in 15 patches. Once a new patch became established, seedlings recruited there in each succeeding mast episode. Adult trees varied in their production of seedlings. Only 25% of the trees in the sample analyzed participated in all mast years; others had few seedlings for up to 28 yr before beginning to produce many seedlings. Seedlings were shade tolerant. They grew extremely slowly in the shaded understory, mean height only doubling in 27 yr. They were also quite long-lived; 6% of seedlings recruited in 1969 were still alive 27 yr later. There was little effect of natural enemies on seeds or seedlings. We found weak positive and negative effects of density on seed germination, seedling mortality, and growth. Mortality rates of Chrysophyllum seedlings did not show any trends with time, nor with distance from conspecific adults. These results suggest that abundance of older stages is determined by recruitment as well as subsequent growth and mortality. Mortality rates of seedlings of species other than Chrysophyllum decreased with distance from adult Chrysophyllum trees. Under present conditions, the Chrysophyllum population may be increasing in relation to that of other species, perhaps leading to a reduction in tree diversity in this tropical rainforest.","Chrysophyllum | Dispersal limitation | Masting | Rain forest | Recruitment limitation | Recruitment, episodic | Recruitment, seedling | Supply-side ecology | Tropical",NA,NA

Like a traditional matrix model, the integral projection model provides estimates of the asymptotic growth rate, stable size distribution, reproductive values, and sensitivities of the growth rate to changes in vital rates. However, where the matrix model represents the size distributions, reproductive value, and sensitivities as step functions (constant within a stage class), the integral projection model yields smooth curves for each of these as a function of individual size.

The matrix and integral models yield similar estimates of the asymptotic growth rate, but the reproductive values and sensitivities in the matrix model are sensitive to the choice of stage classes.

In a field study, the recruitment rate from the sediments to water of two algal species (Gonyostomum semen and Peridinium sp.) was higher at low than at high biomass of herbivorous zooplankton. In complementary laboratory experiments, where abiotic conditions were standardized, the presence of live, as well as dead, herbivores reduced the recruitment rate of both Gonyostomum semen and Peridinium sp. These results suggest that some algal species are able to adjust their recruitment behavior in response to the likely risk of being grazed. Together with morphological adaptations (e.g., spines and large size) common among many algal species, such an induced behavioral response is an important adaptation to reduce cell mortality. As shown in this study, this behavioral response may have a profound impact on dominance and succession patterns in algal communities. The high zooplankton biomass observed during the first year of the field study was caused by failed reproduction of the dominant fish species in the lake (roach, Rutilus rutilus).

Phenotypic benefits and costs of induction would indicate that such plasticity in defense could be adaptive (i.e., that phenotypes matched to their environmental conditions have higher relative fitness than unmatched phenotypes). However, few studies to date have investigated the benefits and costs of induction in the same system. In this study, induced responses of Lepidium virginicum to herbivory reduced feeding by generalist noctuid caterpillars in choice and no-choice experiments. Induced plant responses to herbivory were correlated with an increase in the number of trichomes per leaf and an increase in the diversity of the putatively defensive chemical compounds, glucosinolates, present in the foliage of damaged plants compared to undamaged controls. Induction did not affect the feeding behavior of the larvae of the specialist butterfly, Pieris rapae. In field experiments, induction reduced natural colonization of plants by aphids compared to both unmanipulated controls and controls that were damaged (but not induced) by clipping a leaf from the plant using a pair of scissors. Induced plants were more likely to survive in the field than clipped plants, a result that suggests a net fitness benefit of induction when leaf tissue removal was controlled. In experiments conducted in the absence of herbivores, damage induced responses did not reduce the root or shoot biomass of plants grown at low density. At high plant density, induction was associated with both reduced root biomass and increased aboveground growth, suggesting that induction may cause an allocation shift, rather than a loss of total biomass.

Furthermore, feeding-induced resistance provides the mechanistic basis for many cases of delayed interspecific competition, whereby previous feeding by one species diminishes the performance of other herbivores which attack the same plant later in the season. This phenomenon, however, has been very poorly investigated for sap-feeding insects. The results we present here for salt marsh-inhabiting planthoppers (Prokelisia dolus and P. marginata) provide one of the few known examples of delayed, plant-mediated interspecific competition between two sap-feeding insects. Three lines of experimental evidence from the laboratory, field cages, and open field plots provide support for the detrimental effects of previous feeding by one planthopper species on the subsequent survival and performance of the other. Laboratory experiments showed that prior feeding on cordgrass by one congener resulted in reduced performance of the other in the following generation. However, the effect was asymmetric. Prior feeding by P. dotus resulted in prolonged development and reduced body size (a correlate of fecundity) in P. marginata, whereas only development was protracted in P. dolus when plants were previously exposed to P. marginata. Consequently, P. dolus appears to be the superior competitor in the context of delayed, plant-mediated interactions. The negative effects of previous feeding by P. dolus on the development time, body size, and survival of P. marginata obtained in the laboratory were confirmed both in cages and on cage-free islets of cordgrass in the field. Feeding-induced reductions in host-plant quality by P. dolus may provide additional impetus for P. marginata to migrate from shared habitats on the high marsh to nutritionally superior plants in the low marsh rarely occupied by P. dolus. The mechanism underlying the delayed competitive effects between Prokelisia planthoppers is most likely diminished plant nutrition, because feeding by P. dolus significantly reduces the concentration of essential amino acids in cordgrass. The asymmetry of plant-mediated competition between the Prokelisia species may be due to the ability of P. dolus to better tolerate feeding-depleted levels of plant nitrogen via compensatory feeding. Even though these two planthoppers do not suffer significant fitness reductions during contemporaneous interactions, they compete severely in the context of feeding-induced plant resistance which is expressed later in the season. This result, coupled with the fact that most studies of interspecific interaction between herbivorous insects are contemporaneous, indicates that interspecific competition may be profoundly underestimated as a structuring force in phytophagous insect communities.","Competition | Interspecific competition | Intraspecific competition | Plant nutrition | Plant resistance, induced | Plant-mediated | Planthopper | Prokelisia dolus | Prokelisia marginata | Salt marsh | Sap-feeding insect | Spartina",NA,NA

Franco) were estimated by measuring annual N input in litter, N content of the forest floor, and net N mineralization rate in the forest floor. Rates of C and N turnover were estimated from the litterfall:forest floor ratio. The amount of N returned in litter increased as soil N capital increased. The increase in litter N content resulted from both increased litter mass (C content) and increased N concentration in litter. Despite the greater litter input, forest floor mass was smaller at N-rich sites, indicating more rapid turnover of the forest floor on N-rich sites. There was a positive relationship between fractional annual loss of N from the forest floor and soil N capital. Therefore, even without changes in tree species composition, sites with greater soil N capital returned more N in annual litterfall and had faster turnover of N in the forest floor. Fractional annual loss of C also increased with increasing soil N capital, indicating faster decomposition on N-rich sites. The rate of net N mineralization during laboratory incubations of the forest floor was not correlated with soil N capital or N concentrations of litter, but was related to the C:N ratio of the forest floor. Net N mineralization was appreciable only at two sites where forest floor C:N ratios were <35.

Habitat subdivision occurs both on the patch scale and on the larger spatial scale of sites due to patchy successional patterns. Itame distribution is patchy within areas colonized by Dryas. This research combines observational and experimental approaches to examine individual movement behavior, immigration, and emigration rates of both caterpillars and adult females at the scale of discrete Dryas patches. Itame caterpillars will cross bare ground separating plant patches; however, movement of caterpillars on bare ground was more restricted than predicted by a correlated random walk due to large turning angles which led to area-restricted search. Caterpillar immigration into patches previously cleared of Itame is usually low and is negatively affected by patch isolation when local Itame densities are high. Caterpillar emigration is also significantly greater from patches with high Itame density. Immigration of females, which have reduced wings, was positively influenced by patch isolation and negatively influenced by the presence of a barrier preventing adult females from walking into patches. All females emigrate from their point of emergence and continue moving as they oviposit. Females lay eggs singly on foliage, in leaf litter, and on rocks under and surrounding Dryas patches. Significantly more eggs are laid off of Dryas patches than within Dryas patches, but this is not a result of concentration of searching effort off of Dryas patches. Females move greater distances than predicted by a correlated random walk. Movement parameters combined with oviposition parameters lead to the prediction that the average female will lay all of her eggs within 5-15 m of her starting point. Restricted movement appears to demographically isolate sites separated by distances of as little as 0.5 km. Limited between-site dispersal may link these populations into metapopulations and may explain patchy regional patterns of distribution. Within sites, densities are likely to build up in smaller patches and subdivided habitat due to preferential oviposition on bare ground. These smaller patches may in turn be disproportionally important for population processes due to their contribution of dispersers through density-dependent emigration within and between sites. Thus, this research demonstrates how limited dispersal can impact patterns of distribution, abundance, and population structure in a natural system.",Correlated random walk | Dryas drummondii | Emigration | Habitat patchiness | Immigration | Insect dispersal | Itame andersoni | Metapopulation | Oviposition behavior,NA,NA

Itame inhabits a subdivided habitat created by patches of its host plant Dryas drummondii (Rosaceae) growing on bare ground. Habitat subdivision occurs both on the patch scale and on the larger spatial scale of sites due to patchy successional patterns. I surveyed five distinct sites to examine the relationships between plant patch size, patch isolation, Itame density, and pupal mass. I censused Itame caterpillar density in over 200 plant patches for 1-3 years and found that densities were highest in medium-sized Dryas patches and lowest in very large 'carpets' of Dryas. Isolated and small patches had high variance in density leading to lower mean densities. In contrast to density, pupal masses were highest in the largest patches, indicating a positive effect of patch size on individual fecundity, which was highly correlated with pupal mass. Results from the survey, as well as experimental manipulations of density, showed that Itame density had a negative effect on pupal mass. By using observed caterpillar densities and pupal masses to predict egg densities, I determined that the variance in pupal masses between patches was not sufficient to explain the observed density-dependent population dynamics. Thus it appears that caterpillar density itself has more important population-level impacts than does pupal mass. Contrary to predictions in the literature, this leads to the conclusion that smaller plant patches and the subdivided habitat that they constitute are disproportionally important for Itame populations. Temporal population dynamics were fairly synchronous between Dryas patches within sites but asynchronous between sites separated by >0.5 km, suggesting that sites may form distinct populations of Itame.

In contrast, studies that describe increased herbivory due to heterospecific neighbors (associational susceptibility) are relatively rare. In this study we document associational susceptibility among hosts of the fall cankerworm (Alsophila pometaria). Cottonwoods (Populus angustifolia x P. fremontii) located under box elder (Acer negundo) were colonized by two to three times more cankerworms, and suffered two to three times greater defoliation than cottonwoods growing under mature cottonwoods, or cottonwoods growing in the open. This associational pattern reflects fall cankerworm's strong preference for box elder over cottonwood: egg densities were 26 times greater on box elder than cottonwood, first instar larvae consumed 75 times more box elder than cottonwood in larval palatability trials, and fourth instar larvae consumed three times more box elder than cottonwood. In terms of larval performance, first instar larvae exhibited approximately six times greater mortality and 40% slower development time on cottonwood relative to box elder, whereas fourth instar larval performance did not differ between the hosts. Based on these and other findings, we predict that, when generalist herbivores reach outbreak proportions and consume their preferred hosts, they will then move to nearby less-preferred hosts to complete their life cycle. This 'spillover' effect will result in associational susceptibility for less-preferred hosts and is likely common in forest outbreak situations where herbivore densities are high.

However, such nonlethal effects have rarely been examined experimentally in the field. In North Carolina estuaries, the hard clam Mercenaria mercenaria generally shows lower growth rates in habitats where predation rates are higher. Predator avoidance behavior of the clams (feeding inhibition) might be one of the factors responsible for this correlation. To examine possible effects of predators on clam growth, I first compared variation in clam growth rate among habitats with different predation pressure, and between predator-exclusion cages and uncaged controls. I then carried out a predator-enclosure experiment using the clam and the whelk Busycon carica, a major predator on adult clams. Among-habitat variation in survivorship, predation rate, and growth rate was generally small or not detected in winter, while large variation was found for adult clams in spring, their major growing season. Growth rate of adults was highest in a mud bottom where survivorship was highest (>60%) due to low predation rates, and it was lowest in an oyster shell bottom where survivorship was lowest (<10%). For juveniles, on the other hand, growth rate did not differ significantly among habitats, nor did survivorship. Clams in the predator-exclusion cages showed nearly twice the growth rate of uncaged controls in spring but not in winter. Clam growth rates were thus lower in habitats with lower survivorship and higher predation rates, suggesting that the predators can affect growth rates. In the whelk-enclosure experiment, the clams were enclosed in cages with three different treatments: (1) with whelks capable of attacking clams, (2) with whelks isolated from the prey, and (3) without whelks (control). The shell and somatic growth rates of the clam were at least twice as high in the control than in the two experimental treatments. However, the growth rates did not differ significantly between the two experimental treatments. The clam growth rates were therefore reduced in the presence of whelks even with no direct contact between whelks and clams, suggesting that the decrease in growth rates is due to a behavioral response of the prey to indirect cues, such as water-borne chemical signals produced by whelks. These findings show that predatory whelks can affect clam population dynamics not only by decreasing survivorship directly, but also by decreasing future reproduction and survivorship indirectly by suppressing growth rates, and that the predator-avoidance behavior observed in previous studies has significant demographic consequences. The nonlethal effects of predation on clam growth rate may also be responsible for observed variation in growth rates among habitats.",Anti-predatory behavior | Bivalves | Busycon carica | Demographic traits | Field experiment | Growth | Marine soft bottom | Mercenaria mercenaria | Nonlethal effects | Predator-mediated change | Prey-predator interactions,NA,NA

It has been suggested that variable synchrony with host budburst causes the population sizes of spring-feeding species to be more variable primarily because of the negative effects of older leaves on insects. While much evidence exists that leaf age can directly affect survival and reproduction of insects, few studies have looked at the population-level effects of variable phenology, and especially the potential for complex direct and indirect interactions with natural-enemy effects. To examine the consequences of variable phenology for population growth of an outbreaking insect, we manipulated the timing of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar) egg hatch in the field. We released large numbers of gypsy moth larvae into replicate plots in the field at three times relative to budburst. Survival of larvae in protective sleeves was high unless they were released very long before host budburst, and leaf age had a direct negative effect on fecundity: the later the release, the lower was the fecundity of insects reared on white Oak and black oak. The later the release, however, the greater was the dispersal by ballooning, which had the effect of reducing local densities. Because the most important natural enemies impose density-dependent mortality, dispersal had the effect of raising survival rate for later release dates. The direct host-plant effect and natural-enemy effects exhibited opposing influences on population processes, because fecundity decreased with release date but survival increased. The survival advantage of the late release outweighed the loss in fecundity, so that the expected population growth rate was highest for the latest release. The net effects of phenology on insect population growth thus depend largely on natural-enemy effects. Very different conclusions would have been drawn had we measured mortality only in protective sleeves and not in the presence of natural enemies. The strong natural-enemy effects may explain the large variability in outcome of plant-herbivore interactions and contribute to the high variability in population size of spring-feeding species.",Dispersal | Gypsy moth | Insect-plant interactions | Lymantria dispar | Massachusetts | Outbreaks | Phenology | Population dynamics,NA,NA

Different lines of experimental and correlative evidence indicated that spine length was important in preventing individuals of the two cactus species from becoming parasitized. However, the impact of the mistletoe on cactus fecundity was contingent on the species involved. Even though parasitism decreased fruit production, seed number per fruit, and the total seed output in E. chilensis, low and nonsignificant linear and nonlinear gradients of selection were prevalent in this species, indicating absence of directional and stabilizing/disruptive selection for spine length. Additional analysis based on logistic regression, however, revealed that long-spined E. chilensis had a higher probability of reproduction than did short-spined individuals. Unlike its effect on E. chilensis, the mistletoe had no fitness impact on E. acida, and the maintenance and evolution of spines in this species could not be attributed to parasite-mediated selection. Even though spines act as a first line of defense against parasitism in the two cactus species, selection was detected only on E. chilensis.

We use data from two breeding seasons to investigate the fitness consequences of variation in parent provisioning behavior and chick growth in a sexually dimorphic seabird, the Wandering Albatross (Diomedea exulans). Male parents brought more food to their single offspring than females did, and male chicks (sons) received more food than female chicks (daughters). The study of growth parameters indicates that sons had faster growth rates, reached higher asymptotic mass, and were heavier and larger at fledging than daughters. Male chicks that survived to adult age were larger than those that disappeared, whereas the females that survived were those in better condition at fledging, indicating that different factors affect survival of each sex during the first years of independence at sea. Survival to adult age seems to be influenced by the ability of parents to provision the offspring adequately, especially in the case of male chicks, whose costs appear to be higher. The age and experience of parents did not influence the amount of food delivered to the chick, but older birds rearing male chicks were more synchronized on a within-pair basis than younger parents, and consequently their sons grew faster, attaining both higher asymptotic mass and higher mass at fledging. Old adult males appeared to have a higher mortality rate than younger males when rearing a son. There was no such tendency for adult males rearing a daughter or for females rearing a son. Younger, less experienced pairs may tend to produce more sons than daughters when compared to older and more experienced pairs. If valid, this tendency for an age-related sex ratio could be the result of higher costs of raising the more expensive sex. These findings indicate that the optimal age-related investment by parents varies between males and females but also depends to a large degree on whether they are rearing a son or a daughter.","Breeding effort, effect of age | Diomedea exulans | Fitness | Parental investment | Procellariiformes | Provisioning behavior | Sex differences in chick growth | Survival to adult age, influence of growth",NA,NA

We examine the influence of both local successional processes associated with beaver activity and regional geomorphic boundaries on spatial variation in fish assemblages along the Kabetogama Peninsula in Voyageurs National Park, northern Minnesota, USA. Fish abundance and species richness exhibited considerable variation among drainages along the peninsula. Geological barriers to fish dispersal at outlets of some drainages has reduced fish abundance and species richness. Fish abundance and species richness also varied within drainages among local environments associated with beaver pond succession. Fish abundance was higher in upland ponds than in lowland ponds, collapsed ponds, or streams, whereas species richness was highest in collapsed ponds and streams. Cluster analyses based on fish abundance at sites classified according to successional environment indicated that four species (northern redbelly dace, Phoxinus eos; brook stickleback, Culaea inconstans; finescale dace, P. neogaeus; and fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas), were predominant in all successional environments. Several less abundant species were added in collapsed ponds and streams, with smaller size classes of large lake species (e.g., black crappie, Pomoxis nigromaculatus; smallmouth bass, Micropertus dolomieui; yellow perch, Perca flavescens; and burbot, Lota lota) being a component of these less abundant species. The addition of smaller size classes of large lake species indicates that dispersal of early life-history stages from Kabetogama Lake played a role in determining the species richness and composition of less abundant species in successional environments on the peninsula. Furthermore, collapsed-pond and stream environments closer to Kabetogama Lake had higher species richness than similar successional sites located farther from the lake. Cluster analyses based oh fish abundance at sites classified according to drainage indicated that species composition among drainages was influenced both by the presence or absence of geological barriers to fish dispersal and the nonrandom distribution of collapsed ponds and streams. Based on these results, we present a hierarchical conceptual model suggesting how geomorphic boundaries and beaver pond succession interact to influence fish assemblage attributes.

We construct a discrete-time model for biological invasions that couples matrix population models (for population growth) with integrodifference equations (for dispersal). This model captures the important facts that individuals differ both in their vital rates and in their dispersal abilities, and that these differences are often determined by age, size, or developmental stage. For an important class of these equations, we demonstrate how to calculate the population's asymptotic invasion speed. We also derive formulas for the sensitivity and elasticity of the invasion speed to changes in demographic and dispersal parameters. These results are directly comparable to the familiar sensitivity and elasticity of population growth rate. We present illustrative examples, using published data on two plants: teasel (Dipsacus sylvestris) and Calathea ovandensis. Sensitivity and elasticity of invasion speed is highly correlated with the sensitivity and elasticity of population growth rate in both populations.

Nonetheless few such analyses have been attempted for longer time frames. We identified past fires in a northern Swedish boreal landscape using fire scars on Pinus sylvestris trees. Within a 19 x 32 km area, local fire chronologies were established at 203 points by cross-dating fire scars on 1133 wood samples, the earliest dating back to the 1100s. A total of 349 separate fires were identified to location and size. The estimated number of fires per unit area and time (after correcting for varying sample density over time) was relatively constant at 0.095 fires · (104 ha)-1 · yr-1 from 1350 to 1650. It increased gradually thereafter, except for a low period in the early 1700s, peaked at 1.17 fires · (104 ha)-1 · yr-1 in the mid-1800s, and then dropped dramatically after 1860. The proportion of the area burned per unit time also increased after 1650, in parallel with the increase in the number of fires (although much less strongly due to a counteracting trend in fire size), from an annual rate of 0.8% prior to 1650 to 2.8% in the mid-1800s. Prior to 1650, 90% of the total burned area was due to fires larger than 1000 ha, compared to 55% after 1650. This decrease in fire size with increasing number of fires may be an intrinsic property of the system: a negative feedback caused by lack of fuel in early succession. Fire intervals shorter than 15 yr were rare, and there was an increase in the hazard of burning during the first 3-5 decades after fire, suggesting an effect of fuel accumulation. Thus, the proportion of the area burned per unit time does not increase linearly with the number of fires in the landscape, because the probability that fires will stop at boundaries with recently burned areas increases over fires. The changes in the number of fires per unit time mirror changes in the cultural use of the land, i.e., the gradual expansion of permanent settlements in the area after the late 1600s. They are not explained by changes in climate records. This suggests that the increase in fire numbers from the second half of the 1600s represents an increase in anthropogenic fires. Before 1650, the number of fires detected per unit area and time was only marginally different from the present-day density of lightning ignitions in the region (~ 0.1 fires · (104 ha)-1 · yr-1), whereas during the mid 1800s it was 11.7 times higher. These results show that large alterations in the fire regime can occur without substantial changes in the proportion of area burned per unit time, as exemplified by the trend after 1650, when there were concurrent changes in the number of fires and in average fire size. Therefore, the number of fire events per unit area and time should be an important variable in the analysis of fire history and its underlying causes.",Anthropogenic fires | Boreal landscape | Dendrochronology | Fire frequency | Fire history | Fire regime | Fire size | Landscape ecology | Pinus sylvestris | Spatially explicit | Swedish boreal forest,NA,NA

However, we observed no changes in shorebird abundances (13 species) over a 9-yr period suggesting that green crabs have had no 'bottom-up' effect on shorebirds, which subsist on benthic invertebrate prey.

In this investigation, the environmental heterogeneities were not randomly distributed, but rather were clustered by specifying probabilities of small local configurations of the landscape, as in local structure or pair approximations. This allows the study of landscapes with the same amount of habitat loss but different levels of fragmentation or clustering. I describe a simple algorithm for generating such structured landscapes. Spatially explicit simulations of population models on these landscapes were performed using stochastic cellular automata and compared to predictions from mean-field and pair approximations, for which detailed derivations are presented. For populations with local dispersal, I show that the spatial correlations of habitat types completely determine equilibrium population density on suitable sites and that the amount of suitable habitat has no effect, precisely the opposite of what the mean-field approximation predicts. When habitat types are randomly distributed on the landscape, the two approximations do almost equally well, and thus the additional complexity of the pair approximation is not justified. However, when habitat types are not randomly distributed, the mean-field approximation gives qualitatively incorrect predictions for population response to varying habitat heterogeneity. Thus, pair approximations combine some of the best features of spatially explicit and implicit models and serve as a useful supplement to those methods for understanding spatially structured ecological systems, especially where environmental heterogeneities are spatially correlated.","Cellular automata | Dispersal | Fragmented landscapes | Habitat fragmentation | Habitat heterogeneity | Habitat loss and fragmentation, separating effects | Local-structure approximations | Mean-field approximations | Pair approximations | Population models | Stochastic spatial models | Structured landscapes, algorithm",NA,NA

We analyze the impacts of such interactions on the population dynamics of Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) by considering effects of intercohort competition, habitat heterogeneity, habitat selection, and energy gain made by cannibals. Over a six-year period, we measured mortality and recruitment patterns, individual growth, body condition, resource levels, diets, and habitat use as functions of density for an allopatric perch population in a low-productivity lake. During the course of the study, two major die-offs took place, selectively affecting larger cannibalistic individuals, followed by several years of successful recruitment of young fish. Habitat use of perch ≥2 yr old was density dependent, and these fish used only the inshore region at low densities. The appearance of young fish followed the die-offs of cannibalistic perch and their subsequent absence from the offshore area, both of which decreased cannibalism on pelagic recruits. Whereas die-offs of larger perch could not be related to competition with young-of-the-year (YOY) perch, evidence for a competitive impact of YOY perch on Age-1 perch was present due to substantial food overlap. A strong depression in pelagic zooplankton was observed during summer in years with strong recruitment, which resulted in reduced consumption of zooplankton, slow growth, and reduced body condition in Age-1 perch and suggested high mortality of Age-1 perch in autumn. Age-1 perch did not appear to profit substantially from cannibalism on YOY perch because of the short time period that they could efficiently prey on YOY perch. The few larger perch that survived the die-offs gained substantial energy from cannibalism in years with strong recruitments, which increased both growth rates and per capita fecundity. Size-dependent intercohort competition may have strong impacts on cannibal-victim interactions when victims share resources with cannibals. Furthermore, habitat heterogeneity, combined with habitat selection, may limit the extent to which cannibals have a stabilizing effect on population dynamics. Finally, the energy gained by cannibals may have important consequences on population dynamics as this energy is allocated into new recruits.",Cannibalism | Competition | Energy gain | Growth trajectories | Habitat Selection | Perca fluviatilis | Perch fecundity | Size structure | Starvation,NA,NA

We conducted the study over five years in three north temperate lakes in which fish were experimentally manipulated while allowing for natural recruitment and mortality in lakes with fish. The resulting variation in predator populations allowed us to address how prey community size structure responds to a gradient of predation pressure. The slopes of normalized size spectra were used to characterize whether community biomass is relatively distributed as smaller or larger individuals with regard to mass. We ask whether predator effects on prey are manifested through fish presence/absence or if a gradient of predation pressure is important. In addition, we examined whether consumption rate of prey by fish is a better measure of predation effects on prey size structure than fish biomass alone. Our results suggest that benthos size structure responds to a gradient of fish consumption, rather than a qualitative distinction of fish presence or absence. Consumption rates by fish on benthos explained more of the variation in slopes of normalized size spectra of benthos than fish biomass alone. Slope values were more variable at lower consumption rates, which included no predation by fish. Conversely, high consumption rates by fish produced consistent, predictable body size distributions of benthos in which large individuals were relatively underrepresented. However, these results may not be apparent through more traditional analyses based on predator or prey presence/absence, abundance, or taxonomic-based measures. Generalizations addressing patterns of body size distributions within and among ecosystems may be advanced by examining predation and other underlying size-structuring mechanisms.","Benthic-pelagic links | Benthos | Body size distribution | Fish bioenergetics | Micropterous | Normalized size spectra | Predation, size selective | Predator-prey",NA,NA

Herein, we compare the relative fitness of nine populations of W. smithii from 30°to 50° N when exposed to these same stressful summer temperatures and simulated winter. We determined the survivorship, fecundity, and fertility of five cohorts from each population at each temperature in both environments, and we calculated the cohort replacement rate (R0) as the product of these three component traits. Survivorship declined with increasing latitude in the summer, but not the winter, environment. Fecundity was not correlated with latitude in either environment. Fertility declined with increasing latitude in both environments. Re was not correlated with latitude in either environment. Hence, the interpretation of the adaptive responses to climate can depend critically on the trait being examined. Because R0 is a composite index of fitness that includes any trade-offs among its constituent traits, we place greater reliance on its noncorrelation with latitude. Therefore, we conclude that, despite their clear impact on fitness, summer heat and winter cold have had little impact on the adaptive evolution of W. smithii to the climatic gradient of North America. The decline in summer heat and increase in the duration and intensity of winter cold as one moves north also impose a latitudinal gradient in the length of the favorable growing season. Many plants and animals use daylength to cue the seasonal events in their life cycles.

Environments with high larval food levels and low adult food levels (HL environments) tend to have asymptotically stable carrying capacities. Environments with low larval food levels and high adult food levels (LH environments) tend to exhibit unstable dynamics, like population cycles.

We found that variation in plant quality, prey abundance, and presence of alternative prey altered the functional response of the omnivorous big-eyed bug, Geocoris punctipes (Heteroptera: Geocoridae). The presence of high-quality plant parts (lima bean pods) reduced the number of prey (pea aphids and corn earworm eggs) consumed by big-eyed bugs. The results of our caged, field experiments mirrored those of the functional-response experiment. Populations of pea aphids were larger when caged with big-eyed bugs on bean plants with pods than on plants without pods. Pods, therefore, had an indirect, positive effect on the survivorship of herbivorous insects that feed on lima beans. Because pods reduced the number of prey consumed by big-eyed bugs, and caged prey populations were larger on plants with pods, we hypothesized that herbivore populations would be larger in fields of beans with many pods than in fields of beans with few pods. To test this hypothesis, we established 20 x 30 m field plots of lima beans with many pods and with few pods. The results of this experiment forced us to reject our hypothesis: populations of herbivores were much smaller in plots of beans with many pods than in plots of beans with few pods. In an earlier study, we found that pods had a powerful, direct, positive effect on big-eyed bugs. Big-eyed bug populations were larger in plots of beans with many pods in the present study. It appears that the positive direct effects of pods on big-eyed bugs overwhelm the positive indirect effects of pods on herbivore population size, and that pod feeding by big-eyed bugs ultimately results in smaller herbivore populations.

This paper tests the hypotheses (1) that aridity (potential transpiration E(p)/rainfall P) in tropical alpine environments can be high despite low temperatures, and (2) that aridity in tropical alpine environments may be correlated with scleromorphic habit. A leaf energy balance model was developed that calculates the change in E(p) for a standard leaf along elevational transects in equatorial and middle-latitude mountains by accounting for pressure (elevation) and temperature effects on transpiration. Modeled leaf-level transpiration in tropical alpine environments can be substantial and may even exceed transpiration at low elevations in middle latitudes. At 5000 m elevation, a high diffusion coefficient for water vapor under low air pressure and a high radiation load result in E(p) rates 50-90% higher in tropical mountains than in middle-latitude ones. High E(p) rates at high elevations are expected (1) in mountains of the dry tropics with low cloudiness and low rainfall but high radiation and, (2) in small oceanic mountain ranges with a strong advection of moist air and, thus, a reduced temperature lapse rate on the slope. Data from tropical Mount Haleakala (Maul, Hawaii) and from the middle-latitude Tyrolian Alps (Austria) were used to test the predicted E(p) rates. The two mountains sharply contrast with respect to vertical distribution of E(p) and rainfall. At high elevation on Maui, the calculated E(p) was high (and was consistent with measured atmometer evaporation rates E(m), whereas rainfall was moderate to low. At high elevation in the Alps, both E(p) and E(m) were low compared to similar elevations on Maui, but rainfall was high. Worldwide mountain climate data sets show that rainfall tends to decrease upslope in many tropical mountains, while it increases with elevation in most middle-latitude mountains. I conclude that (1) high-elevation environments in tropical mountains are more arid than similar elevations in middle-latitude mountains as a result of both higher evaporative demand and lower rainfall, and (2) that aridity can significantly contribute to the scleromorphy of tropical alpine plants which had previously been attributed to low temperature or high radiation effects alone.",Air pressure | Aridity | Austrian Alps | Cloudiness | Hawaii | Leaf energy balance | Plant scleromorphy | Potential transpiration | Tropical mountains | Vertical rainfall distribution,NA,NA

The movement distributions were generally leptokurtic, and two of the four species demonstrated some degree of upstream bias. There was little difference in movement among species or through time. There were no temporal correlations in probability of movement, movement direction, or distance moved. The spatial spread of the most abundant species, bluehead chubs, over a four-month period was characterized by upstream bias, diffusion-like spread, and persistent leptokurtosis. Bluehead chubs demonstrated complex relationships between probability of movement and size and growth, while creek chubs showed only an effect of size on probability of movement. Further, growth of individual bluehead chubs was correlated through time. These empirical results suggest the hypothesis that heterogeneity in phenotypic attributes, such as size and growth, is related to heterogeneity in movement behavior. A diffusion-advection model of bluehead chub movement, structured with two subgroups that dispersed at different rates ('fast fish' and 'slow fish'), was parameterized and validated with the field data. This model with heterogeneity in movement rates generated the leptokurtic pattern observed in the field data, in contrast to the classic diffusion model without population heterogeneity, which produces a normal distribution.

Our goals were (1) to assess the relative importance of chronic warming (with field greenhouses) and increased N and P availability (by fertilization) in controlling gross ecosystem photosynthesis, ecosystem respiration (plant plus heterotrophic respiration), and ultimately ecosystem C balance; and (2) to attempt to partition ecosystem responses to these treatments between plant and soil contributions. We present results of the effects of these manipulations on whole-system CO2 exchange over seasonal and diel cycles, and on nonrhizosphere soil microbial respiration using in situ soil incubations. Wet sedge control plots were, at best, a weak sink for carbon even during the peak growing season. Chronic nutrient additions of N + P shifted wet sedge carbon balance to a strong sink throughout the growing season; nutrient availability regulated seasonal and diel CO2 exchanges in these two wet sedge ecosystems. The N + P plots had significantly higher photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration in spite of the unanticipated effect of ~30% reduction in thaw depth in these plots, apparently due to a twofold increase in litter accumulation insulating the soil surface and/or possible shading from greater plant cover in these plots. These results highlighted the prevailing importance of nutrient-carbon interactions in controlling ecosystem processes and ecosystem C balance in arctic tundra. In contrast, warming had only subtle effects on CO2 exchanges. Increased temperatures in the warmed plots had little effect on instantaneous rates of photosynthesis or respiration. After eight years of chronic warming with an average 5.6°C higher air temperature over the growing season and a 40-200% increase in net N mineralization rate, it was surprising that warming did not have more profound effects on CO2 exchange and plant cover. If there were an effect of warming, increased temperatures might cause early canopy development and lengthen the growing season, rather than directly affect instantaneous rates of photosynthesis. Based on photosynthesis-light response curves developed from the early- and late-season diel measurements, we demonstrated that the main effect of warming was to accelerate the development of the canopy early in the season. By midseason, however, there were no significant differences in C exchange between warmed and control plots. Perhaps the most important and novel result emerging from this study is the prevailing importance of plant C exchange, not soil processes, in driving ecosystem C fluxes. First, nonrhizosphere soil microbial respiration as estimated CO2 flux from in situ soil incubations was a small fraction of whole-system respiration and did not vary among treatments. This suggests that anaerobic conditions or some other factor may limit soil microbial respiration more than do temperature or nutrients. Second, plant respiration contributed most (90%) of the ecosystem respiration in fertilized plots. This unanticipated and large contribution from plant respiration highlights the critical importance of understanding the response of plant respiration to global environmental change in these wet sedge ecosystems.","Alaska | Carbon balance | Carbon-nutrient interactions | CO  exchange 2 | Fertilizer treatment | Nutrient availability | Photosynthesis | Respiration | Soil microbial respiration | Tundra ecosystems | Warming, chronic",NA,NA

The model assumes that there is a threshold during larval development after which it is possible to metamorphose and to accelerate metamorphosis in response to certain environmental stimuli. The threshold presumably sets the minimum size and/or age at metamorphosis. Development after the threshold is modified according to environmental conditions, with growth rate serving as an index of environmental quality. Rapidly growing larvae are predicted to delay metamorphosis to take advantage of a favorable larval environment. Slower growers are predicted to transform closer to the threshold, thus enabling them to escape from a poor larval environment. Groups of three larvae from all three species (Experiment 1) or isolated larvae from two species (Experiment 2) in the genus Scaphiopus were reared at three food levels. At predetermined ages, subsamples of larvae had their food supply eliminated. The cessation of feeding represents a decline in the quality of the larval environment. After food elimination, larvae either completed development or entered a developmental stasis, making no further progress toward metamorphosis. The ability to complete development was demarcated by a specific stage of development or a narrow range of stages, thus defining a threshold. The threshold for successful metamorphosis was arrived at earlier at higher food levels and is best described as a function of both stage and mass. If food was eliminated after the threshold had been reached, the starved larvae completed larval development at an earlier age than continuously fed controls at each food level except the lowest food treatment of S. intermontanus. The magnitude of this acceleration of development was greatest in fast-growing (high food) larvae and smallest in slow growers (low food). These results confirm that all three species respond to a decline in the quality of the larval environment as predicted by Wilbur and Collins. Furthermore, the interspecies comparison implies an adaptive shift in this plasticity in the form of a change in the stage of development that serves as a threshold, the degree of acceleration in development rate after the threshold, and the flexibility in the amount of growth that is seen after the threshold. S. couchii, which is derived from the most ephemeral environment, reaches the threshold at an earlier stage of development. It also displays a greater proportional acceleration in development rate after the threshold, matched by a larger trade-off in reduced body size at metamorphosis in comparison with species from less ephemeral environments.",Adaptive plasticity | Amphibian | Comparative studies | Ephemeral environment | Growth rate | Habitat desiccation | Larval development | Metamorphosis | Pelobatidae | Scaphiopus | Spadefoot toads,NA,NA

Our approach relies on curve-fitting to relate empirical measures of resource acquisition with various aspects of plant size and form. These relationships are referred to as size-uptake relationships (SURs). We demonstrate the use of this approach by characterizing the size dependence of light and nitrogen acquisition within developing stands of birch seedlings. Results of a number of phenomenological studies have predicted that competition for light is expected to be size asymmetric and that competition for belowground resources is expected to be size symmetric. Our study provides the first direct empirical test for these hypotheses. Application of the SUR approach largely confirms predictions regarding the size-dependent nature of light and belowground resource (nitrogen) acquisition. The uptake of nitrogen by birch seedlings was size symmetric, regardless of which aspect of size we considered (i.e., root mass, root length, root surface area, number of root tips, number of mycorrhizal root tips). In contrast, light interception was size asymmetric in relation to height and leaf area, but size symmetric in relation to total plant biomass. Differences in the degree of size-asymmetry of light acquisition between different measures of size were driven by the nature of the allometric relationships between plant height, biomass, and leaf area. SURs offer a tool for exploring some of the mechanistic processes related to resource-based interactions. Using this approach, we demonstrate that it is possible to characterize simultaneously the size-dependent patterns of multiple resources within competing plant populations. We suggest that this approach may prove valuable for identifying how size-dependent patterns of resource acquisition vary through ontogeny.

Here we examine the potential cost of flight capability in males of the salt-marsh-inhabiting planthopper Prokelisia dolus (Hemiptera: Delphacidae). This species exhibits a dispersal polymorphism with both flightless adults (brachypters) and migratory adults (macropters) occurring in populations. In a competitive setting in the laboratory, brachypterous males exhibited a threefold mating advantage over macropterous males; they obtained 77% of the matings with brachypterous females. This mating advantage resulted, in part, from brachypterous males aggressively displacing rival macropters during courtship. There was also a nonsignificant tendency for brachypterous males to arrive before macropterous males to court a calling female. Neither female rejection behavior nor male body size appeared to contribute to the mating advantage of brachypterous males. When macropterous females were contested, the mating advantage of the male wing forms changed and macropterous males obtained the majority of matings. Thus, there was evidence for assortative mating based on wing form. When placed with ten brachypterous females, brachypterous males sired twice as many offspring as did macropterous males. This advantage was due to brachypters siring more offspring per female and not from inseminating more females; hence differences in sperm load between the male wing forms are implicated in the siring advantage of brachypters. There was, however, no tendency for brachypterous males to survive longer than their macropterous counterparts; thus, differences in longevity did not contribute to enhanced siring ability.

The relative impacts of proportional changes in fertility, juvenile survival, and adult survival on asymptotic population growth λ (where ln(λ) = r, the intrinsic rate of increase) are determined by vital rates (survival, growth, and fertility), which also define the life history characteristics of a species or population. Because we do not have good demographic information for most threatened populations, it is useful to categorize species according to their life history characteristics and related elasticity patterns. To do this, we compared the elasticity patterns generated by the life tables of 50 mammal populations. In age-classified models, the sum of the fertility elasticities and the survival elasticity for each juvenile age-class are equal; thus, age at maturity has a large impact on the contribution of juvenile survival to λ. Mammals that mature early and have large litters ('fast' mammals, such as rodents and smaller carnivores) also generally have short lifespans; these populations had relatively high fertility elasticities and lower adult survival elasticities. 'Slow' mammals (those that mature late), having few offspring and higher adult survival rates (such as ungulates and marine mammals), had much lower fertility elasticities and high adult or juvenile survival elasticities. Although certain life history characteristics are phylogenetically constrained, we found that elasticity patterns within an order or family can be quite diverse, while similar elasticity patterns can occur in distantly related taxa. We extended our generalizations by developing a simple age-classified model parameterized by juvenile survival, mean adult survival, age at maturity, and mean annual fertility. The elasticity patterns of this model are determined by age at maturity, mean adult survival, and λ, and they compare favorably with the summed elasticities of full Leslie matrices. Thus, elasticity patterns can be predicted, even when complete life table information is unavailable.

Furthermore, by determining which lakes tend to be most synchronous in their response to climate we can deduce the primary ways that climate influences the dynamics of the variable in question. In this study, we look for evidence of synchrony in the temperature, calcium, and chlorophyll dynamics of seven neighboring northern Wisconsin lakes. Our goals were to assess the influence of climate on dynamics of these variables and the effect of lake basin properties on their response to climate signals. Synchrony was measured as the r2 value from a regression relating observations of a variable in one lake against simultaneous observations of the same variable in another. Temperature was the most synchronous variable, with all pairs displaying significant synchrony. Calcium was also highly synchronous, with 15 of the 21 lake pairs exhibiting significant synchrony. Chlorophyll was significantly synchronous for 11 of the 21 lake pairs, but only three pairs exhibited r2 > 0.50. Lakes that were most similar in water clarity and average epilimnetic depth were most synchronous in temperature. Calcium was most synchronous among lakes occupying similar positions in the groundwater flow system, as expected from the control of calcium by groundwater flow paths. Synchrony of chlorophyll was highest for lakes with similar degrees of thermal stratification, suggesting that internal supplies of nutrients are an important determinant of interannual variability. The importance of ground- or bogwater flow to interannual chlorophyll dynamics is also suggested by the systematic asynchrony of chlorophyll for the clear-water lake that receives the least groundwater discharge. Our results show that climate imposes a strong synchrony on the behavior of three very different properties of the study lakes. Furthermore, the lakes differed predictably in their response to the same regional climate trends. Surprisingly, the differences between average synchrony observed for the three variables we considered were largely due to the diversity of the study lakes, rather than the disproportionate sensitivity of chlorophyll to local stochastic effects.",Calcium in lakes | Chlorophyll in lakes | Climate | Hydrology | Lakes | Landscape position | Regional monitoring | Synchrony | Temperature in lakes,NA,NA

In the first experiment, gizzard shad stimulated phytoplankton only when they could feed directly on lake sediments and not when benthic feeding was prevented by a mesh netting. In the second experiment, small gizzard shad stimulated phytoplankton to a greater extent than did an equivalent biomass of large gizzard shad. In the absence of gizzard shad, zooplankton became more abundant, and phytoplankton were less P limited, compared to treatments with gizzard shad present. This suggests a shift from grazer limitation in the absence of gizzard shad to direct limitation by nutrients in the presence of gizzard shad. Gizzard shad stimulated total N and P, suggesting an important nutrient transport effect. Thus, gizzard shad impact phytoplankton through an interaction of top-down and bottom-up effects, which are facilitated by a large detrital subsidy to this system.",Detritus | Dorosoma cepedianum | Gizzard shad | N and P excretion | Nutrient recycling | Nutrient transport | Omnivory | Phytoplankton | Reservoir,NA,NA

Within-flower self-pollination (autogamy) may be advantageous, since it can provide reproductive assurance without much seed or pollen discounting. In contrast, between-flower self-pollination (geitonogamy) provides no reproductive assurance and can cause severe seed and pollen discounting. I used floral emasculations with marker-gene analysis to estimate the components of self-fertilization in a tristylous, self-compatible, clonal, mass-flowering plant, Decodon verticillatus. This species produces 30% of progeny through selfing. I assessed the contribution of autogamy to selfing by comparing pollen deposition, seed production, and the selfing rate of flowers emasculated before anther dehiscence with intact flowers. Emasculation had no effect on pollen deposition, caused a small increase in seed production, and only reduced self-fertilization by 14%, suggesting that most selfing occurs through geitonogamy. Geitonogamy can be due to self-pollination between flowers on the same branch, different flowering branches of the same plant, or different ramets of the same clonal genet. I assessed the contribution of within-branch geitonogamy by emasculating all flowers on a branch, which reduced selfing from 0.29 ± 0.03 (mean ± 1 SE) to 0.19 ± 0.04. Between-branch geitonogamy was estimated by comparing the selfing rate of plants with only a single flowering branch (0.16 ± 0.07) to plants with multiple flowering branches (0.27 ± 0.04). Selfing rates of individual branches also correlated positively with the daily number of flowers open on nonfocal branches of the same plant. Between-ramet geitonogamy was suggested by significant self-fertilization by single-branch plants, even when all flowers were emasculated (0.10 ± 0.07). Selfing rates of individual branches also correlated negatively with measures of local clonal diversity. Based on these results, autogamy accounts for only 18 ± 14% of self-fertilization, with the remainder (82 ± 17%) due to geitonogamy, which occurs about equally through pollination within branches (31 ± 22%), between branches (38 ± 32%), and between ramets (31 ± 28%). Because selfing occurs mostly through geitonogamy and is associated with strong inbreeding depression, it seems disadvantageous.

The spatial relationships and competitive interactions between encrusting algae and overgrowing filamentous, turf-forming algae were investigated on a subtidal rocky reef (Mediterranean Sea, Italy). Quantitative observations and field experiments were done from 1992 to 1998: (1) to investigate the relative patterns of distribution and abundance of crusts and turf and how they differed across space and time, (2) to test whether spatial relationships between crusts and turf were influenced by various characteristics of the substratum and by disturbance from wave action, (3) to investigate spatial and temporal patterns of recruitment and the mechanisms by which crusts colonize space, and (4) to test whether crusts and turf compete for space. Crusts were always among the first colonizers of available bare rock and were subsequently overgrown by turf. Despite variations in spatial and temporal recruitment of crusts, this pattern was never reversed. Covers of crusts and turf were not significantly affected by disturbance. There was some evidence for competition, but this did not result in the local exclusion of either crusts or turf. Despite extensive and persistent cover of turf, encrusting algae were abundant and were able to live, grow, and reproduce beneath the turf over long periods with little adverse effect. Similarly, crusts did not limit the distribution of turf, although they slowed its rate of growth. The capabilities of turf and crusts to overgrow and tolerate overgrowth, respectively, were identified as the major determinants of the structure of this two-layered assemblage and the probable basis of the success of these species in coexisting as the dominant algal forms. Overgrowth was not equivalent to competitive subordination and displacement, emphasizing the need for caution when interpreting competitive abilities from observed patterns of overgrowth. Overall, results suggested that, in some habitats, tolerance may be more important than competition in maintaining coexistence of species and influencing community structure.",Algae | Coexistence of species | Colonization | Competition | Disturbance effects | Encrusting vs. turf-forming | Field experiment | Life histories | Overgrowth | Polysiphonia setacea | Recruitment | Reef | Rocky reef | Spatial coexistence | Subtidal | Tolerance,NA,NA

Such predictions based on elasticities seem robust, but we do identify three situations where problems may arise.

We hypothesized that extreme seasonal changes in ice characteristics in the Baffin Bay region, including a period of open water, may limit polar bear density despite supporting greater prey density than the Archipelago region, where ice is present year-round. Using cyclic time series analysis to model seasonal variation, we found differences in level, amplitude, and phase between sea ice characteristics and habitat selection by polar bears of the Arctic Archipelago and Baffin Bay regions. Polar bears not only followed seasonal changes, but they anticipated seasonal fluctuations, e.g., polar bears were found close to ice edges in spring in advance of the peak availability of edges. Also, seasonal selection of sea ice by polar bears was generally of a larger amplitude than cycles in ice and is best explained by intensive use of specific ice types in spring and summer, and sparse use during the remaining year. During spring and summer, Archipelago bears used landfast ice more intensively, whereas Baffin bears used moving ice, defined as thick first-year ice found in large floes. Both ice types likely represent areas where most seal pupping occurred in spring for each region. Bears from both regions selected first-year ice in winter when new ice was forming and multiyear ice in autumn when maximum ice melt had occurred. Overall, polar bear selection of ice habitat was similar between regions despite major differences in seasonal ice characteristics.

Despite substantial intraspecific variation in body size, explanations of functional differences among Daphnia species continue to emphasize body size. In this study, we ask whether Daphnia in a relatively narrow range of body sizes differ in ability to exploit the array of resources commonly encountered in lakes. We compared juvenile growth rates of several clones and species of Daphnia fed natural planktonic resources that differed in overall dietary richness. We observed, both among and within species, a trade-off between growth rates in rich and poor resource conditions. We compared the ability of different species and clones to exploit natural resources in a lake mesocosm experiment, testing the prediction that clones displaying the greatest growth rates in rich resource conditions would have the highest minimum resource requirements. Using 8000-L whole water column enclosures, replicate populations of D. rosea and two different morphs of D. pulicaria were established separately in monoculture in a thermally stratified lake. An additional treatment without crustacean zooplankton was also established. We quantified resources in the enclosures using multiple indirect measures (e.g., chlorophyll a) and a growth bioassay. Results supported predictions; rankings of resource levels achieved in the different treatments suggest that Daphnia trade off high maximum growth rates for low minimum resource requirements. This field experiment also documented large differences among the species and clones of Daphnia in their impact on phytoplankton resources, water clarity, and formation of calcite particles (whiting). We suggest that these large ecological effects stem from the trade-off in abilities to use rich vs. poor resources and constitute an important aspect of grazer-resource interactions. We review the literature on growth and reproductive responses of zooplankton species to resource level and find general agreement with the concept of a trade-off between abilities to exploit rich and poor resource conditions. A reanalysis of data from a comprehensive study on Daphniidae growth confirms our results and suggests that the breadth of species in this family conforms to the trade-off. Furthermore, the trade-off is only weakly, and not significantly, associated with body size.

Protection from direct sunlight was the main factor contributed by shrubs that enhanced the germination and survival of Austrocedrus. During the 1995-1996 experiment, no seedlings survived in the unwatered interspaces between shrubs, whereas maximal survival was obtained by watering seedlings at shaded sites. The results of this study indicate that in the Patagonian ecotone the strength of facilitative associations between shrubs and Austrocedrus juveniles closely tracks annual climatic variability.

Here, we experimentally examine this prediction by exploiting our understanding of the mechanisms of wound-induced nicotine production in Nicotiana sylvestris (Solanaceae) to manipulate the patterns of nicotine allocation and to determine their fitness consequences. In two perturbation experiments conducted over three stages of ontogeny (rosette, elongation, and flowering), we wounded or removed leaves of different ages (young, mature, or old) and determined the effects on nicotine allocation (whole-plant and within-plant) and fitness (lifetime viable seed production). OD theory predicts that, as leaves age and their fitness value decreases, the allocation of defense to particular leaves and the fitness consequences of their removal should be positively correlated. We found that (1) leaf removal results in a significant decrease in seed mass at the elongation stage, but not at the rosette or flowering stages; (2) the relative value of leaves decreases from young and mature to old leaves; (3) leaf damage significantly increases the whole-plant nicotine contents of rosette-stage plants, but not of elongation- or flowering-stage plants, and after damage, younger leaves are more heavily defended than older leaves at the elongation and flowering stages; and (4) regardless of ontogenetic stage, plants distribute nicotine among leaves in accordance with their relative fitness value, thus supporting OD theory predictions. Leaf value increases after N fertilization at the flowering stage, but is not changed if adjacent leaves are removed at earlier growth stages. Moreover, plants are capable of sending their root-synthesized nicotine to specific leaves after damage; at the elongation stage, the new and young leaves receive greater proportional allocations of nicotine than other leaves. The cessation of significant whole-plant nicotine inductions at later stages in ontogeny is not due to the root's decreased ability to respond to the plant's wound signal, jasmonic acid (JA) with increased nicotine biosynthesis, but rather to the decline in a leaf's sensitivity to wounding and in its ability to export JA from the leaves to roots. Ontogeny has profound effects on the use of this induced defense. Plants mount systemic nicotine inductions at the rosette stage that rely on large increases in de novo nicotine synthesis, switch to the selective targeting of nicotine to the new and young leaves at the elongation stage without large increases in de novo nicotine synthesis, and allocate to reproductive structures, but not leaves, at the flowering stage. These changes are consistent with the predictions of OD theory.",Fitness | Induced defense | Nicotiana sylvestris | Nicotine | Ontogeny | Optimal Defense theory | Seed production,NA,NA

Microbial immobilization was initially (i.e., at 2 h) the largest sink for 15NO3- (21% in forest floor; 16% in soil microbial biomass). After one month, total 15N recovery varied little (24-18%) throughout the remainder of the growing season, suggesting that the major N transfers among pools occurred relatively rapidly.

Temporal changes in the 15N enrichment (atom % excess 15N) of plant and soil pools during the first month of the experiment indicated the dynamic nature of NO3- cycling in this forest. The 15N enrichment of soil microbial biomass and the forest floor significantly increased two hours after isotope additions, suggesting rapid microbial immobilization of NO3-. In contrast, the 15N enrichment of soil organic matter did not peak until day 1, presumably because much of the added 15N cycled through microorganisms before becoming stabilized in soil organic matter, or it directly entered soil organic matter via physical processes.

Soil resource partitioning, wherein shallow-rooted grasses use summer precipitation and deep-rooted woody plants use winter precipitation, may have contributed to the stable coexistence of grasses and trees that form savannas at this ecotone. Thus, predicted changes in regional precipitation patterns and soil moisture caused by anthropogenic trace gas emissions have the potential to alter interactions between woody plants and grasses with potential ramifications for their relative abundance and distribution. We used a field experiment to investigate the response of the dominant woodland and savanna tree Quercus emoryi to simulated potential scenarios of precipitation redistribution within the context of shifts in the woodland-grassland ecotone. Experimental soil volumes isolated from ambient precipitation and soil moisture were hand-watered between July 1994 and October 1996. Control plots received mean annual precipitation (602 mm), whereas treated plots received all possible combinations of 50% additions and reductions to mean summer and winter precipitation (n = 4). Increases in summer precipitation increased seedling emergence and recruitment rates as much as threefold, whereas emergence and recruitment were independent of altered winter precipitation regimes. Seedling survival, size, growth, and biomass allocation were largely independent of shifts in seasonal precipitation regimes. We conclude that Q. emoryi recruitment and subsequent abundance and distribution would more likely be affected by changes in summer precipitation than changes in winter precipitation. For example, increases in summer precipitation that increase rates of seedling emergence and establishment may facilitate downslope shifts in the woodland-grassland ecotone. Similarly, this mechanism may explain downslope shifts in this ecotone that occurred coincident with particularly high summer precipitation during the 'Medieval Warm' period, 645-1295 yr BP. Further, whereas soil moisture resource partitioning between adult Q. emoryi and coexisting grasses may contribute to savanna maintenance, soil resource partitioning does not occur within the first three growing seasons after Q. emoryi germination. Results illustrate the importance of consideration of the regeneration niche, which is often overlooked when predicting the response of woody plants to impending climate change.",Climate change | Ecotone | Emory oak | Precipitation seasonality | Quercus emoryi | Savanna | Seedling establishment | Soil moisture resource partitioning | Treeline | Woodland,NA,NA

However, little work has been done on the relationship between propagule dispersal and spatial heterogeneity in species abundance. We hypothesize that, shortly after a disturbance, spatial variability in abundance of sedentary organisms is negatively related to the dispersal potential of a species' propagules, and that this negative relationship diminishes over time as populations recover from the disturbance. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examined temporal changes in spatial patterns of abundance in a diverse group of sedentary marine organisms, whose propagules differ greatly in dispersal potential. The data set was derived from long-term monitoring of the kelp forest communities of Channel Islands National Park and contained annual estimates of abundance of 27 species from nine phyla collected at 16 sites on five different islands during 1986-1994. Among-site variability in the abundance of plants and animals was negatively related to the planktonic duration of a species' propagules. The negative relationship disappeared over time in some regions, but not in others. This disappearance resulted primarily from species with relatively limited dispersal becoming more uniformly distributed over time; among-site variability of species with more widespread dispersal changed little. Differences among regions in the rate at which the negative relationship diminished over time suggested regional differences in rates of recovery from the 1982-1984 El Nino disturbance. These differences among regions may have resulted in part from differences in the frequency and intensity of sea urchin grazing, and in part from regional differences in the distances separating sites where abundances were measured. Our findings support the hypothesis that differential dispersal after large disturbances can significantly influence spatial heterogeneity in assemblages of sedentary organisms.",Channel Islands National Park | Colonization | Dispersal | Disturbance | El Nino | Kelp forest | Larvae | Propagule | Sedentary organisms | Spatial heterogeneity | Spore | Variability,NA,NA

Evolutionary stable dispersal between source and sink habitats can occur if local fitnesses vary temporally, either due to intrinsic factors (e.g., chaotic dynamics) or extrinsic factors (e.g., environmental stochasticity). The model assumes locally linear Lotka-Volterra competition between two species. Given sufficiently low density-independent mortality in the sink, dispersal between habitats is an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS). Given a trade-off between competitive ability in the source and mortality in the sink, a sink habitat can promote species coexistence in the source habitat if the inferior competitor species experiences lower mortality in the sink. This highlights how sink habitats may provide mechanisms of coexistence in heterogeneous landscapes. In a second scenario, the competitors have distinct habitat preferences, resulting in the 'Ghost of Competition Past' (i.e., complete habitat partitioning) with stable population dynamics. With unstable population dynamics, dispersal between habitats becomes the ESS, and the Ghost vanishes leading either to coexistence of the competitors in both habitats or global exclusion of one species.

Identifying the biological causes of density dependence has, however, proved difficult in many systems. In this study we tested whether adults of three species of reef fish (all gobies) suffered density-dependent mortality, and whether the density-dependent component of mortality was caused by predation. We used field experiments to test for density dependence in each prey species, manipulating the presence of predators and prey density in a factorial design. Prey were stocked on replicate patches of reef constructed of natural materials, with each reef receiving a different density of gobies. Predatory fishes were excluded from half of the reefs using a combination of removals and exclusion cages. Survival of the first species, Lythrypnus dalli, was high and density-independent on reefs free of predators, but declined rapidly with increasing density on reefs to which predators had access. Density dependence in L. dalli was thus a result of mortality inflicted by predatory fishes. In the second species, Coryphopterus nicholsii, predators caused a large reduction in the survival in one experiment but had a negligible effect in a second experiment. More importantly, though, survival of C. nicholsii was always independent of its density, regardless of predator presence. In the final species, Coryphopterus glaucofraenum, two separate experiments showed that natural changes in adult abundance (experiment 1) and survival of stocked adults (experiment 2) were density-dependent regardless of predator presence. Both experiments thus indicated that the density-dependent component of loss in C. glaucofraenum was caused, at least in part, by an interaction other than predation. The presence, intensity, and biological cause of density-dependent survival were thus strikingly different for each of these three fishes, despite the fact that they are taxonomically closely related and ecologically similar.

In general, sizes of island individuals are approximately intermediated in size between those in the region of origin (where they are sympatric and small) and those in the region of allopatry.

Breeding patterns were consistent between years, indicating that tropical seasons were as predictable for Spotted Antbirds (predictability 70%) as they are for many north temperate birds. Individual Spotted Antbirds shut down reproductive capacity (i.e., decreased gonad size) from October until February. In March, during the height of the dry season and about six weeks ahead of the wet season, gonads started to grow again. The growth rate of gonads was influenced by the amount of rainfall, which has been shown to correlate with food abundance. Gonad growth was paralleled by changes in luteinizing hormone, but not in testosterone, which remained at very low plasma levels year-round. The latter contrasts with the pattern for most migratory temperate-zone birds. Seasonal changes in reproductive activity correlated strongly with changes in the tropical photoperiod, but weakly with light intensity and rainfall, and not with temperature. Thus, Spotted Antbirds likely anticipated rain forest seasonality using long-term cues (tropical photoperiod) and fine-tuned their reproductive activities using short-term cues (food/rainfall).

Our goal was to quantify patterns of recruitment at multiple scales, and to explore the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, we predicted that large-scale patterns of recruitment could be driven by changes in the abundance of adults and/or their fecundity, i.e., that corals exhibit a stock-recruitment relationship. The amount of recruitment by acroporids in each of two breeding seasons varied by more than 35-fold among the five sectors. Adult density varied only twofold among sectors and was not correlated with recruitment at the sector or reef scale. In contrast, fecundity levels (the proportion of colonies on each reef that contained ripe eggs) varied from 15% to 100%, depending on sector, year, and species. Spatial and temporal variation in the fecundity of each of three common Acropora species explained most of the variation (72%) in recruitment by acroporids, indicating that the production of larvae is a major determinant of levels of recruitment at large scales. Once fecundity was accounted for, none of the other variables we examined (sector, reef area, abundance of adults, or year) contributed significantly to variation in recruitment. The relationship between fecundity and recruitment was nonlinear, i.e., rates of recruitment increased disproportionately when and where the proportion of gravid colonies approached 100%.

In this study, field caging and tethering experiments quantified habitat-specific growth rates and mortality risk, respectively, for three different sizes of a coral reef fish, Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus), during its juvenile tenure in off-reef nursery habitats. These sizes bracketed the size at which this species undergoes an ontogenetic habitat shift from the interstices of macroalgal clumps ('algal habitat') to areas outside, or adjacent to, macroalgae and other physically complex microhabitats ('postalgal habitats'). Experimental results were used in a cost-benefit analysis to test the following alternative (but not mutually exclusive) hypotheses: (1) juvenile grouper shift habitats in a way that maximizes growth rates (g); (2) juveniles shift habitats in a way that minimizes mortality (predation) risk (μ); and (3) if trade-offs exist between maximizing growth rate and minimizing mortality risk, juveniles shift habitats in a way that minimizes the ratio of mortality risk to growth rate (μ/g). Results suggested that small fish face a trade-off between living in the relatively safe algal habitat and achieving high growth rates in postalgal habitats. The value of μ/g was significantly lower in the algal than postalgal habitats for small fish, which typically reside in the algal habitat, and significantly lower in postalgal habitats for medium and large fish, which typically reside in postalgal habitats. Thus, habitat use by juvenile Nassau grouper was consistent with the 'minimize μ/g hypothesis.'

Three sets of analyses were conducted: mapping of historical windthrow disturbance patches in the 265-km2 Bull Run basin over the past century and analysis of their relationships with meteorological conditions, landforms, and vegetation; comparison of forest structure and species composition as a function of mapped windthrow and wildfire disturbance history in 34 1-ha vegetation survey plots in Bull Run; and canonical correspondence analysis of environmental factors and forest overstory species composition in 1637 vegetation plots in the Mount Hood and Willamette National Forests. Nearly 10% of the Bull Run basin has been affected by windthrow since 1890, but only 2% was affected prior to the onset of forest harvest in 1958. Most of the mapped windthrow occurred in areas with 500- to 700-yr-old canopy dominants and no mapped disturbance by fire in the past 500 yr. Most mapped windthrow occurred during three events in 1931, 1973, and 1983 that were characterized by extreme high speed east winds from the Columbia River Gorge. Forest harvest modified the effects of climate, landforms, and vegetation on windthrow disturbance, reducing the importance of topographic exposure to east and northeast winds, and creating a strong influence of recent clearcut edges, which accounted for 80% of windthrow in the 1983 event. Shade-tolerant overstory species (western hemlock and Pacific silver fir) are abundant in present-day forest stands affected by windthrow as well as by fire in the past century. In the western Cascade Range, Douglas-fir and western hemlock decline and Pacific silver fir increases with elevation (summer moisture stress declines but temperature variability increases), but this transition occurs at lower elevations in the Bull Run, perhaps because of the interaction between regional climate processes and disturbance along the Columbia Gorge.

Using insects in a native grassland habitat, I performed a three-year field experiment that varied fragment size and connectivity to test the hypotheses that corridors influence patterns of insect species loss, rates of recolonization, and insect movement among habitat fragments. I detected few effects of corridors consistent with theoretical predictions. First, corridors generally failed to reduce insect species loss from otherwise isolated grassland patches, except for subtle effects in medium-sized patches. Species richness was slightly higher in medium patches with corridors than in medium isolated patches when averaged over the three years of the study. I observed the strongest positive effect of corridors in the third and driest year of the study. Second, corridors did not significantly influence overall rate of patch colonization, but slightly increased the probability of colonization by less vagile species. Interestingly, corridors did not affect recolonization by rare species, which are often the subject of conservation concern. Third, I characterized individual movement pathways of three insect species in plots with and without corridors. One of the three species significantly preferred corridors, while the other two species moved independently of corridors.

Rainfall varied in the El Nino years from 195 mm to 1359 mm, exceeding the maximum in the other years by 40% to 1000%. Two species were studied: Geospiza fortis, Medium Ground Finch, and G. scandens, Cactus Finch. Almost all eggs, nestlings, and fledglings produced by banded females were recorded in the El Nino years of 1983, 1987, 1991, and 1998. Finch production in these years was compared with production in 10 other years of breeding in the period 1976-1990; there was no breeding in three drought years, 1985, 1988, and 1989. Breeding differed in the two sets of years in several ways. More broods were produced in El Nino years than in non-El Nino years (maximum 10 clutches per female vs. five clutches), the period of breeding was longer (maximum eight months vs. four), average clutch sizes (range 2-6 eggs) were distinctly larger (four vs. three), and average egg and fledgling production per female was larger by a factor of four. The two species differed in some features of breeding, but differences were minor in comparison with the marked seasonal and annual variation. Finch production varied among El Nino years, being greatest in the year of most rain over the longest period (1983), and least in the next wettest year (1998). The surprisingly low production in 1998 is attributed in part to interactions with other finches, and in part to exceptionally high temperatures. Temperature, although positively correlated with rainfall, had an independent negative effect upon hatching and overall breeding success of G. fortis. Breeding by both species in the year of birth (hatch) occurred in two El Nino years with the most extended wet seasons: 1983 and 1987. Young breeders had lower clutch sizes and breeding success than did contemporaneously breeding older birds. Observations in different El Nino years show that finch population responses to major climatic perturbations such as elevated rainfall vary for two major reasons: the perturbations themselves vary in strength and duration, and responses to them are determined, in part, by preceding conditions. Those preceding conditions, in turn, are determined by whether drought or normal conditions precede the perturbation, and on the interval since the previous El Nino event.

Additionally, the probability of Veronica use in a population increased with increasing number of larval groups found on Veronica in the surrounding populations but decreased with increasing use of Plantago in the neighborhood. This regional effect on host use at the scale of migrating butterflies could be caused either by spatial variation in the insect (in either preference or performance) or by spatial variation in plants (in resistance to attack by the butterflies). To study the first possibility, we conducted oviposition preference experiments using butterflies from five metapopulations located 2-55 km from each other and characterized by differences in host plant availability and host use. We found clear genetic differences in oviposition preference between the five metapopulations consistent with the observed host use patterns in the field.

Bark beetles face a particularly severe challenge because the phloem that they consume is very low in nitrogen and phosphorus relative to their requirements. We quantified variation in the phloem concentrations of N and P in the host tree, Pinus taeda, and evaluated the following hypotheses regarding the role of symbiotic fungi in nutrient budgets of the herbivore Dendroctonus frontalis: D. frontalis experience variation in phloem nutrient concentrations across several spatial scales (H1); mycangial fungi enhance the diet of D. frontalis larvae by contributing to the acquisition of N and P (H2); Ophiostoma minus, an apparently antagonistic fungal symbiont, hinders D. frontalis larvae because it does not enhance nutrient concentrations of the phloem as much as mycangial fungi do (H3); and larvae of bark beetle species that lack mycangial fungi must consume more phloem to accomplish the same growth as larvae of D. frontalis (H4). In addition, we developed a general model for the N budgets of herbivorous insects that identifies the possible combinations of dietary and physiological parameters that can allow developmental success on low-nutrient diets. Spatial variation in phloem N was mostly at the level of trees within sites (a scale of meters) while P mostly varied among sites (a scale of kilometers). Trees with higher N content produced larger D. frontalis adults. Prior to infestation by beetles, phloem nutrient concentrations were very uniform within trees and very low relative to that of the bark beetles (N and P concentrations of D. frontalis adults were 28 and 8 times greater, respectively). During infestation, phloem nutrient concentrations increased overall and became highly variable within trees. Nitrogen concentrations increased from 0.40 ± 0.01% (mean ± 1 SE) in uninfested phloem to 0.86 ± 0.03% in the phloem surrounding successfully developing D. frontalis larvae, which are typically associated with one or two species of mutualistic mycangial fungi. Nitrogen concentrations were intermediate in other micro-habitats within infested trees, including regions with no adult colonization, with failed larval development, or colonized by the antagonistic bluestain fungus O. minus. We parameterized a general nutrient-budget model for D. frontalis and a sympatric non-mycangial bark beetle, Ips grandicollis, which indicated that (1) mycangial fungi provide their benefits by concentrating dietary N for larvae; (2) O. minus may exert its antagonistic effects on D. frontalis larvae by failing to concentrate dietary N as much as mycangial fungi do; (3) non-mycangial bark beetles meet their N budgets through high consumption of unaltered, low-N phloem; and (4) larvae should easily meet their P requirements with any combination of consumption rate and development time that allows them to meet their N requirements.

(2) Are the effects of pollinators and herbivores on fecundity additive, or is there some significant interaction between them? A two-factor ('Pollinators' and 'Herbivores,' each with two levels, 'present' and 'excluded') experimental design was used, with individual plants being treated as experimental units and maternal fecundity as the response variable. On average, the effects of pollinators and herbivores were of opposite sign and roughly similar absolute magnitude (~7.5 seeds per plant), thus approximately canceling each other. A significant interaction (non-additivity) between factors did exist, with plants exposed to pollinators experiencing a disproportionately higher incidence of herbivores than those from which pollinators had been excluded. This was mainly due to mammals browsing only on the larger fruits from flowers that had been exposed to pollinators. Only in the absence of herbivores did pollinators account for a significant amount of between-plant variance in maternal fecundity. It is concluded that the interaction between pollinators and herbivores will lead to variable, herbivore-dependent 'opportunity for selection' (sensu Arnold and Wade 1984) on P. broteroi by its pollinators.

Instead, our data indicate that modern distributional patterns of low-elevation (<150 m above sea level [a.s.l.]) soil organic matter (SOM) in Taylor Dry Valley are strongly influenced by the climatic history of the region, with the isotopic signatures of SOM along the valley floor corresponding to the spatial distribution of ancient glacial tills and lacustrine systems. At many sites, higher elevation soils (>150 m a.s.l.) have isotopic signatures similar to those of autotrophs currently inhabiting nearby cryptoendolithic communities, suggesting that similar autotrophic activity may be occurring in these soils and that long-term primary productivity in dry valley soils contributes to organic matter accumulations. Taken together, these findings support a new 'legacy' model for soil organic matter origins and fluxes in the dry valley ecosystem.","Carbon cycling | Climate change | Dry valleys | Legacy model | Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) | McMurdo Region | Nitrogen | Paleosediments | Soil organic matter | Stable isotopes | Taylor Valley, Antarctica",NA,NA

We tested four hypotheses about the cause of breeding dispersal: inbreeding avoidance, mate choice, site choice, and social constraints. In addition, we assessed relationships among age, reproductive failure, and breeding dispersal, and we estimated cost of breeding dispersal by plotting mortality against dispersal rate as a function of circumstance. Breeding dispersal in the population that we studied is associated with multiple factors. Inbreeding avoidance influences dispersal of females whose sons inherit their natal territories. Mate choice influences dispersal of females whose mates have died; these females acquire older, higher quality mates by dispersing. In this study, there was no clear relationship between site choice and breeding dispersal. Social constraints do not appear to affect breeding dispersal in this population: no evidence was found to suggest that dispersal is associated with female-female competition, within-group competition for resources, or reproductive competition between mothers and helper sons. The effect of reproductive failure on breeding dispersal changes with female age. Reproductive failure is associated with breeding dispersal in young females only (those <3 yr old). Estimated mortality rates for breeding females that attempt to disperse vs. those that do not attempt to disperse were 59% and 26%, respectively; the difference between those rates is the estimated cost of breeding dispersal in this population, an additional 33% probability of mortality.

We investigated the intensity and spatial extent of synchrony among populations of birds in Britain. The data analyzed ran from 1962 to 1995 at more than 1000 local sites and concerned 60 species. For each species, we measured the intensity of synchrony among local populations using the cross-correlation function (CCF) and assessed its spatial extent. We tested for differences in these two measures with respect to habitat. We also assessed the potential influence of long-term trends in population synchrony. By aggregating the sites in regions and estimating an index for each region, we measured synchrony at a large spatial scale. In general, we found that synchrony was low between populations of British birds. All but one species with the strongest level of synchrony show a pronounced long-term decline. The mean CCF was significantly correlated with the mean abundance of each species in the Common Birds Census (CBC) sites, suggesting that the more abundant species have more synchronous populations. Significant differences in synchrony between habitats were found in 25 species; synchrony was stronger in farmlands compared to woodlands for 22 species. The same result was observed both at the intra- and interspecific levels. This may be the result of national change in agricultural practice affecting all farmland populations. Our cross-scale analysis showed that synchrony is a scale-dependent phenomenon. Our study is the first to focus on a large number of 'noncyclic' species, and it suggests that synchrony is weaker for these species than for those with widely fluctuating cyclic populations. This is in agreement with some studies on synchrony of insects. Synchrony in natural populations seems to be determined by complex interactions between abundance, population variability, species characteristics, and demographic mechanisms. A general pattern emerging from our study and others is that population synchrony is more intense during declines.","Birds, population synchrony | Britain | Common Birds Census | Cross-correlation | Farmlands and woodlands | Habitats | Population index | Population trend | Spatial scale | Synchrony",NA,NA

However, consumers are often confronted with foods distributed within depletable patches. To investigate the complication of resource depletion, I merged a consumer-resource model of nutritional relationships between foods with the technique of giving-up densities for measuring foraging behavior in depletable food patches. Theory predicts that foods containing plant defenses that act as digestibility reducers (e.g., lignins and tannins) will be relatively less depleted under higher predation risk than will foods without defenses. In contrast, foods containing defensive toxins (e.g., alkaloids) that affect fitness directly, and not through diminished physiological uptake of energy, will be depleted without bias to predation risk or other foraging costs. I tested the theory using fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) feeding on sunflower seeds that were impregnated with either tannic or oxalic acid. Squirrels had their highest giving-up densities on oxalate-treated seeds and their lowest on water-treated (control) seeds. GUDs were also higher when patches were placed in riskier microhabitats. Moreover, risky microhabitats increased tannin GUDs relative to control GUDs but had no effect on oxalate GUDs. The former observation is consistent with defenses that act as digestibility reducers, and the latter is consistent with defensive toxins. These results indicate that the effects of plant defensive compounds on foraging behavior are complicated and require consideration of not only the potential effects of the compound, but also the environment to which the forager is exposed.

In a large-scale experiment that evaluated 28 litter types, we found that low-lignin litter fixed substantially more N than did higher-lignin litter (0.9-1.3 vs. 0.06-0.26 mg N/gram initial litter mass, integrated over two years of decomposition). The supply of nutrients other than N had small and inconsistent effects on N2 fixation. A second experiment then focused on the importance of non-N nutrients, using litter collected from control plots and plots fertilized with P and with all other essential elements except N (abbreviated 'T'), and decomposed in plots that had been fertilized with P, T, and P + T for 12 yr. Litter from P-fertilized plots supported significantly greater AR activity; however, the increase could be explained by decreased lignin concentrations in litter produced in P-fertilized plots. Related studies on controls of decomposition rates in Hawaiian montane forests show that the decomposition of low-lignin litter is increased substantially by added N, while that of high-lignin litter is increased less or not at all. The extent to which decomposition is N-limited correlates strongly with the integrated quantity of N fixed during decomposition. We conclude that low carbon quality of litter, indicated by high lignin concentrations, constrains decomposition and heterotrophic N2 fixation in Hawaiian montane forests, even where N supply limits net primary production.

Cultivation and soil amendments can dramatically alter soil nutrient pools and cycling, yet few studies have examined the longterm (>50 yr) influence of pasturing and cultivation on soil processes in the forests that develop after abandonment. Twelve forested sites at Harvard Forest in central New England were compared 90-120 yr after abandonment from agricultural use. We measured soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P); light fraction C, N, and δ15N; microbial chloroform-N; net N mineralization and nitrification; nitrification potential; and culturable nitrifiers on sites with differing land-use history and vegetation. The sites had similar soil series and topography but were arrayed along a soil disturbance gradient from permanent woodlots (selective logging but no mineral soil disturbance) to formerly pastured sites (clearcut and grazed but no deep [>10 cm] soil disturbance) to formerly cultivated sites (cleared-with-plow horizon 15-20 cm thick). Mineral soil C (0-15 cm soil depth) was very similar among all sites, but the forest floor C was lower in the cultivated sites than in the woodlots of both stand types. Mineral soil in cultivated sites contained 800 kg P/ha and 300 kg P/ha more than woodlots, a relative increase of 39% for N and 52% for P. The cultivated soils had lower C:N and C:P ratios, largely driven by higher soil N and P. The light fraction appeared to be more sensitive to prior land use than the bulk soil organic matter. The C content and C:N ratio of light fraction were lower in cultivated soils, which suggests that input and/or turnover of organic matter pools of relatively recent origin remain altered for a century after abandonment. Similar δ15N for the light and heavy fraction organic matter pools in cultivated soils suggests that cultivation accelerates the mineralization of humus N, increasing the proportion of N available for plant uptake, resulting in a convergence of the light and heavy fractions. The N pool in the woodlot soils may have been subject to preferential losses of small amounts of 14N over a longer time period, resulting in a more pronounced divergence between the light fraction (reflecting recent plant inputs) and the mineral-associated heavy fraction (more recalcitrant). Nitrification was strongly influenced by land-use history, with highest rates in formerly cultivated sites. In contrast, soil net N mineralization and chloroform-N were more strongly influenced by present vegetation. Nitrifying bacteria were relatively abundant in all pastured and cultivated sites; however, only the cultivated hardwood sites, with lowest C:N ratios (16-18), had substantial net nitrification. Historical manure inputs may explain the more rapid soil net nitrification rates, by decreasing soil C:N ratios and thus reducing nitrate immobilization in the mineral soil of cultivated sites. Regionally, 65% of the land area was pastured, and a proportion of the nutrients obtained from grazing was transferred to the cultivated croplands, which comprise ≤15% of the land area. Pastures generally had intermediate nutrient ratios and N transformations but were often more similar to woodlots, which suggests that plowing and amendments, rather than forest clearance, have the greatest impact on soil organic matter and nutrients. The influence of land-use history on soil N and P and nitrification rates was more dramatic in hardwood sites, which indicates that characteristics of the recovering vegetation and/or changes in plant community composition associated with prior land use are important factors in the rate of recovery. Our findings lead to the surprising conclusion that 19th century agricultural practices decreased forest floor nutrient content and ratios, and increased nitrifier populations and net nitrate production for approximately a century after abandonment. Consideration of site history clearly deserves more attention in the design of field experiments, and in our understanding of patterns of element distributions and transformations in dynamic forested landscapes.",Carbon | Cultivation | Land-use history | Light fraction | Nitrification | Nitrogen mineralization | Organic matter | Pastures | Phosphorus | Reforestation | Vegetation effects | Woodlots | δ N natural abundance 15,NA,NA

To determine the effects of nectar robbing on paternity, we used a series of experimental populations of plants containing a known allozyme marker. In each population, we experimentally controlled the levels of nectar robbing on each I. aggregata plant by cutting a hole in the corolla with dissecting scissors and removing nectar with a micro-capillary tube.

We then genotyped seeds for the allozyme marker to determine the number of seeds sired by plants with known levels of robbing. Heavy nectar robbing (> 80% of flowers robbed) significantly reduced the number of seeds sired, as well as the number of seeds produced due to pollinator avoidance of heavily robbed plants. Total plant reproduction, both male and female contributions, were reduced by 50% due to high levels of robbing. To date, no other studies have measured the effects of nectar robbing on realized male function (number of seeds sired).

To date, this work has primarily focused on the effects of predator-induced behavioral plasticity on communities. However, predator-induced morphological plasticity, which has been documented in many taxa, might also lead to trait-mediated indirect effects. Here, I examined how predators altered the behavior and morphology of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) and leopard frogs (R. pipiens) and how these phenotypic changes altered the outcome of competition between the two species. Competition in the absence of caged predators was asymmetric; when reared separately, leopard frogs grew more than wood frogs, but when competing (without predators), wood frogs grew faster than leopard frogs. The presence of caged predators reversed the outcome of competition between the two anuran prey. In the presence of larval dragonflies (Anax spp.) or caged mudminnows (Umbra limi), leopard frogs grew faster than wood frogs while total tadpole biomass production remained unchanged. Thus, there was a predator-mediated indirect effect. Because predators alter both the behavior and morphology of larval anurans and both of these traits are known to affect resource consumption and growth, both are potential mechanisms to explain the change in competitive outcome. Changes in behavior were not related to changes in growth, but changes in morphology (specifically mouth width and tail length) were related to changes in growth. When competitors were added (without predators), wood frogs increased their mouth width by 10% and their tail length by 3%, while leopard frogs increased their mouth width by 5% and did not change their tail length. The greater increase in mouth width for wood frogs should increase their forage intake, since tadpoles feed by scraping periphyton; the importance of a 3% longer tail in competitive ability is unknown. The presence of the predator threat (via chemical cues from the caged predators) reduced both the mouth width and tail length in the two prey species to precompetition levels. This response corresponded with the reduced competitive ability of the wood frogs. This work demonstrates that both competitors and predators can alter prey morphology and suggests that changes in morphology can cause trait-mediated indirect effects.",Anax | Behavior | Competition | Leopard frog | Morphology | Phenotypic plasticity | Predation | Rana pipiens | Rana sylvatica | Umbra limi | Wood frog,all,All Open Access

Recruitment failure was much more important to A. agaricites and L. cucullata than to M. annularis, which could survive long periods with minimal larval input. Recovery of these populations will require an increase in both survival and recruitment.

We document multiannual fluctuation in the abundance of common voles. The numerical response of Montagu's Harrier to this variable food supply was studied using breeding parameters (breeding density, breeding phenology, and various measures of breeding success). Breeding density and mean clutch size were strongly correlated with spring vole abundance, whereas mean brood size at fledgling was correlated positively with summer vole abundance. The mechanism involved in the numerical response of Montagu's Harrier indicates that dispersal and colonization by yearlings may be more important than natality per se. Pellets collected between 1986 and 1997 were used to determine the functional response of Montagu's Harrier to variations in vole abundance. In terms of biomass, Montagu's Harrier diet consisted mainly of voles (33.7-86.6%, between 1986 and 1997). Vole biomass in pellets was closely related to vole abundance estimated by trapping. A type II functional response was detected, with satiation at high prey density, as the shapes of many relationships between breeding parameters and vole abundance were more curvilinear than linear.

Some conclusions from the analysis are as follows: 1) Seasonal constraints that force males and females to have equal development times cause differences between the sexes in other characteristics. 2) The survival cost of greater body size generates a sex ratio at maturation favoring the smaller sex, consistent with much empirical evidence. 3) The relationships among size, growth rate, and development time can be represented graphically in a way that permits sexually dimorphic life histories to be depicted and compared. Cases considered here indicate considerable diversity among these patterns. 4) An allometric growth function is derived to facilitate graphical and mathematical analysis of body size. 5) The reproductive size quotient, an indicator of reproductive potential relative to body size, is defined and shown to be a significant life history characteristic. Except when mortality rate is strongly related to size at maturation, or when generation time is fixed, the reproductive size quotient should be maximized, and these maxima should be the same for males and females.",Allometry | Body size | Development time | Female demographic dominance | Gender differences | Growth-survival trade-off | Optimal life histories | Sex ratio | Sexual dimorphism | Sexual selection,NA,NA

Trenching approximately doubled height growth in the understory. Leaf loss rates were unaffected by either treatment but were 3.7 times higher in Dinizia compared with Aspidosperma. Aspidosperma could persist in the understory, as leaf production and loss were balanced at 0.60% PPFD, whereas Dinizia could not, as it required 2.4% PPFD. Reducing either aboveground competition or belowground competition allowed Dinizia to persist as leaf production was increased above unchanging leaf loss rates. Gap and trenching treatments both significantly reduced mortality rates in Dinizia. Location in gaps significantly reduced mortality rates in Aspidosperma. Both species significantly increased allocation to leaves and significantly decreased allocation to roots in response to trenching. The increased growth in the wet season caused by trenching, and increased foliar nitrogen and phosphorus amount, showed that both species were probably competing with adult trees for nutrients as well as PAR.

We reared eggs from 56 females in a seminatural common environment and released 356 of the resulting hatchlings in four replicates at a natural nesting area to assess offspring recapture probability as a measure of survivorship during the post-emergence migration. Larger body size of hatchling turtles was strongly favored by natural selection overall (β' = 0.346, P < 0.001) and in each replicate. Although selection on body size was positive in all analyses, the form of selection varied depending on the inclusion of nonrecaptured presumed dead individuals in the statistical analyses. This result indicates that such analytical tools are sensitive to the common assumption in many mark-recapture studies that nonrecaptured individuals have no fitness (i.e., W = 0). The most likely explanation for the size-dependent recapture probabilities is differential mortality, because body size at release for survivors was significantly larger than body size at release for hatchlings found dead. This pattern of survivorship appeared to result from size-dependent predation. We suggest that the benefit of larger body size for hatchling turtles may reside in improved locomotor performance that reduces the duration of exposure of larger individuals to predation. This hypothesis is supported by significant negative correlations between measures of body size and time elapsed between release and recapture.",Body size | Hatchling performance | Life-history evolution | Mark-recapture | Natural selection | Predation | Survivorship | Trachemys scripta | Turtles,all,All Open Access

When a top predator feeds on an intermediate predator and they both feed on a shared basal resource, a phenomenon labeled intraguild predation (IGP), the potential exists for complex food web dynamics due to predation and competitive effects. Here we investigate the relative importance of direct predation vs. competition by a top predator on an intermediate predator. The study system is the rocky intertidal interaction web formed by the predatory seastar Pisaster ochraceus, the predatory whelks Nucella emarginata and N. canaliculata, and a shared resource species, the mussel Mytilus trossulus. Previous experiments documented strong negative effects of Pisaster on mussels and whelks, but the mechanisms responsible for the effects on whelks, whether competition or predation, were not identified. Here we report results of a field experiment that manipulated both Mytilus and Pisaster to determine the short- and longer-term changes in whelk populations. Using a simplified dynamic model for changes in abundance over the initial stages of the experiment, we separated and quantified the top-down effect of direct predation by seastars vs. the bottom-up effects of competition and food limitation. Short-term results were in agreement with longer-term responses. Results suggest that direct and indirect bottom-up influences of mussels were far stronger than predation, and thus, whelk increases in the absence of seastars were due to reduced competition with Pisaster. Large differences between the body sizes of seastars and whelks make it difficult to determine the ultimate nature of the resource under competition between predators. Small mussels may constitute only a food resource for seastars, but to some extent, they also represent a microhabitat for whelks. Differences in the magnitude of the response to mussel manipulations between Nucella species might be due to slight differences in the way the species utilize mussel beds. Some of the predictions of theoretical IGP models regarding coexistence and stability of species may not apply to this interaction web because it includes species with both 'open' and 'closed' populations, rather than just closed populations as assumed by the models.",Bottom-up effects | Effect sizes | Exploitation competition | Intraguild predation | Mussels | Mytilus | Nucella | Pisaster | Rocky intertidal | Seastars | Top-down effects | Whelks,NA,NA

I found that flowers of F. virginiana show pronounced sexual dimorphism in petal length, stamen length, nectar and pollen production, and that this results in dramatic and consistent levels of sex-differential visitation by ants, bees, and flies. I performed manipulations of hermaphrodite flowers to understand the basis of selectivity and found that much of bee and fly preference for hermaphrodite flowers derived from their strong preference for longer petals, but also from a more subtle preference for pollen-filled anthers. These studies also revealed that other traits contribute to the observed discrimination against females. A stronger relationship existed between bee visitation and pollen receipt in females than between bee visitation and pollen removal from hermaphrodites. An analysis of natural variation in petal and stamen length confirmed the central role of petal length and also showed a lack of an effect of vestigial stamen length in pollination success of females. It also revealed a significant effect of stamen length, but not of petal length, on pollen removal.

We examine the factors determining the phenology and synchrony of birth seasons of 13 species of ungulates in the Serengeti ecosystem, Tanzania. We propose that phenology of births (time of year) is determined by food supply, whereas birth synchrony (degree of coordination or spread) is an antipredator adaptation that functions in two different ways. High synchrony may occur through 'predator satiation' in species with precocious newborn ('followers'), whereas asynchrony may occur through 'predator avoidance' in species with nonprecocial young ('hiders'). We used green biomass of grass or tree shoots and percentage crude protein as measures of food supply. Births were determined from monthly sample counts covering the period 1967-1997. The frequency distribution of births was compared to that predicted by the abundance of green biomass and percentage protein, and by an even (asynchronous) monthly distribution. Wildebeest, topi, warthog, and Grant's gazelle births differed from all predicted distributions. Another group showed birth distributions similar to that of green biomass food (buffalo, oribi) or the distribution of percentage protein (giraffe, waterbuck, kongoni, zebra). Also giraffe, waterbuck, and Thomson's gazelle showed births spread more evenly through the year, For grazing species the lag in months between birth peak and protein peak is a positive function of metabolic body size whereas the lag with biomass is a negative function of body size. We suggest that small grazers produce their young early in the wet season ahead of the high protein peak, whereas large species produce their young in phase with high biomass and after the protein peak consistent with metabolic requirements. In terms of synchrony, large species in large herds with precocial young (wildebeest, topi, buffalo) have highly synchronized birth seasons consistent with the 'predator satiation' hypothesis. Small species living in small groups with nonprecocial young (impala, Thomson's and Grant's gazelle, waterbuck, oribi) have births less synchronized than the food supply, as predicted by the 'predator avoidance' hypothesis. In general, food supply determines the phenology of the birth season. Predation appears to shape the synchrony of births through two opposite adaptations.

Among unmanipulated litters, juvenile growth rate and survival, but not litter size, were significantly related to annual food supply. Experimental increases in offspring number were successfully sustained in a high- and a low-food year, but in both years increases in litter sizes were associated with pronounced declines in juvenile growth rates. However, the reduced size of offspring in augmented litters did not fully compensate for the increase in offspring number, so that the total litter mass supported by augmented females was much higher than that of control females. During late lactation, augmented females were characterized by increased daily energy expenditure, but not by significant changes in time budgets, relative to control females. Increases in litter size did not appear to reduce maternal survival, but were associated with declines in offspring survival. Together, these results indicate that food availability and energetic ceilings do not limit litter size in red squirrels directly, but that trade-offs between offspring number and offspring survival may eliminate any advantage of weaning larger-than-normal litters.","Boreal forest (Yukon, Canada) | Energy budgets | Field metabolic rate | Lactation | Life-history trade-offs | Limits to reproductive performance | Litter-size manipulations | Mammals | Offspring number | Optimal | Red squirrels | Reproductive effort | Reproductive energetics | Sciuridae | Tamiasciurus hudsonicus",NA,NA

The field flume allows independent measurements of uptake by communities of natural composition and condition. We compare our results with those estimated using empirically derived engineering equations that describe transport processes to rough surfaces in order to explore the possibility that uptake rates can be predicted from these equations. We also investigate the possibility that the seagrass canopy alters the characteristics of water flow within the community, which is reflected by the friction imposed by the canopy (the friction coefficient) on the moving water. Our results indicate that ammonium uptake by seagrass communities is dependent on water velocity. Further, seagrasses affect characteristics of water flow within the community that are reflected in rates of ammonium uptake. Empirically derived engineering equations used with measured friction coefficients yield expected Stanton numbers (a non-dimensional ratio of flux to a surface to advection by a surface) that are within 95% of those measured in the field flume.

Likewise, sites where sparrows placed their nests were significantly different from random sites within territories. Both successful territories (those containing a nest that fledged at least one young) and successful nest sites differed significantly in habitat from those that were unsuccessful.

In some lakes, pumpkinseed forms that use shallow- and open-water environments coexist. We tested four predictions relating to an hypothesis of character release: (1) Pumpkinseed divergence is favored in the absence of the closely related bluegill sunfish (L. macrochirus), a known competitor elsewhere, (2) divergence is favored when the combined effects of other planktivorous fish taxa that may impose diffuse competition is reduced, (3) divergence is positively related to lake size because larger lakes provide more distinct and diverse environments, and (4) divergence is favored in lakes dominated by open-water habitat. In two lakes with introduced bluegill (sympatry), bluegill appear to limit pumpkinseed divergence, as they do elsewhere. Pumpkinseeds were neither found in the open-water habitat, nor did they eat significant amounts of open-water prey. In nine allopatric lakes selected for their similarity to the sympatric lakes, pumpkinseeds were ecologically and morphologically divergent, consistent with a character release hypothesis. Morphological divergence followed functional expectations. Open-water pumpkinseeds generally had longer caudal peduncles, shorter heads, thinner bodies, and smaller paired fins compared to shallow-water pumpkinseeds (heritable variation in body shape has been demonstrated elsewhere). Among 26 allopatric lakes, other planktivores had a negative effect on intrapopulation divergence as if they collectively imposed diffuse competition. Surprisingly, lake size was unrelated to divergence, and the amount of open-water habitat had an unexpected negative effect. Mean body size was also negatively related to divergence.

Here we trace the allocation of nectar nutrients in the hawkmoth Amphion floridensis using naturally occurring variation in plant stable carbon isotopes and thereby derive a descriptive model of carbon flow into eggs. Because 13C content (expressed as δ13C, the 13C:12C ratio relative to a standard) depends on photosynthetic mode, moths were fed sucrose solution made with either either C3 or C4 sugar (beet or cane), both of which were distinct from larval host plant. In addition, two of four experimental diets contained an amino acid supplement distinct in δ13C from either sugar or larval host plant. Females were hand fed daily from experimental diets, and their eggs were collected and analyzed for δ13C. Egg δ13C increased rapidly from a value resembling larval δ13C, and followed an asymptotic pattern of carbon incorporation. The presence of amino acids in the diet had no effect on either fecundity or egg δ13C. Because egg δ13C equilibrated at a value lower than δ13C diet, we invoke an allocation model in which carbon is contributed to eggs by two separate pools. One pool of carbon comes into isotopic equilibrium with adult diet, whereas the other does not, contributing carbon with an exclusively larval signature across a female's lifetime. Carbon fractional turnover rate and the relative contribution of the two pools were estimated by fitting the model to the data with nonlinear regression. The resulting model fitted the data well and indicated that 50-60% of egg carbon is derived from adult nectar sugars after the 'mixing pool' has come into equilibrium. Thus, this study demonstrates that adult nectar sugars provide an important source of egg carbon and explores how properties of nutrient mixing and turnover can generate patterns of reproductive allocation.",Allocation | Carbon turnover | Lepidoptera | Nectar feeding | Reproduction | Sphingidae | Stable isotopes,NA,NA

Although different types of disturbance are likely to generate different community responses, the relationship between different disturbance agents and their effects on reef fish communities has not been examined experimentally. We studied a set of natural patch reefs, dominated by a diverse array of soft and hard coral cover, at Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef (northeastern Australia). The fish assemblages on the reefs were sampled over 4 mo to establish baseline values and then experimentally disturbed. Two types of disturbance were carried out in a factorial combination: pulsed mortality by removing all fish from reefs and pulsed habitat disturbance. Habitat disturbance was applied at two levels: Level 1 consisted only of damaging all live hard corals with a hammer; Level 2 consisted of damaging all live hard corals, and in addition, using a hammer to reduce the height and complexity of the reef matrix. We then monitored the experiment for a further 19 mo, including two recruitment seasons. Unmanipulated control assemblages persisted through time, and despite large changes in total abundance, species composition remained consistent relative to disturbed treatments. Assemblages disturbed by fish removal were resilient, with recolonization from both immigration and larval settlement effectively removing differences between removal treatments and controls 3 mo after manipulation. Habitat disturbance alone generated differences between experimental and control assemblages, which persisted for the duration of the experiment. The more extreme level of habitat disturbance generated more extreme changes in fish assemblages when no pulsed mortality occurred. Habitat disturbance in combination with pulsed mortality generated similar community responses as the habitat disturbance treatment alone. However, fish removal had the effect of eliminating the difference between fish assemblages on reefs subjected to different levels of habitat disturbance. Community response to habitat disturbance was driven by species-specific patterns of reduced abundance of species associated with live coral in combination with increased numbers of those associated with rubble. Declines in the abundance of coral associates on damaged reefs were abrupt, with no recovery observed for the duration of the experiment. In contrast, increases in the abundance of rubble associates were more ephemeral, in that initial high levels of recruitment and immigration were followed by a high rate of loss. Habitat disturbance also generated reefs that typically supported lower fish abundance, fewer species, and increased evenness relative to controls. Our results support a model of patch-reef fish assemblages organized by a combination of deterministic factors (such as habitat structure) and stochastic processes (such as recruitment). These disparate mechanisms operate in concert to generate reasonably consistent patterns of community structure. Habitat structure appears to mediate much of the apparent determinism and is likely to operate both as a reflection of species-specific habitat preferences and by modifying interactions among fish species. Consequently, disturbance plays a substantial role in structuring communities of coral-reef fishes by modifying both spatial and temporal heterogeneity.","Community structure | Coral reef fish | Disturbance | Fish removal | Great Barrier Reef, Australia | Habitat structure | Patch reefs",NA,NA

We use this new method of analysis which we call OMI (for Outlying Mean Index) to address the question of niche separation and niche breadth. The Outlying Mean Index, or species marginality, measures the distance between the mean habitat conditions used by species (species centroid), and the mean habitat conditions of the sampling area (origin of the niche hyperspace), and OMI analysis places species along habitat conditions using a maximization of their mean OMI. Therefore, the position of the species depends on their niche deviation from a reference, which represents neither the mean nor the most abundant species, but a theoretical ubiquitous species that tolerates the most general habitat conditions (i.e., a hypothetical species uniformly distributed among habitat conditions). We demonstrate that OMI analysis is well suited for the investigation of multidimensional niche breadths in the case of strong limiting factors (e.g., meteorological conditions) or strong driving forces (e.g., longitudinal stream gradient). Furthermore, the analysis helps in finding which ecological factors are most important for community structure and organization and provides a separation of species based on their niche characteristics.",Biotic interactions | Multivariate analysis | Niche breadth | Niche position | Outlying mean index (OMI) | Permutation test | Sample weight | Species-environment relationships,NA,NA

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative importance and interaction of relatively static landscape factors and more dynamic factors in a shortgrass steppe landscape. The landscape factors examined were topographic position, and soil texture. The dynamic factors studied were seasonal climate and the localized effects of individual plants on soils. Patterns were evaluated by sampling soil between and under individual Bouteloua gracilis plants in paired upland (erosional) and lowland (depositional) plots at eight locations at the Central Plains Experimental Range (CPER), Colorado. We quantified five organic C and N pools (total, fine and coarse particulate organic matter [POM], mineral-associated organic matter [MAOM], and potentially mineralizable C and N), and we estimated seasonal patterns of in situ N dynamics with three methods (extractable inorganic N, net N mineralization in uncovered cores, and N adsorbed on ion exchange resin [IER] bags). Topographic position and soil texture each explained much of the landscape-scale variation of C and N pools and vegetation structure. Most lowland plots were enriched in silt, clay, C, and N relative to adjacent upland plots, and topographic position affected most pools significantly. Most vegetation and biogeochemical variables were strongly correlated with soil sand content. Across the range of sand content encountered (40-83%), the fraction of area in bare soil openings >5 cm across increased sevenfold, and most C and N fractions increased by 2-4.5 times. Plant-induced, microscale heterogeneity of soil C and N was comparable in magnitude to landscape-scale heterogeneity for pools with more rapid turnover (POM and mineralizable C and N), but presence or absence of plants did not affect more stable, mineral-associated organic matter. Plant-induced heterogeneity was significant in all locations, but its importance likely decreases with decreasing sand content as cover becomes more continuous, particularly in lowlands. Total extractable inorganic N and nitrate, N adsorbed on resin bags, and the proportion of mineralized N that was nitrified during incubations increased with increasing soil water content or precipitation, but net N mineralization did not vary systematically with precipitation. Inorganic N availability was greatest during relatively moist spring periods, and these were the only times when indices of in situ N availability followed the spatial patterns expected from laboratory assays of C and N pool distribution. The relatively weak spatial patterns for N dynamics contrast with the substantial landscape and individual-plant scale variation in C and N pools. Landscape patterns of N mineralization and availability may be tied to N pools, such as POM N, that are not strongly related to topography or texture. Particulate organic matter appears to be especially important to N retention and availability on sandy soils, which typify most sites at the CPER; the proportion of total N residing in POM was high and POM C:N ratios were low in sandy upland soils. We suggest that soil texture is a key proximal control over biogeochemical processes and is largely responsible for observed landscape-scale patterns, including topographic differences. Models that integrate effects of texture and topography have the potential to link landscape biogeochemical patterns to short-term processes that directly influence SOM dynamics and to long-term geomorphic processes that influence soil distribution, including eolian redistribution of soil materials, which is important in many dry regions.",Biogeochemistry | Catena model | Landscape ecology | Microclimate | Nitrogen mineralization | Semiarid ecosystems | Shortgrass steppe | Soil carbon | Soil nitrogen | Soil organic matter | Soil texture | Topography,NA,NA

Dioecious fig species are free of the seed-wasp trade-off involved within each monoecious fig fruit; wasp and seed production in dioecious species reflect selective pressures acting on each sex to maximize offspring production. We studied specific predictions of the reproductive behavior of dioecious fig species, predictions that were made based on studies of monoecious figs. Pollinator (and associated parasitic wasp) arrivals at trees bearing receptive inflorescences were closely linked to the seasonal variation in receptive fig numbers. More wasps arrived at female trees of F. exasperata than at 'male' trees, apparently because of synchronized wasp release by male trees during the time of synchronous female tree receptivity. Wasp numbers arriving at male and female trees of F. hispida did not differ significantly, apparently because inflorescence production on male and female trees was more evenly spread over time. Female inflorescences had more pollinators than male inflorescences in F. hispida; female and male inflorescences had approximately equal numbers of pollinators in F. exasperata. Hand-pollination experiments introducing one, three, or eight pollinators into figs of F. hispida showed that foundress number was a significant predictor of resultant wasp or seed number. In both fig species, female inflorescences initiated more flowers than male inflorescences, and produced more seeds than male inflorescences produced wasps.

A common approach, implemented with methods such as cross-correlation and cross-spectral analysis, relies on matching scales of variability. This approach concludes that a population pattern is caused by a physical factor if their variances share a dominant period. In a nonlinear system, however, forcing at one temporal period can produce a response with variability at one or more different periods. Thus, scale-matching methods will be most successful at establishing cause-effect relationships in linear systems, or close to equilibria, where nonlinear systems are well approximated by linear ones. Here, we propose an alternative approach that does not assume linearity and relies on time series models that are both nonlinear and nonparametric. We specifically apply these models to determine the correct but unknown frequency of a periodic forcing. The time series are generated by simulation of a predator-prey model. Under periodic forcing, this type of model is known to be capable of different dynamic regimes, including chaos and quasi-periodicity, in which the power spectra of population numbers exhibit variance at frequencies other than that of the forcing. We show that nonlinear time series models, built with feedforward neural networks, are able to distinguish the correct forcing period in the predator-prey simulations. These results hold under two common limitations of ecological data: the presence of dynamical and measurement noise, and the availability of time series data for only one variable.

Second, I included two new terms in the equation: (1) an explicit spatial variable for habitat quality that reflects the match between a habitat and a population (species-habitat match), and (2) a demand/supply function that depends on the ratio between the energy used by all populations occurring in a habitat, and energy available in that habitat. Energy was used as a common currency to overcome differences between species of different body sizes as well as to overcome differences caused by disproportional intra- and interspecific effects. Allometric relations were used to characterize parameter values that correlate with body size, such as metabolic rate, birth rate, and death rate. The analytical solution of the equation for carrying capacity shows that, for a population to have a positive carrying capacity, its ratio of death rate to birth rate should be less than its match to the habitat it occupies. Literature-based body-size-dependent birth and death rates of Eutherian mammals show that the death-rate:birth-rate ratio decreases with body size. Combining the analytical solution and the death-rate:birth-rate ratio reveals that habitat generality should positively scale with body size.

Unfortunately, relatively few low-gradient rivers are unregulated and retain their natural 'flood pulse' behavior in most developed regions of the world. Furthermore, attempts to quantify flood inundation dynamics of any river floodplain are scarce. We used aerial photography to delineate the degree of floodplain inundation and GIS to quantify flooded areas on the forested floodplain of a 6.3-km reach of the Ogeechee River, an unregulated sixth-order river in the southeastern USA. A regression was used to quantify the relationship between discharge and percentage floodplain inundation. Using 58 years of daily discharge data obtained from a U.S. Geological Survey gaging station, we converted daily discharge into daily percentage inundation and produced an inundation-duration curve, which describes the percentage of time that a particular inundation level is exceeded. This showed, for example, that >50% of the flood-plain was inundated 15% of the time (54 d/yr) and that 100% was inundated 3.6% of the time (13 d/yr) for the average year. At 50% inundation, system width exceeded channel width by 19 times. In a relatively wet year, we showed that 50-100% of the floodplain was inundated for several months during the winter-spring. Even in a relatively dry year, >20% of the floodplain (seven times the river width) was inundated for several months. The long-term pattern over a period of 58 years (1938-1995) showed considerable fluctuation in inundation and recession occurring throughout most years, with the highest peaks found during winter and spring. The floodplain failed to reach 50% inundation in only four of 58 years. However, in six years, >50% of the floodplain was inundated for at least 30% of the time (i.e., four months of the year). Floods of 50% inundation typically had a duration of at least 30 d. Thus, although inundation may fluctuate considerably within a year, much of the floodplain can be inundated for a relatively long duration. Description of such long-term patterns is essential for understanding natural hydrodynamics of unregulated rivers, particularly as attempts are made to restore previously altered systems. The flood pulse for this forested floodplain river is less predictable and floods are of shorter duration than the large tropical rivers for which the flood pulse concept was originally conceived. Unlike tropical rivers where seasonal patterns of flooding are driven by precipitation, flooding in the Ogeechee River is primarily controlled by seasonal differences in evapotranspiration. Description of inundation dynamics is critical to understanding how plants and animals adapt to a habitat that shifts from dry to lentic to lotic, and in quantifying production of aquatic organisms and ecosystem processes.",Discharge | Flood pulse | Floodplain | Hydrologic model | Hydrology | Inundation | Landwater interactions | Long-term research | River swamp | Unregulated river | Wetland,NA,NA

Seabirds have provided evidence for this hypothesis, and positive effects of high density have been offered as explanations for coloniality in this overwhelmingly colonial group. We investigated effects of nesting density on reproductive success of a colonial seabird that nests at variable densities, the Magellanic Penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus). Using breeding success data collected from 1984 to 1991 as part of a long-term study of this species at a large colony at Punta Tombo, Argentina, and experiments that included manipulation of nesting density, we addressed effects of nesting density at two spatial scales: the within-colony area scale (hundreds to thousands of square meters) and the very small scale of a penguin's immediate surroundings (distance to nearest neighbor). Nest density at the colony averaged 8.7 active nests/100 m2 and ranged from <1 to >50 active nests/100 m2 (n = 873 plots). In 100-m2 plots sampled from 1987 to 1990 over large areas of the colony of similar average nest quality and distance inland, the number of fledglings per active nest was inversely correlated with nest density. Experienced breeders using high-quality nests in a high-density study area (>20 nests/100 m2) had 0.25 fewer fledglings per active nest than similar birds nesting in a low-density area (<6 nests/100 m2). Penguin fights (during which eggs and chicks may be lost), nonbreeding 'prospectors' (who can start fights and kill chicks), and nest predation were all significantly more prevalent in the high-density area. Within a low-density area, birds nesting within touching distance of neighbors (≤80 cm) had significantly lower success than those with more distant neighbors. Nests where fighting occurred were significantly closer to their neighbors than were nests where no evidence of fighting was observed. We found no association between predation and distance to nearest neighbor. Experimental data were consistent with correlative results. In a plot with reduced density, fledging success was higher (P < 0.10) and fewer agonistic behaviors and predators were observed than in higher density plots. Chicken eggs placed in vacant nests remained untouched by predators longer in low-density areas of the colony than in high-density areas. All results indicated that yearly fledging success declines with increasing density at both the local and area scale, and that rates of predation and intraspecific aggression increase with density. The consistently negative effect of increased density begs the question of why Magellanic Penguins are colonial. Possible explanations include benefits to lifetime reproductive success not reflected in yearly fledging success (e.g., mate and nest acquisition or retention) and benefits of aggregation at spatial scales larger than those investigated in this study.",Argentina | Coloniality | Density dependence | Habitat selection | Intraspecific aggression | Nest density | Penguins | Predation | Reproductive success | Seabirds | Spatial scale | Spheniscus magellanicus,NA,NA

The models also assumed that consumer distribution shifted more rapidly toward the more rewarding patch as the difference in resource intake rates between the patches increased. In most cases, the time-average of spatial heterogeneity of resource densities is greatest for intermediate rates of consumer movement. The average resource densities and consumer fitness are also frequently maximal when movement rates are intermediate. Intermediate movement rates allow enough of a lag in consumer redistribution that resources periodically escape overexploitation. Resource densities and heterogeneity may increase by a large factor as the rate of consumer movement (or the sensitivity of consumer movement to differences in intake rates) increases.

The influence on groundwater heterotrophic metabolism of DOC availability, inorganic nitrogen (N), inorganic phosphorus (P), temperature, and season were assessed using laboratory manipulations of aquifer sediments and seasonal measurements in field microcosms. Augmentation with DOC (10 mgC/L above background) nearly doubled respiration rate during base flow but did not influence respiration during snowmelt. In contrast, addition of N and P did not influence respiration at any time. Respiration rate during snowmelt was significantly higher than at base flow and was not influenced by any combination of DOC, N, P, or temperature. The hypothesis that groundwater metabolism is limited by DOC availability during base flow was supported. Hydrologic linkage between soils and groundwater represents a critical flux of DOC that supports metabolism in unconfined alluvial aquifers.",Aquatic-terrestrial interface | Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) | Groundwater | Hydrologic controls | Limitation of metabolism by DOC availability | Metabolism | Organic carbon cycling | Region of seasonal saturation (RoSS) | Seasonal variation | Shallow groundwater ecosystem | Snowmelt,NA,NA

For such data, we require flexible and robust analytical methods, which can deal with nonlinear relationships, high-order interactions, and missing values. Despite such difficulties, the methods should be simple to understand and give easily interpretable results. Trees explain variation of a single response variable by repeatedly splitting the data into more homogeneous groups, using combinations of explanatory variables that may be categorical and/or numeric. Each group is characterized by a typical value of the response variable, the number of observations in the group, and the values of the explanatory variables that define it. The tree is represented graphically, and this aids exploration and understanding. Trees can be used for interactive exploration and for description and prediction of patterns and processes. Advantages of trees include: (1) the flexibility to handle a broad range of response types, including numeric, categorical, ratings, and survival data; (2) invariance to monotonic transformations of the explanatory variables; (3) ease and robustness of construction; (4) ease of interpretation; and (5) the ability to handle missing values in both response and explanatory variables. Thus, trees complement or represent an alternative to many traditional statistical techniques, including multiple regression, analysis of variance, logistic regression, log-linear models, linear discriminant analysis, and survival models. We use classification and regression trees to analyze survey data from the Australian central Great Barrier Reef, comprising abundances of soft coral taxa (Cnidaria: Octocorallia) and physical and spatial environmental information. Regression tree analyses showed that dense aggregations, typically formed by three taxa, were restricted to distinct habitat types, each of which was defined by combinations of 3-4 environmental variables. The habitat definitions were consistent with known experimental findings on the nutrition of these taxa. When used separately, physical and spatial variables were similarly strong predictors of abundances and lost little in comparison with their joint use. The spatial variables are thus effective surrogates for the physical variables in this extensive reef complex, where information on the physical environment is often not available. Finally, we compare the use of regression trees and linear models for the analysis of these data and show how linear models fail to find patterns uncovered by the trees.",Analysis of variance | CART | Classification tree | Coral reef | Great Barrier Reef | Habitat characteristic | Octocorallia | Regression tree | Soft coral | Surrogate,NA,NA

Here we bring together two lines of evidence suggesting that the dynamics of vole populations in northern Fennoscandia may be chaotic: nonlinear analysis of time-series data, and a model based on biological mechanisms. We review how a mechanistic population model can be used to produce short-term population forecasts, even when one of the species is not observed, and then use this benchmark of model accuracy to support our choice of a mechanistic population model for vole dynamics. By adjusting model parameters to optimize the forecasting accuracy on the vole time series, we can obtain parameter estimates for the model. In tests on simulated data, this new approach to parameter estimation for stochastic dynamic models yields parameter estimates such that the fitted model produces dynamics qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those observed. However, some parameters are poorly identified (i.e., many different parameter combinations yield nearly identical model dynamics). For the best-fit parameters, the model dynamics are characterized by quasi-chaotic behavior; the global Lyapunov exponent is very close to (and statistically undistinguishable from) zero, but the median local Lyapunov exponent is significantly positive. Our findings of recurrent short-term chaos suggest that vole dynamics in northern Fennoscandia are characterized by a blend of order and irregularity.

However, the details by which persistence was achieved closely resemble source-sink dynamics, not classic metapopulation dynamics. Evidence suggests that continuous prey immigration into predator-prey bottles from extinction-invulnerable prey-only bottles may have weakened the coupling between predator and prey dynamics and contributed to the increase in persistence.

When exposed to caged (nonlethal) Aeshna dragonfly larvae, newts of two species (T. alpestris and T. helveticus) spent more time hiding in the leaf litter, had darker pigmentation in the tail fin, and developed larger heads and larger tails relative to their body size, in comparison with newts in predator-free ponds. The two phenotypes faced a performance trade-off across environments with and without odonates: the predator-induced phenotype survived twice as well as the no-predator phenotype when exposed to free dragonflies, but the predator-induced phenotype of both species grew more slowly until just before metamorphosis. For Triturus alpestris, a direct comparison of performance between phenotypes was complicated because predator-induced newts emerged later in the summer but at a larger body size. Nonrandom mortality imposed by hunting dragonflies caused selection favoring increasing tail size, but we found no selection on specific traits in predator-free ponds. Head shape was not subject to selection in either environment; we suspect that head shape is involved in consuming different prey in the presence and absence of predators and is unrelated to predator escape. Triturus in 25 natural populations from which we collected quantitative samples in 1997 and 1998 exhibited extreme spatial variation in predation regime (density of large predators ranged from 0 to 24 individuals/m2). Variation among populations in head shape was exactly as predicted by experimental results (Triturus of both species had relatively large heads when exposed to predators), but results for tail shape were consistent with the experiments in only one of the two years.

The main objectives of the study were (1) to assess whether individual plants actually differ in the viability of their progeny under natural conditions, and (2) to determine if naturally occurring levels of variation in viability may modify individual differences in fecundity. Seed progenies from 14 maternal parents belonging to one population were sown at 10 field sites differing broadly in habitat type and soil characteristics, and seedling emergence and survival subsequently were monitored for six years. Maternal parents differed significantly in progeny viability because of both differential seedling emergence and seedling survivorship, and variation in either of these parameters was not significantly related to maternal differences in seed size. Differences in seedling survivorship were more important than differences in seedling emergence as determinants of maternal variation in progeny viability. While individual differences in seedling emergence remained consistent across sowing sites, there was a strong parent x sowing site interaction on seedling survivorship, and the rank of maternal parents with regard to this variable varied erratically among sowing sites. A significant inverse relationship existed across maternal parents between seed production and progeny viability, which was not mediated by differences in seed size, thus suggesting a trade-off between the number and quality of the progeny produced by L. latifolia plants.

We used leaf blowers to erase footprints in the sand in three 40 m x 100 m plots differing in surface topography and vegetation and then measured attributes of the paths and tracks left by U. scoparia that were not disturbed (by observers) during their period of peak activity.

The frequency distribution of stride speed had two distinct modes (mean values 0.25 and 2.00 m/s), for which only the lower one is likely to be aerobically sustainable. Bipedal locomotion was extremely rare (<0.5% of all strides), but much undisturbed locomotion was unexpectedly fast. The inclines of the surfaces upon which locomotion occurred conformed to random habitat use. In contrast, the inclines of paths made by lizards had lower than expected amounts of nearly horizontal locomotion and a propensity for traveling almost directly uphill, especially when surfaces were steep. Habitat structure varied significantly among plots and affected several aspects of locomotion. For example, path length, average speed per path, and average magnitudes of path and surface inclines per path varied significantly among the three plots. Multiple regression analysis also revealed that the average speed per 1-m interval was maximized for paths with relatively shallow downhill slopes (-6% grade) and decreased significantly both with increased amounts of vegetative cover and increased turning between successive intervals.

We investigated the extent and behavioral mechanisms of temperature regulation in the nocturnal, rock-dwelling marbled gecko Christinus marmoratus during spring and summer. During the daytime, we recorded body temperatures of lizards sheltering beneath rocks, as well as operative temperatures (the equilibrium body temperatures that animals would attain in given microclimates) beneath randomly chosen rocks available to the lizards. These measurements were compared with reference to the lizard's set-point (or target) temperature range (T(set)), which we determined in a laboratory thermal gradient. In both seasons, lizard body temperatures were closer to T(set) than were randomly sampled operative temperatures, despite mean operative temperatures being 7°C below and 6°C above T(set) in spring and summer, respectively. The mean body temperature of geckos was 7°C higher, and the accuracy and effectiveness of temperature regulation were also much higher, during summer than during spring. The more severe physiological consequences of thermoconformity during summer, as well as a more constraining thermal environment during spring, are advanced as reasons for this seasonal pattern. At least two behavioral mechanisms allow C. marmoratus to achieve a regulated body temperature. First, operative temperatures within retreat sites selected by geckos were closer to T(set) than were operative temperatures beneath available rocks, suggesting retreat-site selection as a thermoregulatory mechanism. Second, lizard body temperatures were closer to T(set) than were operative temperatures at random positions within selected retreat sites. This observation, together with correlative evidence relating lizard body temperature to the maximum and minimum operative temperatures beneath selected retreat sites, indicates that positional and/or postural adjustments were also employed as thermoregulatory mechanisms.

In this area, seabirds are a major conduit bringing marine productivity to land. Seabirds leave guano on roosting and nesting islands, and carrion on nesting islands. We analyze how seabirds affect the abundance of a dominant consumer group, tenebrionid beetles, on 25 islands in the Gulf of California over a three-year period. Tenebrionid densities vary by three orders of magnitude among islands. Beetles are most abundant in areas influenced by seabirds: they are approximately five times more dense on nesting and roosting islands than on other islands and on mainland sites, and approximately six times more dense inside vs. outside colonies. Path analyses show that seabirds significantly affect beetles by two distinct pathways. On roosting islands, effects are mainly indirect: guano, a fertilizing nutrient, significantly enhances plant productivity; beetles eat plant detritus. On nesting islands, significant effects are primarily direct: beetles eat seabird carrion; the indirect pathway (guano and plants) contributes little on these islands. By providing energy and nutrients to fuel a diverse array of consumer populations, seabirds are central to the dynamics of these island ecosystems. Scavengers and avian parasites directly increase by eating seabird products. Likewise, populations of consumers that eat detritus, plant tissues, and seeds are enhanced indirectly via the fertilizing effects of guano on plants. Increases in these primary consumers indirectly facilitate high densities of many predators. Thus, consumer populations on these islands are deeply subsidized by substantial input from seabirds. Because consumers cannot influence the renewal rate of their allochthonous resources, the dynamics of these consumers and their food webs are largely donor controlled.","Allochthonous nutrient input | Food webs, donor-control | Gulf of California, Mexico | Island ecology | Nutrients | Seabirds | Spatial subsidies | Tenebrionid beetles",NA,NA

We investigated how different pond drying regimes affected the timing of metamorphosis and body size at metamorphosis of two closely related species of hylid treefrogs, one of which commonly breeds in temporary ponds (Hyla gratiosa) and the other in permanent ponds (Hyla cinerea). We experimentally manipulated the water level in cattle-tank communities, exposing tadpoles of each species to a slow drying treatment, a fast drying treatment, and a constant water level treatment. There was no direct effect of pond drying on the larval period or body size at metamorphosis of either species. The drying treatments indirectly affected these traits by increasing larval densities, which extended the larval period and produced smaller sizes at metamorphosis. The timing of metamorphosis and body size at metamorphosis of H. gratiosa were more plastic than the corresponding traits in H. cinerea, but this greater plasticity cannot be interpreted as adaptive.

I experimentally tested the role of dispersal limitation in structuring the zooplankton communities of fishless ponds in southwestern Michigan. An average of 12.9 new species of rotifers and crustaceans from the region were introduced at the beginning of the experiment into the intact resident communities of seven ponds in large in situ enclosures (the invasion treatment). Introduced species were found at least once over three months in six of the seven ponds, and one species consistently colonized all three replicate enclosures in three of the ponds. However, the success rate of the introductions was low as >91% of the species introduced immediately became extinct. In addition, introduced species remained rare throughout the experiment in every pond, comprising only 0-2.5% of total zooplankton community biomass. No effects of the invasion treatment were detected on total zooplankton diversity or biomass, on the biomass of native species, or on chlorophyll a concentration, suggesting that relaxing dispersal limitation for the regional pool had minimal effects on local community structure. Both the biomass of exotic species and the proportion of species introduced that successfully colonized the invasion treatment were negatively correlated with native species diversity. These patterns support the hypothesis that diversity confers resistance to invasion. The results of the invasion treatment indicated a minor role for dispersal limitation in structuring pond zooplankton communities. To test the role of interactions with resident species in excluding potential invaders, a second experiment was performed in four different ponds the following year. In addition to the control and invasion treatment, a second treatment (the resistance treatment) was imposed where the abundance of native species was reduced by filtering before the introduction of invaders. The goal of this treatment was to weaken interactions between resident species and invaders while maintaining the abiotic environment intact. Among the four ponds, 3.8 times more exotic species were found in the resistance treatment than in the invasion treatment, and their total biomass was 16.4 times greater. The contrast between the invasion and resistance treatments indicated an important role for species interactions in repelling invaders.

In the present study, it was found that a few weeks of grazing by the gastropod Littorina obtusata can induce substantially increased concentrations of phlorotannins in the intertidal brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum. In contrast, grazing by the isopod Idotea granulosa and simulations of herbivory through momentary and continuous clipping caused no significant changes in phlorotannin levels. This indicates a high degree of specificity in the elicitation of chemical responses to physical damage, something which previously has been shown for terrestrial vascular plants but not for marine algae. Ascophyllum plants that had been grazed by L. obtusata were also less susceptible than undamaged plants to further grazing by gastropods, but no such induced resistance was found in the experiments with I. granulosa. Feeding experiments with undamaged Ascophyllum plants and artificial food containing different levels of phlorotannins provided further support for the sensitivity of the feeding behavior of L. obtusata, and the insensitivity of I. granulosa, to intraspecific variation in the phlorotannin content of Ascophyllum. Since L. obtusata is specialized to live and feed on a few fucoid species, including A. nodosum, the results imply that phlorotannins have an important mediating role in the interactions between these macroalgae and L. obtusata. The experimentally induced increase of phlorotannins was consistent with results from phlorotannin analyses of Ascophyllum individuals from natural populations, where plants that had been heavily grazed by L. obtusata contained significantly higher levels of phlorotannins compared to undamaged plants. A field survey of the distribution and abundance of L. obtusata revealed that the density of the gastropod is highly variable at the same spatial scale as the phlorotannin content of Ascophyllum in the study area. These results suggest that grazing by L. obtusata can be an important factor in explaining natural phenotypic variation in the phlorotannin content of Ascophyllum. Together with the results from a few other studies on the interactions between mesoherbivores and marine algae, the results of this study support the previously proposed hypothesis that it is feeding by relatively small, less mobile herbivores that is most likely to cue for induced production of defense chemicals in seaweeds. More studies on such interactions may reveal that the apparent rarity of inducible chemical defenses in seaweeds is misleading.","Ascophyllum | Chemical responses induced | Intraspecific variation | Isopods | Littorina | Marine algae | Phlorotannins | Plant defenses | Plant-mesoherbivore interactions | Polyphenolics | Resistance, induced | Seaweeds",NA,NA

Here we examine patterns of regional and local species richness in freshwater crustacean zooplankton to test whether linear (suggesting dispersal limitation) or curvilinear (suggesting saturation, via strong local control) functions best fit the data. Local richness appeared saturated when regions of different spatial extents were included on the same graph. However, this pattern was influenced by differences in scale among surveys. We corrected for the effects of regional scale by plotting mean local richness against the residuals of the species-landscape area relations. Controlling for the extent of the regional scale produced much more linear patterns, suggesting strong dispersal limitation. We present a simple graphical model to explain how variation among surveys in the geographic size of regions can produce apparent saturation of local diversity even if the underlying pattern of local and regional richness is linear. We also compare the predictive power of residual regional richness on local richness with that of several local features in a multiple regression model. Local richness exhibits strong relationships with both residual regional richness and pH. We argue that the relative strengths of local and regional processes depend on the definition of the regional scale. A variety of evidence suggests that local processes play a major role in generating differences in zooplankton diversity among lakes within a biogeographic region. Evidence for the importance of dispersal limitation comes largely from comparisons of lakes across very large scales.
