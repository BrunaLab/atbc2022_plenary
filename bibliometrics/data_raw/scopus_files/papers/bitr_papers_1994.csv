The authors use Euglossa carcasses as temperature sensors to measure operative environmental temperatures (TE) of bees in forest openings (full sunlight) and in the forest understory (shade), relating activity levels of bees on fragrance baits in both locations to measured TE, other environmental variables, and time of day. Shade TE had the strongest (although not significant) direct effect on Euglossa and Eulaema activity levels in the early morning. Operative temperature in the sun apparently had no direct effects on activity of both genera at any time of day. From mid-morning to late afternoon, only time of day (or an unmeasured variable correlated with it) had a significant effect on Euglossa activity levels; the relationship was positive near midday and negative in the early afternoon.

Due to the possession of specific tissues or other devices that provide buoyancy, the diaspores of most tree species of the inundated forests are capable of floating for prolonged periods. A comparison of diaspore characteristics between hydrochorous tree species and their congeners in noninundated habitats reveals recurrent patterns: some lineages that in noninundated habitats possess dehiscent fruits with anemochorous or zoochorous seeds, in inundatable habitats switch to the production of hydrochorous seeds. Other lineages that in noninundated habitats have dehiscent fruits, in inundatable habitats switch to the production of indehiscent hydrochorous fruits. Lineages that in noninundated habitats produce indehiscent fruits remain indehiscent when switching to hydrochory in inundatable habitats. In the inundated forests virtually all diaspores that fall into the water are consumed by fish, with rates of destruction differing greatly. Most hydrochorous diaspores can be dispersed by fish, if they are not destroyed by them (facultative ichthyochory). Others depend on fish for dispersal (obligatory ichthyochory), for example, because their diaspores are very heavy and would sink to the ground under the parent tree, or because their seeds are enclosed in a hard shell from which they can be freed only by the jaws of characins. The dormancy of many kinds of seeds is probably broken by their exposure to the hypoxic conditions that prevail in still water. -from Authors",213,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,22,NA,NA
