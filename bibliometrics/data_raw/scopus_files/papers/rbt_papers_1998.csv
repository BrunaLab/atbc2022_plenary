The depositional environment of Tertiary sedimentary rocks shows a progressive shallowing through geologic time, from deep marine (Miocene-Pliocene) to deltaic-fluvial and coral reef environments (Quaternary). The most dramatic geologic effect of the Limón-1991 earthquake was coseismic uplift of the shoreline, which ranged from 0.3 to 0.6 m in the Gandoca- Manzanillo region. This event caused liquefaction of thick deposits of young, fine-grained fluvial sediments in the region, and produced a tsunami affecting the vicinity of Manzanillo and Punta Uva, but the heaviest damage was reported in northwestern Panamá. The effects of the tsunami may have been diminished in Costa Rica because of the presence of fringing reefs, and the fact that this part of the coast had been coseismically uplifted by the time tsunamis arrived at the coast. Two platform levels were dated using radiocarbon method on coral samples.

It can be separated into a shallow (<25m) interior part fringed by mangroves and mud flats and a deeper part that extends to the shelf edge to about 200m. In order to integrate available information on biomass, catches, food spectrum and dynamics of the main species populations of the system, a trophic model of 21 compartments was constructed by the use of the ECOPATH II software. The larger portion of system biomass is confined to the benthic domain (18.4 gm-2, mangroves excluded, compared to 13.8 gm-2 for the pelagic domain). Mangroves, although only covering 1% of the gulf area, contribute 76% to the system biomass, but only about 1% to the system's primary production. Through their root system, they provide surface area for about 90% of the gulfs biomass of epifauna (12 gm-2), the second largest group of the model. It serves as food source for commercially important species and also fuels the system by the production of large amounts of pelagic larvae and faecal material. Based on these findings, it is emphasized that mangroves, even if they cover only small areas of an estuarine system, have a fundamental role in biomass distribution and flow pattern, and must be considered when constructing a trophic model of the system. Most of the system's energy throughput is achieved from the trophic levels I to II (62%) and II to III (34%) as expected for coastal phytoplankton/detritus based systems. Total catch amounts to 3.38 gm-2, which is considered intermediate for tropical coastal systems. A high gross efficiency of the fishery (catch/ primary production) of 0.3% confirms the known high level of fisheries exploitation in the Golfo de Nicoya. As shown by the model, shrimps occupy a central role within the gulf as converters of detritus and other food into prey biomass for many predators, that seem to be simultaneously affected by the overexploitation of this resource. The network summary statistics computed for the model suggest an overall picture of the Golfo de Nicoya as a system of a low degree of maturity, which seems to be characteristic for tidally driven, tropical estuarine systems. The results are compared and discussed with other published trophic models of coastal systems. Among these, is Golfo Dulce, a further Costarrican gulf system about 200km south of the Golfo de Nicoya.",36,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Biomass budget | Costa Rica | Ecosystem structure | Estuary | Tropical,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,54,NA

There is also significant representation of the family in other vegetation types such as cloud forests and tropical perennifolious forests Generally Mexican Bromeliaceae species have scarce and sparse populations and in many cases they inhabit cliffs, bluffs and scarps in restricted areas.

Fruits and seeds were collected in the State of Chiapas, Mexico (S. L. Camargo et al. 118, UAMIZ). Germination experiments were earned out after four years of seed storage; 1 935 seeds were sown in Petri dishes containing moistened Wathman filter paper. Optimum temperatures were determined in a gradient 5-40°C, with continuous light for mechanically scarified and non scarified seeds. Three photoperiod experiments were made: a) continuous light, b) constant darkness and c) 12 hr light/12 hr darkness. Three germinate pretreatments were applied: a) mechanical scarification, b) sulfuric acid scarification, c) fire scarification and d) control. Three replicates of 15 seeds each were made for each variable and pretreatment Standard deviations (S) were determined, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and media comparison (Scheffé's test) were applied (p<0.05). Analysis of fruit and seed dissemination and seedling establishment was made qualitatively on the basis of field and laboratory observations; radius of dissemination of the fruits from the mother plant was measured; development of laboratory grown seedlings was followed during three months. Seeds germinated at 10-30°C; however, the highest percentages of germination were obtained at 20°C (84.44%) and 25°C (95.55%); seeds are indistinctly photoblastic and percentages of germination, after the three germinate pretreatments, were: control (24.44-35.55%), mechanical scarification (84.44-88.88%), sulfuric acid scarification (73.33-91.11%) and fire scarification (0%). Fruits and seeds are disseminated by the wind in a radius of 5-8 m from the mother plant; rain carries them from slopes to lower plains and human activities contribute to their dissemination. Growth of seedlings is fast; they develop a paripinnate protophyll and ten biparipinnate pronomophylls; the first nomophyll develops during the weeks 12 to 14. It is concluded that optimum temperatures for seed germination of M. tenuiflora are 20°C and 25°C; seeds are indistinctly photoblastic; percentage and rate of germination are highly increased by coat scarification.

The coral reefs found in Bahía Almirante are well developed down to a maximum depth of 23 m, and a diversity of hard corals of 33 species, which represents approximately a 53% of the total diversity known for Panamá. Coral cover observed for the studied region ranged between 20% and 50% depending on the depth, and a total average of 35% is estimated, nearly twice the cover informed for other regions of Panamá (San Blás), where it is presumed that the reefs are better protected from human disturbances. Vertical distribution and composition of species are similar across the area Porites furcata dominates shallow reefs down to 2 m depth, with a cover estimated at 90%, followed by a zone dominated by Agaricia tenuifolia (40%) down to 6 m depth, followed by a zone composed mainly of A. tenuifolia (15%), Madracis mirabilis (7%), and Siderastrea siderea (5%) down to 15 m deep, and finishing in a deeper zone dominated by coralline algae and the coral S. siderea. The existence of a semi-continuous Porites furcata fringing reef of ca. 22 km in length, borders the entire coastal zone of Ensenada Grande de Almirante, is informed for the first time for the region.

The coast of the Chiriquí Lagoon is affected by continuous sediment discharges coming from various rivers, mainly the Cricamola Manantí, Uyama, Guarumo, and Cauchero, whose plumes of freshwater and silt extend for many kilometers, limiting the distribution and development of coral reef communities. The vertical distribution, composition, and dominance of certain coral species in the reefs described here (e.g., Siderastrea siderea, Porites furcata, Agaricia tenuifolia, Madracis decactis, and M. mirabilis) indicate that these communities were formed adapting gradually to unfavorable conditions in water quality (lower salinity, low light penetration) which has limited a more vigorous reef development and perhaps more diverse community. These species, in spite of being quite resistant to environmental changes and building healthy reefs in waters of low clarity, presently live near their limits of ecophysiological tolerance which makes them particularly vulnerable to punctuated changes in the environment.

This paper describes spatial distribution, territoriality and sound production in five species, under natural conditions: Hamadryas amphinome (Lucas, 1853), H. februa (Godart, 1824), H. feronia (Fruhstorfer, 1916), H. glauconome (Bates, 1864) and H. guatemalena (Bates, 1864). Tree characteristics and use by butterflies were recorded under natural conditions in open habitats (grassland thinly covered with trees) in Costa Rica and Panama, avoiding the problems that affected previous natural selection studies in Biston betularia (the ""industrial melanism"" moth). Males perched on the trees and used them as courting territories. The butterflies perched more often on some individual trees, and did not use others. The general tree bark (""background"") color tended to match wing coloration, while presence of food, position of trees along flight routes, tree size, bark texture, and lichen cover were not associated with the frequency of perching on the trees. Most individuals that perched in the study sites were males. Species differed in perching height and populations of H. februa perched at the same heights in both countries; H. feronia moves to higher perches near day's end. The relative use of branches and trunks is not related to the time of day but reflects the typical perching height of each species. The northern side of trees is less used and cardinal side distribution is independent of time of day. Perches exposed to direct sunlight are less used in hot days. All species perch with the head downwards. Perching males frequently fly towards other Hamadryas as well as towards tethered cardboard models. Trees with experimentally removed males were taken by newcomers 32 times more often than trees with resident males. Each marked H. feronia male was seen perching on 1-4 trees daily, without difference between seasons, and each tree used had a minimum daily mean of 1.5 perching butterflies. Most H. feronia interactions occur from 13:00 through 15:00 hours and are more frequent in the rainy season. At night males share perches. Sound emission was studied by using non-destructive experimental methods (N=858) and with a scanning electron microscope. Both sexes emit sound and the sound apparatus, located in the forewing, is percussive, not stridulatory. At the end of the upward wingstroke, the wings are clapped and modified r-m1-2 veins meet at a speed of approximately 1420 mm/s, producing the characteristic clicks. Wingbeat frequency of free-flying individuals is 20-29 Hz. There is some wing deformation during movement. Clicks last a mean of 1.38 ms with mean intervals of 43.74 ms and the component frequencies concentrate around 2.4 kHz, matching Hamadryas hearing capacity and being appropriate for the acoustic conditions of habitat. The swollen Sc vein is present exclusively in Hamadryas; has a serpentine structure inside and probably acts as resonance box. Growth of the sound apparatus may be checked by its effect on flight capacity, physiological costs and ecological reasons. All Hamadryas have a membrane, shaped as an elongated cupola, in the costal cell, that acts as ear. A second and smaller ear has four chambers and may detect predatory bats when the insects are perching at night. Field observations showed that Hamadryas spp. emit audible clicks when approached by potential predators, to defend territories from other Hamadryas and in at least one species also during courtship. Severe wing damage, common in wild Hamadryas, almost never affects the section with the sound mechanism. A review of the literature shows that more than 50 species of lepidopterans (11 families) emit sound audible to humans and suggests that sound mechanisms evolved several times. In general, lepidopteran sound is used basically as a warning to predators and for intraspecific communication.",25,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Behavior | Communication | Courtship | Crypsis | Defense | Industrial melanism | Mating | Mechanism | Protective coloration | Sound | Spatial distribution | Stridulation | Territoriality | Wing structure,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,95,NA

The lifespan of this snail in captivity was about nine months (N= 22) and it could lay viable eggs without mating (N= 40). Oviposition began 42 days after eclosion, when shell diameter averaged 5.12 mm (N= 24). Clutches had about three eggs each (N= 252). One clutch was laid daily over periods of one to four days, with intervals of one to two days (N= 252).

Oviposition took place between crevices of the soil and in the leaf litter. Eggs had a soft egg shell and were laid semi-hydrated; they hydrated by absorbing water from the surroundings (N= 21). This strategy may be the evolutionary compromise between a mechanical limitation (small body size) and the advantage of producing bigger eggs with a larger amount of nutritive substances.

Embryos did not induce the process, but accelerated it. Egg viability was decreased by the tannins of the surrounding leaf litter (N= 50).

Zooplankton densities in the stations located at the central part of the lake were higher when compared with those at a more peripheral position. Time variation in rotifer's relative abundance was directly related to temperature fluctuations. The low density and diversity values, the small size of the zooplankters, the presence of an important number of indicator species, and the calanoid copepods: other planktonic crustaceans low ratio, are all indicators of eutrophy.

Seven loci, ALB, α-, β-, γ-globins, LDHA, LDHB, and TPI were monomorphic; AP1, CP, HP and TF were polymorphic representing a proportion of polymorphic loci (P) of 0.364 and an average heterozygosity (Ĥ) of 0.077. Both values are within a range covered by ten Chibchan tribes of Costa Rica and Panama evaluated for the same loci -(P) = 0.364-0.182; (Ĥ) = 0.104-0.052-. The data allowed an estimation of minimum (ml = 0.0), mean (mm = 7.34) and maximum (ms = 21.9) percentages of racial admixture with blacks. For comparison, admixture was also calculated from the data -mainly blood groups- of a previous survey performed in 1960 by A. Matson and his group on a sample of a region near the border between Nicaragua and Honduras; results (ml = 6.05), (mm = 11.0) and (ms = 18.1). The values showed no statistical difference, for the mean estimates, under the assumption that the non-Indian alleles are Poisson-distributed (P=0.42). The documentation of what is supposed to be the beginning of the racial admixture of the Miskito with blacks in 1641 permitted the calculation of the rate of admixture per generation -generation length: 27 years-; its maximum value lies between 1.68 and 1.91 percent.

In stage IV (first free stage) 361 individually bred spiders were isolated and fed Drosophila melanogaster in the juvenile stage and Musca domestica after wards. ""Stage I"" is the stage following eclosion. For the study of survival, and average life expectancy, a week was taken as age interval, the first free stage was ""age zero"". The web is disordered, lacking a nest and located near the ground. The cocoon is pyriform, (similar to L. antheratus), but and with several layers of thread like L. mirabilis. It measures 14-18 mm, close to L. corallinus. The eggs are similar in size to other argentinian Lactrodectus. Each cocoon had a mean of 183 eggs (66% fertile, No=549). In males, the number of moults to maturity is six in 78% of the cases and seven in 22% (similar to L. corallinus and L. antheratus). In females it is seven in 56% of the cases, eight in 39% and nine in 5%. When compared with other argentinian species females L. variegatus appear to be missing one moult. There are two critical periods of mortality: in stage IV, when specimens begin their webs to capture food and in stage VII when the male life cycle ends. The survival curves for several Latrodectus show a high mortality in the first stages of development. Nevertheless, the survival curves of L. variegatus, L. corallinus and L. diaguita share a sharp descent in the first age intervals followed by a gradual decline. This abrupt decrease is not known for L. mirabilis and L. antheratus. The life expectancy at age zero and maximum longevity in L.

The farms differed in management practices. Farm A had a long history of melon production in rotation with corn, sorghum and rice. Weed control was poor. Farm B was previously used as pastureland, had a shorter history of melon production, and was frequently plowed for weed control. Plant species diversity was monitored in 100 m2 quadrants on each farm over a one year period. In addition to the cultivated areas, four distinct plant communities (improved pasture field, drainage ditches, secondary forest and fallow field) in farm A, and three (spontaneus mixed species pasture field, fallow field and secondary forest) in farm B were included in the study. The number of quadrants sampled was dependent on the total cultivated area on each farm. Five sampling dates were selected during rainy and dry seasons and transition periods between seasons. Plants of each species represented in the quadrants were collected at each sampling date and identified using reference collections. Four plants of each species showing virus-like symptoms in the field were tested for the presence of the four viruses by ELISA. The total number of plant species, and the percent ground cover of each species infected at least with one of the viruses were recorded on each of the five sampling dates. A total of 86 and 72 plant species were identified in sites A and B, respectively. Fourteen plant species, 16% of the total plant species represented in site A, and six species in site B (8%) were found to be infected with at least one of the four melon viruses at different times throughout the year. All four viruses were detected in each location at each of the five sampling dates, indicating that weed species naturally occurring in and around areas of commercial melon production serve as reservoirs for the melon viruses and ensure the survival of the viruses from one production season to the next. Several new host species of three of the melon viruses (PRSV, WMV-2 and ZYMV) were identified. Previously unreported hosts of PRSV included Tridax procumbens. Cleome viscosa, Cleome spinosa, Malvaviscus arboreus and Sida rhombifolia. New hosts of WMV-2 included C. viscosa, Crotum argenteus, Musa pardisiaca and Ponsetia heterophylla.
