Within some growth forms of rainforest plants (lianas, understory shrubs), vegetative propagation may be the primary means of regeneration. In this study, the mode and frequency of vegetative propagation in 30 co-occurring species of the tropical shrub genus Piper at the La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica was assessed through field observations made over several months. Piper species were found to propagate by several means, including stem sprouting, root sprouting, layering, and fragmentation. The mode and frequency of propagation varied significantly among habitats and among species. Shade-tolerant Piper species typical of mid- and late-successional habitats regenerated primarily by vegetative means, especially layering and fragmentation, while shade-intolerant, early-successional species appeared to reproduce and disperse primarily by seed. These differences among Piper species in regeneration mode were due not only to environment, but also to a genetic component, as indicated by experiments investigating the importance of one means of vegetative propagation, fragmentation, to Piper species from different successional habitats. A shadehouse experiment showed that earlysuccessional species were less likely than late-successional species to regenerate from detached fragments, independent oflight regime. This outcome was corroborated by a transplant experiment in forest understory and large gaps comparing fragment vs. seedling survival among five Piper species from different stages of succession over a 7 -mo period. Almost none of the cuttings from early-successional species survived in either habitat. Species of later successional stages survived better as fragments in the understory than in gaps; however, surviving fragments grew larger in gaps.

The paper discusses first how autocorrelation in ecological variables can be described and measured, with emphasis on mapping techniques. Then, proper statistical testing in the presence of autocorrelation is discussed. Finally, ways are presented of explicitly introducing spatial structures into ecological models.

Females discriminated between leaves with and without hosts. In field experiments with mixtures of newly mated and experienced females, the proportion of eggs laid was 4-26%. Available hosts far exceeded wasp fecundity. Hosts, were alive, available, and supported development of parasitoids if parasitized. Increasing numbers of female wasps visiting a patch led to increasing parasitism rate (average of 75% with 20 female wasps). Even though many hosts on a patch were probed and rejected by each wasp, rejected hosts were parasitized by subsequent wasps and yielded live parasitoid offspring. Single wasps dispersed before the ratio of unparasitized to parasitized hosts was much decreased by their efforts. Handing time constraints were small (2.2 min) in relation to total patch time (62 min). Anagrus passed up many suitable and available hosts in each patch and visited multiple patches during its lifetime; number of eggs laid increased linearly with the number of patches visited. This is apparently a foraging strategy built upon compromising the time rate of oviposition in favour of spreading ovipositions among patches and sites. There was high mortality of host-plant leaves, and thus of host-insect patches, in the field due to leaf senescence (20-30%), which would favour spreading of parasitoid offspring among leaves. -from Authors",55,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,7,Cronin J.,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The stunted larvae caught up with individuals in less crowded pools and reached the final instar in sufficient time to emerge in the summer of their 3rd yr, but even so their final body size remained relatively small. A 5-wk field experiment in natural pools demonstrated the causal connection between density and fitness: feeding activity and growth rates were significantly reduced under crowded conditions, but survival showed no response to density. In unmanipulated rock pools, however, natural increases in density from one year to the next were met with slightly overcompensatory decreases in annual survival.

Second-order spatial analysis revealed that ramet patterns of both populations were regular at local spatial scales, a result consistent with the proposition that localized, inter-ramet interactions are important in reducing spatial overlap. Localized ramet interactions suggest Markovian dependence, which is defined when an event (eg occurrence of a ramet) at X is dependent solely on the existence or otheriwse of an event within a distance δ of X. Evidence of Markovian dependence in the populations was tested by fitting Markov point-process models to the observed ramet patterns. The populations conformed well to the Markov model, the results indicating that both ramet spatial patterns were Markov of range δ=18 cm. This inhibition distance corresponds closely to the mean horizontal radius of an A. nudicaulis ramet, indicating that interactions occur at the spatial scale of the individual. A likely mechanism for the development of locally regular spatial patterns in these populations is inter-ramet competition for a limiting resource, probably light. -Author",18,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,9,Kenkel N.,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our approach involved experimental manipulations of aphid densities and field observations of lady beetle foraging at three different scales: (1) individual lady beetles on individual fireweed stems, (2) populations of lady beetles on individual fireweed stems, and (3) populations of lady beetles in populations of fireweed stems. At the finest scale, we found that individual lady beetles remained on single fireweed stems longer in the presence of large aphid colonies. However, this behavioral response to aphid density was weak, explaining only 11 and 4% of the total variance in the length of time C. 7 -punctata and H. variegata remained on the stems. To examine directly the population-level effects of this individual lady beetle behavior, we conducted a second series of experiments that focused on the response of populations of lady beetles; we released large numbers of lady beetles into field plots in which we had manipulated the number and size of aphid colonies. By sampling the distribution of lady beetles, we showed that the number of lady beetles found on fireweed stems depended significantly on the presence and size of aphid colonies. The average number of both C. 7 -punctata and H. variegate found on a stem was l 0-20 times greater when the stem contained a large aphid colony than when the stem contained no aphids. Finally, we examined the consequences of these patterns at the scale of populations of lady beetles and populations of fireweed in 25-m2 field plots. We found that the number and size of aphid colonies within the plots explained 50 and 90% of the variation among plots in the average length of time that C. 7-punctata and H. variegata remained.

Recent studies have attempted to measure the shapes of these gain curves by regressing estimates of male or female fitness against flower number for a set of plants of different size.

This study tests three hypotheses proposed to explain this replationship, using 21 species of dasyurids (body mass range: 5-200 g): 1) the maximum prey size that can be physically handled increases with dasyurid size due to the restricted gapes or forces of biting of smaller dasyurids; 2) the prey size that maximizes rate of energy intake varies with dasyurid size, with animals preferentially consuming the most profitable prey; and 3) prey sizes encountered during foraging vary with dasyurid size. The first hypothesis was rejected. The second and third hypotheses were supported. Individuals of the smaller species maximized rates of energy gain in captivity by feeding preferentially on small prey, and their foraging trails in the field traversed microhabitats where mean potential prey size encountered was small (2-4 mm long). Larger dasyurids preferred large prey, obtained a greater rate of energy gain from them, and foraged in microhabitats where prey lengths averaged ≥6 mm. That larger dasyurids tended to include progressively larger prey in their diets than were available, on average, along their foraging trails, may reflect increasing selectivity for larger prey, but it may also reflect a reduced susceptibility to predation or increased competitive ability for large dasyurids in productive microhabitats, and hence reflect a size-based advantage in encountering large prey. -from Authors",67,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,13,Fisher D.,2,NA,NA,NA,all,All Open Access

However, food quality is complex to assess because it must integrate not only the availability of nutrients but also their digestibility and the requirements of the animal. To evaluate the quality of food and to determine the feeding constraints faced by young herbivores, we compared two brood-rearing habitats used by the Greater Snow Goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica) in the High Arctic using three levels of investigation. The first was based on a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the plants; the second was behavioral, and compared the feeding effort of human-imprinted goslings; and the third was physiological and compared food selection and plant nutrient metabolizability by the goslings. The two habitats grazed by goslings were a sedge meadow (dominated by Carex aquatilis and Dupontia fisheri) and a grass meadow (dominated by Dupontia fisheri and Eriophorum spp.). Plant biomass was higher in the sedge than in the grass meadow. Plant quality declined during the summer but Eriophorum spp. had a significantly higher nitrogen and lower fiber content than the other two species at all times. However, when combining data on quality and relative abundance, the overall plant quality was similar in both meadows. Goslings spent more time feeding and had a higher pecking rate in the grass than in the sedge meadow. Comparison of diet quality to overall plant quality indicated a higher nitrogen and lower fiber content of the diet in the grass meadow but not in the sedge meadow, probably because goslings fed selectively on Eriophorum in the former habitat. Apparent metabolizability of organic matter and nitrogen, and nitrogen assimilation efficiency by goslings, were lower in the sedge than in the grass meadow at some periods. However, goslings did not compensate by an increased rate of food intake when their nitrogen intake was low which suggests that they had reached their gastrointestinal capacity. Under some circumstances, food quality is therefore more important than food abundance for herbivores.

There were no significant differences between the concentrated and intermediate damage treatments and no differences between the dispersed damage treatment and the undamaged control.

One member of the fauna, a killifish, Rivulus hartii, was widely distributed in the drainage, occurring alone in each headwater but also encountering other fish species below barrier waterfalls. Rivulus was used to test four predictions derived from the species inteaction hypothesis: 1) Rivulus density would be depressed at sites with other fish species present, compared to the density expected from physical characteristics of each site as if Rivulus were alone; 2) Rivulus density would decline at points of contact with the piscivorous fish Hoplias malabaricus; 3) local populations of Rivulus found in pools occupied by the predator would show a smaller maximal size than in pools without the predator; and 4) the growth rate of Rivulus would be lowered in the event of a local invasion by the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, another abundant and sometime co-occurring species. Data supported prediction 1: overall, actual Rivulus densities at points of contact with other species were about 1/3 of the density expected if the other species were absent. The distribution of Rivulus was essentially complementary to that of the piscivorous fish, although only one site provided an unambiguous test of Prediction 2, since Hoplias did not ascend the tributaries in this watershed. The size distribution of Rivulus in populations occurring in pools with predators was dominated by small individuals, with none larger than the median size of Rivulus in predator-free populations, supporting Prediction 3.

We used repeated observations of individual spiders’ habitat preferences, movements to new web sites, growth, fecundity, and survival under natural and manipulated habitat conditions to examine relationships between movement, habitat, and components of fitness. Our main objectives were to determine the spatial and temporal patterns of movement, and the causes, costs, and fitness consequences of shifting habitat. Repeated censuses of individually marked females showed that web relocation in L. revivensis is associated with spider growth. Spiders tended to move to larger shrubs after one or two molts, and the size of web components and web-site features scaled to body size. Moves occurred mainly in Spring (March-May), and most moves (74%) were by juveniles. The main cost of web relocation was increased mortality: there was a 40% chance of death during a move. A comparison of occupied shrubs with those available in the habitat indicated strong site selection involving seasonally varying and age-dependent preferences for particular shrub species, and a general preference for taller shrubs. Prey availability at shrubs (as measured by pitfall traps, and by prey remains in nests) varied spatially and was affected by shrub species and size. However these effects were small compared to habitat-wide temporal variation in prey availability, suggesting that web-site relocations would not result in substantially higher prey capture. Nonetheless, movement to larger shrubs resulted in improved spider body condition and, ultimately, greater reproductive success. The advantages of web-site relocation in this species may relate to architectural features of shrubs that provide support for the web, and minimize exposure to thermal extremes and to predators. However, experimental manipulation of exposure by trimming shrubs did not decrease spider fitness.

Despite equal relative consumption rates (RCR) and nitrogen consumption rates (RNCR) across all treatments, larvae experiencing variation in the diet suffered reduced pupal mass and extended development time. Evidently growth performance cannot be predicted based solely on mean diet nitrogen concentration, which was equal among all treatments (3.0% N). Further, growth on a mixture of foods cannot be predicted based on known responses to the individual foods. Reduced growth associated with the chronic variation likely was caused, in part, by nonlinearity in the relationship between nitrogen and food utilization efficiency, and by disruption of the compensatory feeding response.

They were then randomly reassigned to either high or low food with the constraint that there be equal numbers of individuals in each of four treatments: high-high, high-low, low-high, and low-low.

This result indicates that the number of offspring produced in a litter will be a function of both the immediate and the past environment. Lower food during either interval resulted in an increase in the number of days between the second and third litters, indicating that, if resource availability is low, the female may delay the initiation of the next litter, allowing her to acquire more resources. Resource availability during both intervals also influenced how resources were allocated to individual offspring. Females responded to low food during the first interbrood interval by producing heavier offspring in litter 3. This increase in mass was almost entirely attributable to an increase in fat reserves.

Of several potential mechanisms tested, expanded host phenology in the hybrid zone, relative to pure zones, best explained the distribution of C. confluens which is dependent upon newly flushed leaves for optimal growth and reproduction. The hybrid zone is a superior beetle habitat because: (1) early leaf flush in the hybrid zone provides the first source of food for beetles in spring and (2) staggered leaf phenologies in the hybrid zone allow beetles to shift onto newly flushed Fremont trees as foliage of sympatric hybrid and narrowleaftrees declines in quality.

For C. confluens, the hybrid zone is a “phenological sink” that increases beetle fecundity and leads to chronically high herbivory year after year. Because movement from the hybrid zone reduces fecundity, emigration into adjacent pure zones is likely hindered. This hypothesis requires staggered phenologies between overlapping host species; it probably does not require hybridization between host species. Further, this hypothesis may in part explain frequent outbreaks of insects in nurseries and plantations. Thus, two distinct mechanisms have been identified that result in increased insect abundance in plant hybrid zones: “phonological sinks” resulting from staggered plant phenologies and “hybrid sinks” resulting from increased susceptibility of hybrids to insect attack. Such studies suggest that hybrid zones are important natural laboratories for the study of plant-herbivore interactions.",96,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,20308,BSR-8906391,0,FALSE,36,Floate K.D.,3,Chronic herbivory | Chrysomelidae | Cottonwood | Host shifting | Hybrid sink | Hybridization | Phenological sink | Poplar,NSF,National Science Foundation,NA,NA

From 24-38% of the colonies contained cached seeds and 25-32% have seeds on refuse piles. Experiments with captive colonies of Pheidole nebulosa and P. nigricula demonstrated that c6% of harvested Miconia nervosa and M. centrodesma seeds are deposited on refuse piles. Because seeds generally retain viability longer than the nest twig remains intact, harvested seeds are not trapped inside twigs. Experimental plantings of 4-d-old Miconia nervosa seedlings on two types of substrate (ant refuse pile vs. topsoil) under two light levels demonstrated that seedlings grew faster and survived better on refuse piles under light levels typical of small clearings.

That is, those species that exploit food with low energy content and/or high cost of digestion tend to have low, mass-independent metabolic rates. To date there is not an experimental test of this pattern. The aim of this work was to examine experimentally the effect of diet quality on BMR, digestive efficiency, and the relationship between digestion and energy expenditure in a small herbivorous mammal. We used as a model the herbivorous caviomorph burrowing rodent Octodon degus (mb nearly 200 g), an inhabitant of semi-arid and mediterranean communities of northern and central Chile. Individuals maintained during 27 wk with a diet high in dietary fiber showed significantly lower BMRs (28%) than those feeding on low fiber. Daily food intake and ingestion rates (energy and dry matter) of individuals under a high-fiber diet were significantly higher than animals maintained with a low-fiber diet. The same pattern was obtained for total feces production and rate of feces production. The total intake and rate of ingestion of proteins were not significantly different between treatments. However, a significantly higher amount of protein was excreted by the individuals exposed to a high-fiber diet. Apparent digestibility of dry matter, energy, and protein were consistently lower in individuals maintained with high fiber. However, nonsignificant differences were observed between gut contents in the two treatments (P > .58), but a significantly higher digesta turnover rate was observed in animals exposed to a high-fiber diet (P < .05). A significant correlation was found between digestibility and the basal metabolic rate of individuals (rs = 0. 781, P < .0 I), suggesting that elevated digestibilities on high-quality diets allow increased basal rates of metabolism. We suggest that, although small mammals like degus may select sparsely distributed plants of high quality in their habitat, their capability to drop their metabolic demands may help them meet their nutritional and energy requirements when nutritional conditions in the environment deteriorate.",106,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,20308,B/2030-1,0,FALSE,38,Veloso C.,2,Basal metabolic rate | Chile | Diet quality | Digestive physiological ecology | Herbivory | Octodon degus | Small mammals,IFS,International Foundation for Science,NA,NA

We used known-aged females from I through 5 yr of age. Yearling females initiated nests 11-19 d later than older females; heavier females, independent of age, nested earlier than lighter females. One-way analyses of covariance using female body mass and nesting date as covariates indicated that clutch size, mean egg mass, number of ducklings per nest, and the percentage of eggs hatching (hatching success) were independent of female age. Probability of nests producing at least one duckling (nest success) also was not related to female age. We separately tested effects of breeding experience and female age class (yearling vs. adult) on reproductive performance. In the context of this study, females were considered as experienced if they previously were captured using nest boxes and inexperienced if there was no record of nest box use. Adult females with previous breeding experience initiated nests an average of 26 d earlier than adults without previous experience; body mass of experienced adults was greater than that of inexperienced adults. Adult females designated as “inexperienced” may have nested previously in natural cavities and were simply changing to nest boxes. Nest-site fidelity is known to affect nesting date, so we also compared nesting dates of inexperienced adults with a subset of experienced females that changed nest sites. Inexperienced adults nested 12 d later than experienced adults that switched nest sites and were nesting on different wetlands from the previous year. Next, we controlled nesting experience and tested specifically for age effects by comparing inexperienced adults with yearlings. Nesting date of inexperienced adults and yearling females did not differ, but body mass of these adults was greater than that of yearlings. There was no evidence that differential survival of heavy, early-nesting yearling females explained age-related patterns in nesting date and female body mass. In fact, late-nesting yearlings survived better than yearling females that initiated nests early. Furthermore, Jolly-Seber estimates of annual survival did not decline with female age, suggesting that older females were able to compensate for any increase in reproductive effort associated with early initiation of nests. Binary regression analyses showed that later nesting females were less likely to initiate second nests and more likely to have nests destroyed by predators. Female Wood Ducks nesting early produced larger clutches, hatched more young from successful nests, were at less risk from predators, and improved their chances of initiating second nests.

This study investigates the effects of habitat size by examining the response of the distribution of several fitness correlates. I used populations of tadpoles of Bufo americanus and Rana clamitans in artificial ponds as a model system. The natural histories of these species suggested that they might respond differently to variation in habitat size, which was defined in terms of pond surface area and depth. These dimensions were factors in two completely crossed factorial experiments, one for each species. Ponds were of three areas: 529 cm 2 , 2116 cm 2 , and 8464 cm 2 and three depths: 10 cm, 20 cm, and 40 cm. Tadpole populations were established at a single density (number per unit volume). The use of artificial ponds controlled variation in nutrient content, shape, and vegetation structure that may be confounded with pond size in nature. Increases in pond area resulted in Bufo populations that had lower survival, growth rates, and mass at metamorphosis. Populations in ponds of large area showed greater withinpopulation variation in larval period, although the mean of this parameter was only weakly affected. Size distributions of individuals showed positive skewness in small-area ponds. Increasing depth led to lower survival but greater mass at metamorphosis. In experiments with Rana, increased area and depth both led to lower survival but greater growth by survivors. There were statistically significant interactions between area and depth in their effects on early Bufo growth and on Rana survival. The fitness of Bufo showed a significant positive relationship with increasing surface-area-to-volume ratio while Rana showed a mixed response. The results suggest that competition among Bufo tadpoles intensifies with habitat size under conditions of constant initial density by volume because of a decreasing ratio of edge to interior habitat. The form of competition appears to shift towards stronger interference competition in smaller habitats. Individuals may compensate for early, negative effects of habitat size. The variability of the several fitness correlates, while different among populations, showed no consistent pattern with population size. Theory based on assumptions of equal levels of variation in fitness in large and small populations may not be widely applicable to populations in nature.

For both populations, tissue N was inversely correlated with polyphenolic concentrations. Only Fucus from the low-N site showed a significant reduction in polyphenolic concentrations under experimental enrichment. A significant inverse relationship between phenolic concentrations and growth rates for Fucus at the high-N, but not the low-N site, suggests a growth cost associated with phlorotannin production for this phenolic-poor population due, perhaps, to C-limited growth. Phlorotannin concentrations increased significantly in clipped Fucus at the low-N site in two of three simulated grazing experiments, indicating an inducible response. No significant inducible response was found for the high-N, phenolic-poor population. Choice experiments revealed a clear preference for this population by Littorina littorea.

This plant response to defoliation is characterized by a decline in the nutritional quality of leaves for immature insects for several years after defoliation events, and concomitant changes in leaf chemistry that may be detrimental to insect nutrition, that is, a decline in leaf nitrogen and an increase in leaf phenols. Two explanations of delayed inducible resistance have been proposed. (l) The active defense response hypothesis claims that delayed inducible resistance is an active response to defoliation per se rather than merely a passive consequence of recovery from the stress of severe defoliation. (2) In contrast, the carbon-nutrient balance (CNB) hypothesis claims that delayed inducible resistance is caused by nutritional stress resulting from severe defoliation. We used two experiments to test these hypotheses. (l) In a threeway factorial field experiment we reared spear-marked black moth (Rheumaptera hastata) larvae on Alaska paper birch (B. resinifera) saplings that had experienced combinations of 100% manual defoliation and fertilization with N and P in previous years, and measured larval survival and pupal mass. In association with these measurements of larval performance, we assayed leaf condensed tannin levels and the concentrations of N and P in leaves, and correlated the results of these assays with larval performance. (2) In a laboratory experiment we tested the biological activity of condensed tannin and linalool, the major secondary metabolites of Alaska paper birch leaves, by treating leaves collected from previously undefoliated Alaska paper birch saplings with combinations of condensed tannin and linalool, and measuring the performance of spear-marked black moth larvae reared on these leaves. Our results supported predictions of the carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis. We found that fertilization with nitrogen, the nutrient limiting growth of Alaska paper birch in our study site, mitigated delayed inducible resistance, and that condensed tannin is likely to be the major chemical cause of delayed inducible resistance in Alaska paper birch. In our field experiment we also found that fertilization of Alaska paper birch with phosphorus, a nutrient that does not limit the growth of Alaska paper birch in our study site, affected levels of condensed tannin in leaves and the sapling’s defoliation history influenced this effect.

Half of the groups of snails were single-sexed while the other half contained two snails of each sex. I observed snail movements by conducting daily censuses of the reefs and constructed transition matrices describing the movements of snails in each treatment among the three species of coral.

We used a reciprocal transplant experiment to uncover the relative importance of population-specific (genetic) and environmental sources of variation in individual growth rates between two populations of the fence lizard, Sceloporus undulatus. Our study revealed a population x environment interaction, consistent with a genotype x environment interaction that would result if differences between populations were genetically based. The growth rates of Nebraska lizards, normally twice that of New Jersey lizards, were reduced by half when the animals were transplanted to New Jersey. However, New Jersey lizards showed no increase in growth rates when transplanted to Nebraska. Comparisons of relative food availability (arthropod abundance) indicated that more food was available in New Jersey during the experiment. Estimates of potential activity day length using hollow copper models were from 2 to 2.5 h longer in Nebraska. This result suggests that the thermal biophysical environment may have reduced growth rates of Nebraska lizards transplanted to New Jersey, perhaps by reducing foraging time or by limiting physiological processes supporting growth.

The predicted pattern was found in an earlier study of avian communities in central North America, where snowfall is frequent. The authors tested predictions of the hypothesis that 1) when ground- and tree-feeding guilds are compared between geographic regions of harsh and mild winter climate, only ground-feeders will have relatively high fat reserves, resulting in a significant guild × climate interaction term in a two-way analysis of variance, and 2) ground- and tree-foraging guilds will show both low fat reserves in a mild winter environment. Visible subcutaneous fat class was measured in both guilds in Wisconsin and Michigan (harsh winter environments) and SW British Columbia, NW Washington, and Tennessee (mild winter environments). Both predictions were supported. The energy storage strategy appears to be a major life-history trait in the nonbreeding period. Trade-offs that reduce reserves can lead to lower survival in severe winter weather than would occur at masximum fat levels. Individual birds are sensitive to, and can control, both predation and starvation risks. Recent theory of population limitation indicates that as food abundance declines, birds feed to avoid starvation, but at the expense of increased mortality from predation.

In any given year, c98% of all flowering individuals fail to set fruit under natural conditions. Despite the dramatic increase in fruit set after hand-pollination, only plants in the high pollination intensity treatment showed a statistically significant reduction in future growth and flowering. A small seedling production per fruit would be enough to overcome the cost of fruiting; plants in the population should thus experience strong selection for increased pollination. This does not seem to explain nonautogamous orchids. Results suggest an alternative explanation: pollinator limitation could be evolutionarily stable if the correlation between fruit or seed production and seedling recruitment is sufficiently low. If an increase in fruit or seed production does not translate into an increase in fitness, then selection for increased pollination would not occur or would be too weak. -from Author",145,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,72,Calvo R.,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Red oak and white oak showed a greater degree of mast-fruiting than did black oak. Within a species, individuals tended to produce large acorn crops in the same years, but each species differed in which years they produced large crops. The size of a given acorn crop was determined by both flower abundance and survival of flowers to fruit. The first principal component explained the largest amount of the variation in black oak (R2 = 0.55) and red oak (R2 = 0.89). In white oak, two principal components combined to explain 77% of the variation in acorn production. Weather variables associated with these principal components included spring temperature (positive effect) and summer drought (negative effect). Past acorn production had a major impact on the size of the current acorn crop, with each species showing a different pattern. In black oak, the current acorn crop was negatively correlated with the crop 3 yr prior but positively correlated with the crop 2 yr prior. In red oak, acorn crop size 1, 2, and 3 yr prior had negative correlations with current acorn crop, while acorn crop size 4 yr prior was positively correlated. In white oak, there were negative correlations between acorn crop size and crop size 1, 2, and 4 yr prior but a positive correlation with the acorn crop size 3 yr prior. Data are consistent with the hypothesis that mast-fruiting species must store resources during some years in order to produce a mast crop. The patterns of acorn production for black, red, and white oak are apparently not simply responses to weather events but are also a function of prior reproductive events. This suggests that masting is an evolved reproductive strategy. -from Authors",362,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,73,Sork V.L.,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Planktivory increased between 1977 and 1978 due to an increase in biomass of that year class and decreased in August 1987 after a summer kill of cisco in the lake. Yellow perch Perca flavescens and other cisco year classes contributed <25% of the total planktivory during 1978-1987. This 10-yr pulse in planktivory rates was associated with changes in the Daphnia species and biomass. In years with low planktivory rates, higher biomass of daphnids dominated by Daphnia pulicaria developed earlier in the spring and lasted longer into the summer. This was also associated with an earlier and longer spring clear-water phase. In years with high planktivory rates, daphnid biomass was generally lower and dominated by the smaller Daphnia galeata mendotae. However, there was no significant effect of planktivory on the early summer peak in Daphnia biomass that is associated with a clear-water phase. The dynamics of this Daphnia peak are apparently regulated by Daphnia-algae interactions and not by planktivory rates. The seasonal and interyear changes in Daphnia species composition can be explained by the combined effects of planktivory, dynamics of food resources, and the physiological ecology of the two Daphnia species. There was no significant effect of increased planktivory on total zooplankton biomass due to a compensatory increase in cyclopoid copepods and no response by calanoid copepods. -from Authors",100,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,80,Rudstam L.,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There were neither sexually mixed trees nor sex switching of trees between years. Flowering sex ratios for the species of smallest stature, A. microstachya and B. parviflora, consistently exhibited a significant degree of male bias, which was greater in years with lower overall levels of flowering in the population. Two-year cumulative sex ratios were significantly male-biased in these two species and in a second relatively small-statured species of Aporusa. The size distributions for male trees broadly overlapped those of female trees in all species. In the smaller statured species, male trees displayed a significantly greater degree of relative size variation than did female trees, suggesting that male trees begin flowering at a smaller size, but also grow to a larger size. Also, males were significantly more likely to flower in both years than were females in the smaller species. Sexual dimorphism in the frequency and size dependence of flowering has previously been explained as a result of higher energy costs of reproduction in females than in males. This physiological constraint is most likley to play a strong role in energy-limited environments. Male-biased sex ratios and associated patterns of sexual dimorphism may thus generally be most pronounced among diminutive treelets of the rain forest understory. -from Authors",110,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,88,Thomas S.,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Oak residuals from isopoll maps are relatively small in magnitude; pine and birch residuals are relatively large and show greater local variability in sign and magnitude. This indicates local variability in tree abundance, as pollen of all three taxa is readily dispersed by wind. Spatial correlograms summarize the strength of spatial autocorrelation as a function of distance between pairs of sites for a given taxon. Oak correlograms corroborate the mapped data in indicating the dominance of region-wide trends. The birch and pine correlograms indicate that factors operating at scales at 150 to 300 km are as important as region-wide trends in governing pollen abundances. The structure of the correlograms for birch and pine pollen changes through time, with birch showing a more patchy spatial pattern in the mid-Holocene (4500 and 6500 yr BP) compared to the late-Holocene (500 and 2500 yr BP). Pine shows a more strongly autocorrelated pattern in the mid-Holocene. Results suggest that substrate, an environmental constraint on vegetation at scales of tens to hundreds of kilometres, has been important in governing the spatial distribution of birch and pine in the upper Great Lakes region. The changing distribution of birch and pine is attributed, in part, to changes in the relative abundance of ecologically dissimilar species within these genera. -from Authors",38,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,89,Graumlich L.,2,NA,NA,NA,all,All Open Access

Such phenotypic plasticity could have promoted the progenitor's initial adoption of the ant-tended woolly alder aphid as prey and its wool as a source of camouflaging material. 2) Quantitative differences between the generalist's and specialist's behaviour indicate that adaptation to the woolly alder aphid did not require the acquisition of novel behavioural traits in the larvae.

Athough larval movement is frequent and abundance within the zone varies seasonally, ant lions are rarely found >2 m from the cliff base. Rainfall limits ant lion distribution through an interaction with temperature. Within the ant lion zone, the soil remains dry and ant lion larvae bury themselves more rapidly in the sun than in the shade. Outside the ant lion zone, rainfall leads to the formation of a persistent soil crust. Larvae are unable to penetrate this crust, and they succumb to high temperatures in the sun.

Across the ant lion zone, the relative abundance of the two species also differed significantly, although the differences were not consistent among sites. Because of overriding abiotic constraints, neither species can achieve an ideal free distribution with respect to food resources.

The authors investigated the relative effects of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in the water column vs. the sediments, and herbivory by the common isopod Idotea resecata, on eelgrass growth and epiphyte biomass in an intertidal eelgrass bed in Padilla Bay, Washington. Eelgrass growth is affected both by sediment nitrogen resources and the higher order effects of epiphytes and their control by I. resecata. Growth of eelgrass leaves tended to increase in response to sediment fertilization; this trend was significant in April 1988 but not in August 1987. At both times, leaf growth rates demonstrated a saturation-type respoonse to sediment ammonium concentrations >100 μmol/L, providing further support for N-limitation of eelgrass growth over much of the range in ambient concentrations (30-137 μmol/L) in the sediment porewaters. Together, sediment ammonium concentrations and epiphyte biomass explained 71% of the variance in eelgrass leaf growth in August 1987. Consideration of sediment nitrogen, epiphytes, or herbivores alone is unlikely to yield a predictable understanding of the control of eelgrass primary productivity in nature. Results can be reconciled by considering herbivory by I. resecata. in the laboratory, the isopod reduced epiphyte biomass by 1/3 and in its absence, epiphyte biomass increased with increasing N concentrations in the water column and negatively affected eelgrass growth. -from Authors",193,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,127,Williams S.,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Pools of nutrients resorbed and nutrients left in litter in rich-site leaves were larger than pools in poor-site leaves, but N resorption efficiency (percent of total leaf N resorbed) was higher in less fertile sites (65 vs. 46%). Differences in efficiency may be due to the ratio of soluble/nonsoluble proteins, which is higher at low-N sites. Trends for P resorption efficiency were not significant (47 vs. 46% in poor and rich sites, respectively).

In the field interference competition, as assayed by decreasing hole depths, was significantly greater in areas of high beetle density than in areas with low beetle density. Fights for holes occurred only in areas of high beetle density.

A single clone of D. magna isolated from a N German shallow lake with planktivorous fish can express the full range of SFR observed in the field (1.8-3.0 mm) when raised under controlled temperature and food conditions. Control of SFR is predominantly based on size differences in the eggs of the first and the following broods of Daphnia. First-brood eggs are smaller. They hatch into smaller neonates that mature at a smaller size. In the lake, fish may selectively remove large females; this will increase the share of first-brood females in the population. Offspring of these females will mature at a much smaller size, so that the size response to predation is intensified. When predation ceases, some females can grow to larger sizes, contributing many large offspring to the population because they have larger clutch sizes and larger eggs. This leads to a rapid shift toward large SFR. A single clone of D. magna was hatched from isolated eggs to measure the components of maternal size dependency. Strong positive relationships were found between female size and egg size, egg size and neonate size, neonate size and SFR, size of a female and its offspring's SFR, and female size and clutch size.

Coastal grasssland, backdune, and coastal scrub differed in several factors that influenced invasion: soil disturbance, herbivory, and identity of competitors. Disturbance of the soil was required for establishment of Carpobrotus at the grassland site. Soil disturbance did not promote Carpobrotus establishment in the coastal scrub or backdune. Establishment in these sites was restricted by herbivory. The influence of neighboring vegetation on Carpobrotus establishment was site dependent. At the grassland site, Carpobrotus seedling survival was reduced by grasses, and the only surving seedlings were on gopher mounds. Growth of larger Carpobrotus, however, was unaffected by grasses. Proximity to shrubs, the dominant plant type at the backdune and coastal scrub sites, did not affect Carpobrotus seedling survival, but decreased root and shoot biomass of seedlings and cuttings. Invasion is expected to occur most rapidly at the grassland site. Although germination and early survival there depend on the occurrence of rodent disturbances, these occur frequently, and seedling recruitment in the grassland was observed. Once established, clonal growth is great and is not affected by herbivory or competition. At the dune site, even caged plants showed very poor growth, and invasion is expected to be slow due to harsh physical conditions that limit both survival and growth. -from Author",255,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,143,D'Antonio C.,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Photosynthesis (A, measured as CO2 uptake) and g varied substantially in both B. inermis and S. nutans as PPFD fluctuated between sun and shade levels (4-10 min intervals); g approached steady-state levels more rapidly in S. nutans than in B. inermis. However, because of the greater magnitude of change in g between sun and shade PPFD in B. inermis, the absolute rate of change in g in this C3 grass was twice as rapid compared to S. nutans (25.7 vs. 12.4 mmol.m-2.s-1.min-1 for reductions in g, respectively). New steady-state levels in g were achieved in 12-13 min after a change in PPFD in S. nutans and 15-19 min in B. inermis A statistically based two-state (sun-shade) simulation model was used to quantify costs in A and E of the nonsteady-state responses measured for both species as PPFD varied. Even though the absolute rate of change in g was greater in the C3 grass, costs on E during periods of short-term (2-6 min) variations in PPFD were as much as sixfold higher than in the C4 species. Lower cost in E in C4 species during periods of variable PPFD (due to inherently smaller alterations in g), is a previously unrecognized consequence of the C4 photosynthetic pathway.

Leaves of rapidly growing, pioneer species (Robinia, Liriodendron) were slightly less tough and contained lower levels of hydrolyzable tannins and total phenolics, but higher condensed tannin concentrations than the slower growing, more shade-tolerant species (Acer, Cornus). Results generally suport earlier findings indicating the evolutionary development of greater levels of constitutive phenolics in slow-growing than fast-growing species. The differential use of condensed and hydrolyzable tannins by slow- and fast-growing species may reflect adaptive trade-offs in the allocation of different types of phenolics. Regnerating trees often had tougher leaves and contained higher levels of phenolics in large than small openings by midsummer. The differences in phenolics were more pronounced for condensed tannins and when comparing the smallest canopy openings with larger patch sizes. Plant phenolics were also generally lower in understory trees than in conspecific patch sizes. Plant phenolics were also generally lower in phenotypic carbon-nutrient adjustment as light availability changes across the patch-size gradient. The greater sunlight in large than small openings apparently promotes excess carbon production and a metabolic buildup of phenolic compounds. Herbivore damage was consistently high (5-9%) on Robinia sprouts in all openings. Insect herbivory on the remainng three species (1-5%) was significantly lower in large than small patch sizes.

Net primary production in exclosures and browsed plots was strongly correlated with N mineralization.

Spittlebug feeding reduced plant growth rates three times more than beetle feeding; aphid feeding had no detectable effect. The plants grew faster at higher soil fertility, but there was no interaction between insect impact and fertilizer level. Stem heights at the end of the season were increased by fertilizer and not affected by herbivory. Spittlebug feeding, and to a lesser extent aphid feeding, decreased the number of lateral stems; again there was no interaction with soil fertility.

Total seed production was reduced by herbivory. The spittlebug caused the strongest decrease, beetle feeding was second, and aphid feeding caused slight reductions. There was a strong interaction between insect impact and soil fertility. Total seed production was reduced only at the high level of soil fertility for all three insects. Spittlebug and beetle damage also delayed flowering, but only at the higher level of soil fertility.

This slow gain was not explained by energy costs associated with territory establishment or learning to secure food, since it occurred even in years when nectar resources were superabundant and territoriality was nearly nonexistent. Mass gain up to 3.5g was due to deposition of nonlipid body components, hypothesized to be proteins involved in rebuilding muscle catabolized during the last stage of the recent migratory flight. Following the initial phase of slow mass gain, an accelerating rise in body mass consisted entirely of lipid gain. On average, overnight mass loss decreased prior to migration, suggesting that nocturnal torpor facilitated lipid deposition. The slow phase of mass gain is a potentially important constraint on migrating hummingbirds, because if they deplete their fat stores and allow their body mass to fall below 3.5g, they incur a substantial cost in terms of greatly increased time spent on the subsequent stopover. -Authors",73,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,166,Carpenter F.,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Robins faced a hierarchical decision-making process of fruit selection: 1) in which shrub to feed (decisions among shrubs); 2) which fruits to pick (visual decisions among fruits); and 2) which fruits to swallow once picked (within-bill decisions). Choices made by robins among shrubs were correlated with three plant traits (decision cues): fruit abundance, fruit size, and fruit pulpiness. These cues were themselves used hierarchically, so that when higher ranking cues were held constant by manipulating shrubs, the next available cue became important. Robins then made visual choices among fruits correlated with fruit size. No evidence was found to suggest that robins made within-bill decisions; once fruits were picked, additional discrimination did not occur. -from Author",158,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,180,Sallabanks R.,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The authors presented unvisited flowers to freely foraging bees and counted the number of pollen grains left in flowers after 1-4 visits. Pollinators included two generalist bumble bees (Bombus impatiens and B. vagans: Apidae) and Melissodes apicata (Anthophoridae), a specialist with morphological and behavioural adaptations for collecting pollen from P. cordata. Anther position and bee species significantly influenced pollen removal, although the differences between bee species were not related to pollinator specialization. Long-level anthers dehisced early, lost an average of 39% of their pollen during their first visit, and did not consistently contact small pollinators, such as M. apicata. Short-level anthers restricted pollen removal more (28% lost) than long-level anthers, but dehisced more slowly and were subject to unpredictable pollen removal. Mid-level anthers combine the advantages of more exserted and inserted positions without suffering the corresponding disadvantages as they restricted removal (24% lost), dehisced relatively early, and seemed to consistently contact all pollinators. The overall benefits of positioning anthers within the perianth mouth, the position occupied by mid-level anthers in P. cordata, may explain the prevalence of this morphology among bee-pollinated plants with flaring, tubular, monomorphic flowers. -from Authors",95,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,181,Harder L.,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This latitudinal gradient for anions was correlated with the distribution and community structure of diatoms: 62 taxa comprised >85% of the total diatom relative abundance in the saline environments. There were strong negative correlations between specific conductance and diversity and species richness, but pH and major cations showed limited predictive value. Cluster analyses identified diatom assemblages along specific conductance and major anion gradients. Diatom indices provide useful information to interpret past and present physicochemical conditions in lacustrine ecosystems. Greatest diversity was found in habitats with ionic concentrations < seawater and ion composition similar to marine environments.

Success of hybrids was intermediate. This rank order of species efficiences was reversed in the open water habitat. Results support the hypothesis that different traits are favored in different habitats, and that adaptation to one habitat has occurred at the expense of feeding rate in the other. Foraging efficiency in open water was greatest in the smaller size classes of fish, hinting that small size of the open water species is the result of selection for high foraging efficiency, but size could not explain most differences in feeding efficiency between species, and it is likely that many traits contribute. -from Author",318,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,183,Schluter D.,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that foliar δ 15 N values are related to the availability of inorganic nitrogen in mineral soil. Soils collected in or near valley bottoms on the watershed had higher levels of net nitrogen mineralization and net nitrification potential than those sampled from ridges and slopes. More positive foliar δ 15 N values occurred in valley bottoms, which, relative to other positions on the watershed, were characterized by greater availability of soil nitrogen and lower C-to-N ratios in the 0 i -horizon, in the surface mineral soil, and in autumn leaf fall. Although leaf nitrogen concentrations changed significantly over the course of the growing season, there was little seasonal variation in foliar δ 15 N values. A hypothesis about the relative importance of different sources of nitrogen to the forest and how nitrogen cycling varies with topography in this nitrogen-deficient ecosystem was derived, in part, from spatial patterns in natural 15 N abundance. There appear to be two processes affecting the topographic patterns in foliar 15 N abundance on this watershed: (1) greater uptake from isotopically heavy pools of inorganic soil nitrogen by plants in valley bottoms, and (2) uptake of isotopically light ammonium-N in atmospheric deposition by plants on ridges and slopes (where the availability of inorganic soil nitrogen to plant roots is more limited). Results from this study indicate that foliar o15N values are positively correlated with net nitrification potential in surface soil.",231,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,214,Garten C.,1,15  N | Field studies | Isotopic indicators | N cycling | Nitrification | Nitrogen | Nitrogen availability | Nitrogen mineralization | Site nitrogen status | Stable isotopes | Topography | Watershed,NA,NA,NA,NA
