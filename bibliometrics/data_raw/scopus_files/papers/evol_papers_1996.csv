Although genealogy is an important component of macroevolution, recent visions of phylogenetic analysis as replacing rather than supplementing other approaches are short-sighted. The ability of traditional Linnaean taxa to document evolutionary patterns is mainly an empirical rather than a theoretical issue, yet the use of these taxa has been dismissed without thorough evaluation of their empirical properties. Phylogenetic analysis can help compensate for some of the fossil record's imperfections. However, the shortcomings of the phylogenetic approach have not been adequately acknowledged, and we still lack a rigorous comparison between the phylogenetic approach and probabilistic approaches based on sampling theory. Important inferences about the history of life based on nongenealogical data have later been corroborated with genealogical and other analyses, suggesting that we risk an enormous loss of knowledge and understanding if we categorically dismiss nonphylogenetic data.",25,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Biological diversity | Biotal evolution | Macroevolution | Paleobiology | Phylogenetic analysis | Systematics,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although the models are quite general, they are motivated by a specific example, the t complex of the house mouse. Some variants at this gene complex, the t haplotypes, distort Mendelian segregation in heterozygous males in their favor. The selective advantage at the gamete level is counterbalanced by strong negative fitness effects at the individual level (male sterility or even lethality in both sexes). A plethora of different t haplotypes has been found, both in the field and in the lab. Up to now, however, models have focused on the equilibrium frequency of a single t haplotype In contrast, we explicitly model the competition between several t haplotypes. A deterministic model for a large, well-mixed population predicts a surprisingly high degree of polymorphism. Haplotypes with seemingly inferior fitness characteristics may easily coexist with ""superior"" haplotypes. For instance, a lethal haplotype with a low segregation ratio may stably coexist with a sterile haplotype with a high segregation ratio. Stable coexistence is even possible for haplotypes with a segregation disadvantage. A simple stochastic model shows that the same principles apply in the context of a structured metapopulation. Although counterintuitive at first sight, all our results can be explained by the fact that segregation distorters have an inherent advantage when they are rare.

Even mechanisms of simple forms of learning, such as habituation and sensitization, have not been studied phylogenetically. Here we begin an evolutionary analysis of learning-related neuromodulation in species related to the well-studied opisthobranch gastropod, Aplysia californica. In Aplysia, increased spike duration and excitability in mechanosensory neurons contribute to several forms of learning-related changes to defensive withdrawal reflexes. The modulatory transmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT), is thought to play a critical role in producing these firing property changes. In the present study, we tested mechanosensory homologs of the tail withdrawal reflex in species related to Aplysia for 5-HT-mediated increases in spike duration and excitability. Criteria used to identify homologous tail-sensory neurons included position, relative size, resting electrical properties, expression of a sensory neuron-specific protein, neuroanatomy, and receptive field. The four ingroup species studied (Aplysia californica, Dolabella auricularia, Bursatella leachii, and Dolabrifera dolabrifera) belong to two clades (two species each) within the family Aplysiidae. In the first clade (Aplysia/Dolabella), we found that the tail-sensory neurons of A. californica and tail-sensory homologs of a closely related species, D. auricularia, responded to bath-applied serotonin in essentially similar fashion: significant increases in spike duration as well as excitability. In the other clade (Dolabrifera/Bursatella), more distantly related to Aplysia, one species (B. leachii) showed spike broadening and increased excitability. However, the other species (D. dolabrifera) showed neither spike broadening nor increased excitability. The firing properties of tail-sensory homologs of D. dolabrifera were insensitive to 5-HT over a wide range of concentrations. We also performed experiments on two outgroup species (Akera bullata and Bulla gouldiana) and found that spike duration was unaffected by 5-HT, whereas excitability was increased. This study suggests that 5-HT-induced spike broadening arose more recently in opisthobranch evolution, whereas 5-HT-induced excitability increase is a more ancestral trait that may have been expressed in the earliest opisthobranchs. Both traits are absent in the aplysiid species D. dolabrifera, demonstrating that a lineage can lose learning-related mechanisms.

The evidence consists of an association between this variation arid queen genotype at Pgm-3, a phosphoglucomutase-encoding gene. In the present study, we surveyed Pgm-3 allele and genotype frequencies in diverse populations from the native and introduced ranges of this ant to learn whether this simple genetic basis for reproductive traits is a general feature of the species or a genetic anomaly in introduced ants stemming from a recent bottleneck or the invasion of novel habitats. No egg-laying queens living in polygyne (multiple-queen) nests possessed the homozygous genotype Pgm-3(a/a) in any of the study populations, yet nonreproductive females from such nests (workers as well as queens that had not yet initiated oogenesis) possessed this genotype at moderate frequencies. Remarkably, Pgm-3(a/a) was the most common genotype among all classes of females, including egg-laying queens, in monogyne (single-queen) nests from all populations studied. Genotype populations at Pgm-3 in polygyne populations typically departed strongly from the proportions expected under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, whereas those in monogyne populations did not. These patterns establish that a single mendelian gene influences queen reproductive role in S. invicta and that this gene uniformly is under strong directional selection in the polygyne social form only. Moreover, the perfect association of Pgm-3 genotype and reproductive role in all populations, combined with the known function of phosphoglucomutase in insect metabolism, suggest that this gene may directly influence queen phenotypes rather than merely serving as a marker for a linked gene that causes the effects.",21,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Enzyme polymorphism | fire ants | phosphoglucomutase | physiological genetics | selection | social insects | Solenopsis invicta,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,13,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03626.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Here we present evidence for the presence of distinct male (M) and female (F) mitotypes in three other bivalve species, the mytilid Geukensia demissa, and the unionid species P. fragilis and Fusconaia flava. Nucleotide sequences of a segment of the COI gene from the M and F mitotypes from each of the three mytilid species (M. edulis, M. trossulus, G. demissa) and three unionid species (P. grandis, P. fragilis, F. flava) were used for phylogenetic analysis. The analysis suggests three independent origins of M and F mitotypes for the six species examined; one for the three unionid species, one for the two Mytilus species, and one for Geukensia. The first of these F/M divergence events, while of uncertain age, predates the divergence of the two unionid genera and likely older than either of the two F/M divergence events in the mytilid taxa. The most parsimonious explanation of multiple F/M divergence events is that they represent independent origins of DUI. Another possibility is that, in a given taxon, an F or M mitotype assumes the role of the opposite mitotype (by virtue of a mechanism that remains to be clarified) and subsequently was fixed within its new gender. The fixation of a mtDNA lineage derived from a mitotype of switched function would reset the divergence of the gender-associated lineages to zero, thereby mimicking a de novo split of F and M lineages from a preexisting mtDNA genome that was not gentler specific. Further broad-scale taxonomic studies of the occurrence distinct M and F mitotypes may allow for the evaluation of the latter hypothesis.",135,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Cytochrome c oxidase I | doubly uniparental inheritance | Fusconaia | Geukensia | Mytilus | Pyganodon phylogenetics,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,14,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03616.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

However, imbalance also results from some (but not all) models of 'nonheritable' speciation rate variation. The degree of imbalance increases with the magnitude of speciation rate variation, and then for gradual evolution (but not punctuated equilibria) reaches an asymptote short of the theoretical maximum.

I examined the genetic basis of the allometric relationship between horn length and body size by selecting males that produced unusually long horns, and males that produced unusually short horns, for their respective body sizes. After seven generations of selection, lines selected for relatively long horns had significantly longer horn lengths for a given body size than lines selected for relatively short horns, indicating a heritable component to variation in the allometry. The sigmoidal shape of the allometry was not affected by this selection regime. Rather, selected lines differed in the position of the allometry along the body size axis. One consequence of lateral shifts in this allometric relationship was that the body size separating horned from hornless males (the point of inflection of the sigmoid curve) differed between selection lines: lines in which males were selected for relatively long horns began horn production at smaller body sizes than lines selected for relatively short horns.

Extending this classification, we distinguish two forms of mate choice, direct and indirect. This distinction clarifies the relationship between Darwin's two mechanisms and, furthermore, indicates that the potential scope for sexual selection is much wider than thus far realized. Direct mate choice, the focus of most research on sexual selection in recent decades, requires discrimination between attributes of individuals of the opposite sex. Indirect mate choice includes all other behavior or morphology that restricts an individual's set of potential mates. Possibilities for indirect mate choice include advertisement of fertility or copulation, evasive behavior, aggregation or synchronization with other individuals of the same sex, and preferences for mating in particular locations. In each of these cases, indirect mate choice sets the conditions for competition among individuals of the opposite sex and increases the chances of mating with a successful competitor. Like direct mate choice, indirect mate choice produces assortative mating. As a consequence, the genetic correlation between alleles affecting indirect choice and those affecting success in competition for mates can produce self-accelerating evolution of these complementary features of the sexes. The broad possibilities for indirect mate choice indicate that sexual selection has more pervasive influences on the coevolution of male and female characteristics than previously realized.",248,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Darwin | male-male competition | mate choice | mating systems | sexual selection,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,22,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03911.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

DNA sequence data from three regions of the mitochondrial genome were used to infer relationships among four mycophagous species and three that breed on decaying water plants. Phylogenetic analysis of these species show that breeding in mushrooms and tolerance of high levels of α-amanitin were the ancestral states within the group. Thus, breeding in decaying water plants and intolerance of α-amamtin are derived conditions. We also found that the D. quinaria species group does not comprise separate mycophagous and nonmycophagous clades, but rather that (1) the shift from mushrooms to decaying plants occurred on at least two occasions; or (2) mycophagy reevolved within a lineage that had previously shifted to breeding on plants. The correlation between mycophagy and α-amanitm tolerance is perfect across the species we have examined, indicating that there is no detectable time lag between an ecological shift to a new breeding site and correlated changes in biochemical adaptation. The genetic distance between the mycophagous D. recens and the nonmycophagous D. quinaria indicates that these species split only about 1 M.Y.B.P. In terms of α-amanitin tolerance, D. recens and D. quinaria are typical of other ecologically similar species within the group.

A type of GEI that is commonly observed is changes in the fitness ranking of genetic groups (families, clones, or inbred lines) in different environments. We refer to such changes in ranking as crossing of reaction norms for fitness. A common interpretation of crossing of reaction norms for fitness is that selection favors different alleles in the different environments (i.e., that 'trade-offs' exist). If this is the case, selection could maintain genetic variation, and even lead to reproductive isolation between subpopulations using different environments. Even if the same alleles are favored in every environment, however, deleterious mutations that vary in the magnitude of their effect depending on environment could cause reaction norms for fitness to cross. If deleterious mutations with environment-dependent effects are responsible for maintaining much of the variation leading to crossing of reaction norms for fitness in natural populations, it should be possible to observe crossing of reaction norms for fitness among otherwise genetically identical lines bearing newly arisen spontaneous mutations. We examined the contribution of new mutations to GEI for fitness in Drosophila melanogaster. Eighteen lines were derived from a common, highly inbred base stock, and maintained at a population size of 10 pairs for over 200 generations, to allow them to accumulate spontaneous mutation. Because of the small population size of the lines, selection against mildly deleterious mutations should have been relatively ineffective. The lines were tested for productivity (number of surviving adult progeny from a standard number of parents) in five different environmental treatments, comprising different food media, temperatures, and levels of competition. The lines showed highly significant GEI for productivity, owing largely to considerable changes in ranking in the different environments. We conclude that mutations that are deleterious on average, but whose quantitative effects depend on environment, could be responsible for maintaining much of the variation leading to crossing of reaction norms for fitness that has been observed in samples of D. melanogaster from the wild.",89,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Antagonistic pleiotropy | environmental heterogeneity | mutation-selection balance | phenotypic plasticity,22104,9317754,1,TRUE,24,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03619.x,all,All Open Access,BIO,Directorate for Biological Sciences

Allorecognition systems mediate the nature and outcome of these intraspecific competitive interactions, such that the initiation of agonistic behavior and the potential for intergenotypic fusion depend strongly on the relatedness of the contestants. The dependence of these behaviors on relatedness, along with the extraordinary precision with which self can be discriminated from nonself, suggest that allorecognition systems are highly polymorphic genetically. However, allotypic specificity of this sort could be produced by any number of genetic scenarios, ranging from relatively few loci with abundant allelic variation to numerous loci with relatively few alleles per locus. At this point, virtually nothing is known of the formal genetics of allorecognition in marine invertebrates; consequently, the evolutionary dynamics of such systems remain poorly understood. In this paper, we characterize the formal genetics of allorecognition in the marine hydrozoan Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus. Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus colonizes gastropod shells occupied by hermit crabs. When two or more individuals grow into contact, one of three outcomes ensues; fusion (compatibility), transitory fusion (a temporary state of compatibility), and rejection (incompatibility, often accompanied by the production of agonistic structures termed hyperplastic stolons). Observed patterns of compatibility between unrelated, half-sib pairs, and full-sib pairs show that unrelated anti half-sib pairs under laboratory culture have a very low probability of being fusible, whereas full sibs have a roughly 30% rate of fusion in experimental pairings. The genetic simulations indicate that roughly five loci, with 5-7 alleles per locus, confer specificity in this species. In ecological terms, the reproductive ecology of H. symbiolongicarpus should promote the cosettlement of kin, some of which should be full sibs, and some half sibs. Thus, there is potential for kin selection to play a major role in the evolution of the H. symbiolongicarpus allorecognition system. In genetic terms, this system conforms to theoretical predictions for a recognition system selected to distinguish among classes of kin, in addition to self from nonself.",58,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Allorecognition | Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus | transmission genetics,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,25,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03612.x,NA,NA,NA,NA

To examine the causes of heterogeneity in inbreeding depression, the effects of inbreeding on reproduction, survival, and growth were measured in three replicate experimental stocks for each of three subspecies of Peromyscus polionotus mice. Inbreeding of the dam reduced the probability of breeding, the probability of producing a second litter, and litter size. Inbreeding of the litter caused depression of litter size, juvenile viability, and mass at weaning, and caused an increase in the within-litter variance in mass. In spite of differences between the subspecies in natural population sizes, genetic variation, and mean rates of reproduction and survival, all variation observed between experimental populations in their responses to inbreeding could be attributed to random founder effects. The genetic load of deleterious alleles in each replicate was unequally partitioned among its founder pairs, and different founders contributed to the load affecting different fitness components. Thus, inbreeding depression for any one fitness component, in our experimental environment, must be due to relatively few deleterious alleles with major effects. Genetic loads so comprised would be expected to diverge among natural populations due to both random drift and selective removal of recessive deleterious alleles during population bottlenecks.

Five of these species are sympatric in Malawi and exhibit seasonal polyphenism in the savannah rainforest ecotone. The sixth species originated from Cameroonian equatorial rainforest. The organisms were laboratory reared under four different temperature conditions ranging from 17-28°C. The variation in response to temperature is described by principal component analysis (PCA). Discrimination on the basis of plastic wing pattern characters was performed by discriminant function analysis (DFA) and unweighed pair-group method algorithm (UPGMA) clustering. A phylogenetic reconstruction based on adaptive plastic wing characters was compared with a cladogram built on 'nonadaptive' characters. Results demonstrate that: (1) Phenotypic plasticity of wing pattern characters in response to temperature in laboratory-reared organisms is reminiscent of variation induced by seasonal change in the field. (2) Different wing pattern characters are under different control: 'exposed' characters of butterflies at rest position are highly sensitive to temperature variation, whereas 'hidden' characters, only visible during active behavior, are dominated by species differences. In general the sensitivity of the former can be attributed to their proposed function in deflecting predators. (3) The sexes differ especially in the size of those eyespots that are displayed during active behavior. (4) Species from seasonal and aseasonal environments react in a broadly similar manner to temperature variation. However savannah species and species of aseasonal rainforest exhibit relatively shallow reaction norms, whereas reaction norms tire steeper in species from the savannah-rainforest ecotone. Such a strong response was also apparent in so-called correlation networks between principal components for these species. (5) Phylogenetic distances are to some extent reflected in ordination in both PCA space and DFA-space: closely related species of the safitza group remain close in both ordinations. The more distantly related species differ in ordination from a pattern as suggested by a phylogenetic reconstruction.

We do this by first testing for correlations between song characteristics and aspects of male phenotype that are hypothesized to indicate male quality. We show that song is a reliable indicator of male size and male age, and that large male size is associated with increased female fecundity. We then use playbacks of synthetic songs that mimic natural variation in song parameters to study song preferences and we compare preferences under different presentation regimes to determine whether choices are based on relative song quality or some fixed criterion.

The patterns of host association among specialized insects have often been described as highly conservative, yet not all specialized herbivorous insect lineages display the same degree of fidelity to their host plants. In this paper, we present an estimate of the evolutionary history of the leaf beetle genus Oreina. This genus displays an amazing flexibility in several aspects of its ecology and life history: (1) host plant switches in Oreina occurred between plant families or distantly related tribes within families and thereby to more distantly related plants than in several model systems that have contributed to the idea of parallel cladogenesis; (2) all species of the genus are chemically defended, but within the genus a transition between autogenous production of defensive toxins and sequestration of secondary plant compounds has occurred; and (3) reproductive strategies in the genus range from oviparity to viviparity including all intermediates that could allow the gradual evolution of viviparity. Cladistic analysis of 18 allozyme loci found two most parsimonious trees that differ only in the branching of one species. According to this phylogeny estimate. Oreina species were originally associated with Asteraceae, with an inclusion of Apiaceae in the diet of one oligophagous species and an independent switch to Apiaceae in a derived clade. The original mode of defense appears to be the autogenous production of cardenolides as previously postulated; the additional sequestration of pyrrolizidine alkaloids could have either originated at the base of the genus or have arisen three times independently in all species that switched to plants containing these compounds. Viviparity apparently evolved twice in the genus, once without matrotrophy, through a retention of the eggs inside the female's oviducts, and once in combination with matrotrophy. We hypothesize that the combination of autogenous defense and a life history that involves mobile externally feeding larvae allowed these beetles to switch host plants more readily than has been reported for highly conservative systems.",83,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Allozyme electrophoresis | chemical defense | Chrysomelidae | host plants | Oreina | phylogeny | viviparity,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,31,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03625.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

This technique identified patterns of variation that were uncorrelated both within and among instars and which remained fairly constant throughout the growth period; in contrast, the overall amount of variation increased from young to older instars. Negative correlations between size and subsequent growth increments indicated convergent growth in the first three instars, but there was a transition to positive correlations (divergent growth) in later instars. Analysis of covariation among measurements made in different instars showed strong ontogenetic autocorrelation and revealed patterns remarkably similar to those found in mammals and birds: yet corresponding analyses of growth increments showed mainly independent variation in different instars.

In contrast to size increments, instar durations of water striders were highly correlated throughout the larval period, indicating that individuals tended to develop at either relatively fast or relatively slow rates in all instars. The correlations between growth increments arid instar durations were nil or negative, contrary to expectations from life-history theory. The results of these analyses of individual variation match the findings from other water striders and from interspecific comparisons in the germs Limnoporus, but information about physiological mechanisms of molting and growth in insects cannot completely explain the patterns observed.",48,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Age | allometry | common principal components | constraint | developmental time | Gerridae | growth | heterochrony | life history | morphometrics | ontogeny | size,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,36,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03628.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Many parasites, however, reduce host fitness by an equally deleterious but different means, by causing partial or complete sterility of their hosts. A model of optimal parasite virulence is developed in which a quantity of host resources can be allocated to either host or parasite reproduction. Increases in parasite reproduction thus cause reductions in host fertility. The model shows that under a wide variety of ecological conditions, such parasites should completely sterilize their hosts. Only when opportunities for horizontal transmission are very limited should the parasites appropriate less than all of a host's reproductive resources. Field and laboratory evidence shows that the nematode parasite Howardula aoronymphium is relatively avirulent to one of its principal host species. Drosophila falleni, whereas it is much more virulent to D. putrida and D. neotestacea, suggesting that there may be substantial vertical transmission in D. falleni. However, epidemiological studies in the field and laboratory assays of host specificity strongly suggest that the three host species share a single parasite pool in natural populations, indicating that parasites in all three host species experience high levels of horizontal transmission. Thus, the low virulence of H. aoronymphium to D. falleni is not consistent with the model of optimal parasite virulence. It is proposed that this suboptimal virulence in D. falleni is a consequence of populations of H. aoronymphium being selected to exploit simultaneously several different host species. As a result, virulence may not be optimal in any one host. One must, therefore, consider the full range of host species in assessing a parasite's virulence.",59,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Drosophila | host-parasite interactions | Howardula aoronymphium | nematodes | transmission mode | virulence,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,37,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03613.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

A single, structurally simple, and unvarying song is sung throughout life by each male of the two common species, Geospiza fortis (medium ground finch) and G. scandens (cactus finch). Songs of the two species differ strongly in quantitative features, and individual variation among males is much broader in G. fortis than in G. scandens. Although there are exceptions, songs of sons strongly resemble the songs of their fathers. They also resemble the songs of their paternal grandfathers, but not their maternal grandfathers, indicating that they are culturally inherited and not genetically inherited. Female G. fortis display a tendency to avoid mating with males that sing the same type of song as their father. They also avoid mating with males that sing heterospecific song, with very rare exceptions. Thus song, an evolving, culturally inherited trait, is an important factor in species recognition and mate choice. It constrains the mating of females to conspecifics, even when there is no genetic penalty to interbreeding, and thus may play a crucial role in species formation by promoting genetic isolation on secondary contact. The barrier is leaky in that occasional errors in song transmission result in misimprinting, which leads to a low incidence of hybridization and introgression. Introgression slows the rate of postzygotic isolation, but can produce individuals in novel genetic and morphological space that can provide the starting point of a new evolutionary trajectory.",286,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Hybridization | imprinting | inbreeding avoidance | mate choice | speciation | species recognition,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,38,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03633.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We examined the ecological and genetic consequences of exclusive pollination by sexually attracted male thynnine wasps in the orchid Caladenia tentaculata. Male wasps respond rapidly to flowers artificially presented in 1 x 1 m2 experimental patches. Sixty of 287 wasps approached within centimeters of the flower, but did not land. Of the remaining 79% who made floral contact, only 7.5% attempted copulation, the step critical for pollination Wasps only rarely moved among patches (19% of flights) and none attempted copulation a second time, resembling observations in natural populations. We confirmed outcrossing and long distance pollen flow by monitoring how colored pollen moved in natural populations. Pollen movements approximated a linear rather than a leptokurtic distribution (mean distance: 17 m; maximum: 58 m). Pollinator visits varied independently of flower density in three of four populations with most solitary flowers being visited. Allozyme analysis revealed within-population fixation indices (F) close to zero and low levels of differentiation (FST) among populations. Despite behavioral evidence for long distance pollen flow, significant local genetic structure exists, perhaps reflecting restricted seed dispersal. Long distance pollen flow in C. tentaculata may therefore promote outbreeding by minimizing pollen transfers among related neighbors. Although this species is self-compatible, outcrossed progeny develop significantly faster than selfed progeny. Effective pollination at low flower densities could accentuate this advantage. The data are consistent with the predictions that deceptive pollination will result in long distance pollen flow, which may be of selective advantage at low density.

In this paper, we make the distinction between selection on total flower number and on the size of inflorescence units, both of which have been termed 'inflorescence size.' We present an ESS model for the evolution of inflorescence design that considers reproductive success through male and female function. The model predicts that selection will balance the proportional changes in female and male reproductive success resulting from changes in inflorescence-unit size. We conducted a field study of selection on the size of inflorescence units (umbels) by manipulating umbel size and number in a natural population of Asclepias tuberosa, in southeastern Arizona, during two reproductive seasons. We found that the male fitness function reached a maximum at an intermediate umbel size in both years (although not significantly different from the smallest umbel size in either year), whereas the female illness function was highest for the smallest umbel size in one year, but was constant across umbel sizes in the other year. We also found that pollinator visitation rate corresponded well with male, but not female, function, and that between year variation in the male reproductive success of different umbel sizes corresponded with variation in the composition of the pollinator pool.

The expression of a male display trait is proportional to genetic quality, which is determined by the number of deleterious mutations a male carries throughout his genome. Genetic variances and covariances, including the covariance between the preference and male trait that drives the good genes process, are allowed to evolve under an infinitesimal model. Results suggest that the good genes process generates only weak indirect selection on preferences, with an effective selection intensity of a few percent or less. If preferences are subject to direct natural selection of the intensity observed for other characters, the good genes process alone is not expected to exaggerate the male trait by more than a few phenotypic standard deviations, contrary to what is observed in highly sexually selected species. Good genes can, however, cause substantial exaggeration if preference genes are nearly selectively neutral. Alternatively, direct selection on preference genes, acting on mating behavior itself or on the genes' pleiotropic effects, can cause mating preferences and male display traits to be exaggerated by any degree.

Here we compare the genetic structures of different populations of a freshwater New Zealand snail (Potamopyrgus antipodarum) with its trematode parasite (Microphallus sp.) using allozyme frequency data. Allozyme variation among snail populations was found to be highly structured among lakes; but for the parasite there was little allozyme structure among lake populations, suggesting much higher levels of parasite gene flow. The overall pattern of variation was confirmed with principal component analysis, which also showed that the organization of genetic differentiation for the snail (but not the parasite) was strongly related to the geographic arrangement of lakes. Some snail populations from different sides of the Alps near mountain passes were more similar to each other than to other snail populations on the same side of the Alps. Furthermore, genetic distances among parasite populations were correlated with the genetic distances among host populations, and genetic distances among both host and parasite populations were correlated with 'stepping-stone' distances among lakes. Hence, the host snail and its trematode parasite seem to be dispersing to adjacent lakes in a stepping-stone fashion, although parasite dispersal among lakes is clearly greater.

We present a hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships for all of the currently recognized species of northern hemisphere Nucella, based on an analysis of 718 base pairs of nucleotide sequence from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. The order of appearance of species in the fossil record is congruent with this hypothesis. The topology of the inferred phylogeny of Nucella, coupled with ecological, morphological, and fossil evidence, was used to address three main questions: (1) At what time and by which route was the North Atlantic invaded from the North Pacific compared to prior studies of the trans-Arctic interchange? (2) Do patterns of molecular variation within species corroborate the importance of climatic cycles in driving speciation in north temperate marine animals? (3) Was radiation in the direction of increased or decreased ecological specialization, body size, or vulnerability to predation? Molecular evidence confirmed that the sole North Atlantic species, N. lapillus, arose from a North Pacific ancestor. Biogeographic and paleontological evidence supported the dispersal of Nucella, and perhaps other interchange species, via the Eurasian Arctic. Rather intriguingly, the linkage of N. lapillus to a western as opposed to eastern Pacific clade, alia the biogeographic origins of the eastern Pacific species, parallel closely similar patterns observed in another genus of rocky shore gastropods, Littorina. This congruence, in conjunction with information on the climatic and geographic histories of the region, as well as the geographic arrangement of mtDNA haplotypes within Nucella species, supports a model of speciation in Nucella driven by cycles of climatic amelioration and deterioration that began during the Miocene. Calibrations from the fossil record of Nucella suggest that third position transitions and transversions accrue at a rate of 3-4% and 0.5% respectively per million yr. This supports an early participation by Nucella in the trans-Arctic interchange, as suggested by paleobiogeographic studies. Consistent with the unstable taxonomic history of species of Nucella, we found few nonmolecular traits to be phylogenetically informative. Among North Pacific species, more recently derived species (N. canaliculata and the N. emarginata clade) were more ecologically specialized (narrower diet and habitat range). Consistent with extensive intraspecific variation, shell traits were quite labile evolutionarily: neither overall size nor development of antipredatory traits exhibited consistent evolutionary trends over the history of the genus. Nurse eggs (unfertilized eggs consumed by developing embryos) were an ancestral trait that was lost evolutionarily in the two clades that also exhibited increased body size, suggesting that these two life-history traits may be coupled.

Average levels of genetic variability in Schiedea and Alsinidendron were comparable to or higher than those found in other Hawaiian lineages for which equivalent data are available [Bidens, Tetramolopium, and the silversword alliance (Asteraceae: Madiinae)] and similar to average values for species of dicots. Allozyme variability was strongly dependent on breeding system, which varies widely in the Hawaiian Alsinoideae. Species with autogamous breeding systems showed very low variability, measured as the number of alleles per locus, percent polymorphic loci, and mean heterozygosity per locus. Outcrossing hermaphroditic and dimorphic species (those with gynodioecious, subdioecious, and dioecious breeding systems) showed significantly higher genetic variability. Small population size was associated with lower values for all measures of genetic variability. Nearly half of the species occurring in small populations are also autogamous; thus, both factors may have influenced levels of genetic variability in these species. Founder effect was apparent in one species (Schiedea adamantis), which occurs in a single large population, has a gynodioecious breeding system but a very low genetic variability. Island age appeared to have little effect on genetic variability. Slightly lower values of genetic variability for species occurring on Kaua'i and O'ahu result primarily from the occurrence of autogamous Alsinidendron species on those islands.

Nei's unbiased genetic identity (I) was greatest among species with outcrossing breeding systems, which for the most part clustered together. Nei's genetic identities for self-fertilizing species were low, indicating that these species are less similar to one another and to outcrossing species, regardless of their affinities based on cladistic analysis.

From the northern end of the species range, we compare a predominantly selfing population (t̂ = 0.26) with a more outcrossed population (t̂ = 0.84), which is genetically similar. From the southern end of the range, we compare a highly selfing population (t̂ = 0.03) with a more outcrossed population (t̂ = 0.58). We measured developmental stability in the populations using two measures of within-plant variation in leaf length as well as calculations of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) for several leaf traits. Growth-chamber experiments show that selfing populations are significantly more variable in leaf length than more outcrossed populations. Developmental instability can contribute to this difference in population-level variance. Plants from more homozygous populations tend to have greater within:plant variance over developmentally comparable nodes than plants from more heterozygous populations, but the difference is not significant. At the upper nodes of the plant, mature leaf length declines steadily with plant age, allowing for a regression of leaf length on node. On average, the plants from more homozygous populations showed higher variance about the regression (MSE) and lower R2 values, suggesting that the decline in leaf length with plant age is less stable in plants from selfing populations than in plants from outcrossing populations. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) was calculated for four traits within single leaves at up to five nodes per plant. At the early nodes of the plant where leaf arrangement is opposite, FA was as calculated for the same traits between opposite leaves at a node. Fluctuating asymmetry is significantly greater in the southern selfing population than in the neighboring outcrossed population. Northern populations do not differ in FA. Fluctuating asymmetry can vary significantly between nodes. The FA values of different leaf traits were not correlated. We show that developmental stability can be measured in plants using FA and within-plant variance.

Herein, we introduce the term ""locomotor module"" to identify anatomical subregions of the musculoskeletal system that are highly integrated and act as functional units during locomotion. The first tetrapods, which employed lateral undulations of the entire body and appendages, had one large locomotor module. Basal dinosaurs and theropods were bipedal and possessed a smaller locomotor module consisting of the hind limb and tail. Bird flight evolved as the superimposition of a second (aerial) locomotor capability onto the ancestral (terrestrial) theropod body plan. Although the origin of the wing module was the primary innovation, alterations in the terrestrial system were also significant. We propose that the primitive theropod locomotor module was functionally and anatomically subdivided into separate pelvic and caudal locomotor modules. This decoupling freed the tail to attain a new and intimate affiliation with the forelimb during flight, a configuration unique to birds. Thus, the evolution of flight can be viewed as the origin and novel association of locomotor modules.

Genetic correlations are most easily measured under homogenous, controlled laboratory conditions, whereas natural populations typically experience a higher degree of environmental variability. The effect of environmental variability on genetic correlations in the cricket, Gryllus pennsylvanicus, was studied by measuring genetic correlations within and between two environments differing in levels of environmental heterogeneity. Within-environment rg among morphological traits measured in the homogeneous laboratory environment were found to be reliable predictors of rg measured in the experimental field environment. Laboratory measures of rg involving life-history traits, though, were not found to reflect the same correlations measured in the heterogeneous environment. A significant negative genetic correlation between fecundity and developmental time was found in the field environment, yet was not detectable when measured in the laboratory. Phenotypic correlations may be obtained much more easily than genetic correlations, but their usefulness in evolutionary inference depends on the pattern of similarity betweent the two correlations. A comparison of genetic and phenotypic correlations revealed a close match between the two measures for morphological traits, but revealed only broad similarities when considering life-history traits. Male-female genetic correlations between morphological traits were high (all rg > 0.73) and were consistently higher in the field environment than in the laboratory. The genetic correlations between the sexes in developmental time followed the same trend, but the male-female genetic correlation of gonad weights was low in both environments.

Examples of apomorphic decoupling have been suggested for several groups of organisms, however there have been few empirical tests of explicit statements concerning functional and morphological consequences of decoupling. Using the loricarioid catfishes, we tested one particular consequence of decoupling, the prediction that clades possessing decoupled systems having increased biomechanical complexity will exhibit greater morphological variability of associated structures than outgroups having no such decoupled systems. Morphometric procedures based on interlandmark distances were used to quantify morphological variance at three levels of design at successive nodes in the loricarioid cladogram. Additional landmark-based procedures were used to localize major patterns of shape change between clades. We report significantly greater within-group morphometric variance at all three morphological levels in those lineages associated with decoupling events, confirming our predictions under the decoupling hypothesis.

A negative genetic correlation would qualify as an evolutionary 'constraint.' because both aspects of locomotor performance are generally expected to be under positive directional selection in wild populations. We also tested whether speed or endurance showed any genetic correlation with body mass. For all traits, residuals from multiple regression equations were computed to remove effects of possible confounding variables such as age at testing, measurement block, observer, and sex. Estimates of quantitative genetic parameters were then obtained using Shaw's (1987) restricted maximum-likelihood programs, modified to account for our breeding design, which incorporated cross-fostering. Both speed and endurance were measured on two consecutive trial days, and both were repeatable. We initially analyzed performances on each trial day and the maximal value. For endurance, the three estimates of narrow-sense heritabilities ranged from 0.17 to 0.33 (full ADCE model) and some were statistically significantly different from zero using likelihood ratio tests. The heritability estimate for sprint speed measured on trial day 1 was 0. 17, but negative for all other measures. Moreover, the additive genetic covariance between speeds measured on the two days was near zero, indicating that the two measures are to some extent different traits. The additive genetic covariance between speed on trial day 1 and any of the four measures of endurance was negative, large, and always statistically significant. None of the measurement of speed or endurance was significantly genetically correlated with body mass.

The ecological concept of r- and K-selection is formulated in terms of selection gradients on underlying phenotypic characters that influence the density-dependent measure of fitness. Hence the selection gradients on traits are decomposed into two components, one that changes in the direction to increase r, and one that changes in the direction to increase K. The relative importance of the two components is determined by temporal fluctuations in population density. The evolutionary rate of r and K (per-generation changes in r and K due to the genetic responses of the underlying traits) is also formulated. Numerical simulation has shown that with moderate genetic variances of the underlying characters, r and K can evolve rapidly and the evolutionary rate is influenced by synergistic interaction between characters that contribute to r and K.

When applied with a phylogeny of 42 species, the method exhibited reasonable Type I and II error rates. Estimation abilities were comparable to those of independent contrasts and minimum evolution (parsimony) methods, and generally superior to a traditional nonphylogenetic approach (not taking phylogenies into account at all). However, the autoregressive method performed extremely poorly with a smaller phylogeny (15 species) and with nearly independent ('star') phylogenies. In both of these situations, any phylogenetic autocorrelation present in the data was not detected by the method. Results show how diagnostic techniques (e.g., Moran's I) can be useful in detecting and avoiding such situations, but that such techniques should not be used as definitive evidence that phylogenetic correlation is not present in a set of comparative data. The correction factor (α) proposed by Gittleman and Kot (1990) for use in weighting phylogenetic information had little effect in most analyses of 15 or 42 species with incorrect phylogenetic information, and may require much larger sample sizes before significant improvement is shown.

This study examines the assumption of constancy for the wing pattern characteristics of two sibling species of butterflies, Precis coenia and P. evarete (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae).

Second, a modification of Bartlett's modified likelihood-ratio test was used to test for equality between the G-matrices. The matrix test failed to detect any between species differences.

To answer this question. I focus on g(max), the multivariate direction of greatest additive genetic variance within populations. Original data on threespine sticklebacks, together with published genetic measurements from other vertebrates, show that morphological differentiation between species has been biased in the direction of g(max) for at least four million years, despite evidence that natural selection is the cause of differentiation. This bias toward the direction of evolution tends to decay with time. Rate of morphological divergence between species is inversely proportional to θ, the angle between the direction of divergence and the direction of greatest genetic variation. The direction of greatest phenotypic variance is not identical with g(max), but for these data is nearly as successful at predicting the direction of species divergence. I interpret the findings to mean that genetic variances and covariances constrain adaptive change in quantitative trails for reasonably long spans of time. An alternative hypothesis, however, cannot be ruled out: that morphological differentiation is biased in the direction g(max) because divergence and g(max) are both shaped by the same natural selection pressures.

The fungal strains originated from 10 sites in Switzerland, three sites of which were represented by both NS and S subpopulations. In total, 19 allozyme genotypes, that were nonrandomly distributed among S and NS were detected. Genetic variation measured as G(ST) between S and NS strains isolated from the same site ranged from 0.73 to 0.98.

Since all seeds are usually infected vegetatively, horizontal transmission implies the occurrence of multiple host infections. Altogether, these results provide indirect evidence that NS and S strains do not belong to one panmictic population and that differentiation patterns of stroma formation found in nature are due to genetic differences among fungi in associations with their host plants.

This relationship between mode of transmission and virulence would particularly select for improved immune defense in hosts that are subject to horizontally transmitted parasites. Among avian hosts, hole nesters and colonial nesters frequently reuse nest sites because of nest-site limitation, and this results in an increased frequency of horizontal transmission. Comparison of the size of two organs involved in the immune defense between pairs of bird species being either hole or open nesters, or colonially or solitarily nesting birds, respectively, revealed that the size of the bursa of Fabricius and the spleen were consistently larger in hole nesters than in open nesters, and similarly in colonially breeding bird species than in solitarily breeding species.

It was shown that in case of two-locus additive control of the selected trait, global polymorphism is possible only when the geometric mean fitnesses of double homozygotes averaged over the period are lower than that of the single heterozygotes and of the double heterozygote (with a multiplier [1-r](P), which depends on recombination rate r and period length p). But local stability of polymorphism cannot be excluded even if geometric mean fitnesses of all double homozygotes are higher than that of all heterozygotes. We proved, that for logarithmically convex fitness functions, cyclical changes of the optimum cannot help in polymorphism maintenance in case of additive control of the selected trait by two equal loci. However, within the same class of fitness functions, nonequal gene action and/or dominance effect for one or both loci may lead to local polymorphism stability with large enough polymorphism attracting domain. The higher the intensity of selection and closer the linkage between selected loci the larger is this domain.

Frogs are fresh water animals that generally are unable to cross salt water barriers (their skin is readily permeable to both salt and water). The geologically determined ages of salt water barriers that isolate related frog populations thus provide an independent measure of the minimum date of genetic divergence between pairs of such populations. For the genetically well-studied western Palearctic water frogs (Rana esculenta group), the Aegean region provides an ideal area for determining the relationship between genetic divergence and time of spatial isolation, using a nested set of geologically determined isolation times (12,000 yr, 200,000 yr, 1.8 Myr, 2-3 Myr, and 5.2 Myr). Using 31 electrophoretic loci for 33 pairs of neighboring frog populations, a linear relationship between geologically determined isolation time and Hillis' modified Nei genetic distance was found: D*(Nei) = (0.04 ± 0.01) ± (0.10 ± 0.01) isolation time [Myr] corresponding to an average divergence rate ('molecular clock' pace) of 0.10 D(Nei)/Myr (0.10 D(Nei)/Myr). This rate is in the range of previous estimates reported for protein electrophoretic data; the value is conservative because relatively few of the loci used are 'fast evolvers' (13%; sAAT, ALB, EST-5, MPI). Removing these fast evolvers from the analysis results in 0.08 D*(Nei)/Myr (0.118 D(Nei(/Myr). The confidence limits for estimation of the divergence time given the genetic distance are large, but unusually narrow for this kind of study; they permit us to estimate divergence times during the Pliocene and Miocene. Few previous studies, including sequence analyses, have provided reasonable estimates of divergence time for the Pliocene. A test using the outgroup taxa Rana perezi and Rana saharica (also isolated for 5.2 Myr by the Strait of Gibraltar) fits the calibration well: observed genetic Nei distance D*(Nei) = 0.55, expected D*(Nei) = 0.56.

A total of 57 haplotypes was identified in 158 voles from 60 localities. Overall mtDNA diversity was high, but both haplotype and nucleotide diversity exhibited pronounced geographic heterogeneity. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a shallow tree with seven primary mtDNA lineages separated by sequence divergences ranging from 0.6% to 1.0%. The geographic structure of mtDNA diversity and lineage distribution was complex but strongly structured and deviated significantly from an equilibrium situation. The extensive mtDNA diversity observed and the recent biogeographic history of the region suggests that the shallow mtDNA structure in the field vole cannot be explained solely by stochastic lineage sorting in situ or isolation by distance. Instead, the data suggest that the genetic imprints of historical demographic conditions and vicariant geographic events have been preserved and to a large extent determine the contemporary geographic distribution of mtDNA variation. A plausible historical scenario involves differentiation of mtDNA lineages in local populations in glacial refugia, a moving postglacial population structure, and bottlenecks and expansions of mtDNA lineages during the postglacial recolonization of Sweden. By combining the mtDNA data with an analysis of Y-chromosome variation, a specific population unit was identified in southwestern Sweden.

We compared the effects of differential pollen-tube growth on the frequency of F1 hybrid formation in experimental crosses between Iris fulva and Iris hexagona. Analyses of seed production in fruits from pure conspecific and heterospecific pollinations revealed that more seeds were produced in the top half than the bottom half of fruits for all four crosses. Heterospecific pollen was applied to flowers of each species at zero to 24 h prior to conspecific pollen, thereby giving a head start to the foreign pollen. Using diagnostic isozyme markers, the frequency of hybrid progeny was examined at the level of the whole fruit and separately for the top and bottom halves of fruits. In both species, the proportion of hybrid seeds per fruit increased significantly with increasing head starts, suggesting that differences in pollen tube growth rates affect the frequency of hybridization. In I. fulva fruits, the increase in hybrid seeds occurred ill both halves of the fruits, but in I. hexagona an increase was only detected in the top half of fruits. These findings are consistent with a model that assumes attrition of pollen tubes due to the greater length of I. hexagona styles.

We therefore compared our measurements of many corresponding parameters in both strains: growth rate, energy intake, digestive efficiency, metabolic rate and its components, organ masses, and intestinal brush-border nutrient transporter and hydrolase activities and capacities, as functions of age and body mass in zero- to nine-week old chicks. Both strains prove to have the same digestive efficiency. Compared to equal-sized jungle fowl, broilers have higher daily energy intake and activity costs.

Offsetting these increases, broilers have relatively smaller brains and leg bones, these being much less important to a captive bird than to a wild bird exposed to predators. Broilers have generally lower intestinal transporter activities, but relatively higher transporter capacities because of their larger guts. Among domestic chicken strains, comparison of broilers with layers, the former having been consciously selected for much higher growth rates, yields generally similar conclusions.

This 'topiary pruning' method produces a series of progressively modified duplicates of the original set of data, from which more anti more of the most recent substitutions have been removed. The edited sets of data have increased amounts of information per remaining taxon, while similar but randomized data sets subjected to topiary pruning do not. The ability of topiary pruning to 'unscramble' artificial data sets that have high levels of homoplasy is demonstrated, and is shown to be similar in its effects to the weighting method of Kluge and Farris (1969), although with the additional advantage of reducing the number of taxa to the point where bootstrapping is feasible. Pruning and weighting used together produce closer approximations to the 'true' free than either method used separately. It is further shown that in these artificial data sets midpoint rooting is more likely to be accurate than outgroup rooting. When pruning and weighting are applied to the extensive sets of mitochondrial DNA data of Cann et al. (1987) and Vigilant et al. (1991), trees result that have deep branch points, some of which lead to entirely African branches. In the case of the VigiLant et al. data, the three African branches have bootstrap values between 0.94 and 1.0, and the consensus and bootstrap midpoint roots also have high bootstrap values and occur on these African branches near their junction.

Both models are extensions of one-dimensional difference equations that can exhibit complicated dynamics. Compared to these basic models, the phenotypic variability given by the quantitative characters reduces the size of the density fluctuations in asexual populations. With sexual reproduction, which is described by modeling the genetics of the quantitative character explicitly with many haploid loci that determine the character additively, this reduction in fitness variance is magnified. Moreover, quantitative genetics can induce simple dynamics. For example, the sexual population can have a two-cycle when the asexual system is chaotic. This paper discusses the consequences for the evolution of sex. The higher mean growth rate implied by the lower fitness variance in sexual populations is an advantage that can overcome a twofold intrinsic growth rate of asexuals. The advantage is bigger when the asexual population contains only a subset of the phenotypes present in the sexual population, which conforms with the tangled bank theory for the evolution of sex and shows that tangled bank effects also occur in host-parasite systems.

Frequently, multiple character sets representing genetically independent traits are used to classify these individuals and various methodologies are employed to combine the classifications obtained from the different character sets. We adapted the principles of total evidence and taxonomic congruence (two formalized approaches used by systematists in formulating phylogenetic hypotheses) to address the problem of discriminating hybridizing species and classifying individuals from hybrid zones. As our model, we used two morphological (coloration and morphometric) and two molecular (allozyme and mitochondrial DNA restriction-fragment-length polymorphism) character sets that differentiate two stone crab species (Menippe adina and M. mercenaria). Using principal-components analysis, we determined that combining character sets and eliminating characters or character sets that did not have large eigenvector coefficients for the principal component that best separated the two species yielded the highest level of discrimination between species and allowed us to classify a broad range of morpho-genotypes as hybrids. For the stone crabs, three diagnostic allozyme loci and five diagnostic coloration characters best separated the species. The two character sets were not completely congruent, but they agreed in their classification of 50% of the individuals from the hybrid zone and rarely strongly disagreed in their classifications. Classification discrepancies between the two character sets probably represent variation between traits in interspecific gene flow rather than intraspecific, ecologically mediated variation. Our results support the assertions of previous investigators who espoused the benefits associated with using multiple character sets to classify individuals from hybrid zones and demonstrate that, if character sets are reasonably congruent and numerically balanced, combining diagnostic characters from multiple character sets (a total-evidence approach) can enhance discriminatory power between species and facilitate the assignment of hybrid-zone individuals to genotypic classes.

Fitness components of adult females and hermaphrodites in nature, of their open-pollinated progeny, and of experimental selfs and outcrosses onto hermaphrodites were compared in endemic Hawaiian Bidens sandvicensis, all of whose known populations are gynodioecious, consisting of a mixture of females and hermaphrodites. Multilocus selfing rates of hermaphrodites were also estimated, and sex morph ratio monitored over four seasons in three populations of B. sandvicensis and one population of gynodioecious B. cervicata. Total mean inbreeding depression in seed set (in the glasshouse), germination rate (in an open-air nursery on Kauai), and first year survivorship and fecundity in the field were estimated as 0.94 (SE 0.04), and occurred primarily in drought months. Lower survivorship and fecundity of selfs were partially explained by their consistently smaller size. Open-pollinated seed of females had significantly lower germination rate, proportion flowering, and fecundity than outcrossed progeny of hermaphrodites, suggesting moderate biparental inbreeding in females and a lack of any non-outcrossing advantage to progeny of females. In all fitness components, open-pollinated progeny of hermaphrodites were inferior to those of females and to outcrosses, and in most components were superior to selfs. Total performance of open-pollinated progeny of females relative to those of hermaphrodites was calculated as 2.3 (SE = 0.4), but since inflorescences of females also set 20% to 50% more seed than those of hermaphrodites, their total relative ovule success was estimated as 3.2 (SE = 0.5). If inheritance of male sterility is nuclear, this superiority is sufficient to maintain females in frequencies over 20% in populations, whose actual frequencies ranged from 14% to 33%. In four populations, selfing rates of hermaphrodites, assayed in seedlings, were 0.50, 0.45, 0.25, and 0.30, but since substantial inbreeding depression occurred prior to germination, the mean selfing rate of hermaphrodite ovules exceeded 0.57.

The results indicated a polyphyletic origin of ecotypes whereby each of them have been expressed independently more than once.

Early research by Schoener revealed a regularity in the number of Anolis species that coexisted on islands and the difference in body size between coexisting congeners in the Northern Lesser Antilles. This consistent pattern of body size was suggested to be the result of competitive character displacement. Two recent studies critically evaluated this hypothesis by incorporating information about the phylogenetic relationships of insular Anolis. Roughgarden and Pacala suggested that the patterns of body-size differences in the Northern Lesser Antilles could be explained as a cyclical phenomenon that they labeled a taxon cycle. However, Losos supported the character-dis-placement hypothesis (""size adjustment""). The conflict between these two studies is important because both investigations were based on the same phylogenetic hypothesis. We investigated body-size evolution in Lesser Antilles Anolis to resolve the differences in the conclusions of these studies. Our new analysis supported the taxon-cycle hypothesis but nevertheless failed to reject the character-displacement hypothesis. We argue that this curious scenario is largely a function of the method by which phylogenetic information is incorporated in comparative analyses.

Male sand gobies rely on empty mussel shells for nest building and spawning. The two populations differed considerably in nest-site abundance and sexual-selection regimes. In one population nest sites were scarce, leading to stronger male-male competition over nests, a higher nest site colonization rate and reduced potential for female choice compared with the other population that had a surplus of nests. In the high-competition population, males were larger than females, perhaps as a response to selection, whereas the other population was not sexually size dimorphic. The results from the field were confirmed in a pool experiment that demonstrated the effect of nest abundance on nest occupancy and male reproductive success. Larger males were more successful in obtaining nest sites in both high and low nest availability treatments. Larger males were also favored by females as mating partners, but only in the treatment with surplus nest sites. Nest shortage was associated with an increased potential for intrasexual selection (measured as the coefficient of variation), whereas the potential for intersexual selection was increased when nests were common.

For example, altered host behavior is often interpreted as a parasite adaptation, because in some cases it enhances parasite transmission. Resistance to parasites also has obvious adaptive value for hosts. However, it is difficult to evaluate the adaptive significance of host-parasite interactions without considering the historical context in which these traits have evolved and if they can be predicted by host (or parasite) phylogeny. We examined the influence of host phylogeny on patterns of altered behavior and resistance to parasitism in a cockroach-acanthocephalan system. A consensus cladogram for cockroach subfamilies was produced from the morphological data of McKittrick. We used this cladogram to predict patterns of altered host behavior in seven cockroach host species. Each species was experimentally infected with a single species of acanthocephalan, Moniliformis moniliformis, a parasite that is transmitted when cockroaches are eaten by rodent final hosts. Activity patterns, substrate choices, and responses to light were measured for control and infected animals. These data were recoded into a behavioral matrix of discrete characters. We determined the most parsimonious distribution of the behavioral characters on the tree obtained from McKittrick's data. We then measured the concordance between the behavioral data and the cockroach cladogram with the consistency index (CI). We compared the observed CI to the expected value based on a randomization of observed character states. For three different models of evolutionary character change, there was no evidence of strong concordance (significantly large CI) between altered host behavior and host relationships. Parsimony analysis of the interior nodes of the phylogenetic reconstruction suggested that unaltered behavior was the ancestral state for most host behaviors. We also compared host phylogeny to a data set on the susceptibility of 29 cockroach species to infection with M. moniliformis. At the species level, there was a significant concordance between susceptibility and host phylogeny. This pattern was consistent with the finding that susceptibility of species varied significantly among different subfamilies. However, at the subfamily level, susceptibility was not strongly concordant with phylogeny. We predict that, given enough time, resistance should be lost in subfamilies that are currently resistant to parasitism. In spite of the potential importance of phylogeny in the evolution of behavior and susceptibility, we found little evidence for phylogenetic effects in this system. We conclude that changes in the behavioral responses of hosts to parasites and, to a lesser extent, changes in susceptibility are more frequent than cockroach speciation events in different cockroach lineages.

Consequently, the presence of methanogenic bacteria in the various differentiations of the large intestine and the foregut of herbivorous vertebrates had been attributed primarily to the existence of anaerobic habitats and the availability of carbon dioxide and hydrogen originating from the fermentative microbial digestion of plant-based diets. However, Australian ratites, many murids, and several New World primates lack methanogens, despite their intestinal differentiations and their vegetarian feeding habits. Crocodiles, giant snakes, aardvarks, and ant-eaters on the other hand release significant amounts of methane. A determination of methane emissions by 253 vertebrate species confirmed that competence for intestinal methanogenic bacteria is shared by related species and higher taxa, irrespective of different feeding habits. In ""methanogenic"" branches of the evolutionary tree, a variety of differentiations of the large intestine evolved and, in some cases, differentiations of the foregut. In contrast, the lack of competence for methanogens in chiropterans/insectivores and carnivores apparently has precluded the evolution of specialized fermenting differentiations of the digestive tract. Our observations reveal that the presence of intestinal methanogenic bacteria is under phylogenetic rather than dietary control: competence for intestinal methanogenic bacteria is a plesiomorphic (primitive-shared) character among reptiles, birds, and mammals.

Tadpoles reared in ponds with predatory dragonfly larvae are relatively inactive compared with tadpoles in predator-free ponds, and have relatively large, brightly colored tailfins with dark spots along the margins. Models for the evolution of plasticity predict that induced phenotypes such as this should confer high fitness relative to the typical phenotype when in the presence of predators, but should be costly when the predator is absent. Our study tested for the predicted fitness trade-off in H. chrysoscelis by first rearing tadpoles in mesocosms under conditions that induce the alternate phenotypes, and then comparing the performance of both phenotypes in both environments. We generated the two phenotypes by rearing tadpoles in 600-liter outdoor artificial ponds that contained either two caged dragonflies (Anax junius) or an empty cage.

We compared the growth and survival of both phenotypes over four weeks in ponds where there was no actual risk of predation. Under these conditions, both phenotypes grew at the same rate, but the predator-induced phenotype had significantly lower survival than the typical phenotype, indicating that induced tadpoles suffered greater mortality from causes other than odonate predation.

In the chalk bass, Serranus tortugarum, estimates of both reproductive allocation and reproductive success as a male and a female can be made for individuals of different sizes. As individuals increase in size, their investment in gamete production increases, and there is a shift in allocation to a stronger female bias. Spawning frequency as a female in pair spawnings and as a male in both pair spawning and streaking (an alternative mating tactic) does not vary with individual size. As a result, larger individuals should release more sperm or eggs per spawn. Size-assortative pair spawning in this species leads to larger individuals having higher potential returns in total male reproductive success than smaller individuals, which should lead to increases in absolute levels of sperm production in larger individuals when individuals compete for fertilizations through sperm competition. However, smaller individuals contribute a smaller proportion of the sperm released in spawns with multiple spawners and thus are under more intense sperm competition than larger individuals, which should select for increases in male allocation in smaller individuals, all else equal. A local-mate-competition (LMC) model predicts that these factors select for increasing absolute male and female investment with individual size but a relative shift to more female-biased allocation as individual size increases. These predictions are supported by gonadal data. The predictions of average male allocation from the quantitative LMC model were 21.6% and 25.7%, whereas the collections averaged 21.3%.

When behavioral responsiveness is neutral on fitness, a rapid evolution by runaway selection occurs only with enough genetic covariance between the signal and responsiveness.

In a randomly mating population, at each generation progeny move to niches where they are subject to weak Gaussian selection on the trait, with different fitness levels in the different niches. Initially, the variability of the trait is due to additive loci with heterozygous homeostasis. The evolution of plasticity is then described in terms of the invasion of the population by genetic modifiers that may epistatically affect the trait, its optimum in each niche, the strengths of selection, and other parameters characteristic of the niches. We show that the evolution of trait means within niches depends on the overall evolution in the whole system, and in general, optimum phenotypic values are not attained.

One species, Heliothis virescens (HV), has a broad host range and is an agricultural pest on cotton (Malvaceae), soybean (Fabaceae), and tobacco (Solanaceae). The other species, Heliothis subflexa (HS), has a narrow host range, feeding on plants in the genus Physalis (Solanaceae). Experiments were done to determine whether the abilities to feed on cotton, soybean, and tobacco were each under separate genetic control in HV (genetically uncorrelated) or whether feeding on all three hosts was genetically correlated. By repeatedly backcrossing hybrids to HS while selecting for high larval survival and weight on soybean, loci conferring the ability to feed on soybean were moved from HV into the genetic background of the specialist, HS. After six generations of selection on soybean we tested the selected line on soybean, cotton, Physalis, and tobacco to determine if ability to feed on soybean was correlated with feeding ability on these other hosts. We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that feeding on all three hosts was correlated and controlled by a single locus. Compared to HS, the survival and weight of the selected line were significantly higher on soybean, similar on tobacco and Physalis, and slightly, but not significantly, higher on cotton. We also conducted a behavioral choice test to determine if larval preference for soybean was correlated with preference for other hosts. The selected line larvae had higher preference for soybean and cotton than HS. Preference for tobacco was equal in the selected line and in HS. These results support the trends seen in survival and growth tests where performances on soybean and cotton appeared partially correlated and performances on soybean and tobacco were uncorrelated. In conclusion, the generalist, HV, did not have a single set of loci that governed feeding on soybean, cotton and tobacco. It is likely that some of the loci governing performance and preference for soybean also contributed to performance and preference for cotton and that the soybean loci examined did not interact negatively to lower performance and preference for Physalis, the specialist's host.

This paper explores both their causes and potential consequences for the evolution of life-history traits in plants. In a growth chamber experiment, I manipulated the pre- and postzygotic temperatures of both parents of controlled crosses of Plantago lanceolata. All offspring traits were affected by parental temperature. On average, low parental temperature increased seed weight, reduced germination and offspring growth rate, and accelerated onset of reproduction by 7%, 50%, 5%, and 47%, respectively, when compared to the effects of high parental temperature. Both pre- and postzygotic parental temperatures (i.e., prior to fertilization vs. during fertilization and seed set, respectively) influenced offspring traits but not always in the same direction. In all cases, however, the postzygotic effect was stronger. The prezygotic effects were more often transmitted paternally than maternally. Growth and onset of reproduction were influenced both directly by parental temperature as well as indirectly via the effects of parental temperature on seed weight and germination. Significant interactions between parental genotypes and prezygotic temperature treatment (G × E interactions) show that genotypes differ in their intergenerational responses to temperature with respect to germination and growth. The data suggest that temperature is involved in both genetically based and environmentally induced parental effects and that parental temperature may accelerate the rate of evolutionary change in flowering time in natural populations of P. lanceolata. The environmentally induced temperature effects, as mediated through G × (prezygotic) E interactions are not likely to affect the rate or direction of evolutionary change in the traits examined because postzygotic temperature effects greatly exceed prezygotic effects.",94,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Germination | Growth | Life-history evolution | Maternal effects | Onset of reproduction | Parental effects | Paternal effects | Plantago lanceolata | Pre- and postzygotic effects | Seed weight | Temperature,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,126,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03895.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

The phenotypic diversity of wing pattens among mimetic Heliconius adds an additional twist to the problem, because single species contain more than a dozen radically different-looking geographical races even though the mimetic advantage is theoretically highest when all individuals within and between species appear the same. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) offers an independent way to address these issues. In this study, Cytochrome Oxidase I and II sequences from multiple, parallel races of Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene are examined, to estimate intraspecific phylogeny and gauge sequence divergence and ages of clades among races within each species.

The second is an extension of the mixed-mating model and subdivides the outcrossing rate into intra- and interspecific components. The two species were almost completely outcrossing. This high level of outcrossing and interspecific gene flow could play an important role in the maintenance of the genetic diversity in these long-lived forest tree species.

Six initially identical populations were propagated for 2000 generations under each of five regimes: constant 20°C, 32°C, 37°C, and 42°C, and a daily switch between 32°C and 42°C. Glucose was the sole carbon source in all cases. Here, we examine the physiological bases of adaptation to determine whether the same mechanisms evolved among the replicate lines within each thermal regime and across different regimes. Specifically, we investigate whether changes in glucose transport may account for the temperature-specific adaptation. We compared each line's direct response of fitness to glucose with its correlated response to maltose; glucose and maltose enter the cell by different pathways, but their catabolism is identical. Except for lines maintained at the ancestral temperature (37°C), almost all derived lines had significantly different fitnesses (relative to their common ancestor) in glucose and maltose, supporting the hypothesis that adaptation involved changes in glucose transport. An alternative explanation, that maltose transport decayed by genetic drift, appears unlikely for reasons that are discussed. Although most lines showed evidence of temperature-specific adaptation in glucose transport, several different mechanisms may underlie these improvements, as indicated by heterogeneity in correlated responses (across temperatures and substrates) among replicate lines adapted to the same regime.

In crickets, such manipulation is manifest in the premature removal of the externally attached spermatophore, which may afford females an important means of postcopulatory mate choice. We tested the hypothesis that premature spermatophore removal contributes significantly to intraspecific variation in sperm precedence by (1) experimentally manipulating spermatophore attachment durations of competing male Gryllodes sigillatus and (2) employing protein electrophoresis to determine the paternity of doubly mated females. The relative spermatophore attachment durations of competing males had a significant influence on male paternity, but the pattern of sperm precedence deviated significantly from the predictions of an ideal lottery. Instead, paternity data and morphological evidence accorded best with a model of partial sperm displacement derived here. Our model is similar to a displacement model of Parker et al. in that sperm of the second male mixes instantaneously with that of the first throughout the displacement process, but the novel feature of our model is that the number of sperm displaced is only a fraction of the number of sperm transferred by the second male. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, female G. sigillatus can clearly alter the paternity of their offspring through their spermatophore-removal behavior, and employ such cryptic choice in favoring larger males and those providing larger courtship food gifts.

In echinoids, four patterns of larval development are generally recognized: planktotrophy, pelagic lecithotrophy, bottom dwelling, and brood protecting. Each broad type of free and protected development is found in all the oceans, but comparisons of the principal reproductive modes between different geographic regions have shown that they are not equally distributed. Frequency of pelagic development (planktotrophic and lecithotrophic) decreases from equator to Antarctic, where brood protecting becomes dominant. Numerous theories have been proposed to explain the richness of nonpelagic development in most marine invertebrates within the Southern Ocean. These theories can be grouped into three categories: (1) larval survival, where selection acts on larval; (2) energy allocation; and (3) dispersal. All of them consider the adaptative significance of brood protecting as the key to the success of this strategy in the Antarctic. However, the adaptative significance of brooding and the evolutionary success of this strategy in the Antarctic must be considered as two separate questions. To consider the problem at an evolutionary level, we have examined the consequences of different reproductive strategies on the genetic structure of species and on the long-term evolution of the clade. We examine this problem in the case of echinoids, a clade particularly well suited to addressing this question. In echinoids, the reduction of larval-stage duration is associated with a decrease in gene flow and consequently in the geographical scale of genetic differentiation. This allows us to reconsider the high-speciation-rate model, which leads to an increase in the number of low-dispersal species (isolation by distance). This model, previously tested by means of fossils is not satisfactory in living echinoids. Thus, the model is rebuilt with the addition of differential extinction rate between planktotrophic and brooding species in relation with the climatic history of the Antarctic.",73,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Antarctic | Brooding | Echinoderm | Echinoid | Evolution | Extinction | Larval dispersal | Speciation,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,138,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03891.x,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using the morphology of western Canary Island lacertids (Gallotia galloti) as an example, a procedure is explored that gives a preliminary answer to this problem when there are a limited number of islands. The phylogenetic component (represented by patristic distances derived from 1005 mitochondrial DNA [mtDNA] base pairs) can be separated from two potential ecogenetic factors (environmental richness and climate) by partial Mantel tests. This reveals that, although these components interact, some characters are correlated primarily to biodiversity/paucity (e.g., size), others are correlated to wet and lush environments (e.g., dorsal pattern), and others are correlated primarily to the phylogeny (e.g., sexual leg markings).

We surveyed 10 populations of Drosophila melanogaster selected for increased resistance to starvation for 60 generations, their paired controls, and their mutual ancestors (a total of 30 outbred populations) for evidence of physiological and life-history trade-offs that span life-cycle stages. The directly selected lines showed an impressive response to starvation selection, with mature adult females resisting starvation death 4-6 times longer than unselected controls or ancestors - up to a maximum of almost 20 days. Starvation-selected flies are already 80% more resistant to starvation death than their controls immediately upon eclosion, suggesting that a significant portion of their selection response was owing to preadult growth and acquisition of metabolites relevant to the stress. These same lines exhibited significantly longer development and lower viability in the larval and pupal stages. Weight and lipid measurements on one of the starvation-selected treatments (SB1-5), its control populations (CB1-5), and their ancestor populations (B1-5) revealed three important findings. First, starvation resistance and lipid content were linearly correlated; second, larval lipid acquisition played a major role in the evolution of adult starvation resistance; finally, increased larval growth rate and lipid acquisition had a fitness cost exacted in reduced viability and slower development. This study implicates multiple life-cycle stages in the response to selection for the stress resistance of only one stage.

In this paper, I examined the relationship between gene flow and distance in two co-occurring solitary corals. Balanophyllia elegans brood large, nonfeeding planulae that generally crawl only short distances from their place of birth before setting. In contrast, Paracyathus stearnsii free-spawns and produces small planktonic larvae presumably capable of broad dispersal by oceanic. I calculated E- statistics using genetic variation at six (P stearnsii) or seven (B. elegans) polymorphic allozyme loci revealed by starch gel electrophoresis, and used these F-statistics to infer levels of gene flow. Average levels of gene flow among twelve Californian localities agreed with previous studies; the species with planktonic, feeding larvae was less genetically subdivided than the brooding species. In addition, geographic isolation between populations appeared to affect gene flow between populations in very different ways in the two species. In the brooding B. elegans, gene flow decline with increasing separation, and distance explained 31% of the variation in gene flow. In the planktonically dispersed P. stearnsii distance of separation between populations at the scale studied (10-1000 km) explained only 1% of the variation in gene flow between populations.

An empirical observation frequently offered in its support is the occurrence of sister taxa living in sympatry but using different resources. To examine the possibility of sympatric differentiation in producing such cases, I measured genetic, behavioral, and demographic differentiation between populations of the tropical sponge-dwelling shrimp Synalpheus brooksi occupying two alternate host species on three reefs in Caribbean Panama. This species belongs to an apparently monophyletic group of ≥ 30 species of mostly obligate, host-specific sponge-dwellers, many of which occur in sympatry. Demographic data demonstrated the potential for disruptive selection imposed by the two host species: shrimp demes from the sponge Agelas clathrodes were consistently denser, poorer in mature females, more heavily parasitized by branchial bopyrid isopods, and less parasitized by thoracic isopods, than conspecific shrimp from the sponge Spheciospongia vesparium. Laboratory assays demonstrated divergence in host preference: shrimp on all three reefs tended to choose their native sponge species more often than did conspecific shrimp from the other host. Because S. brooksi mates within the host, this habitat selection should foster assortative mating by host species. A hierarchical survey of protein-electrophoretic variation also supported host-mediated divergence, revealing the following: (1) shrimp from the two hosts are conspecific, as evidenced by absence of fixed allelic differences at any of nine allozyme loci scored; (2) strong genetic subdivision among populations of this philopatric shrimp on reefs separated by 1-3 km; and (3) significant host-associated genetic differentiation within two of the three reefs. Finally, intersexual aggression (a proxy for mating incompatibility) between shrimp from different host species was significantly elevated on the one reef where host-associated genetic differences were strongest, demonstrating concordance between genetic and behavioral estimates of divergence. Adjacent reefs appear to be semi-independent sites of host-associated differentiation, as evidenced by differences in the degree of host-associated behavioral and genetic differentiation, and in the specific loci involved, on different reefs. In philopatric organisms with highly subdivided populations, such as S. brooksi, resource-associated differentiation can occur independently in different populations, thus providing multiple ""experiments"" in differentiation and resulting in a mosaic pattern of polymorphism as reflected by neutral genetic markers. Several freshwater fishes, an amphipod, and a snail similarly show independent but remarkably convergent patterns of resource-associated divergence in different conspecific populations, often in the absence of obvious spatial barriers.

Adaptation of Escherichia coli at a niche boundary,Mongold J.A.,Evolution,00143820,50,1,35-43,1996-01-01,February 1996,"Following an environmental change, the course of a population's adaptive evolution may be influenced by environmental factors, such as the degree of marginality of the new environment relative to the organism's potential range, and by genetic factors, including constraints that may have arisen during its past history. Experimental populations of bacteria were used to address these issues in the context of evolutionary adaptation to the thermal environment. Six replicate lines of Escherichia coli (20°C group), founded from a common ancestor, were propagated for 2000 generations at 20°C, a novel temperature that is very near the lower thermal limit at which it can maintain a stable population size in a daily serial transfer (100-fold dilution) regime. Four additional groups (32/20, 37/20, 42/ 20, and 32-42/20°C groups) of six lines, each with 2000 generation selection histories at different temperatures (32, 37, 42, and daily alternation of 32 and 42°C), were moved to the same 20°C environment and propagated in parallel to ascertain whether selection histories influence the adaptive response in this novel environment. Adaptation was measured by improvement in fitness relative to the common ancestor in direct competition experiments conducted at 20°C. All five groups showed improvement in relative fitness in this environment; the mean fitness of the 20°C group after 2000 generations increased by about 8%. Selection history had no discernible effect on the rate or final magnitude of the fitness responses of the four groups with different histories after 2000 generations. The correlated fitness responses of the 20°C group were measured across the entire thermal niche. There were significant tradeoffs in fitness at higher temperatures; for example, at 40°C the average fitness of the 20°C group was reduced by almost 20% relative to the common ancestor. We also observed a downward shift of 1-2°C in both the upper and lower thermal niche limits for the 20°C selected group. These observations are contrasted with previous observations of a markedly greater rate of adaptation to growth near the upper thermal limit (42°C) and a lack of trade-off in fitness at lower temperatures for lines adapted to that high temperature.

Each mtDNA phylogeographic group can be related to a morphometrically defined subspecies, but several other recognized subspecies are not supported by monophyletic mtDNA lineages within their purported ranges. More detailed analysis of several European populations reveals low amounts of gene flow and the partitioning of a substantial fraction of molecular variance between them.

A developing field is the comparison of geographic patterns of genetic variation in codistributed species, or comparative phylogeography. One determines whether species that currently share the same broad area exhibit congruent phylogeographic patterns, which would indicate that they were historically codistributed and differentiated in response to same geological or environmental events. I reviewed studies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variation in five codistributed, widespread species of North American birds. In addition to phylogeographic patterns, data were available on levels of genetic variation, gene flow, and evolutionary distance from common ancestors (an index of a species' relative age) for each species, all important factors involved in geographic differentiation. Two species, Canada goose (Branta canadensis) and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca), exhibited incongruent phylogeographic patterns of mtDNA variation, whereas three other codistributed species, the song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), chipping sparrow (Spizella passerina), and red-winged blackbird (Agelaius phoeniceus), lacked geographically structured mtDNA patterns. Thus, the first two species have had demonstrably different histories, whereas the histories of the latter three are speculative. However, the three species without geographic variation in mtDNA exhibit shallow mtDNA haplotype trees, which are consistent with recent population expansion. Thus, lack of geographic variation in mtDNA is likely due to these three species arriving relatively recently at their current distributions, and after historical isolating events produced genetic divisions in the fox sparrow and Canada goose. Within the geographically uniform species, or parts thereof, dispersal seems a likely homogenizing factor; no consistent explanations emerged from consideration of levels of genetic variation. Lack of congruent phylogeographic patterns suggests that currently codistributed species have not had a long history of co-association.

All possible transitions of reproductive modes were detected in each taxon using Maddison's method. We then tested two specific hypotheses. First, egg guarding can be regarded as an alternative to viviparity. A relatively frequent association of egg guarding and viviparous species in the same taxon may be due to similar environmental conditions or species characteristics leading to two different solutions. Second, egg guarding may facilitate the evolution of viviparity. This hypothesis is supported by the high frequency of viviparous species in taxa containing egg guarding species and by a tendency for prolonged uterine retention of eggs in brooding squamates. Our analyses demonstrate that the first hypothesis is the best supported. Egg guarding and viviparity most often evolved independently. If a major benefit of egg guarding is the repulsion of potential predators, size is one of the most obvious morphological characters that should be correlated with the evolution of reproductive modes.

Examples of conditions that have led to rapid evolution include drastic environmental change, invasion of a new predator, or a host-range expansion. In cyclical parthenogens, however, yearly cycles of phenotypic evolution may occur due to the loss of adaptation during recombination in the sexual phase (genetic slippage), permitting an opportunity to observe adaptive evolutionary change in contemporary populations that are not necessarily subject to new patterns of natural selection. In insect herbivores, comparative studies suggest that morphological features that aid individuals in remaining on the plant or exploiting it as a food source are likely targets for selection. Here, we estimated the genetic variability of morphological traits in a cyclical parthenogen, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), to determine the potential for their evolution and we tested the hypothesis that size and/ or shape evolves by clonal selection during one season of parthenogenetic reproduction. Genetic variation in a set of morphological traits was estimated using laboratory-reared descendents of clones collected from a single alfalfa field in May 1988 and April 1989 (henceforth, the ""early"" collections). In both years, there was significant clonal heritability early in the season both for overall morphology and for several individual aspects of size and shape. Because the course of short-term evolutionary change in the multivariate phenotype is a function of patterns of genetic covariance among characters, genetic correlations between size and 12 shape variables were also estimated for these early collections. A comparison between the mean phenotype of each early collection and that of a corresponding ""late"" collection made from the same field seven to eight clonal generations later in the same years revealed qualitatively similar changes in the average multivariate morphological phenotypes between the time periods in both years, although the difference was only significant for the 1989 samples. The pattern of genetic correlations that we estimated early in the 1989 season between overall size and various shape variables suggests that the observed short-term evolutionary changes in shape could have been due to natural selection acting only to increase overall size. We tested this hypothesis by estimating selection on size using a separate data set in which both demographic and morphological variables were measured on individuals reared under field conditions. Highly significant regressions of individual relative fitness on size were found for two major fitness components. Thus, it is likely that the evolutionary change in morphology that we observed is attributable to natural selection, possibly acting primarily through body size. A shift back to smaller size between the late 1988 and early 1989 collections from the same field suggests that either a cost of recombination or opposing selective forces during overwintering may produce persistent yearly cycles of morphological evolution in this cyclically parthenogenetic species.",53,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Acyrthosiphon pisum | Genetic variation | Morphology | Natural selection | Parthenogenesis | Pea aphids | Rapid evolution,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,150,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb04483.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Plant physiological traits such as leaf size and water-use efficiency (the ratio of carbon gained per water lost) have been suggested by physiological plant ecologists to be important in local adaptation to environments differing in water availability. In this study, I raised families of Cakile edentula var lacustris derived from a wet-site population and a dry-site population in a common greenhouse environment to determine the degree of genetic differentiation between the two populations and the genetic architecture of the traits. The dry-site population had significantly smaller leaf size and significantly greater water-use efficiency than the wet-site population.

Both direct measures in the field and the retrospective selection gradients were consistent with the hypothesis that greater water-use efficiency and smaller leaves were adaptive in drier environments.

Provided that there are no inherent fitness differences among morphs, frequency-dependent selection should result in equal morph frequencies at equilibrium. Stochastic models indicate that the short-styled morph has the highest and the long-styled morph the lowest probability of being lost from local populations as a result of random processes. We surveyed the morph composition of 82 populations of the tristylous, self-incompatible herb Lythrum salicaria in two archipelagos, one in central and one in northern Sweden, located close to the range-margin of the species. To examine whether deviations from even morph frequencies can be explained by among-morph differences in reproductive success, we quantified flower and seed production in six and three populations in the northern and southern archipelago, respectively, and we recorded segregation ratios in offspring produced in six trimorphic populations in the northern area. Seed germination and offspring growth were studied in the greenhouse. Ninety percent of the populations in the southern archipelago (N = 31) and 69% of the populations in the northern archipelago (N = 35) were trimorphic; the remaining populations were dimorphic (only populations consisting of at least three flowering plants considered). Dimorphic populations were smaller than trimorphic populations, as predicted by stochastic models. There was a striking difference in the morph composition of L. salicaria populations between the two archipelagos. In the southern archipelago, there was a slight excess of the long-styled morph and a corresponding deficiency of the short-styled morph. In contrast, the northern populates were characterized by a marked deficiency of the mid-styled morph: the average frequency of the mid-styled morph in trimorphic populations was 0.21, and nine of eleven dimorphic populations lacked the mid-styled morph. In both archipelagos, the long-styled morph (the most common morph) produced about 20% fewer seeds per fruit than the other morphs. The long-styled morph also tended to produce fewer seeds per plant. A hand-pollination experiment performed in two of the northern populations indicated that seed production per flower was pollen-limited in the long-styled morph but not in the other two morphs. Seed germination and offspring size after 24 weeks of growth did not differ among morphs. The mid-styled morph tended to have a higher representation in the offspring than in the parental generation m all six trimorphic populations studied further indicating that the deficiency of the mid-styled morph in the northern archipelago does not represent an equilibrium. Taken together, the results do not support the hypothesis that morph-specific differences in reproductive success can account for deviations from even morph frequencies in L. salicaria.

Maternal influences on progeny phenotype resulting from the cytoplasmic inheritance of plastids or RNA transcripts and effects of the maternal environment have consequently been the focus of much research. To exclude or to control for these sources of variation, breeding designs (e.g., cross-factored, nested, or diallel) in which genetically unrelated pollen donors are mated to maternal genotypes have been adopted. Using these designs, some empirical studies have detected statistically significant differences among pollen donors in the mean performance of their pollen (the mature male gametophytes) or in the mean phenotype of their progeny. These statistical effects of pollen-donor identity on pollen performance or progeny phenotype have frequently been interpreted as evidence for additive genetic variance among pollen donors, although patrilineal cytoplasmic inheritance or effects of the paternal environment on pollen performance or gene expression are recognized as alternative explanations. We note that environment-specific selection among developing gametophytes - in which the environment experienced by developing pollen grains (or ovules) provides a selective force causing the differential survival of gametophyte genotypes (analagous to meiotic drive) - is an additional process that may cause genetically based paternal (or maternal) effects on gametophyte performance. If genes selected during this process are expressed in the sporophyte (postfertilization), this process could also influence the phenotype of the diploid progeny. Here, we review the potential causes of statistically significant differences in mean phenotype among the gametophytes or progeny of maternal (seed-bearing) or paternal (pollen-donating) parental plants. We suggest an experimental approach that permits the detection or elimination of selection among developing gametophytes as one such cause. Specifically, the replication of homozygous parental genotypes within and across environments allows the detection and measurement of paternal and maternal environmentally induced effects on gametophyte or offspring phenotype, while eliminating meiotic drive as a source of the phenotypic variation.",63,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Additive genetic effects | Diallel | Gametophytic selection | Maternal effects | Meiotic drive | Non-Mendelian inheritance | Parental effects | Pollen performance,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,158,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb04471.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Theoretical models predict that the magnitude of inbreeding depression will decrease with inbreeding as deleterious recessive alleles are expressed and purged through selection. If selection acts differentially among life history stages and deleterious effects are uncorrelated among stages, then the timing of inbreeding depression may also evolve with inbreeding. Estimates of cumulative inbreeding depression and stage-specific inbreeding depression (four stages: seed production of parent, germination, juvenile survival, and growth/reproduction) were compiled for 79 populations (using means of replicates, N = 62) comprising 54 species from 23 families of vascular plants. Where available, data on the mating system also were collected and used as a measure of inbreeding history. A significant negative correlation was found between cumulative inbreeding depression and the primary selfing rate for the combined sample of angiosperms (N = 35) and gymnosperms (N = 9); the correlation was significant for angiosperms but not gymnosperms examined separately. The average inbreeding depression in predominantly selfing species (δ = 0.23) was significantly less (43%) than that in predominantly outcrossing species (δ = 0.53). These results support the theoretical prediction that selfing reduces the magnitude of inbreeding depression. Most self-fertilizing species expressed the majority of their inbreeding depression late in the life cycle, at the stage of growth/reproduction (14 of 18 species), whereas outcrossing species expressed much of their inbreeding depression either early, at seed production (17 of 40 species), or late (19 species). For species with four life stages examined, selfing and outcrossing species differed in the magnitude of inbreeding depression at the stage of seed production (selfing δ = 0.05, N = 11; outcrossing δ = 0.32, N = 31), germination (selfing δ = 0.02, outcrossing δ = 0.12), and survival to reproduction (selfing δ = 0.04, outcrossing δ = 0.15), but not at growth and reproduction (selfing δ = 0.21, outcrossing δ = 0.27); inbreeding depression in selfers relative to outcrossers increased from early to late life stages.

To simulate the evolutionary process giving rise to this change, I used a pollinator selection experiment Plants with broad flowers set significantly more seeds than plants with narrow flowers under bumblebee Pollination but had equivalent fecundity when visited by other insects or hand-pollinated. Bumblebee-mediated selection for broad corolla flare intensified from 0.07 at seed set to 0.17 at progeny establishment. Maternal parent-offspring regression yielded a confidence interval of 0.22-1.00 for trait heritability. Given these parameter estimates, the prediction equation shows that broadly flared flowers of bumblebee-pollinated P. viscosum could have evolved from narrower ones in a single generation.

We tested whether such geographically extensive ecotypic variation resulted from parallel evolutionary divergence thoughout the North Pacific or whether the two forms are monophyletic groups by examining allelic variation between sockeye salmon and kokanee at two minisatellite DNA repeat loci and in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) Bgl II restriction sites. Our examination of over 750 fish from 24 populations, ranging from Kamchatka to the Columbia River, identified two major genetic groups of North Pacific O. nerka: a ""northwestern"" group consisting of fish from Kamchatka, western Alaska, and northwestern British Columbia, and a ""southern"" group consisting of sockeye salmon and kokanee populations from the Fraser and Columbia River systems. Maximum-likelihood analysis accompanied by bootstrapping provided strong support for these two genetic groups of O. nerka; the populations did not cluster by migratory form, but genetic affinities were organized more strongly by geographic proximity. The two major genetic groups resolved in our study probably stem from historical isolation and dispersal of O. nerka from two major Wisconsinan glacial refugia in the North Pacific.

Selective sorting, either of individual organisms or of whole species is an obvious mechanism for such active trends. Sorting of individuals should result in a disproportionate number of ancestor to descendant transitions being in the same direction as the trend, whereas sorting of species should result in species with particular morphologies more daughter species. Sorting of species can occur over long periods of time or it can be concentrated over a particular interval, such as an extinction event. Constraints on morphologic evolution also can drive trends, especially in cases where it is easier to produce a particular morphology than it is to change it. Finally, active trends can be artifacts of unrelated differential diversification within a clade (i.e., species hitchhiking), which might result from sorting of species based on phylogenetically associated characters or simply by chance. Unlike other active trends, trends attributable to species hitchhiking do not support hypotheses about selection or evolutionary constraints. From the latest Cambrian through the Silurian, gastropods show significant increases in the proportion of species with high shell torques (≤ high spire height), inclined apertures, and narrow sinuses. Ancestor-descendant contrasts indicate a significant bias towards daughter species with narrower sinuses than their ancestors. This is not true for shell torque or apertural inclination. However, species with high shell torques appear constrained to produce daughter species with high shell torques. Analogous constraints do not exist for sinus width or apertural inclination. To separate the predictions of species hitchhiking from those of differential speciation and differential extinction, a bootstrapping procedure was used to simulate the range of trends phylogenetic effects alone could generate. The simulations indicate that the trend towards species with strongly inclined apertures is indistinguishable from a phylogenetic effect. However, the simulations indicate that differential clade evolution affected the evolution of both shell torque and sinus width. The deviation between observed and expected distributions are sudden and coincide with extinction events species with low shell torques were significantly less likely to survive the Llandeilo/Caradoc (Middle Ordovician) turnover and species with wide sinuses were significantly less likely to survive the end-Ordovician mass extinction. However, there is not a significant association between diversification and morphology for any of the characters studied here.

In the competitive phase, we examined 10 mixed-species communities and 10 pairs of single- species populations. We replicated each community 15 times to provide an assessment of the distribution of competitive outcome. Statistical analysis demonstrates the lineages within the treatments became highly differentiated for all measures of competitive outcome: the outcome of competition (which species won), time to extinction of one of the competing species, and census history. The fraction of the variance that is among lineages has been referred to as the group or community hertiability.

However, recent experimental work has shown that much of the phenotypic variance in hatchling reptiles is induced by nongenetic factors, such as material nutrition and thermoregulation, and the physical conditions experienced during embryogenesis. Thus, there is no unambiguous evidence for strictly genetic (intraspecific) influences on the phenotypes of hatchling reptiles. We report results from a technique that uses a genetic marker trait and DNA fingerprinting to determine paternity of offspring from multiply sired clutches of European sand lizards, Lacerta agilis. By focusing on paternal rather than maternal effects, we show that hatchling genotypes exert a direct influence on the duration of incubation, the size (mass, snout-vent length) and shape (relative tail length) of the hatchling, and subsequent growth rates of the lizard during the first 3 mo of life. Embryos with genes that code for a few days' delay in hatching are thereby larger when they hatch, having undergone further differentiation (and hence, have changed in bodily proportions), and are able to grow faster after hatching.

Because our estimate of heritability is derived from free-ranging lizards, it is useful for predicting evolutionary response to selection in wild populations. Moreover, our estimate for the heritability of egg size is not likely to be confounded by nongenetic maternal effects that might arise form egg size per se because we estimate a significant parent-offspring correlation for egg size in the face of dramatic experimental manipulation of yolk volume of the egg. Furthermore, we also demonstrate a significant correlation between egg size of the female parent and clutch size of her offspring. Because this correlation is not related to experimentally induced maternal effects, we suggest that it is indicative of a genetic correlation between egg size and clutch size. We synthesize our results from genetic analyses of the trade-off between egg size and clutch size with previously published experiments that document the mechanistic basic of this trade- off. Experimental manipulation of yolk volume has no effect on offspring reproductive traits such as egg size, clutch size, size at maturity, or oviposition date. However, egg size was related to offspring survival during adult phases of the life history. We partitioned survival of off- spring during the adult phase of the life history into (1) survival of off-spring from winter emergence to the production of the first clutch (i.e, the vitellogenic phase of the first clutch), and (2) survival of the offspring from the production of the first clutch to the end of the reproductive season. Offspring from the first clutch of the reproductive season in the previous year had higher survival during vitellogenesis of their first clutch if these offspring came from small eggs. We did not observed selection during these prelaying phases of adulthood for offspring from later clutches. However, we did find that later clutch offspring large eggs had the highest survival over the first season of reproduction. The differences in selection on adult survival arising from maternal effects would reinforce previously documented selection that favors the production of small offspring early in the season and large offspring later in the season-a season shift in maternal provisioning. We also report on a significant parent-offspring correlation in lay date and thus significant heritable variation in lay date. We can rule out the possibility of yolk volume as a confounding maternal effect-experimental manipulation of yolk volume has no effect on lay date of offspring. However, we cannot distinguish between genetic effects (i.e., heritable) and nongenetic maternal effects acting on lay date that arise from the maternal trait lay date per se (or other unidentified maternal traits). Nevertheless, we demonstrate how timing of female reproduction (e.i., date of oviposition and date of hatching) affect reproductive attributes of offspring.

In addition, selection was also experimentally assessed in free- ranging female side blotched lizards by (1) surgically decreasing total clutch mass (direct ovarian manipulation) and enhancing clutch mass using (2) exogenous gonadotropin, and (3) exogenous corticosterone. Surgical reduction of clutch mass uniformly enhanced survival. However, increasing clutch mass had more complex effects depending on year. Experimentally enhanced clutch mass enhanced survival in 1991, had no effect on survival in 1992, and decreased survival in 1993. Despite the complexity of these experimental results, they are corroborated by our comparative data. It is important to note that local environmental effects can obscure detection of costs arising from natural variation in reproductive effort, and we removed such effects using path analysis. The striking shift in natural selection favoring females laying a large clutch mass (1991) to selection against females laying a large clutch mass (1993) is associated with an end of a severe multiyear drought. Our natural-history observations suggest that the correlated increase in predatory snake activity on our study site, coincident with the end of the drought, is the agent of natural selection. Although the actual agents of selection (e.g., snake predation versus drought-related effects) are not resolved, the patterns of natural selection measured in our comparative and experimental data are also consistent with year-to-year changes in clutch mass and egg size that would be indicative of rapid short-term evolution in these traits.",158,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Corticosterone | costs of reproduction | gonadotropin | natural selection | ovarian manipulation | trade-offs,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,167,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb02370.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

These findings demonstrate that, through androgenesis, offspring of parthenogenetic hybrid females can contribute specimens of both sexes to the fathering species when fertilized by syntopic ancestral males and the parthenogenetic egg of strictly clonal females, when fertilized, allows a third genome to be added to the allodiploid chromosome set.

Two experimental lines of flies were selected for a shorter LDT (measured from egg laying to pupation). After 15 generations LDT was reduced by an average of 7.9%. The response appeared to be controlled primarily by autosomal loci. A correlated response to the selection was a reduction in adult dry weight: individuals from the selected populations were on average 15.1% lighter than the controls. The lighter females of the selected lines showed a 35% drop in fecundity, but no change in longevity. Thus, there is no direct relationship between LDT and adult longevity. The genetic correlation between weight and LDT, as measured from their joint response to selection, was 0.86. Although there was weak evidence for dominance in LDT, there was none for weight, making it unlikely that selection acting on this antagonistic pleiotropy could lead to a stable polymorphism. In all lines, sex differences in weight violated expectations based on intrasex genetic correlations: Females, being larger than males, ought to require a longer LDT, whereas there was a slight trend in the opposite direction. Because the sexual dimorphism in size was not significantly altered by selection, it appears that the controlling loci are either invariant or have very limited pleiotropic effect on developmental time.

Lines selected for fast development achieve a higher capacity for increase (r(c)) than lines selected for slow development, independently of larval density. These results imply that tradeoffs due to underlying antagonistic pleiotropy affecting growth, development, survivorship, and reproduction are not necessary constraints to life-history evolution. Previous work with W. smithii has shown a positive genetic correlation between development time and a general, genetically coordinated diapause syndrome. We propose that the observed nontradeoffs among the components of r(c) may be subsumed into an even more fundamental tradeoff between performance during the summer generations and synchronization of development and reproduction with the changing seasons.

This change in reproductive allocation and larval form is often accompanied by dramatic changes in development. Little is known of this tranformation because the intermediate form (a facultatively feeding larva) is rare. Knowledge of facultatively feeding larvae may help explain the conditions under which nonfeeding larvae evolve. Two hypotheses concerning the evolutionary loss of larval feeding are as follows: (1) large eggs evolve before modifications in larval development, and (2) the intermediate form (facultatively feeding larva) is evolutionary short-lived. I show that larvae of a heart urchin, Brisaster latifrons, are capable of feeding but do not require food to complete larval development. Food for larvae appears to have little effect on larval growth and development. The development, form, and suspension feeding mechanism of these larvae are similar to those of obligate-feeding larvae of other echinoids. Feeding rates of Brisaster larvae are similar to cooccurring, obligate-feeding echinoid larvae but are low relative to the large size of Brisaster larvae. The comparison shows that in Brisaster large egg size, independence from larval food, and relatively low feeding rate have evolved before the heterochronies and modified developmental mechanisms common in nonfeeding echinoid larvae. If it is general, the result suggests that hypotheses concerning the origin of nonfeeding larval development should be based on ecological factors that affect natural selection for large eggs, rather than on the evolution of heterochronies and developmental novelties in particular clades.

Fitness is measured by the product of survival to the adult stage and expected adult reproduction, which is usually an increasing function of size at maturity. Size is determined by both age at maturity and the value of costly traits that increase mean growth rate (growth effort). The analysis includes cases with fixed size but flexible time to maturity, fixed time but flexible size, and adaptively flexible values of both variables. In these analyses, growth effort is flexible. For comparison with previous theory, models with a fixed growth effort are analyzed. In each case, there may be indirect effects of predation on the prey's food supply. The effect of increased predation depends on (1) which variables are flexible; (2) whether increased growth effort requires increased exposure to predators; and (3) how increased predator density affects the abundance of food for juvenile prey. If there is no indirect effect of predators on prey food supply, size at maturity will generally decrease in response to increased predation. However, the indirect effect from increased food has the opposite effect, and the net result of predation is often increased size. Age at maturity may either increase or decrease, depending on functional forms and parameter values; this is true regardless of the presence of indirect effects.

Estimating of the actual variance of relatedness is required for heritability, but not for genetic correlations. The approach is then extended to include isolation by distance of environments, dominance, and shared levels of inbreeding. Investigations of statistical properties show that good estimates do not require great marker polymorphism, but rather significant variation of actual relatedness; optimal allocation generally favors sampling many individuals at the expense of assaying fewer marker loci; when relatedness declines with physical distance, it is optimal to restrict comparisons to within a certain distance, the power to estimate shared environments and inbreeding effects is reasonable, is reasonable, but estimates of dominance variance may be difficult under certain patterns of relationship; and any linkage of markers to quantitative trait loci does not cause significant problems.

Migration should be neither too strong not too weak relative to selection. The higher peak should be sufficiently dominant over the lower peak. Recombination can greatly reduce the plausibility of this phase or completely preclude peak shifts.

This paper summarizes the results from both areas and compares their implications. In evolutionary computer science it was found that the Darwinian process of mutation, recombination and selection is not universally effective in improving complex systems like computer programs or chip designs. For adaptation to occur, these systems must possess 'evolvability,' i.e., the ability of random variations to sometimes produce improvement. It was found that evolvability critically depends on the way genetic variation maps onto phenotypic variation, an issue known as the representation problem. The genotype-phenotype map determines the variability of characters, which is the propensity to vary. Variability needs to be distinguished from variations, which are the actually realized differences between individuals. The genotype-phenotype map is the common theme underlying such varied biological phenomena as genetic canalization, developmental constraints, biological versatility, developmental dissociability, and morphological integration. For evolutionary biology the representation problem has important implications: how is it that extant species acquired a genotype-phenotype map which allows improvement by mutation and selection? Is the genotype-phenotype map able to change in evolution'? What are the selective forces, if any, that shape the genotype- phenotype map? We propose that the genotype-phenotype map can evolve by two main routes, epistatic mutations, or the creation of new genes. A common result for organismic design is modularity. By modularity we mean a genotype-phenotype map in which there are few pleiotropic effects among characters serving different functions, with pleiotropic effects falling mainly among characters that are part of a single functional complex. Such a design is expected to improve evolvability by limiting the interference between the adaptation of different functions. Several population genetic models are reviewed that are intended to explain the evolutionary origin of a modular design.

This raises the possibility that the systems of epigenetic interactions may compensate or 'buffer' some of the changes that occur as mutations on its lower levels, and thus stabilize the phenotype with respect to mutations. This hypothetical phenomenon will be called 'epigenetic stability'. Its potential importance stems from the fact that phenotypic variation with a genetic basis is an essential prerequisite for evolution. Thus, variation in epigenetic stability might profoundly affect attainable rates of evolutions. While representing a systematic property of developmental system, epigenetic might itself be genetically determined and thus be subject to evolutionary change. Whether or not this is the case should ideally be answered directly, that is, by experimentation. The time scale involved and our insufficient quantitative understanding of developmental pathways will probably preclude such as approach in the foreseeable future. Preliminary answers are sought here by using a biochemically motivated model of a small but central part of a developmental pathway. Modeled are sets of patterns. Such gene-expression patterns, crucially involved in determining developmental pattern formation events, are more likely subject to strong stabilizing natural selection. After long periods of stabilizing selection, the fraction of mutations causing in gene- expression patterns is substantially reduced in the model. Epigenetic stability has increased. This phenomenon is found for widely varying regulatory scenarios among transcription factor genes. It is discussed that only epistatic (nonlinear) gene interaction can cause such change in epigenetic stability.

To investigate such costs, 27 half-sib families of Silene alba, collected from a single host population, were grown in experimental populations in the presence and absence of the anther-smut fungus Ustilago violacea, a host-sterilizing pathogen transmitted by insects that are both pollinators and vectors of the disease. Host families significantly in resistance to inoculation, indicating the presence of genetic variation for mechanisms that impede fungal growth once the disease is encountered ('biochemical' resistance) within the host population. In addition, host families differed significantly in onset of flowering and in flower production in the absence of the disease. Path analysis revealed that late onset of flowering in male host families made a direct contribution to high resistance (P < .0.1), probably due to a reduced rate of contact between hosts and vectors varying high spore loads (avoidance, or 'phenological' resistance). The contribution of low production to field resistance only approached significance (P<0.10). There was a significantly positive genetic association between biochemical and phenological resistance, suggesting that delayed flowering is either a pleiotropic effect of biochemical resistance, or that genes governing these traits are in linkage disequilibrium. Path analysis revealed that biochemical resistance and both a direct contribution to field resistance (P < 0.01) and a positive indirect contribution via its association with phenology and flower production (P < 0.05) in male hosts. Costs of resistance were sex specific. Male host families with high field resistance had significantly lower reproductive success in healthy populations, indicating a fitness cost of field resistance (P < 0.01), whereas no costs were detected for female hosts. Path analysis revealed that the biochemical component of field resistance made to direct contribution to the observed fitness cost in male hosts, whereas its indirect effect through phenology was only marginally significant (P < 0.10). This finding indicates fitness costs were mainly due to the phenological component of field resistance. Because the host population had no known history of disease, it is not clear whether the fitness costs are responsible for maintenance of the resistance polymorphism or whether the polymorphism is present for reasons unrelated to pathogens. Interactions between host families and pathogen strains with respect to inoculation success were not significant. Hence, there was no evidence for indirect costs of biochemical resistance, that is, reduced resistance to alternative strains. Infection rates in experimental populations with an initially patchy distribution of the pathogen were lower than in populations with a uniform pathogen distribution, suggesting that the effective pathogen pressure and hence the relative success of susceptible and resistant individuals may, in addition to fitness costs of resistance, depend on the spatial populations structure of the pathogen.",86,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Costs of resistance | genetic polymorphism | host phenology | male reproductive success | plant-pathogen interactions | Silene latifolia,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,193,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb02350.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Sweden, was used to investigate whether individuals avoid mating with close kin (i.e., parents or sibs). Only one case of close inbreeding (0.5% of all pairs) was observed during the years of study. The observed frequency of close inbreeding was compared to expected frequencies based on two different null models. Assuming no inbreeding avoidance behaviors (e.g., dispersal or kin recognition), but taking into account the fact that mortality, and different arrival and pairing times of individuals reduce the probability of mating with close kin, the expected frequency of close inbreeding is 10% and 15% for female and male recruits (i.e., born in the study plot), respectively. However, assuming mating to be random within the study plot reduced the expected frequency of close inbreeding to 1% or less for both males and females. Consequently, conclusions drawn concerning inbreeding avoidance depend on the null model used. Contrasting estimated costs of tolerating close inbreeding with those of avoiding it (by dispersal to other plots), however, suggests that the costs of avoiding close inbreeding are substantially greater than those of tolerating it. Therefore, although inbreeding avoidance cannot be rejected as a cause of dispersal of this species, it is not the primary cause, and particularly not for sex-biased dispersal. The general problems of investigating inbreeding avoidance are discussed. It is argued that all previous null models based on random mating in finite populations produce expected frequencies of close inbreeding that in fact include inbreeding avoidance, since they implicitly assume random dispersal within a finite population. Thus, comparisons between observed and expected frequencies of close inbreeding based on random mating are inadequate. The most promising method of investigating inbreeding avoidance is to experimentally study individual movements and mating preferences in the presence and absence of close kin.",35,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Cost of dispersal | dispersal | Ficedula albicollis | frequency of inbreeding | inbreeding avoidance | null models | random mating,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,194,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03934.x,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, sexual selection favoring large males is common even in taxa where females are the larger sex, and is therefore not a sufficient explanation of patterns of SSD. As part of a more extensive study of the evolution of SSD in water striders (Heteroptera, Gerridae), we examine patterns of sexual selection and SSD in 12 populations of Aquarius remigis. We calculate univariate and multivariate selection gradients from samples of mating and single males, for two sexually dimorphic traits (total length and profemoral width) and two sexually monomorphic traits (mesofemoral length and wing form). The multivariate analyses reveal strong selection favoring larger males, in spite of the female-biased SSD for this trait, and weaker selection favoring aptery and reduced mesofemoral length. Selection is weakest on the most dimorphic trait, profemoral width, and is stabilizing rather than directional. The pattern of sexual selection on morphological traits is therefore not concordant with the pattern of SSD. The univariate selection gradients reveal little net selection (direct + indirect) on any of the traits, and suggest that evolution away from the plesiomorphic pattern of SSD is constrained by antagonistic patterns of selection acting on this suite of positively correlated morphological traits. We hypothesize that SSD in A. remigis is not in equilibrium, a hypothesis that is consistent with both theoretical models of the evolution of SSD and our previous studies of allometry for SSD. A negative interpopulation correlation between the intensity of sexual selection and the operational sex ratio supports the hypothesis that, as in several other water strider species, sexual selection in A. remigis occurs through generalized female reluctance rather than active female choice.

In this study, we show how models of microevolutionary change can be translated into the resulting macroevolutionary patterns. We illustrate how the structure of phenotypic covariances expected in interspecific measurements can be derived, and how this structure depends on the microevolutionary forces guiding phenotypic change at each generation. We then explore the covariance structure expected from several simple microevolutionary models of phenotypic evolution, including various combinations of random genetic drift, directional selection, stabilizing selection, and environmental change, as well as models of punctuated or burst-like evolution. We find that stabilizing selection leads to patterns of exponential decrease of between species covariance with phylogenetic distance. This is different from the usual linear patterns of decrease assumed in most comparative and systematic methods. Nevertheless, linear patterns of decrease can result from many processes in addition to random genetic drift, such as directional and fluctuating selection as well as modes of punctuated change.

The molecular phylogeny was used to evaluate hypotheses concerning the evolution of reproductive characters associated with the breeding system.

Self-incompatibility is restricted to some but not all tristylous species. In Eichhornia and Pontederia, predominantly selfing species with small monomorphic flowers (homostyly) have been hypothesized to result from the multiple breakdown of tristyly. Restriction-site variation provided a well supported phylogeny of ingroup taxa, enabling the mapping of reproductive char acters onto trees. Two contrasting optimization schemes were assessed, differing in the relative weights assigned to shifts in character states. The reconstructed sequence of floral character state change was used to assess competing hypotheses concerning the origin and breakdown of tristyly, and the relationships between tristylous and enantiostylous syndromes. Our results indicate that the class of optimization scheme used was the most critical factor in reconstructing character evolution. Despite some topological uncertainties and difficulty in reconstructing the primitive floral form in the family, several broad conclusions were possible when an unordered, unequally-weighted optimization scheme was used: (1) tristyly originated either once or twice, while the occurrence of enantiostyly in Monochoria and Heterathera was always found to have independent origins; (2) tristyly has repeatedly broken down leading to selling, homostylous taxa; and (3) self-incompatibility probably arose after the origin of floral trimorphism, a sequence of events that conflicts with some evolutionary models.",105,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Breeding system | Eichhornia | enantiostyly | optimization scheme | phylogeny | Pontederiaceae | self-fertilization | tristyly,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,197,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03919.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

The study included two clades (phylogenetic lineages) in which small-flowered, homostylous populations or species are believed to have evolved from large flowered, heterostylous, self-compatible ones. In one lineage the small-flowered species is tetraploid with disomic inheritance. Rates of self-fertilization were 25% to 55% in the four large-flowered, heterostylous populations; 72% in a large flowered but homostylous population; and greater than 99.5% in the four small-flowered, homostylous populations, which produce seed autonomously. When present, inbreeding depression occurred in the fertility but not the survival components of fitness. Using a cumulative fitness measure incorporating both survival and fertility (flower number), we found inbreeding depression to be lower in the four very highly self-fertilizing populations than in the five intermediate ones. The Spearman rank correlation between inbreeding depression and selling rate for the nine populations was -0.50, but was not statistically significant (P = 0.12). Inbreeding depression was greater in the two tetraploid populations than in the very highly self-fertilizing, diploid ones. Phenotypic stability of progeny from self-fertilization tended to be higher in populations with lower inbreeding depression. We conclude that levels of self-fertilization and inbreeding depression in Amsinckia are determined more by other factors than by each other. Estimates of mutation rates and dominance coefficients of deleterious alleles, obtained from a companion study of the four highly self-fertilizing populations, suggest that a strong relationship may not be expected.

The plant sexual polymorphism tristyly provides an opportunity to investigate genetic drift because stochastic processes interacting with frequency-dependent selection give rise to a diagnostic pattern of morph-frequency variation. A previous study of 102 Ontario populations of the introduced tristylous wetland herb Lythrum salicaria provided evidence for the role of stochastic processes during colonization. However, whether stochastic effects are greater in these recently introduced populations compared to native Eurasian populations remains unclear. The propensity of this species to invade disturbed habitats suggests that episodes of colonization and periods of small population size must also occur in the native range. A survey of 102 populations in southwestern France indicated reduced stochastic effects in native populations. Populations exhibited significantly lower morph loss than in Ontario (5% vs. 23%) and significantly higher values of morph evenness. The greater incidence of trimorphism in French populations was not associated with larger population sizes; populations were significantly smaller than those in Ontario (means: 266 vs. 487). Morph evenness was positively correlated with population size among French but not Ontario populations, providing further evidence of nonequilibrium conditions in introduced compared to native populations. The incidence of trimorphism was unexpectedly high in small native populations (N ≤ 25; 22 of 27 populations trimorphic). Computer simulations indicated that levels of gene flow on the order of m ≤ 0.05 can account for the maintenance of tristyly in small populations.

The estimates of genetic parameters were combined with phenotypic selection gradients to predict evolutionary responses to selection mediated by the hummingbird pollinators.

Differential mortality as a mechanism for natural selection,Reznick D.N.,Evolution,00143820,50,4,1651-1660,1996-01-01,August 1996,"We have previously reported a correlation between the life history patterns of guppies and the types of predators with which they coexist. Guppies from localities with an abundance of large predators (high predation localities) mature at an earlier age and devote more resources to reproduction than those found in localities with only a single, small species of predator (low predation localities). We also found that when guppies were introduced from a high to low predation locality, the guppy life history evolved to resemble what was normally found in this low predation locality. The presumed mechanism of natural selection is differences among localities in age/size-specific mortality (the age/size-specific mortality hypothesis); in high predation localities we assumed that guppies experienced high adult mortality rates while in the low predation localities we assumed that guppies experienced high juvenile mortality rates. These assumptions were based on stomach content analyses of wild-caught predators and on laboratory experiments. Here, we evaluate these assumptions by directly estimating the mortality rates of guppies in natural populations. We found that guppies from high predation localities experience significantly higher mortality rates than their counterparts from low predation localities, but that these higher mortality rates are uniformly distributed across all size classes, rather than being concentrated in the larger size classes. This result appears to contradict the predictions of the age/size-specific predation hypothesis. However, we argue, using additional data on growth rates and the probabilities of survival to maturity in each type of locality, that the age specific mortality hypothesis remains plausible. This is because the probability of survival to first reproduction is very similar in each type of locality, but the guppies from high predation localities have a much lower probability of survival per unit time after maturity. We also argue for the plausibility of two other mechanisms of natural selection. These results thus reveal mortality patterns that provide a potential cause of natural selection, but expand, rather than narrow, the number of possible mechanisms responsible for life-history evolution in guppies.",337,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Adaptation | life-history evolution | mark- recapture | mortality | selection | size-selective predation,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,203,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03937.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

This heterogeneity among individuals in the history of inbreeding can greatly complicate the interpretation of measures of quantitative genetic variability when the traits studied exhibit inbreeding depression. Partial inbreeding can also bias measures of phenotypic selection toward the detection of strong directional and stabilizing selection. In this paper, data are presented from several inbreeding experiments conducted on two partially selfing, annual populations of the monkeyflower Mimulus guttatus thai show that the means of many of the morphological and phenological traits measured were affected by inbreeding. These findings imply that estimates of heritabilities and additive genetic covariances would not reflect the potential for these populations to respond to selection. Phenotypic selection analyses conducted on naturally occurring plants, involving linear regressions of relative seed production on the traits, revealed significant directional selection on many of the same quantitative traits measured in the inbreeding studies. However when the same selection analyses were performed on plants with known histories of inbreeding, part of the statistical relationship between relative seed number and the traits was found to be due to the mating system: inbred individuals had both lower seed production and different mean values for the traits than outcrossed individuals. It is also shown, with a hypothetical example, that partial inbreeding can bias measures of stabilizing selection toward the detection of strong stabilizing selection. Partial inbreeding therefore tends to make directional and stabilizing selection appear stronger than it is, and it may be that natural selection in the wild is actually weaker than many studies of partially inbred species suggest.",67,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Inbreeding | inbreeding depression | Mimulus | natural selection | quantitative genetics | self-fertilization,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,205,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03923.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Specifically, the effect of flea beetle damage on B. rapa fitness depends on the amount of diamondback moth damage a plant experiences: damage by these herbivores has a nonadditive effect on plant fitness. When diamondbacks are abundant, plants that sustain high levels of damage by flea beetles are favored by natural selection, but when diamondbacks are rare, a low level of damage by flea beetles is favored. However, resistance to the later-feeding diamondback moth is not affected by the presence or absence of damage by early feeding flea beetles.

Within species groups, genetic distances between cis-Andean (east of the Andes) and trans-Andean (west of the Andes) taxa are, on average, roughly twice that between Choco and Central American taxa. The genetic data are consistent with the hypotheses that the divergence of most cis-Andean and trans-Andean taxa was the result of either the Andean uplift fragmenting a once continuous Amazonian-Pacific population (Andean Uplift Hypothesis), the isolation of the two faunas in forest refugia on opposite sides of the Andes during arid climates (Forest Refugia Hypothesis), or dispersal of Amazonian forms directly across the Andes into the trans-Andean region (Across-Andes Dispersal Hypothesis). Disentangling these hypotheses is difficult due to the complexity of the Andean uplift and to the scant geologic and paleoclimatic information that elucidates diversification events in northwestern South America. Regarding the divergence of cis- and trans-Andean taxa, the genetic, geologic, and paleoclimatic data allow weak rejection of the Andean Uplift Hypothesis and weak support for the Forest Refugia and Andean Dispersal Hypotheses. The subsequent diversification of Choco and Central American taxa was the result of Pleistocene forest refugia, marine transgressions, or parapatric speciation.",111,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Andes | area of endemism | Aves | Choco | historical biogeography | Pleistocene refugia | protein electrophoresis | systematics | vicariance,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,209,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03933.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

When paired with C. slossonae males, C. quadripunctata females from populations that are sympatric with C. slossonae (i.e. from New York and Florida) had lower incidences of fertile oviposition than those from allopatric populations (i.e. from Kansas and California, Chrysopa quadripunctata females in all interspecific pairings were inseminated, but absence of fertile oviposition was associated with the lack of sperm transfer from the bursa copulatrix to the spermatheca. The C. quadripunctata females thai failed to lay fertile eggs when crossed with C. slossonae males, invariably produced viable C. quadripunctata offspring (no hybrids) within one day after the heterospecific male was replaced with a conspecific one. Thus, the barrier to hybridization may involve the ability of females to (a) distinguish between heterospecific and conspecific sperm and (b) allow the transfer of only conspecific sperm to the spermatheca. When C. slossonae females were paired with C. quadripunctata males, the incidences of fertile oviposition were high and there was no apparent geographic variation in the degree of hybridization. As with C. qudripunctata females, unsuccessful hybridization of C. slossonae females was associated with retention of sperm in the bursa copulatrix. Hybrids did not differ from intraspecific offspring in their viability or sex ratios. However, hybrids whose parents originated from sympatric populations had low fertility; thus hybrid infertility may constitute an additional barrier to hybridization. The patterns of inter- and intraspecific variation in hybridization are consistent with the notions that C. qudripunctata harbors variation in the mechanism that controls sperm movement to the spermatheca and that the evolution of reproductive isolation between C. quadripunctata and C. slossonae may include natural selection for increased expression of this mechanism.",20,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Chrysopidae | gametic barrier | hybridization | Insecta | reproductive isolation | sperm transfer,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,210,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03932.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Corella inflata has internal fertilization and embryonic development, while C. willmeriana has external fertilization and embryonic development.

In this paper, I review the pattern of variation among four combinations of traits: life history x life history (L x L), morphological x morphological (M x M), life history x morphological (L x M), and behavioral x behavioral (B x B). A few other combinations were investigated, but insufficient data were obtained for separate analysis. A total of 1798 correlations, distributed over 51 different animal and plant species, were analyzed. The analysis was conducted at two levels: first by dividing the data set solely by trait combination, and second by blocking the data by trait combination and species. Because selection will tend to fix alleles that show positive correlations with illness traits faster than those that are negative and because the latter are expected to arise more frequently by mutation, correlations between life- history traits are predicted to be more often negative than those between morphological traits. This prediction was supported, with the ranking in decreasing proportion of negative correlations being: L x L > L x M > B x B > M x M. The mean magnitude of the genetic correlation shows little variation among morphological and life-history combinations, and the distribution of values is remarkably flat. However, the estimated standard errors and the coefficient of variation (SE/r(G)) are large, making it difficult to separate biological factors influencing the pattern of dispersion from experimental error.

Sex differences in choosiness are not easily explained, however. The lower-caring sex (often males) has both higher costs of choice, because it is more difficult to find replacement mates, and higher direct benefits, because the sex providing more care (usually females) is likely to exhibit more variation in the quality of contributions to the young. Because both the costs and direct benefits of mate choice increase with increasing parental care by the opposite sex, general predictions about sex difference in choosiness are difficult. Furthermore, the level of choosiness of one sex will be influenced by the choosiness of the other. Here, we present an ESS model of mutual mate choice, which explicitly incorporates differences between males and females in life history traits that determine the costs and benefits of choice, and we illustrate our results with data from species with contrasting forms of parental care. The model demonstrates that sex differences in costs of choice are likely to have a much stronger effect on choosiness than are differences in quality variation, so that the less competitive sex will commonly be more choosy.

Pleiotropic fitness trade-offs occur when genetic resistance causes reduction in other components of illness. Although costs of resistance have an important influence on plant-pathogen interactions, few previous studies have detected pleiotropic costs of resistance in the absence of confounding effects of linkage disequilibrium. To avoid this potential problem, we performed artificial selection experiments on resistance to two fungal pathogens, Leptosphaeria maculans, and Peronospora parasitica, and compared growth rates of resistant and susceptible genotypes of Brassica rapa in the absence of pathogens. Leptosphaeria resistance had no effect on growth rate, indicating cost free defense. In contrast, Peronospora-resistant genotypes grow 6% slower than Peronospora-susceptible genotypes in pathogen-free environments, indicating a significant genetic fitness cost to Peronospora resistance. Such genetic trade-offs could maintain genetic variation in the wild.

When divergence between populations is caused by genetic drift, we show that the time to speciation is independent of population subdivision: speciation occurs just as quickly in a species split into a few large populations as into many small populations.

Genetic correlations between age and size at first reproduction were always greater than +0.8 within and among all populations studied. Although quantitative genetics might provide insight about genetic constraints if genetic parameters remain approximately constant, little evidence has been available to determine the constancy of genetic correlations. I found strong and consistent estimates of genetic correlations between life-history components, which were very similar within four natural populations. Population differentiation also showed these same trade-offs, resulting from long-term genetic constraint. For some traits, evolutionary changes among populations were incompatible with a model of genetic drift. Historical patterns of natural selection were inferred from population differentiation, suggesting that correlated response to selection has caused some traits to evolve opposite to the direct forces of natural selection.

We considered whether this second form of competition might occur among pollen grains of wild radish in two experiments. In the first, interference likely occurred because the amount of pollen germination was less in mixed-donor than in single-donor pollinations. This result was duplicated in a second experiment, which also showed that interference occurred only when pollen grains from different donors were in direct contact with each other.

However, little theoretical work has considered the evolution of virulence for parasites with mixed horizontal plus vertical transmission. Many human, animal, and plant parasites are transmitted both vertically and horizontally, and some horizontal transmission is generally necessary to maintain parasites at all. We present a population-dynamical model for the evolution of virulence when both vertical and horizontal transmission are present. In the simplest such model, up to two infectious strains can coexist within one host population. Virulent, vertically transmitted pathogens can persist in a population when they provide protection against more virulent, horizontally transmitted strains. When virulence is maintained by a correlation with horizontal transmission rates, increased levels of vertical transmission always lower the evolutionarily stable (ESS) level of virulence. Contrary to existing theory, however, increases in opportunities for horizontal transmission also lower the ESS level of virulence. We explain these findings in light of earlier work and confirm them in simulations including imperfect vertical transmission. We describe further simulations, in which both vertical and horizontal transmission rates are allowed to evolve. The outcome of these simulations depends on whether high levels of vertical transmission are possible with low virulence.

In a population from the northern foothills of the Pyrenees in southwestern France, a combined demographic and genetic investigation enabled the study not only of spatial genetic structure of the population, but also of the history of the population's spatial genetic structure over time. Excavation of all individuals allowed identification of clonemates. Age of each individual was determined by counting annual growth rings in the taproot, a method tested with individuals of known age planted in experimental gardens. Each individual was mapped, and genotypes of all individuals were determined using allozyme markers for a number of polymorphic loci. Distribution patterns and spatial genetic structure, both for all individuals and for different age classes, were analyzed using spatial autocorrelation statistics (Geary's Index, Moran's Index). Patterns of gene flow within the population were also studied using F-statistics and tests for random associations of alleles. Because age, allele frequencies, and location were known for each individual, it was possible to study how spatial genetic structure changed over time. Results from all these diverse approaches are consistent with one another, and clearly show the following: (1) founder effects, with the study transect being first colonized by individuals at either end of the transect that were homozygous for different alleles at one marker locus; (2) a difference in spatial distribution of individuals originated from sexual reproduction (seedlings) and from clonal growth (connected individuals): (3) restricted gene flow, due to inbreeding among related, clumped individuals; and (4) increase in heterozygote deficit within the youngest cohort of individuals. The results indicate that genetic differentiation in time was much less marked than differentiation in space. Nevertheless, the results revealed that the studied population is experiencing demographic and genetic variation in time, suggesting that it is not at equilibrium.

Congruent phylogeographic patterns in codistributed species indicate historical association of the taxa being compared, and the uniform action of biogeographic events in shaping genetic variation. We sought to evaluate the congruence of patterns of genetic variation of five closely related fish species across a well-defined biogeographic boundary. We gathered allozymic and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence data for five species of darters (Percidae: Etheostomatini) from populations distributed among biogeographic regions in the Ozark and Ouachita highlands of the south-central United States. Comparisons among species revealed noncongruence in the magnitude of genetic divergence in both allozymes and mtDNA sequences. We hypothesized that noncongruence resulted, in part, from differences in life histories of the species in our comparison. To address this hypothesis, we evaluated the association between gene flow (measured by N(e)m) and variation in body size and fecundity variables because they have been shown to influence gene flow in fishes. Correlation analysis revealed an association between gene flow and fecundity (r = 0.88), but not with body size (r = 0.36) or reproductive investment per individual (r = -0.23). The result was similar when independent contrasts of the original variables were used in correlation analyses. Phylogeographic analysis of mtDNA sequence data indicated the importance of history, evident in gene trees of Percina nasuta and Percina phoxocephala.

Long- and short-tailed birds also differ in the conformation of main tail feathers making up the flight surface: frond shaped in Archaeopteryx and fan shaped in extant fliers. Mechanisms of tail fanning were evaluated by electromyography in freely flying pigeons and turkeys and by electrical stimulation of caudal muscles in anesthetized birds. Results from these experiments reveal that the pygostyle, rectrices, rectricial bulbs, and bulbi rectricium musculature form a specialized farming mechanism. Contrary to previous models, our data support the interpretation that the bulbi rectricium independently controls tail fanning; other muscles are neither capable of nor necessary for significant rectricial abduction. This bulb mechanism permits rapid changes in tail span, thereby allowing the exploitation of a wide range of lift forces. Isolation of the bulbs on the pygostyle effectively decouples tail fanning from fan movement, which is governed by the remaining caudal muscles. The tail of Archaeopteryx, however, differs from this arrangement in several important respects. Archaeopteryx probably had a limited range of lift forces and tight coupling between vertebral and rectricial movement. This would have made the tail of this primitive flier better suited to stabilization than maneuverability. The capacity to significantly alter lift and manipulate the flight surface without distortion may have been two factors favoring tail shortening and pygostyle development during avian evolution.",78,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Archaeopteryx | avian evolution | bird tails | bulbi rectricium | flight | locomotion,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,224,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03590.x,NA,NA,NA,NA

The most striking result was an unexpectedly large decrease in egg hatching with increase in inbreeding (25% per 10% increase in inbreeding). Such a level of inbreeding depression has not been reported previously for any insect. The distribution of egg hatching rate for individual clutches within inbred lines was markedly skewed, with a large fraction of clutches producing no eggs at all. This is interpreted as a relatively lower ratio of detrimental to lethal (or sterile) mutation loads than is found in Drosophila, the only insects for which mutation loads have been well characterized. Possible explanations for this severe inbreeding depression include a relatively high rate of mutation to recessive alleles with substantial damaging effects and infrequent episodes of inbreeding in nature.

Selander (1972) argued that sexual selection favors larger males, while survival selection eventually stabilizes male size because larger males do not survive as well as smaller males during harsh winters. Searcy (1979a) proposed instead that sexual selection may be self limiting: male size might be stabilized not by over-winter mortality, but by breeding-season sexual selection that favors smaller males. Under conditions of energetic stress, smaller males should be able to display more and thus achieve higher reproductive success. Using feeders that provisioned males or females but not both, we produced conditions that mimicked the extremes of natural conditions. We found experimental support for the hypothesis that when food is abundant, sexual selection favors larger males. But even under conditions of severe energetic stress, smaller males did not gain larger harems, as the self-limiting hypothesis predicted. Larger males were more energetically stressed than smaller males, but in ways that affected their future reproductive output rather than their current reproductive performance. Stressed males that returned had smaller wings and tails than those that did not return: among returning stressed males, relative harem sizes were inversely related to wing and tail length.

Despite considerable interest in effects of postpollination processes on male fitness, little is known about the extent of variation in pollen performance among plants from natural populations. To examine this question in Hibiscus moscheutos (rose mallow), we conducted mixed-donor hand- pollination experiments with 39 pollen donors bearing distinctive isozyme markers. Pairs of competing donors were compared on sets of 11 to 15 recipient plants per pain. These donors often differed in the proportions of seeds they sired, with the maximum deviation from an expected ratio of 50:50 being 68:32.

In contrast, sexual selection on male body size appeared to operate among nonterritorial males at the clasping stage of the mating sequence, perhaps because larger males were better at clasping females forcibly.

Females chose the most actively drumming males as mating partners, but the body size of the males did not seem to be selected. Male drumming activity turned out to be a good predictor of male viability, whereas male viability was independent of male body mass. Our results suggest that by actively choosing mates according to male drumming performance, but independently of male body mass, females are preferring viable males as mates.

We studied a portion of this hybrid zone in northwestern Mississippi in detail by sampling ants at many sites along two transects extending across the zone and examining gene frequency and size distributions at a large number of genetic and morphological markers. The distributional patterns at these markers are most consistent with the mosaic hybrid zone model, whereby the distribution of various fire ant genotypes is determined initially by the historical patterns of colonization of newly available habitats. However, these distributional patterns probably do not reflect the equilibrium state of interactions because of the very recent secondary contact of the species (< 60 yr) and the dynamic nature of available nesting habitats in this area. Our data suggest that, with prolonged contact and interaction, differential fitness of various hybrid genotypes due to intrinsic and extrinsic selective factors is important in structuring the hybrid zone. For instance, consistent differential introgression of morphological and genetic markers, combined with previous evidence of differences in developmental stability among genotypes, suggest reduced fitness of hybrids relative to parentals due to intrinsic selection (as may be caused by breakup of parental gene complexes). Furthermore, marked reductions in the occurrence of parental like hybrids in areas where the similar parental species is common suggest reduced fitness of these parental- like hybrids in competition with the parentals (i.e., extrinsic selection).

Life-history traits (fecundity, growth, hatching rate, and survival of offspring) are compared under laboratory conditions between isolated (obligatory selling) and paired (outcrossing possible) snails in one population of B. straminea and B. globosus and two populations of B. truncatus. The genetic polymorphism of the same four populations is analyzed using electrophoretic markers in B. straminea and B. globosus and microsatellite markers in B. truncatus. In B. truncatus and B. straminea, isolated snails have a higher fecundity than paired snails, whereas the contrary is observed in B. globosus. For all populations, no difference in hatching rate and offspring survival is detected between the two treatments. Genetic analyses using microsatellite markers conducted in B. truncatus on progeny of paired snails reveal a high selfing rate in spite of high copulation rates, highlighting the difficulties of obtaining outcrossing in highly selfing snails.The high survival of selfed offspring in B. truncatus and B. straminea indicates that inbreeding depression is limited. The extent of inbreeding depression in B. globosus is less clear. Overall, fitness decrease in this species is limited to fecundity. The extent of allozyme polymorphism is very limited whereas a much higher variability is observed with microsatellites. Biomphalaria straminea and B. truncatus populations are also characterized by very low observed heterozygosities and large heterozygote deficiencies, whereas the B. globosus population does not exhibit such a deficiency. Overall these results allow the definition of a self fertilization syndrome in hermaphrodite freshwater snails: selfing populations (such as those of B. straminea and B. truncatus studied here) are characterized by high selfing rates in spite of copulations, limited deleterious effects of selfing, limited neutral genetic polymorphism, and large heterozygote deficiencies.",51,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Freshwater snails | genetic polymorphism | microsatellites | self- fertilization depression | selfing,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,232,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03578.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Dimorphism decreased in most selection lines, contrary to the model predictions. We suggest that selection on body size acts primarily on growth trajectories.

For both tolerances, chromosome substitutions demonstrated a major effect on chromosome 3, a lesser effect on chromosome 2, and no effect on chromosome 1, except in interactions. Directional selection experiments led to significant increases of tolerance to both toxics. Of greater interest, a strong correlated response was observed in each line: increased ethanol tolerance was accompanied by higher acetic acid tolerance and vice versa. A high genetic correlation (average value r = 0.77) was found between the two traits. These data suggest that alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) activity does not play a major role in explaining the physiological differences known between Afrotropical and European populations. The metabolic flux permitting the detoxification of ethanol and acetic acid seems to be mainly controlled by acetyl-coA synthetase (ACS) at least in adult flies. Acetic acid adaptation could be as important as ethanol adaptation in the ecology of Drosophila melanogaster and other Drosophila species.",25,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Acetic acid tolerance | Drosophila melanogaster | Ethanol tolerance | Geographic races | Metabolic flux,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,246,10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb03886.x,all,All Open Access,NA,NA
