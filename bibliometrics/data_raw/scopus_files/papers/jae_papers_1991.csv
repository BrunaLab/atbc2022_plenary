Birds that had bred successfully were more likely to return to their breeding marsh. Between years, 18% of females and 6% of males returned to breed in their former territories and males tended to move further than females. Less than 15% of the females with their previous year's mate alive, re-established the pair bond. The order of territory settlement was similar between years. Both males and females settled earlier in yeart+1 in territories that were occupied early in yeart, than in territories occupied late or in territories that had been unoccupied. Males and females that arrived relatively earlier than they did the year before occupied a territory of higher rank. Such males increased their reproductive success significantly; females did not. Males became mated with more females and had higher reproductive success in the attractive territories. Reproductive success of females did not differ between attractive and less attractive territories. The adaptive significance of returning to their breeding marsh (neighbourhood fidelity) is apparently that the birds can use knowledge about the quality of several territories, gathered in yeart, and settle in the best territory available at the time of their arrival in yeart+1. -from Authors",153,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Distance travelled to obtain a gram of food rises exponentially as bite size declines. Animals feeding on short swards have small bite sizes, but animals feeding selectively on coarse grasslands would also have small bite sizes. The heat production in locomotion of selective animals can form a large fraction of the daily intake of metabolizable energy. A simple model of the energy exchange in free-ranging ruminants is developed incorporating parameters of diet quality and heat production. The model applies to pastures which do not set a limit to the daily intake of dry matter. The optimum level of selection for high quality constituents in the grass sward is found by determining the conditions in which energy retention (net energy) is at a maximum. For any particular pasture, the optimum level of selection is strongly dependent on the cost of locomotion per day and on the difference between the metabolizable energy concentration of high and low quality constituents, weakly dependent on the average quality of forage, and independent of the ruminant's resting metabolic rate. The model predicts that the optimum level of selection by large grazing herbivores will be lower than that of smaller animals, because large herbivores gain more from digesting low quality constituents due to their ability to digest cell walls, and also because the foraging costs of large animals are higher. -from Author",41,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA,NA

The mean level of larval crowding increases with overall population density. Aggregation of larvae of each species is due to: 1) females laying eggs in clutches of more than one egg, and 2) non-random distributions of ovipositing females across breeding sites. The emergence number of different species of Drosophila trend to be positively correlated across mushrooms, especially between species belonging to the same species group. Within species groups, intraspecific and interspecific aggregation of ovipositing females contribute about equally to the proportional increase in the number of competitors an individual larva shares a mushroom with. Thus, aggregation does not appear to play an important role in the coexistence of species belonging to the same species group. The probability of parasitism of emergent Drosophila by the nematode Howardula aoronymphium is generally independent of emergence numbers. Although density-dependent parasitism could promote coexistence of species that have independent aggregated distribution there is little evidence of such density dependence in these species. -from Authors",97,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,6,NA,NA

The diverse defence and biochemical barrier hypotheses predict negative correlations between insect species richness and chemical diversity and uniqueness, respectively, because plants with diverse or unusual defences should show reduced insect colonization over evolutionary time. Alternatively, the common chemistry and enemy escape hypotheses predict positive correlations between insect richness and these two chemical variables, because plants with diverse chemistry have a higher probability of sharing chemicals common to other plants, facilitating host shifts, and because insect herbivores on biochemically unusual plants may escape from predators and parasites that use host odours to locate prey, again facilitating host shifts. Size of plant geographic range, plant size and leaf form all influence insect species richness. Together, these variables account for 46% of the variance in insect species richness. Insect species richness is not significantly correlated with chemical uniqueness; thus there is no support for the biochemical barrier or enemy escape hypotheses. Insect species richness is positively correlated with chemical diversity, supporting the common chemistry but not the diverse defense hypothesis, but support for the common chemistry hypothesis is tenuous, because of the confounding effects of intensity of biochemical investigation. When intensity of biochemical investigation is factored out, the effects of chemical diversity on insect species richness are still positive and significant but account for only 5% of the variation.

Much of the observed variation in timing of nesting was explained by a consistent relationship between the size of individual males and thermal history immediately prior to nesting: larger males accumulated fewer degree-days >10°C prior to nesting than smaller males. Larger females also appeared to spawn earlier than smaller females. Environmental effects were stronger than phenotypic effects in explaining the seasonal timing of reproduction in males that renested in subsequent years. A significant proportion of adult males did not nest, and the magnitude of that proportion was negatively density-dependent. Nesting habitat was not limiting the number of nesters. Territorial behaviour of nesting males did not affect the seasonal timing of nesting among males of different sizes nor did it limit the total number of nesting males. Removal of experienced spawners from nesting areas in one year was followed by increased recruitment of inexperienced males to the nesting areas in subsequent years; this was not accompanied by a significant increase in the total number of nesters. Two bioenergetic hypotheses can account for why male body size acts as a constraint on the timing of reproduction: 1) large males emerge from winter with a lower energy deficit and are therefore capable of breeding before smaller males; 2) large males allocate energy to reproduction rather than growth earlier in a season than small males. -from Authors",100,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,24,NA,NA

Differences in time-budgets between individuals taking smaller, less profitable prey and those taking larger, more profitable prey are consistent with the idea of a digestion-rate constraint or the maximization of absorption rate, given an optimal rate of gut procesing.

Survival of the parasitoid brood within GV-infected hosts depended on the relative timing of parasitoid emergence (at the spinning of the host pupal mat) and host death due to the virus. Interspecific competition between the natural enemies did not involve changes induced by the parasitoid in the pathogen's ability to infect the host, but the expected life-span of hosts harbouring both competitors was significantly shorter than hosts infected with the virus alone. Interspecific competition within the host was, on average, highly symmetrical. The presence of virus reduced the average weight of the parasitoid brood by 29%, whereas the parasitoid brood reduced the potential reproductive output of the virus by 28%.

The independent variables are between-patch travel cost and structure of the environment. The outcome of the model is described in relation to the predictions of the ideal free distribution (IFD). The numerical distribution of predators and the mortality rate imposed on the prey population are both considered. When travel cost is small, prey depletion is slow and interference is moderate, predators conform to the predictions of the IFD and prey mortality is density-dependent. As travel cost is increased, rate-maximizing predators become more sedentary and the population settles at distributions far from the IFD. In common with all other disturbances of the predation process that impair the correlation between prey and predator densities, this causes mortality to approach density independence and later negative density dependence. In semi-continuous environments where prey density is correlated between neighbouring patches, the slower the spatial rate of variation in prey density (the coarser the environmental grain), the poorer is the adjustment to the IFD. This effect is due to the predators' need for learning: when the environmental sample experienced within the reach of each individual predator is unrepresentative of the global average prey density (as it happens when the environmental grain is very coarse relative to migration range of predators), the predators cannot learn the global distribution of foraging opportunities and fail to take the policy that optimizes individual intake rate. -from Authors",184,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,41,NA,NA

Both during the 1960s and the 1980s, the population varied in size from c600 animals to nearly 1600. Changes in population size occur between successive years as a result of high over-winter mortality, the key factor limiting population size. This is particularly pronounced among lambs and rams and is caused principally by starvation. Winter mortality increases with population density at onset of winter in a non-linear fashion. Neither neonatal survival nor overall fecundity are density-dependent, though both are low following years when winter mortality is high. The persistent instability of the St Kilda sheep population is probably caused by their consistently high fecundity associated with a super-abundance of food in summer. In conjunction, these may permit the population to pass through winter at a level close to carrying capacity; to increase by as much as 50% during the subsequent summer; and to enter the next winter at a level substantially higher than the island can support. -Authors",123,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,42,NA,NA

The sexual generation has fluctuated 6-fold and the agamic generation has fluctuated 10-fold over the 10-yr period. The agamic generation on Q. robur uses 35-60% of the acorn crop in any given year, whereas the sexual generation on Q. cerris uses only 2-8% of the male flowers. There was virtually no parasitism of the agamic generation, while the sexual generation suffers 25-35% mortality from a group of 5 native parasitoids. It is impossible to predict the abundance of one generation from the numbers in the previous generation, either within or between years. Three features of the system contribute to this uncoupling: 1) the insect is food limited in the agamic generation; 2) acorn production fluctuated 20-fold, independent of gall densities; 3) there were two large variable migration mortalities between each generation. There was extremely high tree-to-tree variation in the rate of galling on both species of oak, differences which were consistent from year to year. Some trees have never been galled, while others support predictably high gall densities losing over 90% of their acorns every year. Competitive effects appear to be negligible, as the wasp attacks tissues on the 2 oak species that are not utilized by other cynipids in the UK.

There was a significant difference between these variables in the two years but there was no significant difference in the percentage of time spent at sea. In both years, there was significant variation between individuals in the foraging-attendance time budget. There was a positive correlation between mean time spent ashore and mean time spent at sea for individual seals. The foraging-attendance patterns of seals changed significantly with time through lactation in one year of the study but not in the other. Duration of foraging trips or the period spent ashore had no effect on pup growth rate. During short foraging trips (1-2 d) seals dived for a greater proportion of the time available for foraging than during longer foraging trips (>3 d). Seals fed predominantly on krill during both years. Most foraging occurred at night, reflected in diel variation in times of arrival and departure of seals. Seals were normally feeding 60-90 km away from Bird Island. -from Authors",100,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,63,NA,NA

Helpers had their effect almost entirely through increased productivity per nesting attempt, each helper on average increasing the number of fledglings by 0.50 (±0.06 SE). The activities of helpers did not affect either breeder survival or number of nesting attempts per year. Presence of helpers did not affect clutch size, had no influence on the probability of successful hatching, but dramatically increased the rate of provisioning per nestling. As a consequence of their feeding contributions, helpers significantly decreased both the probability of nestling starvation and the degree of nestling developmental retardation due to food stress. More young fledged, and fledged in better condition, from helped nests. The ability of bee-eater helpers to increase fledging success through their feeding contribution is related to the environmentally unpredictable, and often harsh, conditions at Nakuru. Nestling starvation rates were high (48% of all hatchlings), whereas predation losses were low (4% of eggs laid). Presence of one helper effectively doubled the fledging success of an unaided pair; the effect of increasing numbers of helpers was linear across all commonly observed group sizes. Not only should the presence/absence of helpers influence the decision to breed, but breeders are expected to compete for potential helpers. From the perspective of a potential helper, the large indirect fitness benefit obtained by helping close kin makes helping a viable alternative to breeding. Thus, under some circumstances, helping behaviour may be a first-choice option rather than a second-choice alternative adopted because breeding opportunities are constrained. -from Authors",104,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,64,NA,NA

The stochastic version of the model predicts smaller optimal twig sizes than the deterministic version does. A comparison with the chosen twig size of birch Betula pubescens in a population in C Norway shows that the model predicts quite well the selection of twigs. Furthermore, the stochastic version of the model gives a better fit to the data. The tree species a temperate browsing herbivore encounters during winter may differ in shape and in the relationship between the properties of the twig (eg energetic content, digestibility) and twig size. Optimal twig size was most sensitive to variation in the relationship between digestibility and diameter, and the encounter rate of twigs. Plant species which have a few large annual shoots of high quality will be, at the same available biomass, more severely affected by herbivores than species with smaller annual shoots of lower digestibility. An increase in the number of shoots produced in response to browsing may be an adaptation to reduce the impact of further browsing by modifying the herbivore's foraging behaviour. -from Authors",41,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,65,NA,NA

In breeding seasons following cold springs, breeding was delayed, fewer nests were built, fewer nests contained eggs, and clutch size, hatching success and the number of chicks fledging per nest were reduced. Complete reproductive failures followed the three coldest springs in the 15-yr period. Reproductive success (chicks fledged per nest) was highest following moderately warm springs; but growth rates of chicks and fledging success were extremely low following the warmest spring on record. Spring air temperature were highly correlated with break-up of sea ice. These factors probably influenced seasonal warming trends in the sea water and the consequent availability of prey near the colony. Numbers of adult-plumaged birds on the cliffs in mid-season were markedly lower and more variable in years when few nests were built, suggesting that relatively few experienced adults breed and consistently are present at the colony in years when overall reproductive performance is poor. -from Authors",58,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,66,NA,NA

Energy expenditure for nesting turtles on land is very high, so there may be a selective pressure to maximize clutch size in order to minimize the energy expended per egg laid. Clutch size should be constrained by a female's egg-carrying capacity, which in turn could be expected to be related to her body size.

No evidence is found for relationships between adult length and either adult life-span or fecundity. Body length correlates less well with life-history variation in parasitoids than it does in vertebrate taxa. Adult length correlates with other components of life-span, although the proportion of variance it explains is low. None of the components of life-span correlate with any of the ecological variables with which relationships are predicted. Fecundity only correlates significantly with the period for which an individual host is vulnerable to attack by a given parasitoid species. Several ecological differences are correlated with components of preadult life-span when the effects of body size are controlled for: parasitoids of poorly concealed hosts have shorter incubation periods, koinobionts (species in which the host is not killed until the immature parasitoid has almost completed development) have longer pupal periods and preadult life-span than idiobionts (species in which the host is permanently paralysed or killed by the adult parasitoid before oviposition), temperate species have longer developmental periods than tropical species, and the developmental periods of egg parasitoids are longer than those of pupal parasitoids. Parasitoids with more vulnerable juvenile stages spend less time in these stages. Results are interpreted as reflecting different degrees of variation in the environments of adult and immature parasitoids: immatures may face less variable, more precisely defined environments, as the result of their close associations with their hosts. As a consequence, life-history variation can be more precisely related to environmental differences for immature parasitoids than it can for adults. -from Author",57,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,68,NA,NA
