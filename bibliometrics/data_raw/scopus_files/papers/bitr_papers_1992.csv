Fruiting activities of trees and tall shrubs occurred in all months, whereas fruiting maturation was limited to the dry season and the beginning of the rainy season. Fluctuation in the abundance of fruits was related principally to the production of a large amount of dry, lightweight seeds during the dry season, whereas fleshy and dry, heavyweight fruits were more or less steadily produced throughout the year. This suggests an adaptation to favour wind dispersion of seeds during the dry season when the vegetation is leafless, as well as the maintenance of animal populations and dispersal agents throughout the year.

Delayed greening involves a delay in the input of chlorophyll, rubisco, nitrogen, and energy. Photosynthetic capacity is therefore lower than in species with normal greening. At full expansion, leaves begin to toughen quickly, and rates of herbivory drop by a factor of 4. Delayed greening may have evolved as a mechanism for minimizing losses to herbivores by delaying input of valuable resources until after the leaf is fully expanded and better protected by toughness. These benefits outweigh the costs of forfeited photosynthesis in the shaded understory but not in the high light treefall gaps. This cost evaluation suggests that, in the face of herbivory, it is advantageous to have delayed greening in the shade and normal development in the sun.

With emphasis on food webs based on plants, important effects are represented: the plant's influence on three-trophic-level interactions; the cascading effects of plant quality on herbivore attack and performance; the resource-based influence on the probability of competition in communities; how within-species variation in resources selects for high specificity in resource utilization by foraging females and the consequences for intraspecific competition at low herbivore densities; and, how minor differences between plant species cause differences in herbivore behavior and consequently the number of parasitoids in the food web. Phylogenetic constraints on herbivores are superimposed on plant variation. Insect species in which females actively forage for rare high-quality resources are constrained to be latent species, while those in which larval feeding sites are reached more passively tend to generalize on plant quality and can become epidemic periodically-eruptive species.

Keys vegetation was arranged along two major environmental gradients: an elevational gradient within islands, and a geographic gradient associated with position along the NE-SW trending island chain. Both were complex gradients, with soil depth and type, periodicity of tidal inundation, ground water depth and salinity, climate, and geological substrate as potential contributing factors. TWINSPAN was used to divide the smaples into 14 major groups on the basis of plant species composition. The classification was modified to recognize 13 Ecological Site Units which were homogeneous in important site factors as well as vegetation characteristics. Plant species diversity increased from intertidal to upland site units, while canopy height, basal area, and fine litter production increased both upslope and downslope of the supratidal units. -from Authors",61,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,44

One of the wasp species reproduced successfully. These alien species were not attracted to F. lutea, but once having landed on the figs, these wasps were stimulated to search for the ostiole, through which they gained entrance to the fig cavity. Females of a third pollinator species were also present on the tree, but they failed to initiate ostiole searching behaviour. Hybrid seeds resulting from the entry of the alien wasps germinated successfully, but did not progress past the cotyledon stage, indicating postgermination deficiencies in the hybrids. -from Authors",54,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,45

This discovery corroborates biogeographic and geological evidence for a direct connection of the Magdalena region with the middle Tertiary Amazon watershed and its fauna. The fossil Arapaima and several other fishes from the same area suggest former aquatic communities in the Magdalena region that were once more diverse than the modern fauna. The Magdalena fish fauna was isolated as its watershed formed with Late Miocene uplift of the eastern Cordillera, and this fauna suffered local extinctions presumably as a result of tectonic activity and later Cenozoic climatic change.
