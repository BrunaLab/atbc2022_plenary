Previous studies have hypothesized that patterns in the distribution and genetic structure of riparian plant communities were caused by hydrochory, i.e. plant dispersal by water. We separated the relative contributions of propagules from hydrochory and other dispersal vectors by comparing colonization in pairs of plots, one subject to flooding and deposition of hydrochores and the other unflooded. 2 The number of colonizing individuals and the mortality rate of individuals per year did not differ significantly with flooding, but hydrochory increased the number of colonizing species per year and plot by 40-200%. The pool of colonizing species was 36-58% larger per year for flooded than for unflooded plots, indicating that hydrochory increased the diversity by facilitating long-distance dispersal. Hydrochory resulted in more diverse plant communities after 3 years of succession at both plot and reach scales, despite the fact that flooding caused plant mortality. 3 We found no evidence that dams reduce the abundance and diversity of waterdispersed propagules by acting as barriers for plant dispersal. The role of hydrochory for plant colonization was similar between a free-flowing and a regulated river, although in fragmented rivers propagule sources are likely to be more local (within-impoundment). 4 We conclude that plant dispersal by water, as well as fluvial disturbance, is important for enhancing species richness in riparian plant communities. As flowing water may carry buoyant seeds long distances, riparian plant communities may receive a comparatively large proportion of their seeds by long-distance dispersal. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",140,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Dams | Fragmentation | Hydrochory | Riparian vegetation | River continuum | Seed dispersal | Seed germination | Sweden | Vascular plants | Vegetative dispersal,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although forest ecologists have emphasized the importance of canopy gaps in generating spatial variability that might promote tree regeneration, the effects of canopy gaps on seedling recruitment may be offset by dense forest understories. 2 Large annual fluctuations in recruitment processes, coupled with the long life of forest trees, can provide an alternative mechanism for maintaining tree diversity. Evaluating the relative importance of spatial vs. temporal variability in recruitment, however, requires estimates of seedling survival that are extensive on both scales. 3 Estimates of survival derived from conventional statistical methods require that individual seedlings are monitored through time, and are therefore often limited in extent. We demonstrate a relatively fast and easy alternative approach to measuring survival that uses repeated counts of individuals in quadrats. 4 Annual seedling counts were used to quantify both the effects of small canopy gaps and understorey shrubs on the survival of Acer rubrum (red maple) seedlings and the magnitude of residual spatial and temporal variability in seedling survival. 5 We found that a dense understorey had a greater effect on seedling survival than did canopy gaps. Our canopy gaps had only a slight positive effect on seedling survival, and their benefit was offset by a large negative effect of the understorey shrub Rhododendron maximum. 6 Annual fluctuations in recruitment processes were seven times greater than spatial variability across transects and the effect of individual years on seedling survival was larger than even that of understorey shrubs. 7 The long life span of trees coupled with large annual variability in recruitment success across species may maintain the diversity of forest trees through a storage effect. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",49,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Acer rubrum | Bayesian statistics | Canopy gaps | Forest dynamics | Rhododendron maximum | Seedling survival | Spatial variability | Storage effect | Temporal variability | Tree diversity,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA,NA,NA,NA

The higher resistance of diverse plots to invasion may be partly due to the increased probability of a plot containing a species with similar resource requirements to the invader. 2 We conducted a study of the invasibility of monocultures belonging to three different functional groups by seven sown species of legume. By only using experimentally established monocultures, rather than manipulating the abundance of particular functional groups, we removed both species diversity and differences in underlying abiotic conditions as potentially confounding variables. 3 We found that legume monocultures were more resistant than monocultures of grasses or non-leguminous forbs to invasion by sown legumes but not to invasion by other unsown species. The functional group effect remained after controlling for differences in total biomass and the average height of the above-ground biomass. 4 The relative success of legume species and types also varied with monoculture characteristics. The proportional biomass of climbing legumes increased strongly with biomass height in non-leguminous forb monocultures, while it declined with biomass height in grass monocultures. Trifolium pratense was the most successful invader in grass monocultures, while Vicia cracca was the most successful in non-leguminous forb monocultures. 5 Our results suggest that non-random assembly rules operate in grassland communities both between and within functional groups. Legume invaders found it much more difficult to invade legume plots, while grass and non-leguminous forb plots favoured non-climbing and climbing legumes, respectively. If plots mimic monospecific patches, the effect of these assembly rules in diverse communities might depend upon the patch structure of diverse communities. This dependency on patch structure may contribute to differences in results of research from experimental vs. natural communities. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",50,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Assembly rules | Functional groups | Legumes | Resistance to invasion | Seed-addition experiment,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,3,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

However, it is far from clear whether such differences are consistent both in space and time, and how they influence the spatial structure of plant populations. 2 We analyse the spatiotemporal variability in microhabitat quality for seedling emergence and survival of the Mediterranean tree Acer opalus ssp. granatense, examining seedling dynamics at the microhabitat scale in two maple populations intermingled in pine forests and two established on stony slopes during three consecutive years with different climatic conditions. 3 Seedling establishment varied markedly between microhabitats. In general, seedlings benefited from the presence of pre-established vegetation, with lower emergence and survival of maple seedlings in open interspaces than under adult maples, non-conspecific trees and shrubs. 4 However, the quality of most microhabitats depended on both habitat type and year. Emergence and survival under adult maples, heterospecific trees and in open interspaces was higher in forest than in stony-slope populations, and increased significantly with summer rainfall. Shrubs, on the contrary, showed relatively high values of seedling emergence and survival at all sites and in both dry and wet years. Consequently, the benefits of living under shrubs were comparatively greater at lower precipitation levels. 5 The different microhabitats found in heterogeneous landscapes such as Mediterranean forests vary, over relatively large spatiotemporal scales, in quality for seedling establishment. Shrubs showed the highest consistency in patterns of both seedling emergence and survival. This finding, together with the predominance of dry years in Mediterranean areas, may explain why Acer opalus ssp. granatense has a stable spatial distribution at a geographical scale with most saplings associated with shrubs. Spatiotemporal patterns of seedling dynamics at the microhabitat scale may cascade through later demographic stages, eventually impacting the spatial structure of plant populations. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",70,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Acer opalus ssp. granatense | Climate | Facilitation | Habitat types | Hierarchical effects | Mediterranean mountain | Microhabitat quality | Seedling emergence and survival | Spatiotemporal variability,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,4,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

A conspicuous pattern of alternating dry strings and wet flarks aligned perpendicular to the slope occurs in combination with other microtopes, resulting in a mesotope pattern. 2 Patterning on both these levels can be explained by a simple, spatially explicit model that assumes predominantly lateral water flow through an acrotelm that is draped over a dome-shaped catotelm. The model distinguishes two types of surface elements: hummocks with low transmissivity growing under dry conditions and hollows with high transmissivity growing under wet conditions. 3 Hummocks dam up water and stimulate the development of hollows upslope, whereas hollows effectively drain upslope areas, stimulating the development of hummocks. If the dome is steep and the recharge high enough, this leads to the development of a string-flark microtope. 4 Four distinct types of microtopes are distinguished: (i) areas entirely covered by hummocks, (ii) randomly arranged hummocks and hollows, (iii) string-flark striping patterns and (iv) areas entirely covered by hollows. 5 Different combinations of sharply delineated microtopes occur with different parameter settings, allowing for the classification of four types of raised bog mesotopes. In addition to such qualitative differences, the extent and composition of the microtopes vary with parameter settings, reflecting the variety observed in natural systems. 6 Our simple simulation model shows how small-scale, local processes can create a variety of large and complex landscape patterns. These patterns can be used to describe raised bogs in terms of biological entities of a higher organizational order (ecosystem biodiversity), typically recognizable in often species-poor peatland ecosystems. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",70,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Ecosystem biodiversity | Hollows | Hummocks | Pattern formation | Peatland | Peatland hydrology | Raised bog | Self-organization | Simulation model | String-flark patterns,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,5,NA,NA,NA,NA

After over two decades of parallel research, their ideas have not been reconciled, hindering progress in understanding the functioning of ecosystems. 2 Grime's theories do not adequately incorporate the importance of non-heterogeneous supplies of nutrients and how these supplies are partitioned over long time scales, are inconsistent regarding the importance of disturbance in nutrient-limited habitats and need to reconsider the carbon economy of shade-tolerant plants. 3 Failure to account for differences between aquatic and terrestrial systems in how resource supplies are partitioned led Tilman to develop a shifting set of theories that have become reduced in mechanistic detail over time. The most recent highlighted the reduction of nutrient concentrations in soil solution, although it can no longer be derived from any viable mechanistic model. The slow diffusion of nutrients in soils means that the reduction of average soil solution nutrient concentrations cannot explain competitive exclusion. 4 Although neither theory, nor a union of the two, adequately characterizes the dynamics of terrestrial plant assemblages, the complementarity in their assumptions serve as an important foundation for future theory and research. 5 Reconciling the approaches of Grime and Tilman leads to six scenarios for competition for nutrients and light, with the outcome of each depending on the ability of plants to preempt supplies. Under uniform supplies, pulses or patches, light competition requires leaf area dominance, while nutrient competition requires root length dominance. There are still important basic questions regarding the nature of nutrient supplies that will need to be answered, but recent research brings us closer to a unified set of theories on resource competition. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",163,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Competition | Concentration reduction hypothesis | CSR hypothesis | Disturbance | Plant strategies | Stress,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,6,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Mean species seed longevity was 8.65 years. For five species that persisted in soil for 15-17 years, regression indicates survival times of more than 20 years. 3 Climatic factors (particularly annual temperature range in the centre of the species' distribution range) alone accounted for 42% of the variation in seed longevity and reproductive variables for 55%. 4 Models of fruit dispersal speed (rapid/tardy) demonstrated the link between spatial and temporal (seed longevity) dispersal and between spatial dispersal and habitat affinity (open/closed) of a species. The majority (87%) of species belonged to two of the four possible syndromes (rapid fruit dispersal /long-term seed persistence or tardy dispersal/short-term persistence); 84% of the former were open habitat species. 5 Seed bank density is a function of seed potential longevity, seed rain and soil conditions. Regions that support species having greatest potential longevity have the smallest seed banks.

We identified species having a greater or lesser yield in the mixed communities than expected from monoculture data as winners and losers, respectively. To test our hypothesis that performance of the subordinate species (losers) is mainly controlled by light availability, whereas the dominant species (winners) are sensitive to the availability of below-ground resources, we traced the effects of number of species, light transmission in the community and foliar N concentration on plant photosynthesis through leaf C isotope composition (δ13C). 2 Phalaris arundinacea and Phleum pratense, the two tallest grass species, yielded more in mixtures than expected, as, initially, did Dactylis glomerata. Festuca ovina, the smallest grass, and Ranunculus acris, a forb, had smaller yield in mixtures than expected. For most species, observed mixture yields did not deviate significantly from those expected. 3 Decreases in transmitted light decreased δ13C in D. glomerata, Lotus corniculatus and Rumex acetosa. The δ13C of Trifolium pratense and L. corniculatus was affected by increasing number of species in the plant community even after accounting for the transmitted light. In P. arundinacea, δ13C increased with increasing foliar %N, as expected for the tallest, dominant species. 4 Species showing a positive, significant relationship between δ13C and transmitted light were relatively low growing and unable to establish dominance in multispecies communities due to shading by larger dominants. 5 We conclude that above-ground competition is crucial in determining C isotope composition among the subordinate species, whereas the dominant species are more strongly affected by below-ground resources.

Such facilitative interactions between plant species may have important consequences for patterns of relative abundance and reproduction in plant communities. 2 We studied the relationship between abundance and flowering success of palatable species and the cover of three unpalatable species (Senecio jacobaea, Iris pseudacorus and Lysimachia vulgaris) in a grassland where moderately intense grazing (0.17-0.42 grazers ha-1) had been ongoing for 3 years. Plots were selected so that there were no systematic differences in microenvironmental conditions associated with the level of cover of unpalatable species. 3 Several palatable species had a higher frequency, cover and/or flowering success when they grew in the neighbourhood of an unpalatable species. 4 Several species (both palatable and unpalatable) were significantly taller in the vicinity of a large unpalatable species, probably due to the combined effects of grazing avoidance and increased light competition. 5 These facilitative effects, however, have not yet resulted in a higher local species richness or plant community evenness. It is nevertheless likely that more pronounced effects will be seen if grazing is continued, because facilitative interactions between plant species induced by grazing have already led to a shift in patterns of abundance and flowering success. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",21,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Associational resistance | Competition | Grazing avoidance | Herbivory | Relative palatability,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,9,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Seeds are shed in autumn and overwinter in lake sediments. 2 We investigated the influence of growing-season length on seed maturity and germinability and the cumulative effects of winter temperatures on patterns of germinability. Seeds were stratified for up to 1 year and tested for germinability at 4-week intervals. Data-loggers recorded temperatures simultaneously at the field site and in the cold room. Cumulative temperature below a threshold (thermal time) was used to relate behaviour in cold storage to phenology. 3 Most seeds were dormant at collection. Cold storage of imbibed seed resulted in loss of dormancy. The proportion of non-dormant seeds peaked after a cold treatment equivalent to one winter, i.e. coinciding with favourable temperatures for germination in the field. Continued cold stratification resulted in a cycle of secondary dormancy and its subsequent relief; the thermal time characterizing the second, lower, peak in germinability coincided approximately with that attained in the field in the second spring after collection. 4 Shortening the growing season of Najas marina, by collecting material before natural senescence was complete, reduced the proportion of mature seeds, lowered average germinability and increased germination times. 5 The thermal capacity of water bodies causes a lag in spring warming, whereas declining light becomes limiting in autumn. Najas marina is crucially dependent on the length of growing season to produce sufficient viable seed. A low-temperature requirement to break seed dormancy prevents inappropriate autumn germination. In a prolonged winter (necessarily followed by a shorter growing season), a significant proportion of seed would go into secondary dormancy and remain in the seed bank until the second spring. 6 In annual plants, such requirements for warm summers and cold winters could contribute to a continental-climate distribution in northern Europe.

Although both survival and relative growth rate (RGR) increased with increasing light availability, no other microhabitat variable significantly affected seedling performance. Nor did the magnitude of microhabitat effects on survival or RGR differ among species. 4 Larger-seeded species were more likely to survive from germination to 1 year as well as from 1 to 5 years of age. RGR for seedling height during the first year post-germination was not related to seed mass, but smaller-seeded species did grow slightly faster thereafter. Path analyses revealed that correlations between seed mass and performance were explained in part because larger seeds produced larger initial seedlings, which tended to survive better but grow more slowly. 5 We also analysed within-species effects of seed mass for the larger-seeded Eperua grandiflora and Vouacapoua americana (both Caesalpiniaceae). Larger seeds produced larger seedlings in both species, but larger seeds survived better only for Eperua. Larger seedlings grew more slowly in both species, but did not offset the early (Eperua) and later (Vouacapoua) positive direct effects of seed mass on RGR that may represent contrasting strategies for reserve deployment. 6 Our results demonstrate that seed size influences performance within and among species in part because of indirect effects of initial seedling size. However, we suggest that traits tightly correlated with seed mass at the species level, such as specific leaf area, leaf longevity and photosynthetic capacity, may also contribute to interspecific performance differences. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",131,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,French Guiana | Life-history trade-offs | Microhabitat | Path analysis | Regeneration strategy | Relative growth rate | Seedling survival | Shade tolerance,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,12,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

For Phyteuma spicatum, a self-incompatible, rare understorey herb in deciduous forests of north-western Germany, I tested the hypotheses that: (i) fitness (in terms of reproductive success) is reduced in small or isolated populations, (ii) reproduction in small populations is reduced by pollen limitation and (iii) genetic effects cause fitness reductions in small populations. 2 I compared the reproductive success of plants of Phyteuma in 14 populations of different size and degree of isolation. Seed production was, as predicted, positively related to population size but was also influenced by plant size, although not by population isolation, density or habitat quality. 3 I performed supplemental hand-pollinations in 10 of the 14 populations using pollen from the same population (test for pollen quantity) or from another large population (pollen quality). The proportional difference in seed production between handpollinated plants and open-pollinated controls increased with decreasing population size, indicating pollinator limitation of reproduction in small populations. There was no difference between the two hand-pollination treatments, suggesting that a sufficient number of cross-compatible mates was available even in the smallest populations. 4 Progeny from the 14 populations were grown for 32 weeks in a common environment. There was no effect of population size on germination, but final seedling survival was positively related to population size, and this relationship was more pronounced in the glasshouse than under more favourable growing conditions in a common garden. Genetic effects may thus reduce fitness (here measured in terms of survival) in plants from small populations, making them more susceptible to environmental stress. 5 The results suggest that both reproduction and offspring performance may be reduced in small populations even of long-lived species such as Phyteuma spicatum.

We recorded community-level changes in woody seedling density, species density, species richness and composition in six woody life-forms: canopy trees, subcanopy trees, canopy palms, understorey palms, shrubs and lianas. We evaluated these changes in relation to annualized recruitment and mortality rates for each life-form. 3 Seedling density declined in all four sites over the 5 years, whereas Shannon diversity and the proportion of rare species increased. Species richness and evenness increased in all but the oldest site. 4 Canopy palm, understorey palm and canopy tree seedlings increased in species richness and relative abundance, whereas shrub and liana relative abundance declined. Canopy trees accounted for 34-42% of all new recruits. Detrended correspondence analysis showed that species composition was initially highly distinct within each forest site and remained distinct over the 5-year period. 5 Shifts in life-form were correlated with declining light availability during succession. Across sites, median light availability at the end of the study period in 2003 was positively correlated with recruitment rates of understorey palms, shrubs and lianas, and was negatively correlated with mortality rates of canopy trees and palms. 6 Observed changes among seedling communities mirrored those described in chronosequence studies on plants in larger size classes, lending support to the assumptions of chronosequence studies in Neotropical forests. 7 The results demonstrate the importance of seedling recruitment and mortality in determining the course of succession. Convergence occurs in some community properties, such as relative abundance within life-forms, but not in others, such as species composition.

Mast seeding could have evolved as a result of increased pollination efficiency in mast-flowering years and/or as an anti-predator adaptation that increases the survival of seeds by alternately starving seed predators in non-mast years and satiating them in mast years. 2 We investigated annual seed crops to test the relative contributions of pollination efficiency and pre-dispersal predator satiation to mast seeding in Fagus crenata, a tall tree species dominating cool-temperate forests in Japan. Thirteen-year (1990-2002) time series data were collected for five beech forests in south-western Hokkaido. 3 The negative relationship observed between the pollination failure rate and the total seed crop in the current year supports the pollination efficiency hypothesis. The predator satiation hypothesis was also supported by the fact that the predation rate showed a good fit to the ratio of successive total seed crops, suggesting that a numerical response (starving the predator in low seed years) operated in F. crenata. 4 Key-factor analysis revealed that pre-dispersal seed predation had a larger effect on seed production per flower than did pollination efficiency. 5 We used a simulation model to examine how the magnitude of fluctuation in the total seed crop would influence the pollination failure rate, the predation rate and the viable seed rate. The mean levels of fluctuation of total seed crops of F. crenata were just large enough to provide maximum benefits from predator satiation at some sites. 6 Mast seeding in F. crenata thus appears to be determined by selective pressures from its seed predators. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",72,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Annual reproductive fluctuation | Fagus crenata | Forest trees | Mast seeding | Masting | Pollination efficiency | Predator satiation | Reproductive strategy | Seed production | Ultimate factor,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,15,NA,NA,NA,NA

These mechanisms were evaluated at both the neighbourhood (1-m2 plot) and population (individual species) scales. 4 During invasion, species richness declined with increasing invader cover for three of the four invaders. All invaders reduced colonization rates, but had no effect on extinction rates at the neighbourhood scale. Populations differed in their susceptibility to invasion impacts, with significant reductions in colonization for 10 of 25 (40%) species and increases in extinction for only 4 of 29 (14%) species. 5 At neighbourhood and population scales, influences of invasion on community dynamics were essentially the same for all invaders regardless of life-form. While individual resident species had some increase in extinction probability, community richness impacts were largely driven by colonization limitation. 6 The consistency of invasion impacts across life-forms suggests establishment limitation as a general mechanism of invasion impact.

Across all plant functional traits examined, species had a consistently higher probability of local extinction in the urban landscape. 4 Species that were geophytes or hemicryptophytes with a flat rosette and species with seeds dispersed by wind or ants had substantially increased risks of extinction in the urban landscape.

Over the last decade, the south-western US has experienced six drought years, including the extreme droughts of 1996 and 2002, which led to widespread tree mortality across northern Arizona. 2 We examined the impact of these droughts on the co-dominant tree species of the pinyon-juniper woodland (Pinus edulis and Juniperus monosperma), a major vegetation type in the US. 3 Pinyon mortality following both droughts was 6.5-fold higher than juniper mortality. In addition, large pinyons suffered 2-6-fold greater mortality than small pinyons, a pattern associated with higher mortality of reproductively mature trees and survival of smaller pinyons resulting from facilitation by established vegetation. Differential mortality of large pinyons resulted in a vegetation shift such that the pinyon-juniper woodlands are becoming dominated by juniper, a species that is typical of lower elevations and more arid conditions. 4 Sites that experienced high pinyon mortality during the first drought suffered additional mortality during the second drought, so that reductions in tree densities and the resulting release from below-ground competition did not buffer surviving pinyons against additional mortality during the second drought. Such repeated mortality events also suggest that these stands may suffer chronic stress. 5 Reductions in biotic associations (e.g. avian seed dispersers, ectomycorrhizas and nurse plants) that will probably result from extreme mortality of large pinyons ensure that the observed vegetation shifts will be persistent.

In many tropical forests, trees compete not only with other trees, but also with lianas, which compete aggressively for below-ground resources and thus may limit tree growth and regeneration. 2 Using a replicated experiment, we tested the relative strengths of above- and belowground competition from lianas on tree saplings in a disturbed forest in Côte d'Ivoire with a heterogeneous canopy and relatively high light penetration. We planted seedlings of three tree species and subjected them to below-ground competition with lianas (BGC), above- and below-ground competition with lianas (ABGC), or a liana-free control treatment. After 2 years, we harvested the saplings and compared the amount of above-ground biomass and its relative allocation among the three experimental treatments and different tree species. 3 Lianas competed intensely with saplings in this tropical forest, substantially limiting sapling growth. Saplings grown in the ABGC and BGC treatments had only 18.5% and 16.8% of the above-ground dry biomass of those grown in the liana-free control treatment. 4 Sapling biomass did not differ significantly among the ABGC and BGC treatments, suggesting that below-ground competition was the driving force behind liana vs. tree competition in this forest. Above-ground competition with lianas, however, did affect the allocation of biomass in saplings, resulting in shorter, thicker stems and a poorly developed crown. 5 Collectively, our findings suggest that below-ground competition with lianas plays a substantial role in limiting the growth of saplings in disturbed and secondary tropical forests, and above-ground effects may be due to a combination of above-ground competition and mechanical stress. 6 Disentangling above- and below-ground competition between lianas and trees is critical for a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of naturally regenerating tropical forests, as well as formulating successful management plans for sustainable timber harvest. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",186,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Above-ground | Below-ground | Côte d'Ivoire | Competition | Forest regeneration | Lianas | Trees | Tropical forest,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,19,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We did this using a new approach to relate quantified habitat loss and fragmentation to quantified colonization capacity. 3 We quantified loss and fragmentation during the 20th century of moist, nutrient-poor semi-natural grasslands in study areas in the Netherlands, as well as their current distribution. After testing how well the habitat distribution matches species distributions of two wind-dispersed grassland forbs (Cirsium dissectum, representative of species with long-distance wind dispersal, and Succisa pratensis, representative of species with shortdistance wind dispersal), we combined the habitat distribution data with simulated seed dispersal kernels in order to quantify the impact on connectivity. 4 Habitat loss and fragmentation has dramatically reduced both the area (by 99.8%) and the connectivity of the grasslands. The remaining grasslands are practically isolated for seeds dispersed by wind, even for species with high wind dispersal ability (for which, interestingly, connectivity by wind dispersal decreased most). Linear landscape elements hardly contribute to connectivity by wind dispersal. Regional survival of the studied species has become completely dependent on the survival of a few large populations in nature reserves. Other remaining populations are decreasing in number and size and have low colonization capacity. 5 Habitat loss and fragmentation have drastically changed the regional species dynamics of wind-dispersed plant species, indicating that it is of utmost importance to preserve remaining populations in nature reserves and that the probability of colonization of new or restored sites is very low, unless the sites are adjacent to occupied sites or dispersal is artificially assisted. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",120,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Cirsium dissectum | Connectivity | Grassland | Habitat fragmentation | Linear landscape elements | Long-distance dispersal | Regional dynamics | Seed dispersal | Succisa pratensis | Wind dispersal,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,20,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We also recorded the cover of vascular plants and bryophytes, to assess the impact of changes in Calluna dominance on competing species. 2 Grazing in combination with nitrogen addition caused the greatest decline in Calluna cover, typically 40-50%, but nitrogen addition did not cause a significant decline in Calluna on plots protected from grazing. More Calluna shoots were browsed on nitrogen-treated plots than on unfertilized ones, presumably because grazing animals preferred fertilized Calluna. 3 Nitrogen addition allowed grasses to increase in cover, especially on grazed plots. However, Nardus stricta, Festuca ovina and Agrostis sp. all declined in fenced areas but increased in grazed plots, whereas Deschampsia flexuosa and Festuca rubra increased in fenced plots. 4 The effects of grazing and nutrient addition varied markedly between sites, possibly because of differences in soil moisture and organic matter. Nitrogen addition, however, increased soil nitrogen mineralization rates in both glens. 5 Fencing increased the cover of grazing-intolerant plants with low nutrient demands (as classified by Ellenberg and suited species scores) that were categorized as competitive plants by Grime's CSR model. Plots receiving nitrogen and phosphorus had more nutrient-demanding plants able to tolerate high grazing pressure that were often classified as ruderals. 6 The impact of nitrogen addition on the cover of Calluna and on competing grass species in the community critically depends on the level of grazing.

We focused on the largely unknown effects of pines on spruce and larch, rather than on P. mugo, which is known to be competitively displaced by the two tree species. 3 We used regression models on observational data to analyse the responses of the trees to a gradient of pine cover in terms of recruitment, growth, fecundity and browsing damage, and to determine whether effects involved both competitive and facilitative components, if they depended on the life-history stage of the trees and if they were species-specific. 4 We detected a pronounced negative effect of pine cover on recruitment and growth of both spruce and larch, whereas seed production was unaffected. Larch turned out to be more sensitive to pine competition: its recruitment and growth are superior to that of spruce in open habitats but this advantage vanishes in dense pine thickets. 5 Contrary to expectations, the effects of pine cover on growth rates of spruce and larch did not depend on the life-history stage of the trees. 6 Pine cover is a major determinant of browsing damage for both spruce and larch, indicating that it does have a positive effect in providing shelter against herbivores. 7 The differential effects of pines on spruce and larch are likely to favour spruce at the expense of larch in realizing potential habitat expansion as a result of climate change.

This study aims to identify the life-history traits most likely to have influenced the current distribution pattern of this rain forest tree. 2 Using ecological and molecular analyses we found that its range is limited by the absence of efficient dispersal mechanisms rather than by habitat availability, or as a result of a recent bottleneck or of reproductive failure. 3 Resprouts can take over the position of senesced plants, even in the absence of disturbance, allowing local persistence and the maintenance of genetic diversity. Long-term persistence and preferential outcrossing further favour relatively high levels of diversity (HE = 0.542) despite a small effective population size (Ne = 21.6). 4 We used eight life-history traits to assess if the E. hardeniana findings were valid across 258 local taxa. Current distribution patterns of rain forest species within a species-rich community were accounted for by linking two important components of community assembly theory: dispersal and niche assembly. 5 The interaction of the seed-based dispersal dimension and resprouting potential best explains the current distribution of rare local taxa. Major dimensions of life-history trait variation were identified among local plant species, suggesting that a range of interacting traits contribute to a species' response to environmental variables and mitigate the influence of potentially adverse circumstances. 6 The benefits of merging ecological and genetic approaches to interpret species distribution and population structure are applicable across a broader range of studies. Our findings highlight how currently constrained palaeo-endemic species with small populations in refugial habitats may retain the capacity to both persist and expand in response to changing circumstances and opportunities.

Plots followed isoclines of altitude, to minimize the internal variation of soil. Composition of the total herb community and of the three herb groups was summarized with PCoA. 4 Soil structure, represented by PCA axes, was the main determinant of the variation in herb composition for all groups, but slope affected only pteridophytes. Soil and topography explained less than one-third of the variance in community data. Herb composition was significantly different between watersheds, but watersheds differ only slightly in soil parameters. Our results indicate high turnover in species composition, on spatial scales of 5-10 km in central Amazonia, which is not necessarily associated with soil change. 5 Compositional patterns of the three groups analysed were significantly correlated, but with low values for the correlation coefficient. Although composition was correlated, the responses to environmental predictors differed among groups, and the use of one group as a surrogate will miss around 50% of the variation in other groups. 6 Although important, soil and topography alone cannot predict herb community structure.

It provides a very good approximation of the explicit version (R 2 > 0.99) if initial seed positions vary randomly relative to the obstacle pattern. 4 To validate the model, we conducted a field experiment in which we released seeds of seven South African Proteaceae species that differ in seed size and morphology into an arena in which we systematically varied obstacle patterns. When parameterized with maximum likelihood estimates obtained from independent measurements, the explicit model version explained 70 77% of the observed variation in the proportion of seeds dispersed over 25 m and 67 69% of the observed variation in the direction of seed dispersal. 5 The model tended to underestimate dispersal rates, possibly due to the omission of turbulence from the model, although this could also be explained by imprecise estimation of one model parameter (the aerodynamic roughness length). 6 Our analysis of the aggregated model predicts a unimodal relationship between the distance of secondary dispersal by wind and seed size. The model can also be used to identify species with the potential for long-distance seed transport by secondary wind dispersal. 7 The validated model expands the domain of mechanistic dispersal models, contributes to a functional understanding of seed dispersal, and provides a tool for predicting the distances that seeds move. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",97,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Fynbos Proteaceae | Long-distance seed dispersal | Model aggregation | Phase II dispersal | Process-based model | Relationship between dispersal distance and seed size | Secondary wind dispersal | Seed lift-off velocity | Tumble dispersal | Validation experiment,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,26,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

However, no study has tested its effects using a realistic dispersal kernel in a metapopulation context with explicit spatial structure and local extinctions. 2 We incorporated such kernels into a newly proposed simulation model, which combines within-patch (population) demographic processes and a simplified maternally inherited single-locus, two-allele genetic make-up of the populations. As a test case, we modelled a typical conservation scenario of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) populations. 3 The effects of LDD were rather diverse and depended on initial population conditions and local extinction rates. LDD increased metapopulation survival at intermediate local-extinction probabilities. LDD helped maintain higher total genetic variability in populations that were initially drifted, but facilitated random genetic loss through drift in initially 'well mixed' populations. LDD prevented population differentiation in low extinction rates but increased it at intermediate to high extinction rates. 4 Our results suggest that LDD has broader evolutionary implications and would be selected for in populations facing intermediate local-extinction pressures. Our modelling approach provides a strong tool to test the effects of LDD on metapopulation survival and genetic variability and to identify the parameters to which such effects are most sensitive, in ecological and conservational scenarios. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",108,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Conservation | Demography | Ecology | Evolution | Fragmentation | Genetic diversity | Local extinction | Modelling | Population ecology | Wind dispersal,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,27,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Here, we investigate whether negative feedbacks operate widely in its native range in eastern USA. 2 In laboratory experiments, soil sterilization was used to test the net effect of soil biota (pathogens and mutualists) and fungicide treatments to test the effects of soil pathogens (oomycetes) on survival of P. serotina seedlings in soils from 22 P. serotina populations throughout the eastern USA. 3 In soil associated with P. serotina trees, there was a significant positive effect of both soil sterilization and fungicide on seedling survival. The two effects were positively correlated, suggesting that oomycetes were responsible for the observed mortality of seedlings in untreated soils relative to sterilized soils. 4 We determined the host-specificity of these interactions by comparing the effects of the soil biota associated with conspecific and heterospecific trees. There was no interaction between the effects of soil origin and soil sterilization, or of soil origin and fungicide, on seedling survival, although an effect of soil origin on the relative oomycete effect suggested that soil pathogens associated with conspecifics had a more negative influence than those from heterospecifics. 5 Fungicide treatment decreased pre-emergence mortality of P. serotina seedlings at two of three field sites in the northern USA. 6 The overall consistency between the laboratory experiments and the field experiment strongly suggests that oomycete soil pathogens have a negative effect on the survival of P. serotina seedlings throughout its native range in the eastern USA. 7 Soil-borne pathogens therefore appear to regulate the densities of a common tree species (P. serotina) at larger geographical scales than previously described, providing additional evidence of the important role that soil biota play in regulating plant populations and structuring plant communities. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",76,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Black cherry | Invasive species | Macroecology | Oomycetes | Plant disease | Plant-soil biota interactions | Prunus serotina | Pythium | Soil-borne pathogens,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,28,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We chose both species favoured under herbivory (increasers) and those that become scarce (decreasers) and manipulated the ontogeny of the plant when first clipped, as well as frequency (up to eight times) and intensity of clipping. 3 Plant survival was high (88%) but both frequency and intensity of clipping increased plant mortality in all species investigated (P < 0.05). Immature plants showed the highest mortality (15.9%). 4 Plant biomass mirrored mortality with immature plants again the most affected. As expected, control plants were largest and plants experiencing 100% biomass removal smallest. Clipping frequency was also significant, but the effect was not linear and plants that were clipped more than twice were more dramatically affected. 5 Biomass compensation showed species-specific responses that were significantly related to an a priori definition of species status in the grassland: increaser species had significantly higher compensation ability after recurrent defoliation than decreaser species. 6 Tolerance to herbivory has been viewed as a marginal strategy for plant survival, but our results suggest that it plays an important role in explaining abundance and distribution of plant species in environments with recurrent defoliation. 7 Plants do not always respond linearly to environmental pressures (such as repeated defoliation) and cannot therefore be predicted by studies considering only the lower end of the possible intensities. Understanding the effects of environmental pressures on plant fitness requires the study of a broader range of intensities, at different ontogenic stages and consideration of possible response thresholds. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",118,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Compensation | Decreaser | Defoliation tolerance | Grassland | Herbivory | Increaser | Ontogeny | Regrowth,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,29,NA,NA,NA,NA

The distributions of 73% of tree species in the plot are significantly aggregated on one of these soil types. We tested the hypothesis that variation in performance (growth and mortality) underlies these edaphically biased species distributions. 3 Annual growth and mortality rates over 5 years were estimated for trees ≥ 1 cm in diameter and compared among soil types, life histories and species-aggregation patterns. 4 Overall, growth and mortality rates were lowest on the poorest soil (sandy loam). Growth rates on each soil type correlated with soil fertility for pioneers, while mortality rates correlated with soil fertility for both pioneers and late-successional species. 5 There was little evidence that soil specialists had a home-soil performance advantage. Soil-specific ranks of growth and mortality rates of each species-aggregation group largely mirrored the ranks of their rates across the plot and did not shift substantially among soil types. On every soil, species aggregated on sandy loam or clay ranked last or next-to-last, and species aggregated on loam ranked the highest. 6 Ecological sorting of species among soils was strong. With increasing diameter, species were lost from the soils on which they were not aggregated more frequently than would be expected based on random mortality. The underlying mechanisms of ecological sorting may involve low mortality rates as a requirement for species to achieve high abundance on the poorest soil, whereas for the richer soils, having high growth rates appears relatively more important for achieving high abundance. 7 Thus, species' demographic responses to resource variation among soil types, especially related to the poorest soil, affects tree species distribution patterns in this forest and thereby influences the structure of tropical forest communities. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",197,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Growth | Mixed dipterocarp tropical forest | Mortality | Niche differentiation | Soils,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,30,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Thin (0.5 cm) slices, representing time intervals of c. 50 years each from 11 800 to 7800 cal. year BP, were analysed and the data compared with independent palaeoclimatic proxies to study vegetational responses to environmental change. 2 Alpine plant communities (e.g. with Salix herbacea) were established at 11 600 11 500 cal. year BP, when oxygen-isotope records showed that temperatures increased by c. 3-4°C within decades. Larix decidua trees reached the site at c. 11 350 cal. year BP, probably in response to further warming by 1-2°C. Forests dominated by L. decidua persisted until 9600 cal. year BP, when Pinus cembra became more important. 3 The dominance of Larix decidua for two millennia is explained by dry summer conditions, and possibly low winter temperatures, which favoured it over the late-successional Pinus cembra. Environmental conditions were a result of variations in the earth's orbit, leading to a maximum of summer and a minimum of winter solar radiation. Other heliophilous and drought-adapted species, such as Dryas octopetala and Juniperus nana, could persist in the open L. decidua forests, but were out-competed when the shade-tolerant P. cembra expanded. 4 The relative importance of Larix decidua decreased during periods of diminished solar radiation at 11 100, 10 100 and 9400 cal. year BP. Stable concentrations of L. decidua indicate that these percentage oscillations were caused by temporary increases of Pinus cembra, Dryas octopetala and Juniperus nana that can be explained by increases in moisture and/or decreases in summer temperature. 5 The final collapse of Larix decidua at 8400 cal. year BP was possibly related to abrupt climatic cooling as a consequence of a large meltwater input to the North Atlantic. Similarly, the temporary exclusion of Pinus cembra from tree line at 10 600-10 200 cal. year BP may be related to slowing down of thermohaline circulation at 10 700-10 300 cal. year BP. 6 Our results show that tree line vegetation was in dynamic equilibrium with climate, even during periods of extraordinarily rapid climatic change. They also imply that forecasted global warming may trigger rapid upslope movements of the tree line of up to 800 m within a few decades or centuries at most, probably inducing large-scale displacements of plant species as well as irrecoverable biodiversity losses. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",143,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Climate change | Larix decidua | Long-term timberline dynamics | Macrofossil analysis | Palaeoecology | Pinus cembra | Vegetation history,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,31,NA,NA,NA,NA

By contrast, juvenile Stipa plants had an overall neutral effect on Cistus shrubs, although Cistus suffered some competitive effects during periods of water shortage.

It has been suggested that conifers may be displaced by angiosperms except where competition is less intense, because conifer seedlings are inherently slow growing, and are outpaced by faster-growing angiosperm species. Here we investigate whether competition with ferns and deeply shading trees also contributes to a failure of conifers to regenerate in resource-rich habitats. 2 We examined how changes in soil nutrient availability and drainage affected vegetation along the retrogressive stages of a soil chronosequence in southern New Zealand. Vegetation composition shifted from angiosperm-tree dominance on 'recent' alluvial terraces (< 24 ky), via coniferous-tree dominance on older marine terraces (79-121 ky), to coniferous-shrub dominance on the oldest marine terraces (291 ky). Soil drainage deteriorated along the sequence, and N : P leaves and N : Psoil indicate increasing P-limitation. Conifer species appear to be adapted to persistence on infertile and poorly drained soils. 3 The floor of the relatively fertile alluvial forests was deeply shaded (∼1% light transmission) by dense groves of tree-ferns and ground-ferns, and by large-leaved subcanopy trees. Few seedlings of any type were found on the forest floor, even in tree-fall gaps, and establishment was restricted to rotting logs and tree-fern trunks. Angiosperms were particularly successful at colonizing these raised surfaces. 4 Less shade was cast by the conifer-dominated forests on infertile marine terraces (∼5% light transmission), which lacked tall ferns. There were many opportunities for conifer establishment, with high seedling densities recorded on the forest floor and on logs. By contrast, angiosperm seedlings were mainly restricted to logs. 5 Our results suggest that several mechanisms act in concert to reduce regeneration opportunities for conifers in productive habitats. In particular, we suggest that tall ferns and deep shade are responsible for a restriction of regeneration opportunities in relatively productive forests in New Zealand, diminishing the opportunities for conifers to escape the competitive effects of fast-growing angiosperms.

This is further complicated by the fact that plants can express both competitive effect (target plant influence upon neighbour growth) and competitive response (target plant growth as a function of a neighbour) abilities, with these ecological characteristics potentially being independent. 2 Using the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, we investigated patterns of intraspecific variation in competitive effect and response abilities and their relationships to other plant traits and resource supply rates. 3 Both competitive effect and response were measured for 11 genotypes, including the Columbia ecotype and 10 derived mutant genotypes. Plants were grown alone, with intragenotypic competition, and with intergenotypic competition in a replicated blocked design with high nutrient and low nutrient soil nutrient treatments. We quantified competitive effect and response on absolute and per-gram bases. 4 Competitive effect and response varied among genotypes, with the relative competitive abilities of genotypes consistent across fertilization treatments. Overall, high rates of fertilization increased competitive effect and competitive response abilities of all genotypes. Both competitive effect and response were correlated with neighbour biomass, though genotype-specific traits also influenced competitive response. 5 At the genotype level, there was no correlation between competitive effect and response in either fertilization treatment. Overall patterns in competitive response appeared consistent among inter- and intragenotypic competition treatments, indicating that a target genotype's response to competition was not driven by the genetic identity of the competitor. 6 These findings indicate that within A. thaliana, there is the potential for differential selection on competitive effect and response abilities, and that such selection may influence different sets of plant traits. The concept of a single competitive ability for a given plant is not supported by these data, and we suggest continued recognition of these dual competitive abilities is essential to understanding the potential role of competition in influencing intra- and interspecific processes. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",83,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Genes affecting competition | Intra- and intergenotypic competition | Molecular ecology | Phenotypic plasticity,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,35,NA,NA,NA,NA

Redwood forests are dominated by coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), tanoak and California bay laurel (Umbellularia californica). 3 A total of 120 permanent plots (500 m2 each) were established in redwood forests at 12 sites within the main epidemic area in California.

The highest infection levels by P. ramorum were found on California bay laurel (range 0.42-0.69) and tanoak (0.32-0.45). The highest levels of mortality were associated with tanoak and ranged from 0 to 66%, with 62.5% of that mortality associated with P. ramorum infection. 5 Disease incidence above 30% was most often associated with bay laurel importance value. In plots with few bay laurel stems, high disease levels were associated with the presence of understorey tanoaks. Bay laurel and small tanoaks are thought to represent the main source of inoculum for further spread of P. ramorum. 6 Differential host mortality due to this emerging generalist pathogen will exert considerable influence on redwood forest dynamics, with potentially dramatic shifts in forest composition and structure and subsequent cascading ecological and evolutionary effects. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",82,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Generalist pathogens | Invasive species | Phytophthora ramorum | Redwood forest communities,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,36,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We performed a population viability analysis on three island populations in a protected area to estimate population viability and thus to gain a better understanding of the species and its needs. We developed a 10-stage matrix model, comprising the seed bank, the first 4 years underground, juveniles, young and adult clump stages and three dormant stages, from an 11-year census. 2 All analyses indicate that the three populations have remarkably slow and stable dynamics, with stochastic growth rates close to 1 after 100 years and very slow convergence to equilibrium. The system is probably stabilized by the long life span of clumps (mean longevity from 110 to 350 years). Retrospective and perturbation analyses showed that adult dormancy had an important role in the dynamics, and adult survival and seed persistence were key factors in maintaining population stability and persistence. 3 A young, uniformly distributed population had fewer, shorter lived adult clumps than two older, aggregated populations. Although no perceptible change was predicted for the next 100 years, the younger population was more sensitive to environmental variations and may go extinct in the next 250-500 years, depending on longevity of the seed bank. 4 C. calceolus populations can persist in a protected area where there are only slow changes in habitat through secondary forest succession.

Lack of sufficient data often leads to spatial variation being substituted for temporal variation in models to evaluate management options, but variation in population growth rate (λ) between sites or over years may be caused by variation in different life history components. 2 We studied the demography of three coexisting and related perennial herbs (the long-lived perennial Succisa pratensis, the shorter-lived Hypochaeris radicata and the long-lived, but more clonal Centaurea jacea) in the same plots over 4 years (1999-2003). 3 Life table response experiment analysis revealed that temporal and spatial variation in the life history components of S. pratensis and H. radicata were qualitatively different: variation in fecundity contributed most to variation in λ between sites, but variation in growth contributed most to variation between years. 4 In years with a below average λ, most life history components of S. pratensis and H. radicata had lower transition probabilities, whereas the reasons for low population growth differed between the three poor sites. All major life history components of S. pratensis had lower probabilities in the most productive of these sites, but in the other two, negative contributions from some components (fecundity or growth) were partly compensated for by positive contributions from others (growth or stasis). 5 Centaurea jacea showed a different pattern: in poor years, negative contributions from some life history components were buffered by positive contributions from other components; however, this buffering did not occur in poor sites. 6 Our analysis shows that the population dynamics of perennial plants may respond differently to temporal and spatial variation in environmental conditions. Moreover, co-occurring species with similar life histories responded differently to the same spatiotemporal variation. We conclude that temporal and spatial dynamics cannot readily be interchanged in population viability analyses and management studies, as such substitution may lead to incorrect projections of a species' population dynamics in time. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",90,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Buffering of variation | Demography | Life history components | Population growth rate | Variation decomposition,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,39,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Measurement of 13C and 18O of foliage allowed separation of the contributions of stomatal and biochemical factors to differences in mean intercellular CO2 concentration, while deuterium composition of stem water served as an indicator of the relative depth of water extraction. 3 Leaf δ13C of juniper and, to a lesser extent, of sagebrush increased with decreasing density of juniper. Foliage 18O did not vary significantly with juniper density, indicating that this was primarily caused by an increase in photosynthetic capacity rather than decreased supply of CO 2. Increased foliage nitrogen concentration of both species with decreasing juniper density is also consistent with increased photosynthetic capacity. 4 The much greater mean age of juniper trees in the high juniper density plots may explain their lower photosynthetic capacity. 5 Averaged across densities, juniper always extracted water deeper in the profile than did sagebrush, but in June and August, only the high juniper density plots showed an effect. Sagebrush is either restricted from using water at greater depth in the presence of juniper at high density or was in such poor condition that deep-water sources were not necessary to maintain their reduced function. 6 Ecotones can serve as useful, spatially constrained stages for examining resource partitioning and relationships among plant species.

Plant growth forms are widely used to predict the effects of environmental changes, such as climate warming and increased nitrogen deposition, on plant communities, and the consequences of species shifts for carbon and nutrient cycling. We investigated whether the relationship between growth forms and patterns in litter quality and decomposition are independent of environmental conditions and whether growth forms are as good as litter chemistry at predicting decomposability. 2. We used a natural, latitudinal gradient in NW Europe as a spatial analogue for future increases in temperature and nitrogen availability. Our screening of 70 species typical of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands showed that leaf litters of Sphagnum mosses, evergreen and deciduous shrubs, graminoids and forbs differed significantly in litter chemistry and that the ranking of the growth forms was independent of the region for all litter chemistry variables. Differences among growth forms were usually larger than differences related to the environmental gradient. 3. After 8 and 20 months incubation in outdoor, Sphagnum-based decomposition beds, growth forms generally differed in decomposability, but these patterns varied with latitude. Sphagnum litters decomposed slower than other litters in all regions, again explaining its high representation in organic deposits of peatlands. Forb litters generally decomposed fastest, while the differences among the other growth forms were small, particularly at higher latitudes. 4. Multiple regression analyses showed that growth forms were better at predicting leaf litter decomposition than chemical variables in warm-temperate peatlands with a high N-load, but less so in the subarctic, low-N region. 5. Our results indicate that environmental changes may be less important in determining ecosystem leaf litter chemistry directly than are their indirect effects through changes in the relative abundance of growth forms. However, climatic and nutritional constraints in high-latitude peatlands promote convergence towards nutrient-efficient plant traits, resulting in similar decomposition rates of vascular growth forms despite differences in litter chemistry. The usefulness of the growth-form concept in predicting plant community controls on ecosystem functioning is therefore somewhat limited. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",175,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Climate change | Decomposition | Environmental gradient | High latitude | Leaf litter | Litter chemistry | Nitrogen deposition | Peatlands | Plant functional types | Sphagnum,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,41,NA,NA,NA,NA

We studied seedling emergence in four familial pairs of floodplain herbs in response to the experimental manipulation of soil moisture and litter cover to analyse (i) whether the effect of litter changes from negative under humid to positive under dry conditions, and (ii) whether the response to changing water and light conditions with increasing litter cover varies among species and plant families. 2. We carried out a controlled pot experiment using four levels of litter cover (0 g, 2 g, 4 g and 8 g litter per pot, corresponding to 0 kg m -2,0.2 kg m-2,0.4 kg m-2 and 0.8 kg m -2) and two levels of water-addition, leading to constantly humid substrate or intermittently dry topsoil. 3. Across water-additions, percentage emergence reached a peak at low levels of litter cover (0.2 kg m-2 and 0.4 kg m-2). There was a significant litter x water-addition interaction in six species, with positive effects of litter under intermittently dry conditions and negative or neutral effects under constantly humid conditions. Litter lowered maximum temperature as well as amplitude, and alleviated soil humidity under low water supply, while imposing increasingly shaded conditions. Analysis of species- and family-specific responses suggested that germination under a litter cover of 0.8 kg m-2 was significantly reduced in smaller-seeded species (i.e. those that tend to have higher light demands for germination). 4. Our results suggest that transfer of seed-containing plant litter can aid restoration projects if applied at 0.2-0.4 kg m-2. Below these levels, establishment of most species may be inhibited by drought, while higher amounts will increasingly suppress seedling emergence, especially of small-seeded species. 5. In addition to facilitation effects observed between living plants, dead plant remains may also exert positive effects on establishment. The sign of the litter effect on seedling emergence depends on soil humidity, with negative effects seen above a threshold amount, which is species- and family-specific and is closely related to seed size.

Species identity of the nearest neighbour was established to see whether the effects of intra- and interspecific interactions differed. 4 Relative growth rate (RGR) was negatively related to local density during both of the first two summers, but not during winter. In 1998 the negative effects were stronger when the closest neighbour was conspecific. 5 Contrasting patterns of size-dependent growth were found during summer and winter, with summer RGR an increasing, and winter RGR a decreasing, function of size. 6 Summer survival was generally high, and was positively related to spring size. There was a significant negative effect of increasing local density on survival probability in 1998. No effect of neighbour identity was detected. 7 Winter survival was low, and mainly dependent on autumn size, with no significant effects of local density in any season. During the first winter, individuals with a conspecific as the nearest neighbour had lower survival probabilities. 8 There was no evidence of a tradeoff between summer RGR and survival probability. 9 Density-dependent effects may be significant beyond the recruitment stage in monocarpic perennials such as D. purpurea. Density dependence was strongest at early life stages although, because effects on growth persisted into the second year, it is likely that local density may influence timing of reproduction in this population.

We studied the effects of litter on seed longevity in the field and performed glasshouse and field experiments with natural and plastic litter to assess their physical and biological/chemical nature. Seeds were sown on the soil surface, buried or within the litter layer. Published data on spatial distribution of seeds were used to calculate the net effect of litter on seedling recruitment. 3. Litter increased seed longevity. In the glasshouse, litter increased seedling emergence and growth for surface, but not for buried, seeds. Seeds within the litter layer (no seed-soil contact) showed reduced seedling emergence and growth. In the field, litter did not have a direct effect but emergence was promoted by burial. 4. Integrating the effects of microsite quality and seed density showed that litter microsites recruited c. 50% of Bromus pictus seedlings, double that expected from its cover (25%). The positive effect of litter on seed density and on seed longevity outweighed the negative effect of litter acting as a mechanical barrier to burial. 5. Inconsistent effects of litter on plant recruitment in arid environments may be due to responses being dependent on seed size and shape, and thus may represent indirect effects acting via the probability of burial.

The potential importance of directed seed dispersal for the response of plant metapopulations to habitat loss and changes in disturbance rate is assessed, and illustrated with a case study of a metapopulation of an aquatic plant. 2 The Levins model is extended to include preferential dispersal towards suitable habitat and towards unoccupied patches. Both increase patch occupancy, decrease the minimum habitat cover required for persistence and increase the maximum allowable disturbance rate, while preferential dispersal towards unoccupied patches also makes reductions in abundance due to increased disturbance rates more threshold-like. 3 Applying classical metapopulation approaches, which assume random dispersal, to a species that features directed dispersal, is expected to give systematic errors in prediction. For example, where dispersal is directed towards suitable habitat regardless of occupancy, the Levins model will tend to overestimate the response to habitat loss, and where dispersal is directed towards unoccupied patches, the Levins model will tend to underestimate the response to changes in disturbance rate. 4 Eichhornia paniculata is an aquatic plant restricted to ephemeral pools. Seed dispersal is by waterfowl, and so is directed towards suitable habitat. Data on habitat cover and patch occupancy from Husband and Barrett in 1998 fit well with our model but deviate significantly from the predictions of the Levins model. The parameter estimates imply dispersal very strongly directed towards suitable habitat, and that without this the minimum density of pools required for persistence would be at least 10 times greater than the highest densities observed, implying that the species would go locally extinct. 5 To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative demonstration that the nature and strength of directed dispersal affects the robustness of fragmented plant populations to anthropogenic disturbance.

I tested the interaction between light supply and consumer presence in a meta-analysis of experiments that manipulated both these factors factorially and measured the biomass of benthic algae (periphyton). 3 Both grazer removal and light enhancement had positive effects on algal biomass. These two factors showed strong interactions, which exceeded previously observed interaction terms between nutrient supply and grazer removal. Positive light effects on algal biomass were primarily observed in the absence of grazers. Grazer effects became stronger at high light supply, which indicated that high light favours algal growth types that are easily ingested. 4 Further analyses showed that light effects increased with trophic state of the habitat and with algal biomass, indicating enhanced importance of light limitation and self-shading at high nutrient supply. Grazer effects depended on grazer biomass and varied with type of experimental manipulation. 5 This study implies that light is of similar importance as nutrients in resource control of benthic algal biomass. High light levels simultaneously enhance consumer control of algal biomass, resulting in strong resource vs. consumer interactions.

We also tested whether environmental conditions influence maternal fertility by experimentally manipulating resource levels in natural populations. 3 The polliniferous morph showed significant gender variation, from almost zero fruit production in pioneer populations to high fruit set, albeit of less than females, in late-succession.

Seeds and seedlings produced by the polliniferous morph in a late-succession population had significantly lower viability than those from females.

To test this hypothesis, we irrigated naturally occurring woody seedlings during an El Niño-related drought in seasonal moist tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We predicted that irrigated plots would retain greater species richness than control plots, and that the benefits of irrigation would increase with the abundance of: trees relative to lianas, wet-forest seedlings relative to dry-forest seedlings, and rare species relative to common species. We also hypothesized that the strength of this filter would increase with increased moisture limitation, predicting that the benefits of irrigation would increase with seedling density and light availability, and decrease with mean seedling age. 2 Irrigation did reduce species losses, but not by limiting the loss of drought-sensitive species as predicted. Instead, mortality in irrigated plots was density dependent, whereas species losses in control plots were well predicted by random thinning, suggesting that density dependence weakened as abiotic stress increased. 3 Irrigation increased seedling growth, but did not affect seedling mortality. Contrary to our predictions, irrigation increased growth in plots dominated by dry-forest species relative to those dominated by wet-forest species, suggesting that dry-forest seedlings either occur in moisture-limited microsites or are more able to utilize dry-season precipitation. The strength of the filter did increase with potential moisture limitation, as irrigation increased seedling growth more in higher light environments. 4 Annual precipitation has declined over much of the humid tropics during the 20th century. Our results suggest that this trend may reduce tropical forest diversity by weakening density-dependent mechanisms that maintain diversity. In addition, plots dominated by dry-forest species experienced higher growth in response to irrigation and also far lower dry-season mortality relative to plots dominated by wet-forest species. While we cannot disentangle the effects of microsite from species composition, these results suggest that dry-forest species may benefit from any increase in dry season length or severity. 5 Research conducted during 'normal' conditions may overlook the impact of severe events and thus fail to identify critical mechanisms structuring ecological communities. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",73,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Barro Colorado Island | Density dependence | Drought | El Niño | Irrigation | Maintenance of diversity | Niche differentiation | Rare events | Seedling growth and mortality | Tropical forest dynamics,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,48,NA,NA,NA,NA

It merely proposes that the clade created by adaptive radiation will occupy more niche space than the original colonist could on its own. Members of the clade will then collectively inhibit establishment by new colonists more effectively than can a colonist that has not radiated. 3 The monophyly of many larger radiations in the Macaronesian flora is well established and new studies tend to confirm this pattern. 4 A few later-arriving colonists may have undetectably hybridized with earlier arrivals, but this is only a genetic interpretation of the essential idea behind pre-emption, i.e. that early arrivals so outnumber later colonists that the latter cannot establish. 5 We do not therefore believe that hybridization provides an alternative explanation of why groups with multiple colonization failed to radiate in Macaronesia. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",66,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,Adaptive radiation | Macaronesia | Niche pre-emption | Phylogeny,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,51,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

In previous studies, experimental fertilization of moist acidic tussock tundra greatly increased the abundance and productivity of the deciduous dwarf shrub Betula nana. However, this species is largely absent from moist non-acidic tundra. 2 These two common upland tundra community types exhibited markedly different responses to fertilization with nitrogen and phosphorus. In moist acidic tundra, cover of deciduous shrubs (primarily B. nana) increased after only 2 years, and by 4 years vascular biomass and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) had increased significantly, almost entirely because of Betula. In moist non-acidic tundra, both biomass and ANPP were again significantly greater, but no single species dominated the response to fertilization. Instead, the effect was due to a combination of several small, sometimes statistically non-significant responses by forbs, graminoids and prostrate deciduous shrubs. 3 The different growth form and species' responses suggest that fertilization will cause carbon cycling through plant biomass to diverge in these two tundra ecosystems. Already, production of new stems by apical growth has increased relative to leaf production in acidic tundra, whereas the opposite has occurred in non-acidic tundra. Secondary stem growth has also increased as a component of primary production in acidic tundra, but is unchanged in non-acidic tundra. Thus, fertilization will probably increase carbon sequestration in woody biomass of B. nana in acidic tundra, while increasing carbon turnover (but not storage) of non-woody species in non-acidic tundra. 4 These results indicate that nutrient enrichment can have very different consequences for plant communities that occur on different geological substrates, because of differences in composition, even though they share the same regional species pool. Although the specific edaphic factors that maintain compositional differences in this case are unknown, variation in soil pH and related variability in soil nutrient availability may well play a role. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",58,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Alaska | Arctic | Betula nana | Fertilization | Moist acidic tundra | Moist non-acidic tundra | Net primary production | Nitrogen | pH | Phosphorus,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,52,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

A meta-analysis of field results in arid environments,Maestre F.,Journal of Ecology,00220477,13652745,93,4,748-757,2005-08-01,August 2005,10.1111/j.1365-2745.2005.01017.x,"1 Theoretical models have predicted that the relative importance of facilitation and competition will vary inversely across gradients of abiotic stress, with facilitation being the dominant interaction under high abiotic stress conditions. A critical reappraisal of current theoretical models is needed because experimental studies both support and refute their predictions. 2 A quantitative meta-analysis of field and common garden studies evaluating the effect of abiotic stress (low vs. high) on the net outcome of plant-plant interactions in arid and semi-arid environments was performed to evaluate the degree of empirical support for these models. We created four separate data sets corresponding to the categories of response variables commonly used to measure plant performance (survival, density, growth and fecundity). 3 The analyses showed that both the selection of the estimator of plant performance and the experimental approach followed have a strong influence on both the net outcome of plant-plant interactions and the effect of abiotic stress on such outcome. The effect of neighbours on the survival and growth of target plants was not significant at either stress level, but that on the density and fecundity of target plants was positive (facilitation) and negative (competition) at the low and high abiotic stress level, respectively. Density data showed that the net effect of neighbours was positive and negative at low and high abiotic stress levels, respectively, whereas other estimators suggested that the net effect of neighbours did not differ with stress level. None of our meta-analyses indicated that the magnitude of the net effect provided by neighbours, whether positive or negative, was higher under high abiotic stress conditions, and facilitation does not therefore appear to increase in importance with abiotic stress. 4 As the predictions of current theoretical models regarding the relationship between the net outcome of a plant-plant interaction and abiotic stress do not hold in arid and semi-arid environments, different models are needed. These should consider different sources of abiotic stress separately, and should be valid for performance measurements, such as survival, that integrate plant responses over time. The incorporation of these features into theoretical models will undoubtedly improve their predictive capabilities. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",414,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Abiotic stress | Arid | Competition | Environmental gradients | Facilitation | Meta-analysis | Plant-plant interactions | Semi-arid,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,53,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Seed rain was also a good predictor of recruitment of Ilex and Crataegus at the microsite scale, but, for Taxus, the rather homogeneous dispersal across microsites contrasted with the heterogeneous post-dispersal losses. At the site scale, only Taxus showed a positive trend of concordance. 6 Concordance patterns were maintained from microsite to microhabitat in Crataegus and Ilex, and from microhabitat to site in Taxus.

Plants were grouped into patches that were surveyed annually. The effect of spatial scale on dynamics was evaluated by varying the interplant separation used to determine grouping from 5 to 200 m. Using the 5-m criterion, the number of patches varied from 703 to 854 over the 5 years of the study. 3 New patches were colonized by a few individuals and located on average 50 m away from the closest old patch. Recolonization of extinct patches was very rare. Small patches had the highest risk of extinction (5%) and, although floods can destroy even large populations, no large patches with flowering individuals became extinct. 4 Elasticity analysis indicated that the survival of patches made a much greater contribution to patch dynamics than the production of new patches. Increasing patch scale decreased the rates of colonization and extinction as well as the projected finite rates of increase in patch number, but elasticities remained invariant. 5 The river dynamics both create space for colonization and cause local extinctions, especially of small patches. The short-term dynamics of S. tatarica depend primarily on local dynamics but, in the long run, the species will track the availability of habitat, and its persistence will depend on a positive balance between colonization and extinction. 6 This species from a transient environment does not exhibit the extinction-recolonization dynamics predicted for metapopulations at equilibrium.

A comparative analysis accounting for phylogeny was used to examine variation in semi-quantitative estimates of species abundance in comparable habitats across the five island floras. 3 Species were divided into those with affinity for semi-natural, agricultural and ruderal habitats. Both vegetative and reproductive attributes were evaluated for individual islands and averaged across all islands. 4 Vegetative propagation, large leaf size, summer flowering, long flowering period and dispersal by wind or vertebrates were positively associated with average alien abundance across all five islands. Fewer significant trends were found in island-specific patterns. 5 The relative importance of a few reproductive traits is reflected in over-representation of Caryophyllales, Asterales and Poales (late flowering, large seed size and anemochory). Although significant covariation in traits was found there was no evidence for well-defined invasive syndromes. 6 Succulence was important in ruderal habitats, long flowering period in agricultural habitats and vertebrate seed dispersal in semi-natural habitats, suggesting that empty niches, avoidance of competitors and exploitation of mutualists, respectively, are important. 7 The study highlights the importance of estimating invasion success across a wide region, but analyses of specific invasion stages are also needed.

Submerged plants in shallow lakes are subject to pulling forces arising from waves, currents and grazing birds. Such forces can cause anchorage failure (mainly dislodgement of the root system) or breaking failure of the stems. Both lead to loss of fitness but uprooting is more damaging because many perennial species can replace broken shoot systems. 2. We investigated 12 abundant species (Ceratophyllum demersum, Chara sp., Eleogiton fluitans, Elodea canadensis, Myriophyllum spicatum, Najas marina, Potamogeton natans, P. obtusifolius, P. pectinatus, P. pusillus, Utricularia vulgaris and Zannichellia palustris) in 28 shallow lakes in the UK and the Netherlands. We measured the anchorage and breaking strengths of individual plants of different sizes. 3. Anchorage strength depends on the cohesive strength of the sediment and the size of the root system. The undrained shear-strength of sediments in shallow lakes varied more than 50-fold, but all were substantially weaker than terrestrial soils. Anchorage strength was modelled using the product of sediment cohesive strength and four measures of root-system size. A transformation of plan-form area (raising it to the power 2/3) that represented the hemispherical surface area of the root ball was consistently the best predictor of anchorage strength. 4. Breaking strength was a linear function of stem cross-sectional area in all species. Breaking stresses were comparable with those of marine algae and non-lignified terrestrial plants. 5. The results were used, in combination with plant allometric relationships, to predict the fates of four of the species when challenged with the largest waves likely to be encountered in a 10-year period, and the even greater forces exerted by grazing birds. We show that sediment strength and plant size determine whether plants break or uproot. A careful balance between investment in anchorage and in breakage resistance is needed to survive in the fluctuating physical environment of lakes. 6. Pulling forces experienced by aquatic plants are distinct from the mainly bending forces on more rigid land plants.

Removal of neighbour vegetation increased the number of leaves of Thalictrum and Carex, whereas flowering stems and leaf stalks of Thalictrum became significantly shorter. Furthermore, increased plant growth after nutrient addition and warming suggests that both abiotic environmental conditions and biotic interactions limit plant growth at Finse. 3.

We found substantial variation in many of the demographic parameters measured between plots within stands (10-50 m apart), among stands within areas (600-1500 m apart), and among forest areas (5-30 km apart), as well as among years. 3. Almost all adult P. rigida in most of the stands studied were killed by the 1995 fires and population recovery therefore depended upon recruitment from seed. Initial recruitment appears to be largely determined by seed limitation, which was affected by fire intensity combined with serotiny and other factors. 4.

High interannual variation in fecundity was not reflected in high interannual variation of either adult plant density in spring or of the seed bank. Significant regional differences were, however, found in seasonal seed bank dynamics, which were more pronounced in peripheral German populations than in central Italian populations. 6 We conclude that seasonal seed bank dynamics are a key factor in explaining differences in H. petraea density patterns, particularly in central populations, where fewer seeds are incorporated into the seed bank. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",42,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,'Abundant centre' distribution | Biogeography | Central-marginal model | Demography | Evolutionary ecology | Macroecology | Nested repeated measures design | Population dynamics | Scale | Spatio-temporal variation,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,62,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

In general, relative rainfall (rainfall for a given period standardized against mean annual rainfall) was positively related and initial woody cover negatively related to rates of change in both the overstorey and the understorey. The interaction between rainfall and initial woody cover was significant, reflecting the fact that increases in cover coincided with low initial cover when rainfall is higher than average, whereas decreases in cover typically occurred with high initial cover, regardless of rainfall. 4. On average, overstorey and understorey cover increased over the second half of the 20th century.

We investigated the composition of Atlantic oak wood epiphytic communities in relation to atmospheric N deposition in order to identify N indicator species and propose a critical load for such communities. 2. The epiphytic communities of seven Atlantic oak woods receiving estimated total nitrogen deposition in the range 10-53 kg N ha-1 year-1 were surveyed. Exposure of epiphytes to atmospheric N over 7 months was measured in terms of stemflow flux and concentration and airborne NH3. 3. Redundancy analysis (RDA) related the species to stemflow chemistry and bark pH. Different groups of species were found at (i) a coastal low N deposition site (Graphina ruiziana, Lecania cyrtella, Lobaria pulmonaria, Opegrapha atra, Orthotrichum affine, Melanelia fuliginosa ssp. glabratula and Pertusaria hymenea), (ii) inland low N deposition sites (I. myosuroides, F. tamarisci, Plagiochila atlantica, Cladonia chlorophaea, C. squamosa, Hypotrachyna laevigata and Thelotrema lepadinum) and (iii) high N deposition sites (Hypnun andoi, Hypnum cupressiforme. Calicium viride, Chrysothrix candelaris, C. coniocraea, Hypogymnia physodes, Parmelia saxatilis, Phyllospora rosei and Usnea subfloridana). 4. RDA analysis showed that bark pH and NH 4+ concentration in the stemflow explained the greatest amount of variation in the species composition among the sites. The sites separated into two groups (low and high NH4+ concentration) leading to an estimate for the critical load for N deposition for epiphytes in Atlantic oak woods of 11-18 kg N ha-1 year -1. 5. Analysis of the occurrence of species against N levels suggested that I. myosuroides and F. tamarisci are indicators of small N inputs, whereas H. andoi, C. coniocraea, P. saxatilis and H. physodes are tolerant of increased N loads. 6.

The relationship between environment and the ability of plant species to resprout has been explored more in terms of disturbance frequency than of resource gradients, and has rarely been examined in non-Mediterranean landscapes. 2.

We then tested whether there was a dichotomy of response to crown fire, whether the proportion of resprouters differed among habitats, and if disturbance frequency or resource-productivity models could account for landscape patterns of resprouting. 3. There was a continuum of sprouting ability but most species could be classified as obligate seeders (killed by fire) or resprouters. Habitats differed in the proportion of resprouting species, with rocky outcrops having the lowest proportion and grassy forests and wet heaths the highest. This pattern was consistent at the congeneric and confamilar phylogenetic levels of comparison. 4. Resource/productivity models better explained landscape patterns of resprouting than disturbance frequency models. There was a strong positive relationship between resprouting and increasing soil fertility and moisture gradients. Species richness and obligate seeder richness increased with climate variability and landscape heterogeneity. 5. Landscape resprouting patterns were explained by a resource-competition model where resprouters are favoured because of their ability to persist in more competitive environments.

We proposed that contrasting correlations between potential height and other plant attributes would be observed for sets of species selected to span two hypothetical axes of light availability within mature forest and time since disturbance. 2 We selected 45 perennial rain forest species in Australia's wet tropics to span gradients of light availability and successional status and measured potential height together with traits influencing light capture and regeneration strategy on mature individuals. The traits included leaf mass per area, leaf nitrogen, wood density, stem mass per length, branch mass fraction and seed mass. 3 Potential height was significantly correlated with numerous traits among species selected to span each of the two gradients. Height was positively correlated with leaf mass area-1, leaf nitrogen and seed mass and negatively correlated with leaf area ratio at the branch tip along both light and successional gradients. Height was positively correlated with wood density along the successional axis, with the opposite relationship along the light gradient. 4 Trait relationships differed in either slope or intercept between the two gradients, reflecting different strategic trade-offs. At a given height, shorter species in the successional gradient were characterized by lower leaf mass area-1, lighter wood, smaller seeds, lower leaf nitrogen and lower leaf area ratio at the branch tip than similar sized species along the light gradient. 5 The results of this study support the idea of two distinct, trait-mediated axes of coexistence among short and tall plant species within vegetation.

We hypothesized that decomposition of wood of mangroves from Florida, USA (Avicennia germinans, Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle), and the consequent nutrient dynamics, would depend on species, location in the forest relative to freshwater and marine influences and whether the wood was standing, lying on the sediment surface or buried. 2 Wood disks (8-10 cm diameter, 1 cm thick) from each species were set to decompose at sites along the Shark River, either buried in the sediment, on the soil surface or in the air (above both the soil surface and high tide elevation). 3 A simple exponential model described the decay of wood in the air, and neither species nor site had any effect on the decay coefficient during the first 13 months of decomposition. 4 Over 28 months of decomposition, buried and surface disks decomposed following a two-component model, with labile and refractory components. Avicennia germinans had the largest labile component (18 ± 2% of dry weight), while Laguncularia racemosa had the lowest (10 ± 2%). Labile components decayed at rates of 0.37-23.71% month -1, while refractory components decayed at rates of 0.001-0.033% month-1. Disks decomposing on the soil surface had higher decay rates than buried disks, but both were higher than disks in the air. All species had similar decay rates of the labile and refractory components, but A. germinans exhibited faster overall decay because of a higher proportion of labile components. 5 Nitrogen content generally increased in buried and surface disks, but there was little change in N content of disks in the air over the 2-year study. Between 17% and 68% of total phosphorus in wood leached out during the first 2 months of decomposition, with buried disks having the greater losses, P remaining constant or increasing slightly thereafter. 6 Newly deposited wood from living trees was a short-term source of N for the ecosystem but, by the end of 2 years, had become a net sink. Wood, however, remained a source of P for the ecosystem. 7 As in other forested ecosystems, coarse woody debris can have a significant impact on carbon and nutrient dynamics in mangrove forests.

Individual trees were followed for 2.8-9.8 years. 2. The trajectories of the 47 species were compared with the average vertical light profile in the forest canopy. Evidence was found for the existence of all nine trajectories hypothesized on the basis of three possible light environments (high, intermediate and low) for juveniles and adults. The classical paradigm of pioneer vs. shade tolerant, based on seed and seedling responses, does not therefore apply to post-seedling stages. 3. The majority of the species followed the vertical light profile in the forest canopy, starting in low light environments in the juvenile stage and ending up in high light environments in the adult stage. Only two species complied with the classic notion of whole-life shade tolerants and whole-life shade intolerants (one each). 4. The predictable vertical light gradient in the forest canopy has led to a close association between adult height, light trajectories and allometric traits. Large-stature species tend to have relatively slender stems and narrow crowns, and therefore realize a faster temporal and height-related increase in crown exposure. 5.

Pre-dispersal predation of seeds of Asteraceae has been studied in species where ripening seed is present on plants for long periods but rarely in those where seed maturation is ephemeral and density of consumers is therefore unlikely to keep pace with changes in seed availability. 2. We therefore followed predation of dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) seeds by the larvae of Glocianus punctiger and Olibrus bicolor and predicted that both abundance of seed consumers and seed damage will be indirectly proportional to inflorescence availability, and that overall seed damage will be less than in species with longer lived inflorescences. 3. We counted the number of dandelion capitula m-2, number of larvae capitulum-1 and percentage of damaged seeds at 10 sites, where the flowering time and densities of dandelions differed. The counts were made in 2002 and 2003, at half-weekly (April-May) or weekly (June-August) intervals. 4. Abundance of both species of consumer varied among dandelion patches, and with change in availability of dandelion capitula. Numbers of larvae capitulum-1 were high early and late, when few capitula were available, but decreased at the time of peak flowering when there were many capitula. Production of ready-to-pupate larvae m-2 of a species at a site was similar in successive years, but values for O. bicolor and G. punctiger were not correlated. 5. Seed damage paralleled the abundance of consumer larvae, with early and late flowers suffering most. A linear relationship correcting for lost seeds, predicted 30% damage when there were five larvae capitulum-1, below levels reported for species of Asteraceae with persistent inflorescences. 6. The intensity of pre-dispersal seed predation is directly proportional to the abundance of seed consumer species and indirectly proportional to the availability of maturing capitula. Consequently, in species with ephemeral, synchronized flowering, where seed is available for only a short time, the majority of plants lose only a small proportion to predators. Although those flowering earlier or later than the peak will suffer a much higher risk, the low overall level of damage is unlikely to influence population biology. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",37,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Abundance | Coleoptera | Consumption | Germination | Glocianus punctiger | Olibrus bicolor | Phenology | Seed | Seed predation | Taraxacum officinale,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,73,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although monocarpy is rare among long-lived plant species that grow in stable habitats, one monocarpic species, Tachigali vasquezii, is extremely abundant in the rain forests of the Bolivian Amazon. We analyse how T. vasquezii is able to maintain itself successfully by comparing its life-history traits with those of polycarpic tree species of the same community. We then evaluate the relative importance of such traits using population matrix models. 2. Monocarpic species are expected to have a high fecundity. Seed production per basal area for T. vasquezii is indeed nearly twice that of an average polycarpic species, but this is not sufficient to maintain stable populations. 3. Life-history theory predicts that a monocarpic strategy is advantageous if juvenile survival rates are high compared with adult survival. Although seedlings of T. vasquezii have a lower mortality rate than polycarpic species, its sapling have higher mortality. 4. We found that the success of T. vasquezii is due to its very high diameter growth rates in the larger size classes, which are four times higher than that of an average, co-occurring polycarpic species. Fast diameter growth is enabled by investment in large, leafy crowns and by a low wood density. Applying this high diameter growth in a population model yielded a population growth rate close to that of polycarpic species. Life table response experiment analysis of Tachigali and polycarp models showed that higher growth compensated for the negative demographic effect of 100% adult mortality following reproduction. 5. Rapid growth enables T. vasquezii to reach reproductive maturity in only 49 years, compared with 79 years for an average polycarpic species. It also reduces the risk of dying before reproducing, and 50% more seedlings survive to maturity for T. vasquezii compared with polycarpic species. 6. The dramatic negative demographic consequences of one-time flowering can therefore be completely balanced by taking a shorter time to reach maturity.

Male steriles (MS) must have a fitness advantage relative to hermaphrodites (H) if they are to be maintained in gynodioecious species. We report experiments in which we disentangle the relative contributions of seed size, inbreeding and maternal sex to the fitness advantage of male steriles in Plantago coronopus L. 2. Seed size effects were observed throughout growth experiments in the glasshouse and were reflected in all biomass measurements. In the field, seed size effects resulted in a fourfold increase in standardized seed production per initial buried seed after 2 years between small (mean weight = 0.13 mg) and large (0.20 mg) seeds. 3. Inbreeding depression, calculated from seed to seed was δ = 0.37 after one generation of selfing and δ = 0.93 after the second generation of selfing. Regression of log(1 - δ) on inbreeding level suggested synergistic epistasis in fitness. 4. Even after taking into account the effects of seed size and inbreeding level, the offspring of a male sterile mother had a 16% advantage over a hermaphrodite, but this disappeared when the progeny sex ratio (the ratio of MS:H individuals among the offspring) was taken into account. 5. In the field, offspring of large seeds had both a higher overall incidence of flowering, and a higher probability of flowering in their first year, thus generating an extra cohort of individuals. The high inbreeding depression in fitness after two generations of selfing was also due to a very low incidence of flowering among the S2 individuals. Flowering probability therefore appears to be a critical trait in this system. 6. In the field, the contributions of seed size variation (15%) and inbreeding (9%) combine with 48% higher seed production to give a total fitness advantage of 70% of male steriles relative to hermaphrodites. This is probably sufficient for maintenance of gynodioecy under nuclear-cytoplasmic inheritance of male sterility. 7. Both inbreeding effects (as a consequence of the sexual system) and pleiotropic effects (of the genes coding for male sterility) play a role in the maintenance of gynodioecy in this species, with an apparently greater role for the latter. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",31,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Compensation | Flowering | Germination | Growth analysis | Inbreeding depression | Male sterility | Maternal sex | Seed size | Sex ratio | Spatial variation,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,78,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Ectomycorrhizal fungi are spatially associated with established ectomycorrhizal vegetation, but the influence of distance from established vegetation on the presence, abundance, diversity and community composition of fungi is not well understood. 2. We examined mycorrhizal communities in two abandoned agricultural fields in Minnesota, USA, using Quercus macrocarpa seedlings as an in situ bioassay for ectomycorrhizal fungi from 0 to 20 m distance from the forest edge. 3. There were marked effects of distance on all aspects of fungal communities. The abundance of mycorrhiza was uniformly high near trees, declined rapidly around 15 in from the base of trees and was uniformly low at 20 m. All seedlings between 0 and 8 in distance from forest edges were ectomycorrhizal, but many seedlings at 16-20 m were uninfected in one of the two years of the study. Species richness of fungi also declined with distance from trees. 4. Different species of fungi were found at different distances from the edge. 'Rare' species (found only once or twice) dominated the community at 0 m, Russula spp. were dominants from 4 to 12 m, and Astraeus sp. and a Pezizalean fungus were abundant at 12 m to 20 m. Cenococcum geophilum, the most dominant species found, was abundant both near trees and distant from trees, with lowest relative abundance at intermediate distances. 5. Our data suggest that seedlings germinating at some distance from established ectomycorrhizal vegetation (15.5 m in the present study) have low levels of infection, at least in the first year of growth. Distance from established vegetation represents an important gradient for ectomycorrhizal fungi, with different species occupying distinct niches along this gradient. This provides support for niche differentiation as a factor contributing to ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity. 6. Ectomycorrhizal infection of seedlings is spatially complex, with high infection and high fungal diversity near trees, high infection but lower diversity at intermediate distances, and low infection and low fungal diversity distant from trees.

The EICA (evolution of increased competitive ability) hypothesis suggests that release from natural enemies and pathogens results in higher vigour of invasive plants as a result of the selection of less defended but rapidly growing genotypes. Slug diversity and abundance appear to be low in North America compared with Europe, and we therefore hypothesized that release from slug herbivory contributes to the invasiveness of European Brassicaceae species in North America. 2. In common garden and glasshouse experiments we compared life history and fitness parameters in native (NP) and introduced (IP) provenances of four invasive Brassicaceae species (Barbarea vulgaris, Bunias orientalis, Cardaria draba, Rorippa austriaca) that were subjected to herbivory by Arion lusitanicus. In climate chamber bioassays we investigated slug damage to seedlings and leaf discs using the same sources of plant material. 3. In all species except B. orientalis we found significant but not always consistent differences in growth and reproductive characteristics between IP and NP plants. Plants of B. vulgaris and R. austriaca from the introduced range had a considerably higher growth rate than those from the native range. While IP plants of the non-clonal B. vulgaris allocated more resources to seed production than NP plants, the IP plants of the clonal R. austriaca showed a decreased number of seeds. 4. Contrary to expectation, there were no differences between NP plants and IP plants in the number of damaged leaves and leaf area consumed by slugs, or in the proportion of seedlings damaged and killed. Nor were there interaction effects between slug treatments and provenance. 5. The results suggest that there are genetically based differences in growth and reproductive parameters between NP and IP plants. As there were no differences in herbivore damage between the provenances, this genetic differentiation is probably due to factors such as competition rather than herbivore effects. 6.

Our model predicts that, in the context of ecological succession, selection should generally favour plastic strategies allowing plants to increase their dispersal rate with population age, contrary to previous predictions of models that have assumed genetically fixed dispersal strategies. 3. More complex patterns can evolve showing periods with high production of dispersing seeds separated by periods of intense local recruitment. These patterns are due to the interaction of individual senescence with change in ecological conditions within sites. 4. Evolution of plastic dispersal strategies affects the patterns of density variation with time since foundation and accelerates successional replacement. An interesting parallel can be drawn between the evolution of age-specific dispersal rates in successional systems and the evolution of senescence in age-structured populations. 5.

The importance of predation in determining the fate of post-dispersal dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) seed was investigated. Flowering, seed dispersal, seedling establishment, seed predation and seed predator abundance were recorded in 2002 and 2003, at two sites. Number of flowers were counted in 1-m2 plots, wind-borne seeds were collected in water traps, invertebrate seed predation was estimated from the rate of removal of dandelion seeds exposed on the ground and invertebrate activity density was determined by using pitfall traps. The censuses were made at 2- to 3-day intervals. 2. Seed dispersal occurred 10 days after flowering. Although some seeds were blown away, 3.7-24.2 × 103 seeds m-2 fell to the ground. Four weeks after the peak in seed dispersal 0.7-3.1% of these seeds germinated. Three weeks later only 11-13% of the dispersed seed remained on the ground and most of these were damaged, the remainder presumably having been removed by predators. 3. Predation of exposed seeds was low before seed dispersal but increased after its onset, in parallel with increases in the number of seeds present on the ground and in the activity density of adults of a seed-consuming carabid, Amara montivaga. 4. In cafeteria experiments in which the seeds of 28 perennial and annual herbs were provided A. montivaga consumed the most dandelion seeds, followed by nine other Amara species. In no-choice experiments, under field conditions, A. montivaga consumed six seeds day-1. 5. Post-dispersal predation, mainly due to aggregation of a single ground beetle species, was more important than that which occurred prior to dispersal. Although predators destroyed c. 97% of the seeds, the effect on dandelion population biology is likely to be small. 6. Post-dispersal seed predation may nevertheless be important in other species, as aggregates of large invertebrate predators can consume large quantities of seed. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",63,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Aggregation | Amara montivaga | Carabidae | Coleoptera | Food specialization | Germination | Seed consumption | Seed dispersal | Seedling establishment | Taraxacum officinale,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,82,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many theoretical models have been proposed to explain the empirical self-thinning relationship given by Yoda et al. in 1963 for even-aged, monospecific stands of plants, but the models are inadequate to allow consensus on the processes driving variation in density-dependent mortality and self-thinning. 2. Most non-individual based models (non-IBMs), and many IBMs, employ a common representation of competition in which a finite amount of potential crown area remains completely allocated throughout self-thinning, making stand density inversely proportional to mean projected crown area. 3. This representation entails four assumptions regarding the competition process: the population is adequately represented by the mean plant; total stand resource utilization is constant throughout self-thinning; competition is a horizontal packing process; and differences in initial stand conditions may affect the rate of competition but not the process itself. 4. Reviewing published empirical data, the competition literature and the logical implications for the self-thinning process shows that all four assumptions are untenable as generalizations. Unfortunately, their application provides neither a mortality-inducing mechanism nor insight into the relationship between stand growth and mortality. 5. Explaining the observed variation in self-thinning relationships therefore requires improved representation of the competition process. This improvement is likely to require IBMs that explicitly represent variation in plant size or resource acquisition, two-dimensional stand distribution, dynamic rather than static stand resource utilization, and, perhaps, explicit three-dimensional stand development. Most importantly, the requirement for explicitly modelling mortality mechanisms implies that whole plant models may be insufficient for insight into the self-thinning process. 6. The review reinforces the need to assess mechanistic models for more than their ability to reproduce a single, high-level pattern. Such models should be assessed for their ability to simultaneously reproduce multiple features selected from the levels of both the modelled mechanisms and the high-level patterns. 7. Progress in understanding the observed variation in self-thinning currently requires a shift from searching for universal insight into the modelling of specific mechanisms for specific plant types, eventually leading to a broader theory explaining how variation in plants affects the competition process. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",61,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Density-dependent mortality | IBMs | Mechanistic model | Model assessment | Model evaluation | Model validation | Plant competition | Plasticity | Process model | Universal laws,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,83,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Data from elevations ranging from mixed hardwood-conifer forest at 600 m to subalpine Abies balsamea forest at 1120 m indicate that canopy gaps are not static but expand over time due to mortality of trees at the gap margin and coalescence of gaps. Gap expansion is more frequent than gap initiation. Ultimately such disturbance patches may become more extensive than is normally considered as typical of gap-phase disturbance, but the processes of development are the same. 2 Disturbance agents involved in gap initiation tend to differ from those involved in gap expansion. Spruce beetle, dwarf mistletoe and most root diseases predominate as agents of gap initiation, while windthrow/windsnap, chronic wind stress and Armillaria root disease are important agents of gap expansion. 3 Concepts of equilibrium gap-phase dynamics and a shifting-mosaic steady state do not fully account for the dynamics of these spruce-fir forests. A spruce beetle outbreak in the late 1970s/early 1980s killed most of a cohort of dominant, emergent Picea rubens. This epidemic initiated a long-term cycle of disturbance and release that is likely to be repeated in many years when a new cohort of P. rubens becomes sufficiently large to sustain another major bark beetle outbreak. 4 Episodic disturbance agents affect long-lived, dominant species at infrequent but regular intervals (up to hundreds of years) and operate at the landscape level. Gap-phase cycles appear to be nested within the long-term cycle. Over the long term, episodic disturbance drives such 'nested bicycle' dynamics. 5 Spatial and temporal distribution of disturbance results not only from stochastic events such as storms, but also from host specificity of agents of disturbance, their tendency to attack certain age classes of trees, local and regional contagion, and susceptibility of trees at the edge of disturbance patches.",111,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Disturbance | Gap dynamics | Gap-phase processes | Root disease | Spruce beetle,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,84,NA,NA,NA,NA

If natural forest landscapes were indeed more open, current forest conservation management policy across Europe would need to be reconsidered. 2.

Similarity between the two data sets indicates that large herbivores were not required to maintain these taxa in the primeval landscape. 3.

Species were classified as native (to Australia, including the local community) or exotic (from outside Australia) and as non-invasive or invasive. 2. In a glasshouse experiment the treatments were control (natural soil), added water, added nutrients and added water and nutrients.

There were strong biomass responses to added nutrients for all plant types except native non-invasives.

In a field experiment the factors were site (high and low nutrient soils) and physical disturbance but survival differed between plant types only in relation to site. Exotic species had much better survival than native species at the high nutrient site only. Exotic invasive species had the strongest biomass responses to the high nutrient site while native and exotic non-invasive species showed relatively smaller growth responses. 4.

As expected, we found that introduced S. jacobaea grew larger, and had greater reproductive output, than plants from the native range. Larger plants experienced more feeding damage, and introduced plants were consumed more even when size differences were controlled. Introduced plants also exhibited a greater relative ability to reproduce after damage was sustained, i.e. higher tolerance to herbivory. 4. Contrary to predictions, however, plants from introduced populations had higher total pyrrolizidine alkaloid production (chemical defence against herbivores). 5. Although plants from introduced ranges exhibited life-history traits consistent with EICA predictions, similar phenotypes were common in one of the populations from the native range, suggesting that EICA may not fully explain the invasion success of S. jacobaea. 6. Our results imply that increased competitive ability (vigour) of invasive plants may be associated with changes in resistance as well as tolerance to herbivory, and both types of anti-herbivore defence may need to be examined simultaneously to advance our understanding of invasiveness.",129,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Enemy release hypothesis (ERH) | Evolution of increased competitive ability (EICA) | Herbivore resistance | Herbivore tolerance | Invasive species | Longitarsus jacobaeae | Senecio jacobaea | Vigour,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,90,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

The hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae (ex-Scrophulariaceae) are characterized by a distinctive suite of ecophysiological traits. These traits have important impacts on host plants and non-host plants, and influence interactions with other trophic levels. Ultimately, they can affect community structure and functioning. Here, we review these physiological traits and discuss their ecological consequences. 2. The root hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae form a convenient subset of the parasitic angiosperms for study because: they are the most numerous and most widely distributed group of parasitic angiosperms; their physiological characteristics have been well studied; they are important in both agricultural and (semi)natural communities; and they are tractable as experimental organisms. 3. Key traits include: high transpiration rates; competition with the host for nutrients and haustorial metabolism of host-derived solutes; uptake of host-derived secondary metabolites; dual autotrophic and heterotrophic carbon nutrition; distinct carbohydrate biochemistry; high nutrient concentrations in green leaf tissue and leaf litter; and small (often hairless and non-mycorrhizal) roots. 4. Impacts on the host are detrimental, which can alter competitive balances between hosts and non-hosts and thus result in community change. Further impacts may result from effects on the abiotic environment, including soil water status, nutrient cycling and leaf/canopy temperatures. 5. However, for non-host species and for organisms that interact with these (e.g. herbivores and pollinators) or for those that benefit from changes in the abiotic environment, the parasites may have an overall positive effect, suggesting that at the community level, hemiparasites may also be considered as mutualists. 6. It is clear that through their distinctive suite of physiological traits hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae, have considerable impacts on community structure and function, can have both competitive and positive interactions with other plants, and can impact on other trophic levels. Many community level effects of parasitic plants can be considered analogous to those of other parasites, predators or herbivores.",75,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Community diversity | Competition | Decomposition | Foraging | Herbivory | Host range | Nutrient cycling | Parasitic plants | Secondary metabolites | Trophic interactions,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,91,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Regional distributions of plants could be determined by local dispersal processes or by extreme long-range dispersal. The importance of dispersal scale was examined by comparing regional frequencies of 36 forest herbs with predicted frequencies generated by a dynamic landscape model that only allowed local dispersal. The model was parameterized to land use turnover in south-eastern Pennsylvania and northern Delaware, USA, for the period of 300 years since initial forest clearance. 2. The model successfully predicted the frequencies of fleshy fruited and ant-dispersed forest herbs in the modern landscape, but failed to predict frequencies of adhesive species or of all species considered together. No attempt was made to predict the frequency of wind-dispersed species, which were infrequent in these forests. 3. Frequencies of species in the modern landscape appeared to be controlled, by the time available for spread after emerging from a period of low habitat frequency in the 19th century. 4. Species dispersed by ingestion of fruits were more abundant than predicted, probably due to gap-crossing by animal dispersal vectors. Ingested species appear to have spread at a rate only achievable by modelled species in an artificially long time frame. 5. The predictive power of a model based on local dispersal implies that extreme long-range dispersal is rare on the time-scale of human land use and does not significantly influence regional distributions. 6. Predicted frequencies were ≤ 20% for all species, consistent with an observed decline in forest species diversity. Herb species impoverishment can be interpreted as a distinct vegetational condition created by 18th-century forest clearance, which will probably be detectable for at least another century. 7. Seed dispersal ability appears to be critical to the regional survival of forest herb species.

Competition is widely thought to be responsible for constraining species limits at the favourable ends of freshwater flooding gradients. However, field studies testing this idea rarely consider the role of competition beyond a species' field distribution limits. 2. To test whether species distributions are, instead, constrained by physiological limits, and only narrowed by biotic interactions, we measured the effect of competition on survival and fecundity of Rumex crispus and Rumex palustris within and above their distribution range along an elevation gradient in a river floodplain. 3. Flooding reduced the fitness of both species at the lowest elevations. A decline in fitness was also noticed at the two highest elevations in control as well as in removal plots, although standing crop measurements indicated that conditions here were the most favourable. 4. Both leaf herbivore damage and likeliness of drought increased with elevation. Because herbivore damage only reinforced prevailing abiotic influences, drought appeared to be the strongest constraint at higher positions. 5. Competition merely narrowed both species' physiological ranges by displacing them downwards from their optimum and maximum elevation. The displacement was strongest for the weak competitor Rumex palustris. 6.

The sites differed with respect to shoot density and sediment composition, with an active die-off occurring at only one of the sites. 2. Meristematic oxygen content followed similar diel patterns at all sites with high oxygen content during the day and hyposaturation relative to the water column during the night. Minimum meristematic oxygen content was recorded around sunrise and varied among sites, with values close to zero at the die-off site. 3. Gaseous sulphide was detected within the sediment at all sites but at different concentrations among sites and within the die-off site. Spontaneous invasion of sulphide into Thalassia rhizomes was recorded at low internal oxygen partial pressure during darkness at the die-off site. 4. A laboratory experiment showed that the internal oxygen dynamics depended on light availability, and hence plant photosynthesis, and on the oxygen content of the water column controlling passive oxygen diffusion from water column to leaves and belowground tissues in the dark. 5. Sulphide invasion only occurred at low internal oxygen content, and the rate of invasion was highly dependent on the oxygen supply to roots and rhizomes. Sulphide was slowly depleted from the tissues when high oxygen partial pressures were re-established through leaf photosynthesis. Coexistence of sulphide and oxygen in the tissues and the slow rate of sulphide depletion suggest that sulphide reoxidation is not biologically mediated within the tissues of Thalassia. 6. Our results support the hypothesis that internal oxygen stress, caused by low water column oxygen content or poor plant performance governed by other environmental factors, allows invasion of sulphide and that the internal plant oxygen and sulphide dynamics potentially are key factors in the episodes of sudden die-off in beds of Thalassia testudinum.

The results suggest some congruence between the three populations and indicate that post-germination processes shape the spatial variation in recruitment more than pre-germination processes. Although between-plot variation in recruitment: was mostly explained by seedling emergence and mortality, factors such as seed production and removal still have significant effects on recruitment through various, and frequently contrasting, pathways. 4.

We investigated whether (±)-catechin, a phytotoxin exuded from the roots of the exotic invader Centaurea maculosa (spotted knapweed), is also one of the factors that regulates C. maculosa recruitment. 2 Adding activated carbon, which adsorbs organic compounds, to soil around C. maculosa adults in the field increased seedling density by 78% 25 days after sowing, and by 34% 32 days after sowing, suggesting that soil-borne compounds inhibited or delayed recruitment. 3 Analysis of field soils near mature C. maculosa revealed that they can contain exceptionally high (±)-catechin concentrations (mean = 1.55 mg g -1 dry soil, with 60% of samples containing ≥ 1.0 mg (±)-catechin g -1 ). 4 In laboratory experiments, treatment with ≥ 1.0 mg (±)-catechin mL -1 reduced seedling root elongation by > 50%, indicating that field concentrations are sufficient to inhibit C. maculosa recruitment. Provided that 10% methanol was used to maintain (±)-catechin in solution for > 1 day, treatment with ≥ 1.0 mg mL -1 also reduced C. maculosa germination by > 70%. 5 (±)-Catechin maintained in solution with methanol did not significantly reduce C. maculosa seed survival, suggesting that inhibition of germination was due, at least in part, to delayed germination rather than to seed mortality. 6 Depending on the solubility of (±)-catechin in soil and on the duration of its effects on recruitment, C. maculosa may avoid intraspecific competition or regulate the timing of seedling establishment by reducing seedling growth or postponing germination in response to its own phytotoxin. 7 Chemical regulation of C. maculosa recruitment, as demonstrated here, suggests a dual role of (±)-catechin as an allelochemical and an autoinhibitor.

We also found evidence of observation errors for measurements of tree growth and, to a more limited degree, recruitment. Loglinear analysis provided evidence of significant temporal variation in demographic rates for only two of the 17 populations. 3 Total population sizes were strongly predicted by model projections, although population dynamics were dominated by carryover from the previous 5-year time step (i.e. there were few cases of recruitment or death). Fractional changes to overall population sizes were less well predicted. Compared with a null model and a simple demographic model lacking size structure, matrix model projections were better able to predict total population sizes, although the differences were not statistically significant. Matrix model projections were also able to predict short-term rates of survival, growth and recruitment. Mortality frequencies were not well predicted. 4 Our results suggest that simple size-structured models can accurately project future short-term changes for some tree populations.

We used inverse modelling to parameterize spatially-explicit seedling recruitment functions for nine canopy tree species in the Luquillo Forest Dynamics Plot (LFDP), Puerto Rico. We modelled the observed spatial variation in seedling recruitment following Hurricane Georges as a function of the potential number of seedlings at a given location (based on local source trees and the potential contribution of parents from outside of the mapped area) and of light levels and density-dependent mortality during establishment. We adopted the model comparison paradigm and compared the performance of increasingly complex models against a null model that assumes uniform seedling distribution across the plot. 2. Our data supported a model in which parents must reach a threshold size before any seedling production will occur. Once parents attain that size, the relationship between tree diameter and the number of seedlings produced is fairly flat for the majority of species. These results contradict previous analyses that simply assumed a linear relationship between biomass and seedling production and a uniform size threshold for seedling production across species. 3. The majority of species tested supported models that included at least one of a bath term (contribution from non-local trees), conspecific density dependence and light availability after the hurricane. Density dependence shifted the mode of the effective dispersal kernel away from potential parent trees and significantly reduced the number of seedlings established near parent trees. Recruitment from non-local sources accounted for 6-81% of observed seedling recruitment depending upon the tree species. Light availability appeared to divide species into three groups that showed more successful seedling establishment at low (< 5% of full sun), intermediate or high light levels (> 30% full sun). 4. Differences between individual species in the importance of local vs. bath recruitment and the intensity of density dependence suggest the existence of distinct recruitment syndromes that go beyond the traditional focus of tropical tree life histories.

Dispersal of endozoochorous seed involves uptake by a herbivore and exposure to different kinds of digestive fluids during passage through the gastrointestinal tract. Assessment of the ecological significance of endozoochory therefore requires examination of the survival rate of seeds during this phase. 2. A feeding experiment was conducted with seeds of 19 plant species that are important constituents of temperate semi-natural grasslands and five animal species (two ruminants, two colon fermenters and a caecum fermenter). Mean retention time of germinable seeds was determined and seed characteristics that might affect germination success were examined. 3. Gut-passed seeds had a much lower germination success (0-26%) than non-gut-passed seeds either sown directly on dung (2-79%) or bare soil (7-89%). 4. Relative germination success differed considerably between both plant and animal species. This may result from complex, herbivore-specific interactions between animal behaviour (chewing, digestion) and seed characteristics. 5. Germination success was positively related to seed longevity and, remarkably, also to seed mass and seed shape. Retention time of germinable seeds varied from c. 12 hours (rabbit) to 72 hours (ungulates), potentially allowing long-distance seed dispersal. This study highlights both the complex interaction between animal species and seed characteristics and the considerable differences in germination success of gut-passed seeds, which exist between plant species.

We present evidence of trade-offs in competitive ability among five perennial C4 grass species at different levels of soil fertility and disturbance in a garden experiment in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. 2. Our goals were to examine plant strategy theory, using grass species that differed widely in various traits and in their response to environmental influences. More specifically, we wished to examine whether the importance of competition was less in low fertility or regularly disturbed environments (stressed environments) than in more fertile or undisturbed conditions, and whether species made trade-offs in competitive ability along such stress gradients. 3. The trend in the competitive ability of two species in mixture along a soil fertility gradient tended to be inversely related if one had narrow and the other broad leaves or they differed in height, providing strong evidence for trait trade-offs. Thus, a tall broad-leaved species, Panicum maximum, was the most competitive species in fertile subplots, whereas a tall narrow-leaved species, Hyparrhenia hirta, was the most competitive species in infertile subplots, but no difference in competitive ability across a fertility gradient was observed when both species in a mixture had similar traits. 4. Regular cutting altered competitive interactions amongst species resulting in a short species, Themeda triandra, having a greater competitive effect on neighbours and a better response to neighbours in cut than in the less stressed uncut treatments, suggesting a trade-off for competitive ability in regularly disturbed habitats. However, cutting only improved the performance of T. triandra against P. maximum in infertile subplots. 5. We demonstrated that for some, but not all, mixtures of species, competitive hierarchies may reverse along gradients of soil fertility and disturbance.

Soil science and ecology have developed independently, making it difficult for ecologists to contribute to urgent current debates on the destruction of the global soil resource and its key role in the global carbon cycle. Soils are believed to be exceptionally biodiverse parts of ecosystems, a view confirmed by recent data from the UK Soil Biodiversity Programme at Sourhope, Scotland, where high diversity was a characteristic of small organisms, but not of larger ones. Explaining this difference requires knowledge that we currently lack about the basic biology and biogeography of micro-organisms. 2. It seems inherently plausible that the high levels of biological diversity in soil play some part in determining the ability of soils to undertake ecosystem-level processes, such as carbon and mineral cycling. However, we lack conceptual models to address this issue, and debate about the role of biodiversity in ecosystem processes has centred around the concept of functional redundancy, and has consequently been largely semantic. More precise construction of our experimental questions is needed to advance understanding. 3. These issues are well illustrated by the fungi that form arbuscular mycorrhizas, the Glomeromycota. This ancient symbiosis of plants and fungi is responsible for phosphate uptake in most land plants, and the phylum is generally held to be species-poor and non-specific, with most members readily colonizing any plant species. Molecular techniques have shown both those assumptions to be unsafe, raising questions about what factors have promoted diversification in these fungi. One source of this genetic diversity may be functional diversity. 4. Specificity of the mycorrhizal interaction between plants and fungi would have important ecosystem consequences. One example would be in the control of invasiveness in introduced plant species: surprisingly, naturalized plant species in Britain are disproportionately from mycorrhizal families, suggesting that these fungi may play a role in assisting invasion. 5. What emerges from an attempt to relate biodiversity and ecosystem processes in soil is our extraordinary ignorance about the organisms involved. There are fundamental questions that are now answerable with new techniques and sufficient will, such as how biodiverse are natural soils? Do microbes have biogeography? Are there rare or even endangered microbes? © 2005 British Ecological Society.",208,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,1,1,Biodiversity | Global change | Invasive species | Mycorrhizas | Soil,29602,EP/G066728/1,1,TRUE,101,all,All Open Access,EPSRC,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council

A mutualism is a mutually beneficial interaction between individuals of two species. Here we show that the degree of benefit resulting from an interaction depends on whether adaptation within the mutualism is considered. 2. A species' proximate response measures the short-term effect of addition or removal of the partner species, without allowing for any adaptation. We define a proximate mutualism as an interaction in which removal of each partner results in a decreased performance of the other, i.e. both species show a positive proximate response to the presence of the partner. 3. A proximate mutualism might, however, only reflect evolved dependence (i.e. the species has lost its ability to perform well without the partner). Some authors therefore insist on an ultimate criterion, regardless of the use of proximate responses in almost all empirical studies. 4. A species' ultimate response measures the long-term effect of adding or removing the partner species, thus allowing the focal species to adapt. In an ultimate mutualism neither partner could ever have performed as well without the other. In other words, a mutualism is called ultimate if both species show a positive ultimate response to the presence of the partner. Despite the conceptual attractiveness of this definition, ultimate responses are difficult to measure, rendering its use operationally problematic. 5. Mutualistic evolution, the evolution of a trait that is costly to the bearer but beneficial to its partner, is not, paradoxically, a necessary consequence of either proximate or ultimate mutualism. Another counterintuitive result is that even obligate mutualisms are not necessarily ultimate interactions. 6. We conclude that the proximate response is the only workable criterion for mutualism. Our understanding of mutualism, however, requires further evaluation of how evolved dependence may be responsible for such responses. 7.

Size-dependent competition was modelled with different rules to partition overlapping zones of influence. 3. The experiment used genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana with different morphological plasticity and hence size-dependent competition. Compared with wild types, transgenic individuals over-expressed phytochrome A and had decreased plasticity because of disabled phytochrome-mediated shade avoidance. Therefore, competition among transgenics was more asymmetric compared with wild-types. 4. Density-dependent mortality under symmetric competition did not substantially change the initial spatial pattern. Conversely, simulations under asymmetric competition and experimental patterns of transgenic over-expressors showed patterns of survivors that deviated substantially from random mortality independent of initial patterns. 5. Small-scale initial patterns of wild types were regular rather than random or clumped. We hypothesize that this small-scale regularity may be explained by early shade avoidance of seedlings in their cotyledon stage. 6.

Clonal populations face a trade-off between sexual recruitment and vegetative growth and, once established, may undergo continuous declines in genotypic diversity if their sexual recruits make poor competitors. The geological history of delta formation in the Lower Mississippi River Valley was used to age eight 5. alterniflora marshes for use in a space-for-time substitution ranging over 1500 years, in order to determine the long-term effects of clonal growth on genotypic diversity in natural populations. 2. We also predicted that highly heterozygous clones are competitively superior, leading to an increase in the overall level of genetic diversity as a marsh ages and/or to an increasingly positive relationship between clone size and individual heterozygosity, and that the clumping of ramets within clones will occur over increasingly large distances as populations age, while the clumping of genetically related clones will become less pronounced as intraclonal competition begins to obscure the initial effects of localized seedling recruitment. 3. Using molecular markers to differentiate clones, we documented a decline in clonal richness at the rate of approximately 1% 100 years -1 that was accompanied for the first 300-500 years by an increase in the distance over which clumping of ramets within genets occurred. Older populations, in the 500-1500-year range, showed evidence of clone fragmentation. 4. The spatial clustering of kin was observed for only two marshes, and exhibited no clear relationship with marsh age. 5.

Genetically based phenotypic and ecotypic variation in a dominant plant species can influence ecological functions and patterns of recruitment by other species in plant communities. However, the nature and degree of importance of genotypic differences is poorly understood in most systems. 2. The dominant salt marsh species, Spartina alterniflora, is known to induce facultative and competitive effects in different plant species, and the outcomes of interactions can be affected by nutrients and flooding stress. Clonal genotypes, which maintained their different plant architecture phenotypes throughout 31 months of a field experiment, underwent considerable genet-specific senescence in their centres over the last 12 months. 3. Different clonal genotypes and different locations (robust edges vs. senescent centres) permitted significantly different levels of light penetration of the canopy (14.8-77.6%), thus establishing spatial heterogeneity for this important environmental factor. 4. S. alterniflora clonal genotype influenced the degree of suppression of the previously dominant Salicornia bigelovii as well as facilitation of recruitment and growth by other plant species. Aster subulatus and Atriplex, patula performed better in Spartina clone centres, and experienced reduced growth in Salicornia-dominated areas. 5. Four other high marsh species (Borrichia frutescens, Aster tenuifolius, Iva frutescens and Limonium carolinianum) colonized only into Spartina clones but not into the Salicornia-dominated area. 6. These results suggest that differences in clone size, centre senescence, stem density, height, total stem length and biomass in different genotypes of a dominant marsh plant species can influence recruitment and growth of other plant species. The spatial pattern of habitat heterogeneity is, at least in part, dependent on the genotypic diversity, and possibly the genetic diversity, of such foundation species. 7.

Most theory and empirical research on exotic invasions is based on the assumption that problematic exotics are much more abundant in the regions where they invade than in the regions where they are native. However, the overwhelming majority of studies on exotic plants have been conducted solely within the introduced range. With few exceptions, ecologists know surprisingly little about the abundance, interaction strengths and ecosystems impacts of even the best-studied exotics in their native range. 2. We argue that taking a biogeographical approach is key to understanding exotic plant invasions. On a descriptive level, unambiguous quantification of distributions and abundances of exotics in native and introduced ranges are crucial. Experiments conducted at a biogeographical scale are also necessary to elucidate the mechanisms that enable highly successful exotics to occur at substantially higher abundance in their introduced vs. native communities. 3. We summarize the leading hypotheses for exotic plant success. We assert that tests of these major hypotheses for invasions (the natural enemies, evolution of invasiveness, empty niche and novel weapons hypotheses) require comparative biogeographical approaches. 4. In addition to focusing on comparative work in the native and introduced range, we also suggest other approaches that could yield important insight into processes that influence exotic success. 5.

We investigated resource limitations in a saltbrush scrub community along a salinity-alkalinity gradient in the Mojave Desert of North America. Previous studies have shown that, as productivity declines with increasing soil stress, there are parallel declines in leaf Ca and Mg, suggesting availability of these resources may limit growth in addition to water, N and P limitations expected in deserts. 2. To determine which soil resources limited growth of the dominant shrub, Atriplex parryi, and whether this differed along the soil stress gradient or among life stages, water and nutrients were applied in combination at different rates to plants at high- and low-stress sites. We developed and applied a conceptual model to identify resource limitations from this experiment. We also investigated how those limitations interacted to influence A. parryi growth and physiological function at the high-stress site. 3. Availability of soil N and P limited growth at the low-stress site and N, P and Mg limited growth at the high-stress site for both adult and juvenile life stages. There was no evidence that availability of water alone or K, Ca or other nutrients, or increasing soil Na and B, limited growth along the soil stress gradient. 4. When N, P, Mg and water were supplied in combination, plant growth increased more than 16-fold. Supply of these resources interacted to influence both plant growth and function. Because of the high demand for N relative to other resources, N supply rate was the major driver of these interactions, influencing the magnitude by which P and Mg affected growth. The major mechanism behind these growth responses was an increase in allocation to leaves relative to fine roots, rather than nutrient or water effects on water relations, photosynthesis or water use efficiency. 5. Multiple, interacting resources limit the growth and distribution of A. parryi on a saline, alkaline Mojave Desert site.

Tests of the relationship between resident plant species richness and habitat invasibility have yielded variable results. I investigated the roles of experimental manipulation of understorey species richness and overstorey characteristics in resistance to invader establishment in a floodplain forest in south-western Virginia, USA. 2. I manipulated resident species richness in experimental plots along a flooding gradient, keeping plot densities at their original levels, and quantified the overstorey characteristics of each plot. 3. After manipulating the communities, I transplanted 10 randomly chosen invaders from widespread native and non-native forest species into the experimental plots. Success of an invasion was measured by survival and growth of the invader. 4. Native and non-native invader establishment trends were influenced by different aspects of the biotic community and these relationships depended on the site of invasion. The most significant influence on non-native invader survival in this system of streamside and upper terrace plots was the overstorey composition. Non-native species survival in the flooded plots after 2 years was significantly positively related to proximity to larger trees. However, light levels did not fully explain the overstorey effect and were unrelated to native survivorship. The effects of understorey richness on survivorship depended on the origin of the invaders and the sites they were transplanted into. Additionally, native species growth was significantly affected by understore y plot richness. 5. The direction and strength of interactions with both the overstorey (for non-native invaders) and understorey richness (for natives and non-natives) changed with the site of invasion and associated environmental conditions.

Droughts and fires are increasingly recognized as a significant component of tropical rain forest dynamics but detailed large-scale assessments of such events are scarce. Here we examine tree mortality in a lowland rainforest in East Kalimantan after an extreme drought (the most severe ever reported in a tropical forest study), and a subsequent fire. Eighteen 1.8-ha paired permanent plots that crossed a firebreak allowed us to examine the separate effects of the two events. 2. Eight months after the drought, stem mortality in unburned forests reached 18.5 ± 5.6% (average ± SD ≥ 10 cm diameter breast height, d.b.h.). After 21 months, this increased to 26.3 ± 5.0%. Mortality was higher in larger stems, being 46.6 ± 18.7% in stems > 80 cm d.b.h., but falling to 23.9 ± 3.7% in stems 10-20 cm d.b.h. (after 21 months). The burned forest showed an overall mortality of 64.2 ± 12.2%. This increased to 79.0 ± 10.2% after 21 months. 3. By subtracting mortality after drought alone from mortality with fire in each plot pair, we can estimate the distinct influence of drought and subsequent fire. Fire caused near complete mortality for individuals < 10 cm d.b.h., but did not increase tree mortality for individuals > 70 cm d.b.h. 4. Drought contributes approximately 30% of the stem death observed in the burned forest after 21 months but the estimated contributions to dead basal area and biomass are higher at 52% and 63%, respectively. The forest contained around 7.3 tonnes ha-1 (± 2.2, 95% confidence) of above-ground biomass as dead trees (≥ 10 cm d.b.h) prior to the drought, rising to 133 ± 30 tonnes ha-1 21 months after drought alone, and 207 ± 50 tonnes ha-1 in burned forest. 5. Eusideroxylon zwageri survived the drought with only 5% mortality after 21 months. Overall per-species mortality appears negatively correlated to wood density, though Koompassia malaccensis, with 64% mortality, is an outlier. 6.

Consequently, species well represented at large sizes, mainly Dipterocarpaceae, increase in relative dominance compared with smaller taxa. Palm mortality was low, reaching only 3% after drought and 10% in burned forest. 7. The stem mortalities recorded in this study are amongst the most severe ever observed in rainforest.

In Southeastern North America residual mature deciduous forests have long been assumed to represent the stable endpoint of succession, with local compositional variation reflecting primarily variation in soils and topographic position. However, the long-term stability of understorey vegetation in this region has rarely been examined due to the lack of reliable baseline data. 2. We resampled a series of permanently marked vegetation plots spanning a range of soil and site conditions in the Piedmont of North Carolina to evaluate compositional change in the understorey of putative 'climax' hardwood forests over a 23-year period. We examined all ground-layer species for change in total and native species richness at 25 m2 and 1000 m2, change in species composition and variation in richness and composition with environment. 3. Although native and total species richness remained nearly constant, there was a significant decline in herb richness balanced by a strong increase in tree seedling richness. Species composition changed significantly across all plots with strong evidence of consistency in the direction of plot-level compositional change. 4. Change in herb species richness over time was strongly correlated with environment at 25 m2. Sites with higher pH, percentage sand and soil cations exhibited less decline in herb species than other sites. Understorey richness tended to increase more over time on low-elevation, mesic sites as opposed to higher, dry sites. 5. The systematic changes in herbaceous species richness and woody seedling abundance do not support the expectation of stability and may be due to the elimination of ground fires and widespread grazing in the early twentieth century, exotic species invasion or increases in white-tailed deer populations. 6. The lack of stability we observed for mature vegetation of the Carolina Piedmont is likely to be representative of temperate forests in general.

Spatial and temporal pattern of nutrient delivery to individual plants and plant populations can affect growth and allocation of biomass to roots and shoots. We predicted that it would also affect attributes of plant community structure, including species composition, diversity, and partitioning of biomass between above- and below-ground parts. We tested these predictions experimentally by providing the same quantity of nutrients in five different patterns to sown plant communities grown under field conditions for 2 years. We used orthogonal contrasts to compare the effects on community structure of homogeneous vs. heterogeneous nutrient supply, supply of nutrients in patches at two different densities, and provision of nutrients in spatially predictable vs. unpredictable patches. We harvested above- and below-ground plant biomass, and measured species richness, diversity, and species population sizes. 2. Pattern of nutrient delivery significantly affected community biomass and below-ground : above-ground biomass partitioning. Treatments with the lowest density of nutrient-rich patches supported 44% more total biomass than homogeneous treatments, largely as a result of greater (71% more) below-ground biomass, which resulted in a 39% increase in community below-ground : above-ground biomass ratio. 3. Above-ground community composition was also affected by treatment. There were several instances in which biomass, percentage cover or population sizes of different species, were affected by treatment. There were few significant differences between communities in treatments with predictable and unpredictable nutrient patches. Treatment did not affect species richness or diversity, despite high power to detect small differences. 4.

Nutrient-rich litter of hemiparasites (and N-fixers) has the potential to influence ecosystem-level decomposition and nutrient cycling, which may be important in ecosystems where productivity is nutrient limited. This influence may be both direct, and indirect via impacts on the decomposition of other species' litters in mixed-species litter layers. 2. We investigate the importance of these direct and indirect effects of sub-arctic hemiparasite litter in a litterbed study and a field litterbag experiment, and compare these data with those from a microcosm study also involving litter mixtures. 3. Field-placed litterbags demonstrate for the first time the direct importance of hemiparasite litter on decomposition and nutrient cycling in a field setting: litter of the hemiparasite Bartsia alpina lost 18 times more N over 2 years than Betula nana litter. 4. The majority of this N was released during the growing season, strongly supporting the proposal that hemiparasites can have a substantial direct impact on nutrient availability to other plants. The short spring and autumn periods were important for litter mass and N dynamics, with consequences for predicting effects of environmental change. 5. However, hemiparasite litter did not indirectly affect the decomposition rate or nutrient release from litter mixtures in field-placed litterbags. Furthermore, the direction and magnitude of litter mixing effects on mass loss varied strongly between methods; interactions were absent or negative in the litterbed, non-significant in field litterbags and positive in microcosms. 6. We thereby demonstrate the importance of the decomposition environment, rather than species-specific litter quality, in determining litter-mixing interactions, with implications for evaluating the impact of particular species on ecosystem carbon and nutrient fluxes via litter mixing 7.
