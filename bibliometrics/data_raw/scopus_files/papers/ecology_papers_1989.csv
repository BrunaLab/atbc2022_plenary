Mean size at the initiation of metamorphosis was correlated positively with average zooplankton biomass during the larval period, which suggests that food was limiting in many ponds. Reducing larval density did not increase zooplankton biomass, number, or density relative to controls. Many populations exhibited Type II suvival, but survival tended towards Type I at sites where ponds contracted severely near the end of the larval period. Mortality associated with pond contraction was due to changes in biotic or physical factors associated with pond contraction. Most larvae suffered tail damage caused by attacks from conspecifics and/or invertebrates. High larval mortality in contracted ponds was associated with increased larval density and injury frequency. Intraspecific aggression may be more important than exploitative competition in explaining density dependence in Ambystoma larvae. -from Author",92,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

In 2 other sites located in stable areas farther from the lake, emergence averaged from 55-72.5%. The main effect of nutlet size on emergence was significant, although no interaction with distance from the lake was noted because of the lack of sand deposition at sites distant from the lake. Survival through the 1st season of seedlings located in one of the stable areas was only 9%, due to desiccation and the burrowing activity of mammals. Survival of seedlings in the other stable area, located on the 1st dune where naturally established L. caroliniense is found, averaged 36%. Most of these individuals fared far better than naturally established individuals located at greater distances from the lake, where lake climatic effects diminish. In an experiment, located at the periphery of a blowout, 2-4 cm of sand deposition favored emergence of seedlings in the 2 areas closest to the edge of the disturbance. There, seedlings produced by larger nutlets had a disproportionate advantage because of their ability to emerge from greater depths. In a site located further from the center of the blowout in a stable area, larger nutlets had no advantage during emergence. A combination of lake climatic effect and moderate sand deposition is most favorable for growth and establishment of this species. -from Author",15,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,3,NA,NA

Data were collected from 1973-1982 on the movement of individuals into and out of a color-banded flock. Most dispersal occurred in the fall, but yearling females also dispersed during the breeding season. Fall dispersal was primarily by juveniles and included males and females in equal abundance. Females transferred between neighboring flocks more often than males. Many males returned to their natal flocks after months of wandering. As a result, 89% of male yearlings, but only 48% of female yearlings was correlated with sex ratio in their natal and neighboring flocks; females joined flocks with strongly male-biased sex ratios and females left flocks with female-biased sex ratios. Low status of juveniles and yearlings, especially females, may explain why some dispersal occurred each year regardless of the sex ratio of the flock. Homing ability and number of relatives in a flock were only weakly related to the percentage of yearlings and juveniles emigrating. Five consequences of dispersal were: 1) flock members may become familiar with resources outside their home range; 2) the sex ratio of yearlings approaches 1:1, despite extreme and variable sex ratio biases among yearlings born in the flock; 3) in some years the yearling cohort is predominantly composed of immigrants and in other years natives predomimate; 4) immigrants have fewer relatives in the flock than natives have; and 5) the effective population size ranges from 222-370 and includes breeders of a flock and breeders in neighboring flocks. -from Authors",26,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,10,NA,NA

During prey transfer and initiation of copulation, males lift their own mass, the mass of the female, and the prey. The maximum mass that males carried was consistent with limitations predicted from laboratory experiments (maximum lift force of 54-63 N/kg of flight muscle). Load-lifting limitations must frequently constrain the size of females and prey that a male can carry in flight. Observed consequences of this constraint were that males in copula had significantly greater body mass and flight muscle ratio than randomly captured males; males and females mated assortatively for body size; and larger females were presented with smaller prey when male size was held constant. -from Author",31,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,46,NA,NA

Female condition at parturition and average foraging-trip duration appear to reflect prey availability.

The magnitude of the enrichment is influenced by temperature and humidity. The authors tested the proposal that leaf waters in plants with crassulacean acid metabolism show higher slopes (m in the leaf water equation δD = mδ18O + b) than in C3 plants. They determined the relationships between the stable hydrogen (δD) and oxygen (δ18O) isotope ratios of leaf waters collected during the diurnal cycle of evapotranspiration for Yucca schidigera, Ephedra aspera, Agave deserti, Prunus ilicifolia, Yucca whipplei, Heteromeles arbutifolia, Dyckia fosteriana, Simmondsia chinensis and Encelia farinosa growing at 2 sites in S California. Slopes (m in the above leaf water equation) ranged from 1.50-3.21, compared to c8 for meteoric water, but differences in slope could not be attributed to carboxylation pathway nor climate (coastal California vs. Sonoran Desert). Higher slopes were correlated with greater overall ranges of leaf water enrichment of D and 18O. Leaf water isotope ratios in plants with lower slopes were better correlated with temperature and humidity. Thus m in the equation is related to the overall residence time for water in the leaf and proportions of water subjected to repeated evapotranspiration enrichments of heavy isotopes. -from Authors",23,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,90,NA,NA

Two qualitatively different dynamic outcomes were possible: a stable steady state, and cyclic fluctuation in population density and space occupied. The crucial factor needed to produce cyclic fluctuations is a time delay between settlement and recruitment into the adult population. Introduction of density-dependent mortality in adults serves to stabilize the limit cycle. The effect of growth or development rate on stability depends upon the relationship between these rates and individual size or age, because increased growth may act to increase the area occupied at equilibrium (a destabilizing factor), but can cause developmental time lags to either increase or decrease in length. As a result, an unstable system can be stabilized by either an increase or a decrease in juvenile growth rate when adults do not grow, or grow more slowly than juveniles. -from Authors",86,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,91,NA,NA

Therefore, sporocarps of E. granulatus cannot be regarded as a high-quality dietary item in terms of the availability of nutrients.

The apparent barrier imposed by clearcuts diminished with the invasion of second growth. Except for the 4 species in the genus Glaphyrocanthon, all species were found more frequently in forested areas than in clearcuts. Glaphyrocanthon constituted 97% of the 717 individuals captured in clearcuts and was never captured in contiguous forest or 10 ha fragments. Forest fragments had fewer species, sparser populations and smaller beetles than comparable intact forest areas. The changes in dung and carrion beetle communities help explain the low rate at which dung decomposed in 1 ha fragments. -from Author",471,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,110,NA,NA

At the shallow end of the gradient, which contains seasonally high food levels and large amounts of the most preferred foraging microhabitat (the red algae Gelidium), interspecific competition was intense during seasons when food was scarce. This was accompanied by low overlap in use of feeding microhabitats. No competition was detected in deep areas that lacked Gelidium. In this portion of the resource gradient, low overlap occurred because there was no preferred microhabitat that both fishes could share. Low overlap in the deep habitat was a consequence of the slightly different foraging adaptations of each species. High resource overlap occurred when competition wad dampened by abundant food (in the shallow zone during food-rich seasons). Low overlap was either associated with strong competition (during periods of relative scarcity of food in the shallow zone) or its absence (deep waters which lacked the shared, preferred microhabitat).

Age, degree of development, and the mass of the alcid chick at fledging are extraordinarily variable between and within species. Nests are safe places (daily mortality of chicks is low) relative to the ocean, but growth in the nest is slow relative to that attainable at sea, because of the parental travel time between the nest and feeding areas. The chick therefore faces a trade-off in deciding when to make the transition from nest to ocean. A dynamic programming model incorporating 1) the differential growth and mortality in the nest and ocean habitats, and 2) assumptions about the relation between size and survival, accurately predicts the fledging age and mass of common murre Uria aalge (the only species for which reasonable estimates are available). The model suggests explanations for some other phenomena associated with the reproduction of alcids and other northern seabirds, viz the seasonal decline in mass at fledging, and the negative relation of mean fledging age and mass observed between colonies in several species.

However, prey defensive behavior and morphology affect not only encounter rates and capture success, but also attacks per encounter. Also, although significant differences were not seen among prey types in encounter rates or captures per attack, multiple regression analysis showed that these factors, in addition to attacks per encounter, contributed significantly to observed variation in capture rates among prey types in behavioral trials.

Clear evidence of adjustment of maternal investment was found at only 2 developmental stages: 1) number of inflorescences produced per plant, related to rainfall during the initiation of inflorescence buds; and 2) development of fertilized ovaries during the initial stage of fruit growth. -from Authors",9,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,151,NA,NA

Most forest understory species persisted through disturbance. Most colonizing species established within 2 yr after burning. Individualistic species responses were described by a series of broadly overlapping, unimodal curves of constancy and canopy cover, differing in time of initiation, duration and magnitude. Thus, early successional change was characterized by gradual shifts in the abundance of generally persistent species. Eleven population patterns (species groups) were identified. Interactions of life history traits and disturbance explain the temporal trends of common species. Within the groups of invading species, timing of initial establishment, as well as timing and magnitude of peak abundance were related to the origin of propagules, phenological traits, potential for vegetative expansion, and temporal and spatial variation in disturbance. Abundance patterns of invading species were also influenced by stochastic and historical factors. Contrasting responses of species between sites reflected differences in histories of logging and slash burning. Within the groups of residual species, temporal patterns of abundance reflected initial species distributions, resistance to logging and burning disturbance, mode of reproduction, morphological traits, and spatial variation in disturbance intensity.
