Matrix population models are usually constructed by employing average values of vital rates (survival, growth and reproduction) for each size category. Perturbation analyses of matrix models assess the influence of vital rates or matrix elements on population growth rate. They consider the impact of either an unstandardized (sensitivity analysis) or a mean-standardized (elasticity analysis) change in a model component. Certain vital rates are intrinsically more variable than others. This variation can be taken into account in variance-standardized perturbation analysis, which applies changes to vital rates in proportion to their variability. 2. We applied variance-standardized perturbation analysis to six plant species with different life histories (a forest understorey herb, two tropical forest palms and three tropical forest trees). 1500 random values were drawn from observed frequency distributions of each vital rate in each size category, and population growth rates (λ) were calculated for each of the simulations. 3. Variability differed widely between vital rates, being particularly high for growth and reproduction. Vital rate variation was negatively correlated with its effect on λ (measured by either sensitivity or elasticity). The variation in λ resulting from the sampling procedure differed between species (with higher values in shorter-lived plants) and vital rates (with particularly high values due to variation in growth rates). 4. The relationships between λ and vital rates were close to linear. Therefore, the product of sensitivity (or elasticity) and degree of variability of a vital rate was a good estimator of the variation in λ, explaining 95% of the variation in λ in the six study species. 5. Thus, a reliable estimation of the 95% confidence interval of λ due to variation in one of the vital rates can be calculated as the product of the 95% confidence interval of the vital rate and its sensitivity. 6. Our results suggest that variance-standardized perturbation analyses are a useful tool to determine the impact of vital rate variation on population growth rate.",53,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Demographic variation | Plant demography | Population growth rate | Sensitivity analysis | Variance-standardized perturbation,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

An experiment was carried out to test the hypotheses that in heterogeneous environments: (i) the size of species' root systems will be negatively correlated with their ability to place roots precisely in nutrient-rich patches; (ii) precision of root placement will be less affected by distance to nutrient patches in species with large root systems; (iii) species with greater precision in root placement will show greater variation in biomass (sensitivity) in response to heterogeneity in nutrient supply; and (iv) plants will be less precise in root placement, and will invest more biomass in above-ground structures or in fitness-related attributes, when in association with mycorrhizas. 2. Single plants of six herbaceous species (Arrhenatherum elatius, Festuca ovina, Plantago lanceolata, Campanula rotundifolia, Papaver rhoeas and Sonchus oleraceus) were grown in pots with mycorrhizas either present or absent. The same amount of nutrients was supplied either homogeneously or heterogeneously at different distances from the plants. Pots received the same quantity of nutrients in all treatments. 3. There was a significant negative correlation between species' root system biomass and precision. Several species, including some with large root systems, showed small but highly significant differences in precision between the various treatments. Only the high-precision species Papaver and the low-precision species Campanula exhibited sensitivity in biomass produced in response to different patterns of heterogeneity. 4. The precision with which roots were placed in nutrient-rich patches was affected by distance from patches in Papaver, the smallest-rooted species used in the experiment, and in Plantago, one of the larger-rooted species. There was no evidence to support the hypothesis that precision would be affected more by distance from nutrient patches in small-rooted species than in large-rooted species. 5. The presence of mycorrhizas did not affect precision of root placement in any species. However, allocation of biomass to roots was significantly lower in Arrhenatherum, and allocation to reproductive structures was significantly higher in Campanula, when mycorrhizas were present. 6. This study confirms that there are differences between species in precision of nutrient foraging that are related to root system size. It also shows that there is variation in precision within species in response to the location of nutrient-rich patches, and that the ability of a species to display precision in nutrient foraging is dependent on its environmental setting.",143,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Environmental heterogeneity | Morphological plasticity | Nutrient acquisition | Root distribution,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,2,all,All Open Access

We used forest stand history reconstruction to infer the relative roles of disturbance and climate warming on the population dynamics of Nothofagus menziesii (silver beech) dominated tree lines in north Westland, South Island, New Zealand. 2. Stem recruitment in tree line forests over the last 300 years has been episodic, has tended to occur in small, scattered parches, and has been dominated by the production of new stems from existing trees. Pulses of stem recruitment also coincide with episodes of abrupt decline in the radial growth of established trees. These patterns suggest that infrequent natural disturbances form localized canopy openings, damage trees that survive the event, and initiate the establishment of new trees and the production of new stems by surviving trees that fill these openings. 3. Climate warming in New Zealand since 1950 has had little effect on the recruitment of Nothofagus close to the tree line. There is a large seedling pool within the tree line forests, but recruitment will probably require a disturbance-related canopy opening. 4. Natural disturbances drive the population dynamics of Nothofagus tree lines and may modify their response to climate warming. Unlike many Northern Hemisphere tree lines, there has been no recent upward movement of the tree line or increase in seedling establishment. This difference could reflect the greater importance of natural disturbance for recruitment in the abrupt closed-canopy tree lines formed by light-demanding Nothofagus species in the Southern Hemisphere. However, given the ubiquity of disturbance effects in low-altitude forests in both hemispheres, future studies need to consider their role when investigating any tree line response to climate warming.",91,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Beech forest | Climate change | Forest disturbance | Growth suppressions | Temporal and spatial patterns,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,3,NA,NA

Both meadows and fens showed a hump-backed species density-biomass relationship, although there was much variability and the study did not include very highly productive sites. In fens a significant quadratic relationship was observed (R2 = 0.42). 3. Environmental factors could explain 57% (in meadows) and 40% (in fens) of variation in species density. The majority of the variance explained was attributable to factors that were not related to community biomass (increasing pH in meadows) or the organic soil-mineral soil gradient in fens. 4. Density of threatened species vs. biomass was also consistent with a hump-back curve covering a narrow biomass range. Density of threatened species increased with decreasing P availability, regardless of whether P availability was related to biomass (as in meadows) or not (fens).",65,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Acidity | Hydrology | Mineralization | Nutrient availability | Productivity | Species pool | Species richness | Wetland vegetation,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,4,NA,NA

Efforts to understand and forecast long-term forest dynamics are often hindered by limited data on mortality rates and longevity of trees in older stands. In this study, mortality data were analysed from 11-year permanent plot records in 10 tracts of hemlock-hardwood forest with little past human disturbance in the upper Great Lakes region, USA. 2. We compared tree size-mortality trends in mature stands (canopy trees mostly 100-170 years old) with those in true old-growth stands (canopy trees mostly 200-350 years old). Stem sections were also cut from 71 recently fallen trees to determine average and maximum longevity for canopy trees of each species. 3. All five mature stands had descending monotonic size-mortality trends for shade-tolerant species, with low rates of mortality (generally much less than 1% per year) for trees > 18 cm d.b.h. In contrast, all five old-growth stands had U-shaped mortality functions, with annual mortality rates of 1.5-2.9% for trees > 66 cm d.b.h. These size-mortality trends are biologically consistent with 'rotated sigmoid' size distributions observed for major species, although mortality rates were nearly size-invariant for trees between 18 and 66 cm d.b.h. 4. Both late-successional and gap-phase species had fairly high mortality rates for saplings (2-10 cm d.b.h.) of 25-34% over the 11-year period, which suggests that size distributions with moderately steep negative slopes are needed to compensate for mortality and ensure population sustainability. 5. Average age at time of death for canopy trees was 216 years for sugar maple (Acer saccharum) and 301 years for hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), suggesting that the biological transition from mature to old-growth forest probably doesn't occur on these sites until a stand age of about 180-250 years.",133,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Forest models | Old-growth definitions | Population sustainability | Tree life tables,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,5,all,All Open Access

Macrolichens are important for the functioning and biodiversity of cold northern ecosystems and their reindeer-based cultures and economies. 2. We hypothesized that, in climatically milder parts of the Arctic, where ecosystems have relatively dense plant canopies, climate warming and/or increased nutrient availability leads to decline in macrolichen abundance as a function of increased abundance of vascular plants. In more open high-arctic or arctic-alpine plant communities such a relationship should be absent. To test this, we synthesized cross-continental arctic vegetation data from ecosystem manipulation experiments simulating mostly warming and increased nutrient availability, and compared these with similar data from natural environmental gradients. 3. Regressions between abundance or biomass of macrolichens and vascular plants were consistently negative across the subarctic and mid-arctic experimental studies. Such a pattern did not emerge in the coldest high-arctic or arctic-alpine sites. The slopes of the negative regressions increased across 10 sites as the climate became milder (as indicated by a simple climatic index) or the vegetation denser (greater site above-ground biomass). 4. Seven natural vegetation gradients in the lower-altitude sub- and mid-arctic zone confirmed the patterns seen in the experimental studies, showing consistent negative relationships between abundance of macrolichens and vascular plants. 5. We conclude that the data supported the hypothesis. Macrolichens in climatically milder arctic ecosystems may decline if and where global changes cause vascular plants to increase in abundance. 6.

Sites dominated by each species were sampled in eight upland regions from North-umberland in the north-east to Dartmoor and Exmoor in the south-west, and shoot N variables were related to atmospheric N deposition data by regression analysis. For each species and Calluna type in each year, separate analyses were carried out against oxidized N (NOx) deposition, reduced N (NHx) and total N deposition. Shoot N variables were also tested for the influence of altitude and temperature. 3. None of the plant tissue variables tested was significantly correlated with NHx deposition and only Nardus N : P ratios were correlated with total N deposition. However, for all species except Nardus, Eriophorum and Molinia, shoot N concentration and/or assimilated N per hectare were significantly correlated with NOx deposition in at least one of the two years, as were N : P ratios for Calluna, Vaccinium and Nardus. 4. Most of the significant relationships were recorded with material sampled in 1997, rather than in 1996. 5. In terms of increased shoot N concentration, the response of mature Calluna was lower than that shown by previous work encompassing a different range of locations in the United Kingdom. 6. Increases in the amount of N per hectare accumulated in the current season's Calluna shoots exceeded corresponding increases in estimated annual deposition rates by several-fold, implying that N deposition has enhanced the accumulation of organic N in upland soils, leading to an increased pool of mineralizable N. 7. Significant relationships between N deposition and N : P ratios in shoot tissue suggested that this accumulation has changed a substantial proportion of Calluna-dominated uplands from N-limited ecosystems into P-limited ones.

We reconstructed the history of forest disturbance in two study areas, totalling 1412 ha, to quantify the role of such disturbance in structuring the conifer/hardwood forests. 2 We divided the study area into different land-surface types, aged trees on each land surface and identified cohorts of trees established in response to past disturbance. The type of disturbance (tree fall or erosion/sedimentation event) that initiated cohort establishment was determined from the type of land surface and other physical evidence. We also dated abrupt growth releases or suppressions in tree rings to aid disturbance history reconstruction. 3 Erosion and sedimentation events dominated the disturbance regime, affecting 86% of the study area in the last 650 years. Catchment-wide episodes of forest cohort-initiating disturbances were centred around 1820-30, 1710-20, 1610-20 and 1460 AD. Of the 51 cohorts identified in the study area, 47 were initiated during one of these episodes, when disturbance by erosion or sedimentation affected from 10-50% of the study area. Consequently, over 80% of the forested area currently comprises simple, first generation cohorts of trees established after catastrophic disturbance. Only 14% of the study area is more complex, all-aged forest. 4 Three disturbance episodes coincide with the three most recent Alpine fault earthquakes (c. 1717, 1630 and 1460 AD), while one coincides with earthquakes recorded to the south of the study catchment in 1826 AD.

Seedling recruitment was followed from 1993 to 1996 in four remnant Themeda triandra grassland sites in south-eastern Australia subjected to different long-term fire histories (1-, 2-, 4-year fire intervals, unburnt > 10 years). Multivariate analyses were used to separate the effects of site and year on recruitment and community dynamics. 2. Exotic species (mostly annual monocots such as Aira spp., Briza minor and Juncus capitatus) dominated the seedling flora at all sites in all years. Seedlings of most native species were absent or rare in all years, despite their abundance in the standing flora. 3. Seedling recruitment (richness and density) in the long unburnt grassland was significantly less than in burnt sites in all years. Hence, the seedling floristic composition of this site was substantially different from all other sites on PCA axis 1, which did not differ in all years. 4. Amongst burnt sites, some differences in the annual seedling cohort were evident on PCA axes 2 and 3, but these were due to small differences in the relative abundance rather than the composition of recruiting species. Seedling recruitment was not cued or promoted by fire but rather, seedling density was influenced by, and interacted with, yearly (presumably rainfall) variation. 5. Amongst the native species seen as seedlings, yearly emergence occurred in some cases (14 of 24 species) but always at low densities (< 10 seedlings/0.25 m2). Seedling survival amongst native species varied from nil (0%) to high (> 60%), with most mortality occurring in early summer. 6. The temporal and spatial variation observed in seedling regeneration suggests that long-term native species coexistence may be promoted by differences in the 'regeneration niche'.

Studies on the variability of natural fire regimes are needed to understand plant responses in a changing environment. Since vegetation changes might follow or trigger changes in fire frequency, climate models suggest that changes in water balance will accompany current global warming, and the response of fire regimes to Holocene hydro-climate changes and vegetation switches may thus serve as a useful analogue for current change. 2. We present high-resolution charcoal records from laminated cores from three small kettle lakes located in mixed-boreal and coniferous-boreal forest. Comparison with some pollen diagrams from the lakes is used to evaluate the role of the local vegetation in the fire history. Fire frequency was reconstructed by measuring the separation of peaks after detrending the charcoal accumulation rate from any background. 3. Several distinct periods of fire regime were detected with fire intervals. Between c. 7000-3000 cal. year BP, fire intervals were double those in the last 2000 years. Fire frequency changed 1000 years earlier in the coniferous-boreal forest than in the mixed-boreal forest to the south. The absence of changes in combustibility species in the pollen data that could explain the fire frequency transition suggests that the vegetation does not control the long-term fire regime in the boreal forest. 4. Climate appears to be the main process triggering fire. The increased frequency may be the result of more frequent drought due to the increasing influence of cool dry westerly Pacific air-masses from mid to late Holocene, and thus of conditions conducive to ignition and fire spread. In east Canada, this change matches other long-term climate proxies and suggests that a switch in atmospheric circulation 2-3000 years ago triggered a less stable climate with more dry summers.

The results of the first 2 years of the study have already been published. 2. After 2 years, invasion was strongly promoted by disturbance and less so by increased fertility. Three years later the cover of invaders had declined over most of the matrix, and the greatest cover of sown species was where the highest levels of fertility and disturbance coincided.

We concluded that a bryophyte favourability gradient existed along which biomass and shoot and species density increased. This gradient was attributed to positive interactions within dense bryophyte stands, high clonal fragmentation, absence of competitive hierarchies and to the limited ability of larger bryophyte species to replace small species along this favourability gradient. 4. Since species density for vascular plants varied independently from biomass and shoot density, there was no such favourability gradient as for bryophytes. Large size variation, predominantly negative interactions between species, and clonal integration of species (e.g. tussock-forming grasses and sedges) may be responsible for the different behaviour of the two taxonomic groups. 5. Bryophyte favourability decreased with increasing vascular plant biomass. Concerning light availability, we found highest bryophyte favourability at intermediate levels where the combination of radiation and moisture seems to be optimal for bryophytes. No relationship was found between bryophyte favourability and vascular plant shoot density and litter mass. 6. The negative relationship between bryophyte favourability and vascular plant biomass is important for bryophyte conservation. Stands of low vascular plant production are those with the potential for highest species richness, and should therefore receive conservation priority.",71,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Above-ground biomass | Favourability gradient | Positive interaction | Species diversity | Wetlands,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,14,NA,NA

An attempt was made to distinguish between autogenic successional processes and allogenic environmental forces. 2 Holocene sedimentation began c. 7500 cal. BC. The basin was occupied by a shallow open lake with substantial input of inorganic material until c. 6200 cal. BC, when floating reedswamp vegetation encroached on the lake surface. This turned to Carex fen within c. 100 years. Sphagnum transitional bog became established by c. 5300 cal. BC. 3 The local mire water table in the Sphagnum bog phases was elevated between c. 5700-6000 cal. BC, c. 5000-5250 cal. BC and c. 4500-4700 cal. BC. The most distinctive feature of the record is the coincidence of upland vegetation changes with reconstructed wet-shifts in mire hydrology. The upland pollen data imply selective exploitation of Ulmus and Corylus coupled with burning and soil erosion during the second and third wet periods. 4 Succession from shallow open lake to Sphagnum-bog is an autogenic process, although superimposed allogenic perturbation (human induced soil erosion and climate change) modified the expected progression from wetter to drier and from minerotrophic-water dependent to oligotrophic communities.",63,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Geochemistry | Human activity | Humification | Plant macrofossils | Pollen record | Wetland community succession,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,15,all,All Open Access

N deposition was significantly higher in four parks in densely populated regions than in two remote parks. 3. Available soil N increased significantly with N deposition across all parks. 4.

Differences between parks in tissue N concentrations were small, but forest expansion over five decades resulted in the mass of N in vegetation increasing by 74% in Elk Island but by only 26% in Jasper. δ15N in forest vegetation was significantly lower in Elk Island than in Jasper, suggesting that anthropogenic sources contribute significantly to the high rates of N entering that ecosystem. 5. We determined the rate of forest expansion within parks using six decades of aerial photographs. Parks in aspen parkland and boreal forest showed a strong positive relationship between forest expansion and N deposition.

The long-term benefits of root foraging in heterogeneous environments are unclear. The short duration of many previous studies may have overlooked the effects of patch depletion and root turnover, which may limit the long-term rewards of root foraging for perennial plants. 2. The benefits of root foraging were investigated for Holcus lanatus and Nardus stricta over two growing seasons. Shoot biomass of each species was measured in homogeneous nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor treatments and in a heterogeneous treatment consisting of a nutrient-rich and a nutrient-poor side, at a high and a low overall level of nutrient availability at the same patch contrast. Large initial differences in nitrate concentrations in the soil solution between the soil types disappeared so that, after several months, nitrate levels were low in all soil types. 3. In heterogeneous treatments, Holcus was able to proliferate roots in the nutrient-rich side compared with the nutrient-poor side, but only at the high overall level of nutrient availability. Nardus did not selectively place roots in the nutrient-rich side of the heterogeneous treatment at either nutrient level. 4. Root longevity, as determined by minirhizotron observations, revealed that roots of Holcus tended to be shorter lived than those of Nardus, and to live longer in nutrient-poor soils. 5. Initially, Holcus produced more shoot biomass in the heterogeneous treatments, at both overall levels of nutrient availability, than expected from values in the homogeneous treatments, but this advantage disappeared by the end of the first growing season and, after 2 years, shoot biomass in the heterogeneous treatments was much less than expected. At the high overall level of nutrient availability, Holcus shoot biomass was not significantly greater than that produced in the homogeneous nutrient-poor treatment. In contrast, shoot biomass of Nardus in the heterogeneous treatment was similar to the expected value, both after the first and second growing seasons. 6. For Holcus, fast root proliferation and presumably a high nutrient uptake resulted in increased shoot biomass in the short term, but this was then curtailed by rapid patch depletion and high losses due to a limited root life span.

Life history theory predicts that reproduction incurs costs in terms of future growth and survival. In infertile environments reproductive events may accelerate nutrient turnover such that losses of limiting nutrients cannot be replenished by uptake from the soil. 2. We compared the effect of reproduction on nitrogen (N) turnover and N use-efficiency, i.e. the annual dry matter produced per unit N lost, of three carnivorous species of the genus Pinguicula on an infertile subarctic heath. We hypothesized that reproduction should increase N turnover, unless a larger N pool or improved N resorption can compensate for the losses associated with reproduction. 3. These carnivorous herbs showed a nitrogen use strategy similar to that of non-carnivorous plants (herbs and grasses) with a relatively low mean residence time (MRT) of N and a large dry matter productivity per unit N in the plant (annual N productivity). N pool size and the efficiency of N resorption from senescent leaves were similar in reproductive and non-reproductive individuals. Reproductive individuals had significantly larger annual N losses and thus a lower average MRT (0.8 vs. 1.8 years), with values < 1 indicating that the annual N losses are greater than the annual average N pool. Unless plants can enhance their nutrient acquisition, flowering may therefore impact on future growth and survival. 4. This study presents evidence for a direct link between reproduction, reflected in a higher relative allocation to inflorescences, turnover and N use-efficiency; the latter being reduced because of increased N turnover.

The influence of botanical composition on annual phytomass production of a semi-arid grassland in response to precipitation was tested with a 19-year experiment. Three compositional states reflecting good, medium and poor rangeland condition, whose basal cover increased from poor through to good, were created in 1978. 2. Multiple regression models were developed for assessing whether phytomass was influenced by precipitation, composition, phytomass of the previous year, basal cover, abundance of individual species, or diversity. Composition and precipitation accounted for 66% of the variation in phytomass, but a separate model of basal cover by precipitation was equally successful. The linear effect of rainfall on phytomass was enhanced as composition improved from poor (0.076 g m-2 mm-1) through medium (0.197 g m-2 mm-1) to good (0.277 g m-2 mm-1). Phytomass increased for low precipitation if it had been high the preceding year. Phytomass was more variable over time with deteriorating condition. 3. Species' complementarity ensured greater and more stable production. Setaria sphacelata, Eragrostis chloromelas and Digitaria eriantha increased phytomass on the good or medium condition grasslands during drier years, whereas Themeda triandra had this effect during wetter years. 4. Precipitation-use efficiency (PUE) was influenced mostly by composition and a linear and quadratic effect of precipitation (63% of variance). Optimum PUE of 0.308, 0.203 and 0.096 g m-2 mm-1 for the good, medium and poor condition grasslands, respectively, occurred at intermediate amounts (±680 mm) of precipitation. PUE was increased if phytomass had been high the previous year. 5. Species' complementarity of PUE in response to precipitation was evident for all compositional states.

Mangrove forests are structurally complex with canopy gaps generated by physical disturbances such as storms and mounds created on the forest floor by biotic disturbances such as crabs excavating burrows. 2. I studied how variations in canopy cover and substratum topography influence the recruitment and demography of the mangrove Avicennia marina in a temperate forest in New South Wales, Australia. 3. Surveys showed that mounds covered up to 44% of the forest floor and were larger and covered more of the substratum under the canopy than in gaps. Propagules and new seedlings (i.e. the most recently established cohort) were more abundant under the canopy than in gaps and on flat areas than on mounds. 4. A field experiment tested whether the observed spatial distribution of new seedlings was due to differences in the secondary dispersal of propagules or in the establishment or early survivorship of seedlings. Propagules were supplied in equal densities on mounds and flats under the canopy and in gaps and then monitored for 10 months. 5. Four times as many propagules were dispersed away from mounds as from flats, and this difference was greater under the canopy than in gaps. In contrast, seedlings established more successfully on mounds, particularly in gaps, suggesting that this is an important microhabitat for recruitment. Seedling survival to 9 months was independent of habitat structure. 6. The influence of mounds on dispersal was, however, much greater than on establishment, so that densities of new seedlings 9 months after establishment were greater on flats. Patterns of seedling abundance in the mangrove forest are thus primarily driven by the influence of habitat structure on the supply of propagules. 7. In contrast, saplings were most abundant on mounds in gaps. Thus, there is a shift in the spatial distribution of the population from the early to the later stages of life history in relation to habitat structure. Long-term survival of seedlings and their development into saplings may depend both on light availability in gaps and on sediment disturbance resulting from the creation of mounds.

In oligotrophic habitats, proliferation of roots in nutrient-rich microsites may contribute to overall nutrient conservation by plants. Peat-based soils on mangrove islands in Belize are characterized by the presence of decaying roots and numerous old root channels (0.1-3.5 cm diameter) that become filled with living and highly branched roots of Rhizophora mangle and Avicennia germinans. The objectives of this study were to quantify the proliferation of roots in these microsites and to determine what causes this response. 2. Channels formed by the refractory remains of mangrove roots accounted for only 1-2% of total soil volume, but the proportion of roots found within channels varied from 9 to 24% of total live mass. Successive generations of roots growing inside increasingly smaller root channels were also found. 3. When artificial channels constructed of PVC pipe were buried in the peat for 2 years, those filled with nutrient-rich organic matter had six times more roots than empty or sand-filled channels, indicating a response to greater nutrient availability rather than to greater space or less impedance to root growth. 4. Root proliferation inside decaying roots may improve recovery of nutrients released from decomposing tissues before they can be leached or immobilized in this intertidal environment.

Macrofaunal leaf consumption and degradation of leaves, woody twigs and roots were studied in mangrove island forests on a Belizean island. Factors influencing accumulation of organic matter deposited both above and below ground in this oligotrophic, autochothonous system were assessed. 2. Leaf degradation rates of Rhizophora mangle (red mangrove), Avicennia germinans (black mangrove) and Laguncularia racemosa (white mangrove) measured in mesh bags, were much faster in the lower than the upper intertidal zone. Mass loss was most rapid in A. germinans but zonal effects were much larger than species differences. 3. Exposure to invertebrates such as crabs and amphipods tripled overall rates of leaf litter breakdown. In the lower intertidal, crabs completely consumed some unbagged leaves within 23 days. Crabs also had an effect on some upper intertidal sites, where degradation of leaves placed in artificial burrows was 2.4 times faster than when placed on the soil surface. 4. In contrast to leaves (27±5% remaining after 230 days), roots and woody twigs were highly refractory (40±2% and 51±6% remaining after 584 and 540 days, respectively). Root degradation did not vary by soil depth, zone or species. Twigs of R. mangle and A. germinans degraded faster on the ground than in the canopy, whereas those of L. racemosa were highly resistant to decay regardless of position. 5. Peat formation at Twin Cays has occurred primarily through deposition and slow turnover of mangrove roots, rather than above-ground tissues that are either less abundant (woody twigs) or more readily removed (leaves).",207,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Detritivores | Leaf burying crabs | Litter decomposition | Litter processing | Peat accumulation,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,28,all,All Open Access

The facilitative and inhibitory effects of a nitrogen-fixing shrub, Carmichaelia odorata, during primary succession were studied using both field measurements in a New Zealand temperate montane valley, and manipulative glasshouse experiments on seedlings of the three dominant tree species, Griselinia littoralis, Metrosideros umbellata and Weinmannia racemosa. 2. During a stand development chronosequence of <100 years in which Carmichaelia colonized, dominated and senesced, there was significant development of soil organic horizons and a large build-up of soil nitrogen, especially in the organic horizon. Soil organic matter and nitrogen levels across the sequence were strongly correlated with the main DCA axis of vascular plant species composition, along which there was change in dominance from herbaceous to woody species. Vegetation increased in height and light levels declined with stand development. 3. Similar responses to shade that mimicked that in mature Carmichaelia stands suggested that inhibitory effects were likely to be uniform across the three tree species. 4. Nitrogen, either added via Carmichaelia litter or in solution, enhanced shoot biomass and foliar nitrogen concentrations of all three tree species. Growth in soils of increasing development increased foliar nitrogen concentrations for Griselinia and Weinmannia, but not Metrosideros. 5. Overall, Metrosideros was the least responsive to potential facilitative effects of Carmichaelia, and Griselinia exhibited the highest degree of plasticity of response.

We measured whole-plant survival, frequency of leader (mainstem terminal bud) damage among survivors and growth responses of intact and damaged juveniles of three Acer species over 3 years along a microenvironmental gradient represented by the understorey and two sizes of artificially created canopy gaps in central Massachusetts, United States of America. 2. For all species combined, survival decreased while the frequency of leader damage among survivors increased across the gradient of microsite exposure. Acer rubrum L. (red maple) showed the highest survival (65-93%) but also very high leader damage (80-97%). Acer pensylvanicum L. (striped maple) showed fairly high survival (81-93%) in all but the most exposed microsites (24-36%) and had the lowest leader damage over-all (17-44%). Acer saccharum Marsh. (sugar maple) was intermediate for both survival (25-86%) and leader damage (55-96%). 3. Growth differed significantly among sites and species. Both intact and damaged plants showed greater growth in gaps than in understorey, particularly in large gaps. For most growth variables in most microsites, A. pensylvanicum ≥ A. rubrum > A. saccharum when plants were intact, but A. rubrum ≥ A. pensylvanicum > A. saccharum when damaged. Species differences in growth varied among sites, with large gaps producing more pronounced effects than small gaps and understorey for both intact and damaged plants. 4. Growth recovery was inversely related to leader damage frequency among species, and thus at least partially offset the effects of damage on net growth across the populations. 5. The microsite- and species-specific responses to leader damage may influence gap regeneration and forest composition. A. pensylvanicum may be favoured by its regrowth advantage over A. rubrum and A. saccharum in the understorey, where damage is likely to occur during prolonged pre-gap periods.

We assessed the contribution of regional (latitudinal) and landscape (topographic) patterns of species turnover to overall heterogeneity using data from 749 censuses. 3. A large proportion of the variation in species composition across the entire region was observed at very fine spatial scales (0.1-10 km2), associated with subtle topographic features and soil salinity gradients. Latitudinal variation played a secondary role. 4.

Light penetration declined linearly with increasing grass or shrub biomass, to a minimum of about 30% incident light at 500 g m-2 shoot mass.

Due to little photosynthetic acclimation to light, daily photosynthesis for plants under shrubs was reduced proportionally to the light regime. 3. Shading did not reduce stomatal conductance proportionally to photosynthesis, which led to decreased water use efficiency for plants under shrubs. Few differences were found in leaf water potential between microhabitats, indicating that little competition for water was occurring. 4.

Vegetation cover regularly punctuated by spots of bare soil is a frequent feature of certain semi-arid African landscapes, which are also characterized by banded vegetation patterns (i.e. tiger bush). 2. The propagation-inhibition (PI) model suggests that a periodic pattern characterized by a dominant wavelength can theoretically establish itself through a Turing-like spatial instability depending only on a trade-off between facilitative and competitive interactions among plants. Under strictly isotropic conditions, spotted and banded patterns are distinct outcomes of a unique process, whereas anisotropy leads to a banded structure. The model predicts that spotted patterns will have a lower dominant wavelength than bands. 3. We test some outcomes of the PI model against vegetation patterns observable in aerial photographs from West Africa. Two sites with rainfall of c. 500-600 mm year-1 were studied: a 525-ha plain in north-west Burkina Faso and a 300-ha plateau in southern Niger. Digitized photographs were subjected to spectral analysis by Fourier transform in order to quantify vegetation patterns in terms of dominant wavelengths and orientations. 4. Spotted vegetation proved highly periodic. The characteristic range of dominant wavelengths (30-50 m) was similar at two sites more than 500 km apart. The PI model suggests that spots may occur as a hexagonal lattice but there is little evidence of such patterning in the field. A dominant wavelength was far quicker to establish in simulations (c. 102-103 years for annual grasses) than a hexagonal symmetry (c. 105 years), and observed patterns are therefore likely to be far from the asymptotic structure. 5. Elongated and smudged spots that locally became flexuous bands have been observed in southern Niger.

Plants often suffer substantial loss of seeds to consumers. However, because the seed-to-seedling transition is frequently ignored, quantitative estimates of the effects of seed consumers on plant population dynamics are rare. 2. We examined how post-dispersal seed predation by rodents affected seedling emergence and subsequent adult plant abundance of bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus), a large N-fixing shrub common to coastal dunes in California. We monitored patterns of seedling emergence and survival over 3 years for seeds sown into exclosed and control plots. 3. We sowed additional cohorts of seeds in the second and third years and compared interannual variation in emergence patterns. 4. Rodent exclusion substantially reduced seedling emergence, with an average of 109 seedlings emerging over 3 years from 476 seeds sown in rodent exclusion plots vs. 26 from control plots. The intensity of granivory, however, varied between years, with rodent exclusion increasing emergence from seeds sown in year one, but not in year two. 5. Winter seedling mortality, due to cutworm herbivory, was similarly high in rodent-free and control plots, and its net impact was to reduce the difference in seedling abundance. Thus, by mid-summer in each of the three years, there were only marginally more seedlings in rodent-excluded vs. control plots. 6. The cumulative effect of protecting seeds, was, however, large. After 3 years, an average of four adult lupines were established in rodent-free plots, whereas only 0.5 were found in control plots and lupine biomass was more than 5-fold higher in exclusion plots. 7.

This trait convergence may be related to selection against small, dormant diaspores in the unstable regeneration niche. 3. Differences in dispersal potential and early growth of 12 species were compared with known patterns of distribution (across the shore, along estuaries, regional occurrence and continental range size) to test if tidal sorting of diaspores could account for adult spatial patterns. 4. Diaspore buoyancy, orientation, lateral root initiation, shoot initiation and early shoot extension differed among species but none correlated with adult zonation across the shore or along estuaries. However, some back-shore species had diaspores that were buoyant and were slow to initiate lateral roots and shoots. Patterns of early growth were partially related to the distribution along estuaries but salinity responses contributed to this zonation in only three species. 5. Regional distributions were unrelated to dispersal potential. However, the tendency of infrequent species to show slow growth in full seawater may account for the under-saturation of species in estuaries with appropriate habitats. The range size of the tropical mangroves appears unrelated to their dispersal potential and early growth traits. 6.

Nine tree species contributed at least 1% to the overall composition. Individuals of white pine and red pine were larger than all other species and represented 9% of the tree population, while accounting for 27% of the standing basal area. Black spruce, paper birch and larch, the three most abundant species, collectively accounted for 51% of the population and 38% of the basal area. 2. Eight physiographic zones were characterized by differences in glacial histories, geological surfaces, soil complexes and topographic properties, and supported different compositional mixes of the nine important species. 3. Fifty-six per cent of all four-tree plots had three or four individuals of a single species. This level of conspecific aggregation is an order of magnitude greater than would be expected based on a random distribution of the same population of trees and species. Jack pine had the greatest plot-scale aggregation, with 45% of all plots containing jack pine trees having three or four jack pine individuals. Jaccard association of similarity values of species co-occurrence ranged from less than 0.05 to 0.24, indicating limited plot-scale interspecific associations. 4. Landscape spatial patterns of the species were measured at two spatial scales, 1-10 km and from 5 to 50 km. Conspecific autocorrelation patterns were positive while interspecific autocorrelation patterns tended to be either neutral or negative. Hence, plots dominated by any given species tended to spatially aggregate near other such plots, out to substantial distances. 5.

We hypothesized that the survival of shade-tolerant juvenile trees in the understorey depends on allocation strategies that slow their growth but enhance recovery from herbivore damage. In contrast, allocation patterns should maximize height growth in gaps where competitors grow rapidly. We tested the interactive effects of canopy gaps and simulated herbivory (by removing the apical meristem, or 10%, 50% or 90% of tissue from all leaves) on juvenile (< 1 cm diameter at breast height) Shorea quadrinervis Sloot (Dipterocarpaceae), a dominant canopy tree in Borneo. 2. Damage did not diminish survival over 8 months, except for 90% foliage removal from understorey plants. Height growth in the understorey was negligible in both control and damaged plants. In gaps, height growth was stimulated by removal of either the apical meristem or 10% of leaf tissue; growth was reduced only after 90% foliage removal. 3. Higher damage levels increased subsequent net leaf loss. Leaf production was much greater, but leaf retention much lower, in gaps than in the understorey. Ninety per cent foliage removal drastically reduced production in gaps and retention in the understorey. After 10% defoliation, height growth was enhanced in gaps despite approximately 30% net leaf loss. 4. In a separate experiment, juveniles were moved from a shade house to gaps. After 8 months, gap plants had more leaves and more total biomass, but only half the root : shoot ratio of plants left in the shade. 5. Allocation patterns, together with the survival of understorey plants after all but the highest levels of damage, indicate that root : shoot allocation there tends to reduce the risk of mortality following herbivore or mechanical damage at the expense of growth. In contrast, in gaps, where interference competition for light is high, resource allocation apparently maximizes height growth.

The vertical and horizontal dynamics of peat carbon accumulation in Ruosuo aapa mire, north-central Finland, were investigated in an attempt to understand variations in carbon accumulation over time. 2. Paludification began around 8700 BP (9600 cal BP). The long-term net carbon accumulation rate, based on vertical and lateral growth, was 8.0 g C m2 year-1. Variations in carbon accumulation rates can be explained to a great extent by natural succession and variations in local conditions, but the role of climate cannot be ignored. 3. The marked decline in carbon accumulation rates after 6100 BP (7000 cal BP) may indicate a relatively dry and warm climate. The levelling out and subsequent increase in carbon accumulation rates after 4000 BP (4500 cal BP) indicates the development of a cooler and moister climate. 4. The low long-term net carbon accumulation rate and the high carbon content per unit volume in the layer underlying the surficial peat is typical for a wet aapa mire. The continuous penetration of roots, mostly sedge, results in carbon input into the underlying peat layer and contributes to the intensive decay of the surficial peat due to high biological activity. 5. Although one-third of the apparent carbon has accumulated during the last 2000 years, most of Ruosuo is approaching the stage where primary production does not adequately compensate for overall carbon loss. The declining net carbon accumulation rates from the base up to the depth of 80 cm may indicate a real delayed trend in net carbon accumulation rates. 6. We suggest that under the present climatic conditions the northern circumpolar wet mires are significant sources of greenhouse gases. In addition to high methane production, northern aapa mires also have lower carbon accumulation rates than more southern raised bogs. 7.

The effects of light availability and tree height on different traits were evaluated in trees < 25 m in height and compared with taller individuals (25-37 m). Path-analysis is used to illustrate the consequences of trait changes at multiple levels of organization for the whole crown level. 2 Tree height and canopy openness influenced crown development at each organizational level. Crowns in higher light levels had lower specific leaf area, greater leaf spacing, greater extension of all branches, and greater extension of the leader shoot. With increasing tree height, crowns had a lower specific leaf area, greater leaf area index and greater relative crown depth. 3 Vouacapoua showed some responses to light not seen in Dicorynia. In particular, Vouacapoua increased meristem activity with light, but the lack of response in Dicorynia may be due to moderate light levels rather than inability to respond. 4 Low leaf-display costs at low light availability may enable trees to survive light suppression. 5 Light availability cannot explain trait changes with tree height. Alternative explanations for trait changes with tree height are discussed. 6 Several of the relationships between plant traits and tree height or canopy openness became non-linear when taller trees (25-37 m) were included. In these taller trees, vegetative growth was reduced at all organizational levels, particularly in Vouacapoua, which does not grow as tall as Dicorynia. 7 Qualitatively, plant responses to light did not differ between trees of different height, and were similar to seedling and sapling data in the literature.

At the four elevations, six replicates of 50 seeds each, from each of the four elevational sources, were buried at 5 cm depth in mesh envelopes, placed in wire cages to protect against predation. Seeds were retrieved 1,2 and 3 years after burial, and numbers of ungerminated seeds, and of those that remained viable, were determined. 3 At all elevations of seed burial, increasing proportions of seeds remained ungerminated, and proportionately more of the ungerminated seeds remained viable, as elevation of source of seed increased. For seed from low elevation, more seeds remained viable in the soil at the higher burial sites. However, for the seeds from higher elevation sources, seeds remaining viable were similar in number at all sites for seed burial. Half-lives of seed buried at the source elevation, calculated from the log-logistic distribution, increased with elevation, and ranged from 188 days at 1600 m to 354 days at 3400 m. 4 The results suggest that the propensity to form a persistent seed bank in P. secunda increases with elevation. Seeds from the highest elevations had the longest persistence, and this was largely unaffected by soil preservation conditions.

Timing and extent of clipping had little effect on the responses. 3 Compensatory responses to leaf clipping in polluted habitats were reduced, especially in S. borealis, as reflected by decrease in shoot growth and fruit production and an increase in leaf fluctuating asymmetry, a non-specific indicator of stress. 4 Activation of dormant buds was a common compensatory response to herbivory in unpolluted sites. The lack of an increase in epicormic shoots in polluted sites may be due to already weakened apical dominance. 5 Compensatory abilities may be affected both by direct damage caused by pollutants and pollution-induced increases in environmental stress. Although S. borealis shows no visible sign of stress in polluted sites, regrowth from dormant buds and enhanced shoot growth were seen under these conditions. Resources were not therefore available for further compensation of damage caused by defoliation. Our results fit the hypothesis that fast growing plants have low compensative abilities. 6 Salix caprea shows more pollution-induced stress than S. borealis, expressed as increased developmental instability near the weaker and shorter shoots near the stronger pollution source.

Male plants produce many short-lived flowers, whereas females produce few flowers that remain connected with the plant after fertilization. We investigated how variation in flower production and flower longevity affects the infection risk for males and females. 3 In glasshouse experiments, we varied the number of flowers inoculated (4 vs. 16 per plant) with spores and the time until these flowers were removed (1 or 2 days for both sexes, 14 days for females only). We also measured the longevity of male flowers receiving simulated visits, with or without spores, to test for an abscission response to visitation and/or contamination. In a field survey, we measured male and female disease prevalence in 17 natural populations. 4 Varying the number of inoculated flowers did not affect infection probability, but females retaining inoculated flowers for 14 days became diseased more often (20.0%) than did plants with flowers removed within 2 days (7.3%). 5 Males that had dropped more inoculated flowers prematurely were more likely to remain uninfected. Spore-bearing visits shortened male flower longevity (38.4±2.8 h) relative to non-spore visits (47.9 ± 5.2 h). 6 Female field disease prevalence (19.7±3.5%) was higher than that of males (14.3 ± 2.6%), especially in populations with a high disease incidence. 7 Continuing physical connection during fruit ripening appears to increase invasion time and thus the per-contact infection risk in females. This is consistent with higher female field prevalences, although other explanations, unrelated to disease transmission, are possible. These results illustrate how interactions between plant reproductive behaviour and pollinator activity may affect disease spread.

In the garden experiment only species at opposite ends of the ranking differed significantly in per-gram competitive effect, resulting in a weaker competitive hierarchy based on this measure. 4 Nonetheless, rankings of per-gram competitive effect were more strongly correlated with rank in abundance than were rankings of total competitive effect. 5 Per-gram competitive effect may be more predictive of natural abundance than total competitive effect for at least two reasons. The effects of neighbour abundance on targets are nonlinear, and unlike total effects, per-gram estimates of competitive effect may therefore indicate how competition changes over time with changing neighbour densities.

From 1995 to 1997 we compared plant species composition and biomass on plots where geese were excluded from feeding with paired plots where foraging could occur. 2. Foraging intensity was low (650-1930 goose-days km-2) compared to other goose-grazing systems. 3. Canada geese fed mainly on above-ground shoots of Triglochin maritimum, Puccinellia spp. and Carex ramenskii, whereas the majority of the snow goose diet consisted of below-ground tissues of Plantago maritima and Triglochin maritimum. 4. Plant communities responded differently to goose herbivory. In the sedge meadow community, where feeding was primarily on above-ground shoots, there was no effect of grazing on the dominant species Carex ramenskii and Triglochin maritimum. In the herb meadow community, where snow geese fed on Plantago maritima roots and other below-ground tissues, there was a difference in the relative abundance of plant species between treatments. Biomass of Plantago maritima and Potentilla egedii was lower on grazed plots compared with exclosed, whereas biomass of Carex ramenskii was greater on grazed plots. There was no effect of herbivory on total standing crop biomass in either community. The variable effect of herbivory on Carex ramenskii between communities suggests that plant neighbours and competitive interactions are important factors in a species' response to herbivory. In addition, the type of herbivory (above- or below-ground) was important in determining plant community response to herbivory. 5. Litter accumulation was reduced in grazed areas compared with exclosed in both communities. Trampling of the previous year's litter into the soil surface by geese incorporated more litter into soils in grazed areas. 6.

Pollinators were attracted to the larger inflorescences in sparse populations, which were also more visible due to their larger area for a given size. 3 Bumblebees probed more flowers within plants in sparse populations, probably due to the larger inflorescences and longer flight distances between individuals. 4 Subsequent reproductive success (capsule production) was higher in sparse populations, due to differences in pollination success and resource competition, and their interaction. In self-compatible species, such as L. viscaria, reproductive success may be determined more by resource availability, whereas self-incompatible plants may be more sensitive to changes in pollinator abundance. 5 We conclude that plant-pollinator interactions are sensitive to changes in both the size and spatial arrangement of plant populations, which can affect their demography and genetics.

This self-incompatible species appears to set seeds as a result of visitation by nectar robbing bumblebee queens. The tendency of bees to visit lower flowers first and then move upwards within an inflorescence should result in directional pollen flow from bottom to top flowers. 3. Naturally pollinated upper flowers set fewer seeds than intermediate and lower flowers due to pollen limitation. The lack of differences in seed set and seed mass per pod following artificial outcrossing indicated that resource limitation did not explain the variation in seed production of flowers in different positions. Pollen viability also did not differ significantly between flower positions. 4. A model of pollination was developed that incorporated the visitation pattern of bumblebees and observed variations in nectar distribution between flower positions. This predicted that receipt of outcross pollen would decrease from bottom to top flowers, but that pollen export to other plants would not differ between flower positions provided that the pollen exchange rate of pollinators was either small or positively correlated with nectar content of each flower position.

We surveyed components of sexual fertility and vegetative growth in 28 populations distributed along a 500-km latitudinal transect in New England, USA. Northerly populations tend to be monomorphic (M) for style length, and probably therefore have reduced sexual reproduction compared with southerly, trimorphic (T) populations. 3. Compared with T populations (n = 10), M populations (n = 18) exhibited large reductions for all components of sexual reproduction, including flower production, pollen deposition, pollen tube growth, fertilization, fruit set and seeds per fruit. Seven M populations produced no seed at all, and the other 11 very little (mean = 24 vs. 1139 seeds per plant in trimorphic populations). Clonal propagation was also greatly reduced in M populations. 4. A survey of three polymorphic allozyme loci detected only single, usually heterozygous, genotypes in 15 M populations, whereas all T populations were genotypically diverse. The other three M populations contained three or fewer genotypes and one always predominated. Sexual recruitment is therefore extremely rare. 5. Comparison of the sexual fertility of M and T populations in a concurrent common glasshouse experiment with our field data revealed that reduced sexual performance in northern M populations is principally due to genetic factors, but is also caused by ecological factors that covary with latitude. 6.

Allium had the lowest N uptake capacity in both laboratory and field experiments whereas roots of Tiarella had the highest specific N uptake capacity. 3. Viola was the only species in which the specific uptake capacity of roots was related to photosynthetic activity of leaves, both decreasing by a factor of two from spring to summer. In contrast, Tiarella consistently had the lowest photosynthetic capacity and the highest specific uptake capacity whereas Allium maintained substantial root uptake capacity throughout the summer when it had no photosynthetic activity. 4.

Less explored is the possibility that heterogeneity in abundance of plants between habitats with distinct flooding regimes may also result from variation in rates of herbivory or in the ability of plants to tolerate losses to herbivores. 2. Flooding and herbivores were tested as factors underlying variation in abundance of two tropical forest palms, Socratea exorrhiza (which is associated with lowlands adjacent to streams) and Oenocarpus bacaba (which is more abundant on plateaux and upper edges of slopes). 3. In a bench experiment, seeds of both palms were either completely immersed in water for a period of 101 days or not subject to inundation. Flooding inhibited germination of both species but, as expected, the adverse effects were much stronger on Oenocarpus. 4. In a field experiment, seeds of both palms were planted with increasing levels of protection against herbivores on plateaux and in lowlands. Seeds were either not protected or placed within poultry-netting exclosures, half of which were sprayed with insecticide. 5. After 17 months, only Oenocarpus had experienced differential mortality between habitats, and this was clearly associated with the negative effects of flooding on seed germination in lowlands. In contrast, growth differed between habitats only for Socratea seedlings, where average above-ground biomass was greater in lowlands. 6. Although protection with exclosures and insecticide increased survivorship of both species, herbivores caused similar proportions of mortality on plateaux and in lowlands, and had no significant effect on seedling growth.

Field studies on effects of geese on arrowgrass (Triglochin palustris) on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (SW Alaska) have demonstrated that Pacific black brant geese (Brant bernicla nigricans) can have both positive and negative effects on arrowgrass populations, but cannot predict unambiguously the effects of increased goose numbers on arrowgrass demography. 2. A cellular automata model was used to predict effects of changes in goose grazing intensity on small-scale (within-patch) arrowgrass dynamics. We examined effects of making some of the plant competitors edible to geese, of goose faeces increasing arrowgrass reproduction but reducing size of ungrazed arrowgrass, and of the presence of other species protecting arrowgrass from grazing. We also compared the effects of a random vs. patchy distribution of geese, and of incorporating threshold numbers of arrowgrass below which grazing ceased. 3. The results indicate that arrowgrass populations are likely to be highest at medium to high levels of grazing. Inclusion of edible competitors and positive effects of faecal deposition resulted in greater changes in arrowgrass population dynamics than did inclusion of associative refuges. 4. For a given grazing intensity, models generally resulted in lower arrowgrass populations with increased aggregation if distributions of geese were patchy, suggesting that decreased colonization may result from lower dispersal. 5. Inclusion of a feedback effect (grazing only above a certain plant population) caused arrowgrass populations to persist for much longer. Temporal variability in whether plots were grazed (unrelated to arrowgrass numbers) could not account for this result. 6. The model results suggest that knowledge of both small-scale and large-scale foraging behaviour is needed to predict the long-term effects of goose grazing on arrowgrass. Small-scale effects on the population may be particularly important where dispersal distances are short. The ability of plant populations to persist locally may be increased if grazing is suspended when herbivory reduces forage plants below a threshold level.",7,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Branta bernicla nigricans | Cellular automata | Foraging behaviour | Subarctic saltmarsh | Triglochin palustris,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,70,all,All Open Access

Many rare plant species are restricted to small isolated populations in which fitness may be reduced because of inbreeding, environmental and demographic stochasticity, and reduced pollination. However, specialist herbivores are less likely to be present in such populations because of higher probabilities of herbivore extinction and lower rates of colonization, and may therefore affect fitness only in larger plant populations. 2. We studied the relationships between the size of populations of the endangered grassland plant Gentiana cruciata and the probability of occurrence and population size of its specialist herbivore, the endangered butterfly Maculinea rebeli, and their effects on plant size, fruit herbivory and seed production. 3. The 29 G. cruciata populations studied ranged in size from 1 to 337 genets and 18 of them supported a M. rebeli population. M. rebeli populations were both more likely and larger in larger G. cruciata populations. Estimated adult herbivore populations were small, ranging from 1 to 42 individuals, with a median of 11. We conclude that the conservation of M. rebeli requires the conservation of large G. cruciata populations. 4. Although large populations of G. cruciata produced more flowers, a greater proportion of their fruits were attacked by herbivores. Fruit herbivory, which considerably decreased the number of seeds per fruit, appears to have been caused largely by Maculinea.

The boreal forest is subject to disturbance but the effects on population dynamics are poorly understood. We investigated how a prominent species of the forest floor, the clonal moss Hylocomium splendens, responded to different types of fine-scale disturbance. 2. Canopy gap formation was simulated in H. splendens populations by removing 50% of the bryophyte layer (Removal treatment) and herbivory by clipping all of its growing points (Clipped treatment). Demographic parameters and population dynamics were compared with an unmanipulated reference population (Ref). 3. Both types of disturbance caused a significant decrease in mean segment size (particularly following clipping) and an increase in branching rates. Branching rates in the Removal population were enhanced at all architectural opportunities for enhanced branching, but only the Clipped segments themselves were affected during the 2 years following disturbance. 4. The population effects of disturbance were analysed by a periodic matrix model, with 3-year as the period, followed by elasticity analysis. The Ref population was approximately stable (growth rate, λ = 1.012), with the survival of mature segments making an overwhelming contribution to its growth rate. The higher λ (1.740) in the Removal population was associated with higher elasticities of branching. Clipping reduced λ to 0.841 by blocking segment survival, although regeneration of new growing points on the remnant main shoot axis after 1 year, and its subsequent maturation in the next year, then made a major contribution. 5. Life table response experiment analyses revealed that almost all demographic processes including branching and the survival of mature segments contributed to the increased λ in Removal treatment. The relatively small decrease in λ following clipping was mainly due to the absence of mature segment survival, being almost balanced by the pulse of regeneration of growing points the year after disturbance. 6. We conclude that H. splendens populations show a good ability to recover from common types of disturbances in their environment.

Transition matrix models were used to evaluate the effects of environmental stochasticity and four different methods of grassland management on dynamics and viability of a population of the biennial Gentianella campestris (Gentianaceae) in species-rich grassland. Data were collected between 1990 and 1995. 2. Continuous summer grazing, the prevailing management strategy in Scandinavian grasslands, resulted in high recruitment of new plants, mainly because litter accumulation was prevented and gaps were created by trampling. Trampling and repeated grazing, however, caused damage which reduced seed production. Lambda for the average matrix was c. 0.77, and a stochastic matrix model yielded an extinction probability for the total population of c. 0.08 within 50 years. 3. Mowing in mid-July (used as a conservation tool) increased seed production, but litter accumulation following re-growth of the vegetation prevented establishment. Lambda and extinction risk were similar to continuous grazing. 4. Mowing in October (another conservation tool) promoted recruitment because of low litter accumulation, but the seed output decreased because plant growth was impaired by tall vegetation. Lambda was 0.64, while the extinction probability was very high (c. 0.98 within 50 years). 5. Mid-July mowing followed by autumn grazing (the historical management regime) yielded high values for both seed production and establishment of rosettes. Lambda was 0.94 and the probability of extinction within 50 years was below detection level. 6. Log-linear analysis showed that the matrices differed significantly both between treatments and between years. The latter indicates environmental stochasticity, here caused by summer drought that increased the extinction risk. Lambda may be slightly underestimated because drought occurred in one out of five summers during the study period, which is high compared with the natural frequency. 7. We conclude that traditional grassland management is more favourable for G. campestris than the methods that prevail in Scandinavia today.

Because related species tend to be ecologically similar, it has long been recognized that the phylogenetic relationships between species in a community are likely to influence its structure. Previous investigations of the influence of phylogeny on community structure have generally shown that congeneric species are more frequent than would be expected if communities were randomly assembled. Because, under most theories of coexistence, stable coexistence requires ecological differences between species, the apparent excess of coexisting congeners suggests that trait differences important to coexistence must be recently evolved, arising near the tips of phylogenetic trees. 2. We test this hypothesis in two meadow plant communities for which we have good evidence of niche segregation along axes defined by hydrological conditions. 3. Niche overlaps were calculated and compared against null models for (i) all species in the community, (ii) species within genera, (iii) genera within families, (iv) families within the eudicots and monocots, and (v) eudicots and monocots. 4.

We introduce a hydraulic soil-plant model with water uptake from two soil layers; one a pulse-dominated shallow soil layer, the other a deeper soil layer with continuous, but generally less than saturated soil moisture. Water uptake is linked to photosynthetic carbon assimilation through a photosynthesis model for C3 plants. 2. A genetic algorithm is used to identify character suites that maximize photosynthetic carbon gain for plants that experience a particular soil moisture pattern. The character suites include allocation fraction to stem, leaves and shallow root, stem capacitance and stem water storage capacity, maximal leaf conductance and sensitivity of leaf conductance to plant water potential, and a critical soil water potential at which shallow roots cease to transfer water. 3. We find that if pulse water is a more important water source than deeper soil water in the environment, optimal phenotypes lean towards adaptations that maximize pulse water use (small root: shoot ratio, predominantly shallow root system, high leaf conductance with high stomatal sensitivity to plant water status). If deeper soil water is more important, phenotypes lean towards adaptations that maximize deeper soil water use (large root: shoot ratio, predominantly deep root system, lower leaf conductance with low stomatal sensitivity). Stem succulence is adaptive only when deeper soil water is unavailable. 4. From among the continuum of derived phenotypes, four phenotypes are selected that resemble the character suites of winter annuals, drought-deciduous perennials, evergreen perennials and stem succulents. Under common conditions, these phenotypes reproduce many of the responses to drought and water pulse observed in their respective life-form counterparts. The comparison also highlights the differences in plant life-form sensitivity to summer and winter drought conditions. 5.

White pines (Pinus strobus) in a c. 1 ha near-boreal aspen-red maple stand in the western Great Lakes region, USA, were allocated to five size-classes that were tested for discordance of their spatial patterns (i.e. within-size-class spatial distribution of individuals and spatial associations among different size-classes). The size-classes were 0.5-1 m tall, 1-2 m tall, 2-4 m tall, > 4 m tall but < 20 cm diameter at breast height (d.b.h.), and > 20 cm d.b.h. The size-classes also differed in age. Their spatial patterns were analysed using formulae for spatial autocorrelation with categorical data at neighbourhood (0-14 m) and stand (0-70 m) scales. 2. Size-classes clustered in neighbourhoods that differed in size ranging from 6 m in diameter (size-class 2) to 40 m (size-class 3), suggesting that the pattern of each size-class is due to a different set of environmental factors. Similar size-classes tended to be randomly or positively associated at neighbourhood scales, while the most dissimilar size-classes occupied different neighbourhoods. 3. Size-classes 1 and 2 were located farther away from seed trees than size-class 3, which was farther away than size-class 4. Thus periodic seedling invasion of a deciduous matrix may be followed by the gradual retraction of older size-classes into a refuge near the mature seed source where competition from shrubs and overstorey trees is lower. Although the lack of fine-scale clustering suggests density-dependent mortality within the refuge, few older individuals were found outside this area. 4. Two regeneration bottlenecks may structure white pine populations. First, recruitment into size-class 2 is restricted to small patches (possibly in understorey gaps) within neighbourhoods with abundant size-class 1.

We studied the differences in dispersal between the fruit types in order to investigate their ecological roles. 2 The typical positive relationship between dispersal ability and germinability is not found in this species. Type A (ebracteate) fruits produced deeply dormant seeds and had the lowest dispersal potential, but of the two fruits with bracts, type B, with dormant seeds, was better dispersed by both water and wind than type C, which produces non-dormant seeds. 3 Wind, temperature and precipitation have significant effects on fruit release but their effects differ between fruit types. The release of fruit types with bracts was positively correlated with wind whereas all fruit types tended to be negatively correlated with precipitation and temperature range. 4 Type C fruit, which contains non-dormant seed, are absent from the soil in summer and have a Type II transient seed bank. Type A and B fruits, containing dormant seeds, form a persistent seed bank. 5 Heterocarpy, where fruit types show distinct ecological behaviour, enables colonizing species such as A. sagittata to survive both major disturbance (by ensuring that some seeds persist) and unfavourable conditions (by spreading germination over a long period). 6 In A. sagittata, seed dynamics can be explained by the germination behaviour of seeds produced by the three types of fruit. All fruit types mature in autumn, but few of Type A fall from the mother plant until spring, when germination is probably inhibited because of insufficient stratification.

Numerous pioneer trees in the tropics possess anti-herbivore defences, resulting in their low palatability to generalists, increased host specificity of herbivores, and often idiosyncratic composition of herbivore communities.

Periphyton production was 4-8 times higher at sheltered than at wave-exposed sites and its influence was further investigated in a glasshouse experiment. Morphological responses in both experiments were compared by allometric analyses, with shoot weight as covariate. 2 In the field study, plants shoots exhibited similar responses (increased plant height and branch length, and decreased branch number) to sheltered conditions as to deep water. The partitioning between above- and below-ground biomass however, differed, with below-ground decreasing with an increasing water depth, but increasing or remaining unaffected at sheltered compared with exposed conditions. 3 In the glasshouse experiment, plant responses to water depth were similar to those in the field study. Furthermore, plant height increased when plants were overgrown with periphyton. 4 High production of periphytic algae at sheltered sites appears to cause light limitation of macrophytes. However, other factors such as nutrient uptake also appears to determine morphological responses. At sheltered sites, where leaf nutrient uptake is reduced by abundant periphyton and thick boundary layers, plants allocate more biomass to roots. At deep and wave-exposed sites, the absence of periphyton allows plants to take up nutrients through their leaves and allocation of biomass to shoots increases photosynthesis. 5 Overall, relative allocation to shoot and root biomass appears to be primarily controlled by nutrient availability, whereas allocation of available shoot biomass to particular structures is controlled by light availability.",131,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Allocation | Allometry | Nutrients | Periphyton | Submerged macrophytes,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,86,all,All Open Access

Elevated CO2 conditions (target concentration 560 μmol CO2 mol-1) were created using MiniFACE technology. In a separate experiment, N deposition was increased by 5 g N m-2 year-1 by adding dissolved NH4NO3 at 3 week intervals during the growing season. 2 Elevated atmospheric CO2 increased height growth of Sphagnum magellanicum, the dominant Sphagnum species, in the second and third growing seasons. Vascular plant biomass was not significantly affected by elevated CO2, but growth of species growing close to the moss surface was influenced negatively by the increased Sphagnum height growth. Elevated CO2 did not change allocation to below-ground plant parts. 3 Adding N increased above-ground vascular plant biomass. The shallow-rooted species Vaccinium oxycoccus responded most to the increased N deposition. Sphagnum growth was significantly reduced in the third growing season. This reduction was likely the result of the increased vascular plant cover, given the observed negative relation between vascular plant cover and Sphagnum growth. 4 The observed shifts in species composition as a result of species-specific responses to treatments, and interactions between peat mosses and vascular plants will have important consequences for the sequestration of carbon in the bog ecosystem.",108,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Carbon dioxide | Competitive interactions | Plant species composition | Sphagnum | Vascular plants,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,87,all,All Open Access

We conducted a 3-year field experiment to investigate the effects of small-scale habitat fragmentation on the occurrence of choke disease in three calcareous grasslands in the Swiss Jura Mountains, where, overall, 4.3% of all flowering tillers had diseased inflorescences. 2 The number of diseased B. erectus plants (presumed genets), the number of tillers with diseased inflorescences, and the number of tillers with healthy inflorescences were counted over 3 years, but healthy tillers could not be allocated to particular genets. Each of 12 blocks contained one large (4.5 × 4.5 m), one medium (1.5 × 1.5 m) and two small (0.5 × 0.5 m) fragments and corresponding control plots. The percentage of tillers in the plots that were infected but did not show disease symptoms (asymptomatic plants) was estimated in the final year of the study using a diagnostic polymerase chain reaction. On average 1.7% of all tillers without disease symptoms were infected. 3 There were significantly more diseased plants in fragment than in control plots, particularly in small fragment plots or in the third year of the study, indicating that disease incidence in the host plant increased after fragmentation if assessed at the level of the genet population. This was probably due both to a switch of genets from the asymptomatic to the symptomatic state and to increased horizontal transmission of the disease in fragments. 4 The increase in the number of flowering tillers with diseased inflorescences was out-weighed by that in the number of tillers with healthy inflorescences. Disease incidence was therefore decreased by fragmentation if assessed at the level of the host flowering tiller population. The effect on healthy plants was probably due to beneficial abiotic edge effects following fragmentation. 5 Plot size affected fragmentation response, with the largest increases in small, followed by medium and large fragments. Similarly, the strength of fragmentation responses increased through time over the 3-year study period. 6 Significant site to site and year to year variation in the number of diseased plants and in the number of tillers with diseased inflorescences suggested that separate experiments with replication within site and year would have yielded a series of interesting but individually different results.

In long-lived plants, large absolute differences in size between individuals, storage of resources between reproductive events and organ preformation may make such costs difficult to demonstrate, especially when only natural variation is considered. 2 The long-lived legume Lathyrus vernus shows large size differences compared with variation in carbon resource allocation, and is known to store resources in below-ground rhizomes. We therefore followed individual plants over a period of 4 consecutive years. We examined the cost of reproductive investment by comparing the performance of untreated plants that differed in size and herbivore damage. We also compared controls with plants where we experimentally reduced flowering in terms of fitness measured as: survival, growth, flower number, fruit:flower ratio and storage. 3 Natural patterns of flowering and fruiting provided no evidence of a negative relationship between current and future reproduction. Individuals that produced fruits did not experience a lower probability of surviving and producing fruits the following season compared with flowering individuals that failed to produce any fruits, even when differences in above-ground size and herbivore damage were taken into account. 4 Flower removal in a single season increased the allocation to the rhizome but the size of shoot buds for the next season was not increased. Experimental manipulation of reproductive effort by repeated removal of flowers during 3 consecutive years, however, resulted in a significant increase in vegetative size and the probability of flowering and setting fruit compared with control plants. 5 While long-term data on natural variation in fruit production and short-term experimental data provided no evidence of a cost of reproduction, such a cost is still present, although detectable only after repeated flower removal.",75,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Delayed response | Flower removal | Fruit production | Long-term flowering pattern | Organ preformation,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,89,NA,NA

In a 4-year fertilization experiment we studied the effects of increased nitrogen (N) or phosphorus (P) supply on productivity and potential decay in the acrotelm of Sphagnum-dominated Swedish peatlands at northern (low atmospheric N input: low-N site) and southern (high atmospheric N input: high-N site) sites. 2. During the experimental period, there was a severe summer drought at the high-N site which led to strong limitations on Sphagnum growth, especially in the fertilized treatments. There were no significant effects of the nutrient treatments on cumulative length growth and productivity at either site. There were, however, significant effects of site and nutrient treatment on nutritional variables of the Sphagnum species. 3. Nitrogen concentration in living capitula was lower, but P concentration was higher at the low-N site than at the high-N site. However, at both sites N and P concentration in the living capitula showed only minor responses to the nutrient additions. 4. Litter chemistry variables differed significantly among sites and treatments. Sphagnum litter had lower N concentration, higher P concentration, a higher C : N ratio, a lower C : P ratio and a lower N : P ratio at the low-N site. Litter chemistry was significantly affected by the nutrient treatments only at the high-N site, where litter P concentrations increased significantly in the P-fertilized treatment, whereas C : P and N : P ratios showed a significant reduction. 5. Although potential rates of decay of Sphagnum litter were higher at the high-N site than at the low-N site, they were not significantly affected by nutrient additions. Potential decay rates did, however, show significant relations with all the litter chemistry variables we had determined. 6. An increase in nitrogen input to Sphagnum-dominated bogs appears to lead to higher N concentrations in litter and, as a result of dilution, to lower P concentrations. This change in litter chemistry leads to a higher potential decay rate of the litter and this may seriously affect the carbon balance in the acrotelm of these systems. 7. Our results also show that carbon balance characteristics of Sphagnum bogs can be strongly affected by unpredictable extreme climatic conditions. This suggests that the occurrence and consequences of these events need more attention when long-term responses of ecosystems to global change are studied.",96,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Bog | Decomposition | Global change | Litter chemistry | Productivity,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,90,NA,NA

The two variables analysed (landscape position and stocking rate) accounted for similar proportions of variation in the vegetation ground layer, although forbs were more sensitive to slope position and perennial grasses were more sensitive to stocking rate. 2 As grazing pressure increased, perennial grasses declined, while the relative proportion of forbs and annual grasses increased. Detailed functional group analyses were conducted for the perennial grass and forb life-forms. Annual grasses were represented by only two species, preventing identification of functional types within this life-form. 3 We conducted a five-step analysis for both perennial grasses and forbs as follows: (i) defining grazing-related species response groups; (ii) defining species groups based on natural attribute correlations; (iii) identifying attributes that changed significantly with grazing; (iv) identifying syndromes by relating (ii) and (iii); (v) describing functional types from (iii) and (iv), and assessing them against actual species response. 4 Eight grass and eight forb functional types were identified. Of the taxa that had an observed response to grazing, 54% of the grass taxa and 57% of the forb taxa corresponded to one of these functional types in terms of meeting both grazing response and trait criteria. The five-stage analysis provided a comprehensive but complex approach to functional type identification. 5 The functional types identified can be summarized as follows. Low levels of grazing were associated with more medium-sized, moderately leafy perennial grasses with wind-dispersed or adhesive seeds, and more erect or twining forbs with large to medium sized seeds. High levels of grazing were associated with: more annual grasses; low-growing leafy perennial grasses with small seeds having no dispersal appendages; mat-forming large-seeded forbs; and low-growing, scrambling, small-seeded forbs.",173,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Disturbance | Grassland vegetation | Multivariate analysis | Plant traits | Species diversity,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,92,all,All Open Access

The fruit-colour polymorphism of Myrtus communis, a common Mediterranean shrub, is examined. We investigate whether frugivores affect the maintenance of the polymorphism, whether morphs differ in germination or seedling growth, and whether passage through frugivores' gut affects seed behaviour and seedling growth. 2. Blue berries are very similar in morphological traits and nutrient composition to the rarer white morph. Rates of fruit removal by birds, the main dispersers of this species, did not differ between morphs, suggesting that a colour preference is not involved in maintenance of the polymorphism. 3. Seeds of the two morphs showed the same germinability (final percentage germination) as well as similar rates of germination under controlled conditions (in growth chamber and greenhouse). Outdoors, seeds from blue berries tended to germinate slightly faster (which might give them an early advantage) but differences between morphs disappeared after several weeks of growth. 4. The germination of myrtle seeds is differently affected by passage through the digestive tract of birds, which appeared to significantly increase germinability, and of the carnivorous pine marten, Martes martes, which did not. The different seed retention time in the gut or the chemical composition of the food ingested along with the seeds may be responsible for such differences. 5. The detection of a positive effect of bird ingestion in outdoor conditions, but not in the growth chamber or in the greenhouse, demonstrates the importance of performing germination tests in the natural habitat. 6. Seed size, irrespective of morph, affects the response to passage through the bird gut. Large seeds, which are more rapidly ejected, and are thus less abraded, germinated at a similar speed to non-ingested controls. Variation in seed size within a single species should thus be considered in future studies.",87,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Avian fruit removal | Balearic Islands | Mediterranean vegetation | Pine marten | Seed passage through digestive tracts,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,93,NA,NA
