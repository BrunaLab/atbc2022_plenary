Apparently, these molluscs develop a resistant mechanism after being exposed to the infection. In naturally infected slugs, the higher infection rates were found in large slugs, but they usually bear few larvae. Large number of larvae were found in medium sized molluscs. Experimental infection in laboratory breed slugs produced an amebocytic reaction around developing larvae; later, the formation of a fibrotic capsule is observed. When there is a second infection, cell reaction is stronger and the larvae show degenerative signs. This cell-mediated resistant mechanism seems to explain why the biggest molluscs, although more probably exposed to infection, bear fewer larvae."

Its molecular weight by gel filtration was 35 kDa and its specific clotting activity was 702 NIH/mg of protein. A 32 fold increase in the clotting activity was obtained by purification. The coagulant proteinase exhibited esterolytic activities toward lysine and arginine esters as well as amidolytic activity.

Significant differences in the activities are also observed when the venom from the Pacific and Atlantic L. muta populations (corresponding to the subspecies L. m. melanocefala and L. m. stenophyrs) are compared toward the same substrates. The Pacific type is less amidolytic and more esterolytic toward BAME and BAEE, although toward the lysine and tyrosine esters no significant differences are observed. The venom from the Pacific population is more coagulant and less proteolytic than the venom from the Atlantic population.

The results here given further substantiate the taxonomical differentiation already given to the Pacific and Atlantic Costa Rican population of L. muta."

Although development of the immune response against four toxic and enzymatic activities of the venom was similar in both horses during the first two thirds of the immunization schedule, antibody response in one of the horses reached much higher levels in the last part of the immunization. Immunoelectrophoretic analysis indicates that there were precipitating antibodies in the sera of these horses during all the stages of immunization. However, immunoprecipitation did not correlate with the ability of sera to neutralize toxic activities of B. asper venom. Monovalent antivenom was more effective than the commercially available polyvalent antivenom in the neutralization of Bothrops asper venom. On the other hand, despite the fact that it neutralizes lethal and hemorrhagic activities of the venoms of Lachesia muta and Crotalus durissus durissus, it was less effective than polyvalent antivenom in these neutralizations. Moreover, it does not neutralize defibrinating activity induced by these two venoms, whereas it neutralizes this effect in the case of B. asper venom. It is proposed that monovalent antivenom may be highly effective in the case of envenomations induced by Bothrops asper venom; its use in treating accidents by L. muta and C. durissus would be indicated only if polyvalent antivenom is not available. Results also demonstrate that it is important to monitor antibody response individually in horses being immunized for antivenom production, due to the conspicuous variability in the response of different animals."

At the beginning of nuclear division (equatorial stage), a set of six dense plaques located about the equatorial region of the nucleus and a microtubular spindle develops in the two opposing poles of the nucleus (two sets of polar microtubules). The microtubular mitotic spindle is entirely intranuclear with the nuclear membrane persisting through mitosis. The polar spindle consists of a discrete bundle of about 50 microtubules and the equatorial spindle is formed by about 100 microtubules. The spindle may contain several continuous microtubules, but no microtubular organizing centres were observed in association with the spindle. The plaques and hemiplaques are associated with microtubular bundles; some of the spindle microtubules converge on kinetochore-like plaques. It is suggested that the spindle has a special significance in the physiology of mitosis. The two sets of hemiplaques may guide the separation of the daughter genomes. At the beginning of the elongational stage the mitotic plaques split into halves and each set of half-plaques migrates to one pole. It is concluded that the dense plaques play a kinetochore-like role and thus Leishmania mexicana ssp. may have six chromosomal units. Mitotic events of this species are essentially similar to those of Trypanosoma cruzi."
