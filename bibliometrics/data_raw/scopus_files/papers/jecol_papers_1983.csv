Recruitment was usually concentrated in late summer and autumn, but occurred at any time until mid-May of the following year. Most of any population experienced low death risk until June, although some cohorts emerging in late summer were devastated (Deevey Type III curve) during periods of drought or extended snow cover. Most plants survived to produce seed. Loss of seed production from devastated autumn-emergent plants was offset by the reproduction of late winter-spring recruits. B. tectorum persists under the vagaries of steppe environments by its ability to behave simultaneously on the same site as an ephemeral monocarpic, annual monocarpic and winter annual monocarpic species. Year-to-year variation in weather and predator activity overrode the intrinsic differences along a 200km transect of varying moisture availability often producing considerable amplitude in population attributes (recruitment, survivorship and fecundity). Characterization of any species as a colonizer, etc., on the basis of life history traits alone may be erroneous; knowledge of the variation in such population attributes is also necessary.-Authors",183,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Most of the spatial variation relates to the composition of the forests at low altitudes on Millstone Grits in the NE of the region, which now has a particularly cloudy climate. There was more Betula, Pinus, Salix and Melampyrum, and less Ulmus and Corylus than in other parts of the region. Tilia was more abundant in the S of the region, probably because its northern extension was limited, as now, by low summer temperatures.

The vegetation outside the cold frame generally had greater concentrations of heavy metals(especially Zn and Pb) than vegetation growing inside the frames; there were, generally, no such differences with nutrient elements. The effect of climate-induced increase in growth on the concentration of different elements in the aerial vegetation was examined by ranking the element-concentration-quotients (cool climate/warm climate). The greatest impact of milder microclimates was in reducing the concentrations of Cd, Zn, Pb and Al; the least impact was on concentrations of Ca, K, Mg and P; effects on Fe and Mn were intermediate. The results support the contention that in certain communities, rich in 'Teesdale rarities', the metal-rich soil may exacerbate the effect of the cold climate to reduce productivity of the vegetation as a whole to below 150 kg m-2 year-1, the suggested upper value of net growth for indefinite survival of the 'rarities'.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,19,NA,NA

Small plants (<20 cm rosette diameter) produce c.2500 seeds after being completely stripped of their initial set of flower heads; defoliated large plants produce >10 000 seeds. Compensation in seed production is due mainly to the production of new capitula on regrowth shoots from the root crown or from surviving parts of the primary shoot. The number of seeds per capitulum is lower under some defoliation regimes than in undefoliated plants. Seeds produced on regrowth shoots are substantially smaller than seeds produced on primary shoots. Large plants (>30 cm rosette diameter) allocate proportionately more of their biomass to reproductive tissues than do small plants; undefoliated plants allocate more than defoliated individuals. Plants do not necessarily die after flowering; they retain a food reserve in the rootstock for regrowth the following spring irrespective of their defoliation history.

Addition of Na was higher at a wetter site, and was mostly derived from rainfall. Estimates of the loss of dry weight and elements from the litter layer, were greater in the rainforest plots than in the Araucaria plantations. The annual rate of litter disappearance (k, the quotient of the annual litterfall to the mean amount of litter on the forest floor) ranged from 0.69 for the Araucaria plot to 1.25 for the rainforest plot at the same site. -from Authors",32,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,59,NA,NA

Initially, weeds predominated, but a bamboo (Dendrocalamus hamiltonii) was an important component of 10-20-yr old fallow; later this was replaced by shade-intolerant trees. Old-field succession was accompanied by increased species diversity, reduced dominance, and increased above-ground net primary productivity which reached 1.8 kg m- 2 yr-1 in a 20-yr old fallow. Above-ground biomass increased linearly with age up to 15 kg m-2 in a 20-yr old fallow. Rate of accumulation of biomass increased for 15 yr, when it was 0.9 kg m-2 yr-1, then declined slightly. Litterfall increased with the age of the fallow up to 1.0 kg m-2 yr-1 in a 20-yr fallow. -from Authors",93,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,60,NA,NA

Increasing concentrations of both nitrate and phosphate increased the growth progressively. In dry pasture much of the benefit of the added nutrients was shared by the two predominant species Eragrostis tenella and Zoysia matrella, which grew vigorously and luxuriantly, suppressing the other species including Cynodon dactylon. In damp pasture, however, the augmented nutrient regimes improved the growth of C. dactylon substantially. The restricted growth and low productivity of the 2 grasslands are related chiefly to the limited effects of low concentrations of N and P.-from Author",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,61,NA,NA
