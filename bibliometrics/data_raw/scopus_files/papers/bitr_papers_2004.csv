To address the importance of this mechanism, we collected 15 Hawaiian plant litter types and decomposed them in fertilized and control plots for up to two years. We measured litter nutrient content and carbon chemistry prior to decomposition, as well as extracellular enzyme activities, mass loss, and litter nutrient content over time. We found that water-soluble carbon content, cellobiohydrolase activities, and polyphenol oxidase activities were significantly correlated with mass loss. Enzyme activities and decomposition rate constants both varied significantly by litter type, and fertilization increased mass loss rates in five litter types. Some litter types that decayed faster under fertilization also showed time-dependent increases in carbon-degrading enzyme activities, but others decayed faster independent of enzyme changes.

In this study, we compared the vegetation structure and floristic composition of old-growth and 40-year-old secondary riparian forests in the Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic. Canopy height and stem density of woody plants were similar between forest types, but basal area of trees was 27 percent lower in secondary forests. Introduced tree species comprised 20 percent of the basal area and dominated the understory of secondary forests. Life-form diversity was higher in old-growth forests as arborescent ferns, the palm species, and epiphytic bromeliads, orchids, and bryophytes were much more abundant. The number of species of epiphytic orchids and bromeliads, ground ferns, and herbaceous plants was also significantly higher in old-growth forests. The species density of woody plants and vines, however, was comparable between forest types, and vine abundance was significantly higher in secondary forests. The high importance of introduced tree species and the delayed recovery of several plant life-forms have important implications for the conservation of plant diversity in secondary forests in the tropics. The robust regeneration of woody structure despite the long land tenure (ca 60 yr) by farmers is probably due to the nutrient-rich alluvial soils and low-intensity agriculture. This study revealed the potential for the rapid recovery of woody plant diversity and structure in fertile secondary forests adjacent to mature forest seed sources and the more delayed recovery of nonwoody plant diversity and abundance.",Dominican Republic | Epiphytes | Invasive species | Old-growth forest | Riparian forest | Secondary forest | Species diversity | Succession | Tropical montane forest | Vines,NA,NA

The lack of variation in herbivore intensity within forests suggests that estimates of herbivore damage from fossil assemblages may reflect levels of herbivore intensity typically experienced by a given forest, at least over a short ecological timescale. The differences in herbivore intensity between similarly categorized forests suggest that simple one-to-one comparisons between fossil and modern sites can be problematic. The distribution of functional feeding groups also differed on an interannual basis both within and between forests. As guild structure can be highly variable, caution should be taken when comparing modern herbivore guild structures with those from fossil assemblages.

Thus, extraction of S. siamensis indirectly affected the pollination of D. obtusifolius, primarily by causing changes in the foraging behavior of butterfly pollinators rather than their abundance. A shift in the relative abundance of floral nectar resources from the canopy to the understory, a consequence of S. siamensis extraction and invasion by C. odorata, led to a parallel shift in foraging location of the principal diurnal pollinators, the butterflies, toward the understory.

Pollen limitation was evident from a significant overall increase in seed set after supplemental pollination in three populations over two seasons.

Discriminant function analysis (DFA) was used to assess the relative importance of the landscape and environmental factors in controlling the presence in gaps of Cecropia species that are typical of secondary forests regenerating after large-scale disturbances. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used as an ordination technique based on pioneer species composition of each gap. The PCA ordination axes were regressed against soil type, gap size, forest type, and distance values of each site to explore the relationship between composition and control factors. At the four sites, the variable best correlated to the discriminant function of gaps with and without Cecropia was the distance to secondary forests, although such discriminant function was statistically significant at only one site. In three of the four sites (with the exception of BCI, where there are no typical young secondary forests), distance to secondary forests was correlated with at least one axis of the PCA (P < 0.06).

They can have strong effects on both forest structure and animal populations, and yet few studies have considered the impacts on plant-animal interactions. Reduction of canopy cover by severe winds increases light availability to understory plants, providing an opportunity for increased growth. An increase in light availability should cause an increase in annual production of leaves and a more even production throughout the year (i.e., less seasonality in production). This change will affect the availability of food resources to folivorous insects that feed primarily on young leaves; outbreaks of these insects could nullify the temporary advantage of increased understory light levels. On 21 September 1998, Hurricane Georges struck Puerto Rico, providing an excellent opportunity to determine the effect of the hurricane on leaf production and herbivory in the forest understory by comparing post-hurricane data with data obtained from a previous study conducted at the same site. Eight species were analyzed at El Verde Field Station, a wet forest site in eastern Puerto Rico. For the eight species combined, there was an increase in number of leaves produced after the hurricane and a more even seasonal pattern of leaf production, as predicted. Levels of herbivory were much lower (2.03%) after the hurricane compared with pre hurricane conditions (16.05%), indicating that increased light availability to understory plants was not offset by increased herbivory. Lower levels of herbivory were possibly due to herbivore satiation, changes in leaf chemistry, changes in herbivore populations, changes in herbivore predator populations, or a combination of two or more of these factors.",Folivory | Hurricane Georges | Leaf flushing | Puerto Rico | Tropics,NA,NA

We examined the effect of soil fertility specifically by measuring the density and basal area of trees, lianas, and palms on two soil types differing in fertility at each site. We used allometric relationships to estimate the contribution of the various life-forms to total aboveground biomass (AGB) and compared two relationships for trees 30 cm diameter or greater. Estimated liana density and AGB were similar among sites, but the density and AGB of trees and palms, estimated using diameter alone, differed significantly. Basal area and AGB of trees 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) or greater differed among forests and averaged 30.2 m2/ha and 250 Mg/ha, respectively. Cocha Cashu and KM41 had higher tree basal area and AGB than La Selva or Barro Colorado Island. Across forests, lianas and small trees (1-10 cm DBH) each contributed between 4 and 5 percent of the total AGB and small palms contributed ca 1 percent. Many forest inventories ignore lianas, as well as trees and palms less than 10 cm DBH, and therefore underestimate AGB by ca 10 percent. Soil type had little influence on the forest structure within sites, except at Cocha Cashu where total AGB was much higher and liana density much lower on the more fertile old floodplain Entisols than the terra firme Oxisols. Although total stem density, basal area, and some biomass components differed significantly among forests, they seemed less variable than other quantitative measures (e.g., species richness).",Aboveground biomass | Brazil | Costa Rica | Large trees | Lianas | Palms | Panama | Peru,NA,NA

Additionally, root growth and survival were studied both in normal, unmanipulated, and experimentally cut roots to investigate the effect of damage on root resprouting and survival.

We examined how insect primary defense strategy and natural variation in Myioborus plumage pattern influence escape behavior in six species of homopterans from Monteverde, Costa Rica. The six homopterans included two aposematic species of the family Cercopidae (Ocoaxo sp. and Sphenorhina sp.), two cryptic species of the family Cixiidae (both Bothriocera spp.), and two structurally defended species of the family Membracidae (Campylocentrus sp. and Vestistilus variabilis).

Many report that hybrid sterility evolves very slowly between separated tree populations. If so, tree species rarely originate by splitting of large populations. Instead, they begin with few trees. The few studies available suggest that reproductive isolation between plant populations usually results from selection driven by lowered fitness of hybrids: speciation is usually a response to a ""niche opportunity."" Using Hubbell's neutral theory of forest dynamics as a null hypothesis, we show that if new tree species begin as small populations, species that are now common must have spread more quickly than chance allows. Therefore, most tree species have some setting in which they can increase when rare. Trees face trade-offs in suitability for different microhabitats, different-sized clearings, different soils and climates, and resistance to different pests. These trade-offs underlie the mechanisms maintaining α-diversity and species turnover. Disturbance and microhabitat specialization appear insufficient to maintain α-diversity of tropical trees, although they may maintain tree diversity north of Mexico or in northern Europe. Many studies show that where trees grow readily, tree diversity is higher and temperature and rainfall are less seasonal. The few data available suggest that pest pressure is higher, maintaining higher tree diversity, where winter is absent. Tree α-diversity is also higher in regions with more tree species, which tend to be larger, free for a longer time from major shifts of climate, or in the tropics, where there are more opportunities for local coexistence.",Janzen-Connell | Neutral theory | Pest pressure | Regional diversity | Speciation | Stability-time | α-diversity | β-diversity,NA,NA

In total, 352 fruit bats of eight species were captured during 72,306 m2 mist-net hours of sampling between February 1996 and September 1999. Three species of fruit bats (Balionycteris maculata, Chironax melanocephalus, and Cynopterus brachyotis) that fed on a wide range of ""steady state"" and ""big bang"" food resources were captured continuously throughout the study period, with no significant variation in capture rates over time. In contrast, five species that fed exclusively or almost exclusively on ""big bang"" food resources were sampled intermittently, with significant temporal variation in the capture rates of two species (Cynopterus horsfieldi and Megaerops ecaudatus). Significant variation in the capture rates of the remaining three species (Dycopterus spadiceus, Eonycteris spelaea, and Rousettus amplexicaudatus) could not be detected due to small sample sixes. Since ephemeral ""big bang"" food resources were only sporadically available within the study area and were associated with large canopy trees and strangler figs, these results suggest that food abundance, or the availability of specific food items, may be important factors limiting local fruit bat species diversity in old-growth Paleotropical rain forest. Thus, only three fruit bat species were locally resident within the forest throughout the study period. Therefore, further studies on the ranging behavior and habitat requirements of Malaysian fruit bats are required to assess the adequacy of existing reserves and protected areas.",Chiroptera | Dipterocarp forest | Foraging ecology | Migration | Nomadism | Phenology | Pteropodidae | Refuging | Southeast Asia,NA,NA

Our study used observations and soil analyses from eight exposed riverbank sections to test the predictions of three models to determine why birds consume clay: mechanical aid to digestion (grit), adsorption of dietary toxins, and mineral supplementation. We round that preferred soils were deficient in particles large enough to aid in the mechanical breakdown of food and help digestion. Percent clay content and cation exchange capacity (CEC), both predicted to correlate with adsorption of toxins, did not differ between used and unused sites as had been found in a similar study. Instead, preferred soils were more saline and had higher concentrations of exchangeable sodium. This suggests that the choice of soils at our site was based primarily on sodium content. Birds may be using the heavy, plastic texture of soils rich in clays and high in exchangeable sodium as a proximal cue for soil selection. Our findings suggest that avian soil selection decisions depend on the range of available soil characteristics.",Cation exchange capacity | Geophagy | Macaw | Moist tropical forest | Parrot | Particle size | Peru | Psittacidae | Salinity | Sodium,NA,NA

We propose four strategies that may help tree species persist under these conditions: repellence, resistance, tolerance and avoidance. We sought and found evidence for each strategy. Large, shade-tolerant Cynometra alexandri dominated basal area (often >50%) and showed severe scarring. Nearly 80 percent of stems were small pioneer species. Scarring frequency and intensity increased with stem size. Stem-size distributions declined steeply, implying a high mortality to growth rate ratio. Tree species with spiny stems or with known toxic bark defenses were unscarred. Epiphytic figs escaped damage while at small sizes. Mid-successional tree species were scarce and appeared sensitive to elephants. Savanna species were seldom scarred. Taking stem size-effects into account by using a per-stem logistic modeling approach, scarring became more probable with slower growth and with increasing species abundance, and also varied with location. Pioneer and shade-bearer guilds showed a deficit of intermediate-sized stems. Evidence that selective elephant damage is responsible for monodominant C. alexandri forests remains equivocal; however, elephants do influence tree diversity, forest structure, and the wider landscape.",African semi-deciduous rain forest | Bark damage | Cynometra alexandri | Herbivory | Loxodonta africana | Monodominant | Species richness | Succession | Tolerance | Uganda,NA,NA
