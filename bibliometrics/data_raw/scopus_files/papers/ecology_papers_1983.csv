Predicted body temperatures were converted to a space-time index. The distribution of the space-time index in each microhabitat was used to predict the spatial and temporal distributions of lizards.

However, when the potential prey was highly cryptic or hidden, the birds all learned to use both tree species and leaf damage simultaneously as cues in their searching effort for specific prey.

A test of the model with 5 genera and 13 species revealed positive results across the entire family, but the most speciose genera, Perognathus and Dipodomys, showed seemingly conflicting patterns: the smaller (in mass) genus, Perognathus, conformed strongly to the model, while in Dipodomys water regulatory efficiency was fixed at a level equivalent to that of the largest Perognathus spp (approx 35-40 g) . At this mass in these genera, in addition, occurs the demarcation between strict quadrupedality (Perognathus) and bipedality (Dipodomys); a strict scaling of cheek pouch volume with mass in Perognathus but independence of mass in Dipodomys; and the common use of torpor in Perognathus, with its near absence in Dipodomys. Initially, selection favored a decrease in mass with a concomitant increase in water regulatory efficiency and reduction in absolute energy need in heteromyids, tracking progressive aridity during the Tertiary. In Dipodomys, the option of bipedality was adopted, apparently freeing them from energetic constraints imposed strictly by mass, coupled with an intermediate and fixed level of water regulatory efficiency that dictates use of seeds with high metabolic water yields. The quadrupedal Perognathus have retained a mass-specific water regulatory eficiency, ensuring maintenance of both water and energy balance on a broad array (with respect to protein:lipid: carbohydrate and metabolic water yield) of seeds, when their more limited locomotor powers are consistent with seed availability; torpor is the tradeoff, enhancing survival during energetically demanding periods. -Authors",82,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,12,NA,NA

ANPP as a function of peak foliar standing crop (FSC) was best explained by models which showed a reduction in ANPP/FSC as FSC increased. Thus, deserts had a higher ANPP per unit of FSC than did other systems. As expected, photosynthetic efficiency (PE) was highest for forests, approx 100 times greater than for deserts. However, when PE was evaluated per unit of foliage, the differences in PE of ecosystems were much less. A hot-desert site had the highest PE/FSC. In terms of a theoretical maximum, the PE of forests was only 6-25% of the maximum value. Systems with nearly steady-state aboveground standing crop (ASC) showed an exponential decrease with decreased water availability (potential evapotranspiration minus precipitation). For these same systems, the ratio of ANPP to ASC increased with decreased water availability, suggesting that water-stressed systems need more energy from ANPP to drive internal processes.

Epiphytic flora reduced organic carbon release to a small extent and contributed to a slight enhancement of community productivity.

These assumptions are frequently incompatible, Levins' model is modified to allow for a varying difference between the local and regional time scales, and regional competition between 2 species is analyzed with the new model. The main results are that 2 like species may or may not coexist regionally, depending on the difference between the time scales (a large difference facilitates coexistence) and on the intensity of competition; a species' precompetitive distribution is a good predictor of its competitive success, much as the carrying capacity in the Lotka-Volterra model is a good predictor of success in local competition. The local time scale is slower than the regional one in some organisms (eg orchids, ferns), which may survive regionally, although they may succeed in breeding only seldomly.

Spring-flying native bees included many species adapted to forage on native flower species that bloom before the tree canopy closes. Apis mellifera outcompeted native bees at large clusters of attractive flower species such as apple and the crucifer Barbarea vulgaris. Halictus ligatus was the most common early summer halictine. This species concentrated its foraging on different flowers than did other early summer bees, probably because of differences in innate flower preferences. A profuse bloom of native goldenrods Solidago in late summer was the seasonal peak of resource abundance. Native bees must complete their seasonal cycles and enter diapause before the killing frost. They therefore foraged on early-blooming goldenrod species such as S. juncea. In contrast, honey bees overwinter as active bees within their hives. They were most common on later-blooming goldenrods, where they collected much of the nectar required for overwintering.

On Barro Colorado Island, Panama, female bruchids oviposit more frequently on pristine fruit, and female bruchids disperse their eggs uniformly among Scheelea fruit. Such sophisticated seed predators might search large areas for pristine seeds. As a result, seed-predation rates may fall slowly with distance from the parent palm. Scheelea fruit were exposed at distances of 1, 8, 16 and 100 m from the nearest fruiting palm. Within 16 m, bruchid attack rates were uniformly high. However, at 100 m there was a significant decline.

Spiralling length, at steady state, is approximately the ratio of the total downstream flux of phosphorus per unit width of stream (720 m.d-1.m-1) to the rate of P uptake from the water (3.90 mg.m-2.d-1). Coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) accounted for 60% of the uptake, fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) for 35%, and aufwuchs for 5%. Turnover times of P in particulates ranged from 5.6-6.7 d, except for FPOM, which showed a second, slower turnover time of 99 d. Of the P uptake from water by particulates, 2.8% was transferred to consumers. The remainder returned directly to the water. About 30% of the consumer uptake, in turn, was transferred to predators. The spiralling length was partitioned into: 1) an uptake length associated with transport in the water column (165 m), 2) a particulate turnover length associated with transport in FPOM and CPOM 25 m), and 3) a consumer turnover length associated with animal drift (0.05 m). FPOM transport accounted for 99% of the particulate turnover length. The small consumer turnover length reflected low consumer uptake of P from particulates and slow downstream drift velocity (0.013 m/d). Despite the low rate of P uptake, the combined consumer-and- predator community accounted for 25% of the standing stock of exchangeable P in the stream. The retentiveness of this community is attributable both to the low drift rate and to a long turnover time (152 d) for P within the community.-from Authors",223,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,132,NA,NA

Factors potentially causing the aggregated distribution of urchins include physical parameters, food availability, interspecific competition, and starfish predation. The starfish Pycnopodia helianthoides is the only predator observed feeding on sea urchins in Torch Bay, and it elicits a strong escape response in 2 of the 3 urchin species (and the 2nd at small size). Predation, by creating even short-lived herbivore-free patches, can significantly affect subtidal algal assemblages, and thus primary productivity, species richness, and species distribution in this important marine community.-from Author",90,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,153,NA,NA

A 2nd prediction concerns plants in which increased energy devoted to rhizomes increases the radial growth rate of clones much more strongly than it increases leaf area index and in which genets self-thin in response to crowding. Here, the ratio of seed production to rhizome production should be relatively constant across environments and should be strongly influenced by the relationship between the level of investment in rhizomes per ramet and the length of the resulting rhizomes.

Acclimatization of photosynthesis to different gardens was most pronounced in populations from thermally variable environments. Differences in photorespiration among populations and among gardens generally paralleled differences in photosynthesis. The temperature optimum for photosynthesis of each population was higher than average air temperature in any site and may represent a compromise between 1) effective photosynthesis and 2) high N requirement associated with a low temperature optimum in a cold environment. All processes associated with plant carbon balance lacked marked ecotypic variation. In contrast, phosphate absorption rate differed substantially among populations grown in a common garden, being highest in populations evolving in cold, phosphate-deficient soils. Soil phosphate status was more important than soil temperature in eliciting this evolutionary response.

Significant correlations were found with only 4 characteristics: number of individuals of all species inhabiting the reefs; presence of the dominant lagoonal piscivore, current strength, and, most often, number of heterospecific planktivores inhabiting the reef. Increased numbers of these apparent food competitors correlated with delayed spawning, reduced initial brood size, and reduced adult (and possibly juvenile) rates of growth. Results of a brief series of experimental manipulations of community structure, involving selective removal of apparent food competitors, support these observations. Food abundance is thus probably a limiting resource for A. polyacanthus and significant interspecific competition for food occurs. The potential therefore exists for selection to favor niche partitioning and for resources in short supply to affect year-class success and, subsequently, community structure.-from Author",69,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,160,NA,NA

Optimal clutch size is determined by a balance between the fitness per offspring, (dependent on clutch size) and the number of clutches mothers can deposit in their brief life-span. As clutch size increased, so did sibling competition, with the result of smaller size and lower fecundity for larvae developing in large clutches. Larval survivorship was lower in small clutches because of differential attack by parasitoids. From the offspring's viewpoint, benefits of small clutch size outweighed the deficits. When mothers experience no risk of mortality, optimal clutch size from their viewpoint is also one. However as the risk of mortality between ovipositional events increases, females are unlikely to survive to deposit all their eggs. Females will be selected to deposit several eggs per clutch, since this results in the development of many moderately fecund offspring whose aggregate fitness is greater than that of the few highly fecund offspring that would result if one egg were deposited per site.-from Authors",55,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,162,NA,NA
