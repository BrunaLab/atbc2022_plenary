Size-selective sex-allocation and host-feeding (SSH) is analysed using a parasitoid-host model that recognizes overlapping generations, an invulnerable adult host stage, a young immature stage, an old immature host stage, and only the female parasitoid. Young immature hosts are assumed to be attacked by the parasitoids, die as a consequence, but do not contribute to the juvenile female parasitoid population; each attack on an old immature host produces a juvenile female parasitoid. SSH leads to delayed pseudo-density-dependence in recruitment to the parasitoid population because the current attack rate on young immatures, which is a function of parasitoid density, influences the future number of old immatures and hence the future per head rate of recruitment of searching parasitoids. SSH is potentially stabilizing because it tends to suppress the inherent long-period host-parasitoid cycles. This stabilizing propensity is enhanced when the adult host stage lasts about as long as or longer than the entire immature host stage is not too long-lived or the attack rate on it is not too high. SSH can also destabilize the model by creating a region of instability in which cycles occur with a period related to the total length of the host immature stages. These shorter-period cycles are promoted by the same features that tend to suppress the underlying parasitoid-host cycles. -from Authors",44,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

In kelp beds eiders feed mostly on small blue mussels Mytilus edulis. Over barrens they capture green sea urchins Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis, and over Agarum beds they feed on both spider crabs Hyas araneus and urchins. All sizes of flocks feed in the kelp beds, whereas mostly small flocks fed in the barrens and Agarum beds. Small-flock individuals strongly select mussels and crabs whereas urchins are non-preferred prey. Dive and foraging cycles differ significantly according to the above three habitats. Although, the size, density and energy content of prey differ markedly between kelp and Agarum beds, these two habitats offer an even energy return. However, the variance in energy return in these two habitats differs strikingly, being greater in the latter. The author hypothesized, in the context of risk foraging theory, that this was related to flock sizes and body condition.

Survivorship and mating success of andro- and gynochromotypic females of Ischnura graellsii were measured in two natural populations with different densities in Galicia (NW Spain).

Mating success was the same for andro- and gynochromotypics at high density but the proportion of unmated females was greater in andro- than gynochromotypics at low density. Androchromotypics mated with longer inter-copula intervals at high density, and mating duration was also density-dependent. Results suggest that hypothesis 3 is the most appropriate to explain the maintenance of the polymorphism. Androchromotypics were larger than gynochromotypics in the high density population.

Data used in the models were from observations in SE Kruger National Park. Model 1 ascertained the number of killing lions (adult females) that could be supported by each prey population while remaining stable. A single model was constructed for the sedentary wildebeest population. A summer and winter model was constructed for the semi-migratory zebra population. The sensitivity of the parameters in the model was tested by changing their value by 10%. In model 2, the kill age structure for each species was changed to determine the number of killing lions the altered prey selection parameters could support. There was no difference in the vulnerability of either species to predation. Zebra foals (<1 yr) were killed more frequently than expected. No selection for sex or by season could be found for either species. Model 1 predicted that the wildebeest population stabilizes with 7.7 killing lions, close to the number in the study area. The winter zebra populations stabilizes with 6.8 killing lions and the summer zebra population with 19.4. Manipulation of kill rate followed by adult fecundity rate had the greatest effect on population size of both species. In model 2, wildebeest predation was made selective towards calves and zebra predation was made non-selective for sex and age. With these parameters the wildebeest population stabilizes with 10.7 killing lions and the zebra population with 5.4 in winter and 15.1 in summer. The models suggest that lion predation affected wildebeest more severely than zebra during the study.

Leapfrog parents fledged fewer chicks, not because of poor feeding conditions in their feeding territory (intake rates of leapfrogs exceeded those of residents), but because they failed to transport a sufficient amount of food to the chicks.

Only predation of galls by birds exhibited a consistent pattern of direct density dependence. There was marked variation in the intensity of all mortality factors from tree to tree. As spatial scale is increased from catkins, through buds, shoots and twigs, so the sample size declines and the range of densities increases. Enhancing gall densities by caging agamic females directly onto the branches of the host tree led to an increase in mean gall density and in the range of gall densities. This, in turn, led to an increase in the detection of inverse density dependence (mainly through parasitoid attack) but had no significant impact on the detection of direct density dependence.

A modified mathematical model of the grouse-nematode system is described which incorporates the effects of both random and selective predation of heavily parasitized grouse.

This area has a severe 6-7 month dry season and the largest seasonal fluctuations in arthropod numbers and biomass yet recorded for a tropical habitat. The A. nebulosus population in the Chamela forest experiences high predation rates and low annual survivorship. In response to the wet season flush of insects, males and females shift from ground to arboreal foraging and increase feeding rates 5-10-fold. Males also travel further to capture prey and change their foraging mode, switching from trunk-ground, sit-and-wait foraging in the dry season to trunk-crown, mobile foraging in the wet season. During the dry season, male and female A. nebulosus are the most sedentary lizards known, moving only once or twice per hour, and travelling a maximum of 8-9 m day-1. During the wet season females are 2-3 times and males 5-10 times more active. Following the brief breeding period, however, both males and females retreat into unexposed hiding places and are emergent and active for only 1 or 2 days week-1. This reclusive behaviour and the exceptional levels of inactivity found in this species are most likely adaptations that reduce the risk of predation. During the wet season breeding period, males increase display rates 15-30-fold and expand their home ranges 10-15-fold. Compared to insular populations, however, Chamela males invest significantly less time courting females (49% vs. 95%) and more time hiding and resting (44% vs. 1%). Such differences suggest that mainland males are trading off the probability of encountering and mating with females for enhanced safety. Females devote more time to foraging than males during both wet and dry seasons. This may enhance female fitness by increasing growth rate, fat reserves, and egg production. Males divide their time equally between resting/hiding and foraging and allocate only a small proportion of their day to social activities, except during the breeding period when the majority of their time and energy is invested in reproductive behaviour. -from Authors",92,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,17,NA,NA

In most previous work of this general kind, the movement is not localized in this way, but involves ""global' mixing of the populations prior to dispersal. A remarkable range of dynamical behaviour is exhibited by a mathematically explicit model with constant host reproductive rate, deterministically unstable local dynamics and dispersing hosts and parasitoids that only move to nearest neighbour patches in a density-independent way. Density of the host and parasitoid subpopulations in a two-dimensional array of patches may exhibit complex patterns of spiral waves, spatial chaos, a so-called static ""crystal lattice' pattern, or they may become extinct. The probability of extinction rises rapidly when the number of patches present decreases below some characteristic arena size which varies with the scale of the spatial dynamics. The different types of spatial dynamics depends critically on the fractions of hosts and adult parasitoids that disperse in each generation from the patches in which they emerged. Low rates of host dispersal tend to lead to chaotic patterns unless this rate is very low and parasitoid dispersal rates very high, in which case ""crystal lattice' patterns may occur.

The proportion of successful dives increased as fish weight decreased. Mean diving time, however, was not related to any component of the food supply, nor to pond characteristics. When roach/rudd were the prey, handling time above the water did not constrain the number of prey eaten per unit time foraging at any fish density. With roach/rudd and carp Cyprinus carpio as prey, the above-water handling time increased with the size of the fish consumed. Total handling time under and above the water surface together constituted on average 4.7% of the time required to consume one fish. When fishing for roach/rudd, successful dives lasted significantly longer than unsuccessful ones. As mean duration of successful dives increased with fish weight, this can be explained by handling prey under water. For carp, however, this could not be shown. Furthermore, unsuccessful dives lasted significantly longer when fishing for carp than for roach/rudd, probably related to behavioural differences between the fish species.

Recent studies have shown that hydrolysable tannins in red oak reduce both gypsy moth (GM) fecundity and virus susceptibility. The most realistic gypsy moth dynamics required moderate to high levels of tannin (30-45%), low non-virus mortality (3.0 per GM per year), and long-lived virus (1 yr). For simulations with low non-virus mortality and long-lived virus, the ratio of highest to lowest population density increased from 10-fold at 10% tannin to over 1000-fold at 40% tannin, then stabilized with little or no fluctuation at 50% tannin. The shift to stability at 50% tannin results from the lower sensitivity of fecundity than virus to hydrolysable tannins and a consequent decrease in the difference between virus pathogenicity and the gypsy moth's intrinsic rate of increase at high tannin levels. The dynamics generated agree well with predictions of the Anderson & May (1981) model that stable limit cycles are promoted by 1) longer-lived virus and 2) high pathogenicity relative to the intrinsic rate of increase. Simulations suggest that the net effect of moderate constant tannin levels over multiple generations will be destabilizing compared with low and high tannin levels. -from Authors",34,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,25,NA,NA

Density-related changes in birth weight are closely correlated with changes in neonatal mortality, but annual variation in neonatal mortality contributes little to fluctuations in population size. Desite the relationship between individual variation in birth weight and survival through the first winter, density-related changes in the weight of lambs at birth and at four months contributed little to density-related changes in survival through the first winter, primarily because birth weight and early growth were most heavily depressed in springs that followed die-offs and were followed by winters when mortality (and density) were low.

The population of hen fleas in pied flycatcher nests is closely related to the number of blue tits Parus caeruleus breeding, suggesting that the numbers of fleas arriving in the nest is a significant factor in pied flycatcher.

Parameters for the model are based in part on data collected from the Spanish Pyrenees. The model is used to evaluate how different ecological processes and densities of the plant and ant resources may affect the butterfly population, including its density, resilience from perturbation, and persistence. For the Spanish study site, survival of the butterfly in ant nests is disproportionately more important to its population than is competition on the plant. Changes in the observed population of the plant have virtually no impact on the butterfly population.

Five metapopulations occurred in heathland, one in mossland and three in limestone grassland. Within metapopulations, local distributions of the butterfly corresponded to the spatial distributions of suitable habitat: P. argus was able to colonize virtually all suitable habitat patches <1km from existing, populated patches. The regional distribution was constrained by the inability of the butterfly to colonize suitable habitat that was further than a few kilometres from existing metapopulations; some of these sites are now populated by P. argus following successful introductions. Turnover (extinctions and colonizations) of patches within metapopulations was relatively high in small patches. Turnover was also greater in heathland than in limestone; the principal reason for this was that patches of habitat were usually smaller in heathland, and small patches had high turnover in both biotopes. Turnover of area was greater in heathland, where the butterfly occupies relatively transient successional habitats, than in limestone grassland where the habitat can be maintained in a suitable condition for longer periods. The persistence of this spatially dynamic species depends on some suitable habitat being continuously available within relatively large areas of biotope. If the continuity is broken and a whole metapopulation becomes extinct, natural recolonization is unlikely to occur if the nearest P. argus source is more than a few kilometres away. -from Authors",178,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,40,NA,NA

The authors review theoretical evidence for saturation in various community models and find that non-interactive models predict the absence of saturation as expected, but that interactive models do not uniformly predict saturation. Instead, models where coexistence is based on niche space heterogeneity predict saturation, whereas those where coexistence is based upon spatial heterogeneity yield mixed predictions. Thus, theory says that species interactions are a necessary but not sufficient condition for local saturation in ecological time. Unsaturated assemblages are likely to be ubiquitous in nature, and even saturated assemblages may not show hard limits to richness over evolutionary time-scales. If local richness is not often saturated, then regional richness is freed from local constraint, and other limits on regional richness (which, in turn, limit local richness) become important, including phylogenetic diversification over evolutionary time-scales. The principal direction of control for species richness appears to be from regional to local: then the key to community structure would lie in extrinsic biogeography rather than in intrinsic local processes, making community ecology a more historical science. -from Authors",815,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,41,NA,NA

Subsequent analysis of data from the 12 ""priority' beds allowed more variables to be eliminated: densities of small and large mussels, shell thickness on the ventral side, and bed size.

They spent 1-7 yr (mean 1.5 yr) as breeders and raised 0-26 fledglings (mean 5.4) during their lifetime. The lifetime number of fledglings produced by males was highly significantly correlated with their lifetime contribution of known recruits to the breeding population. Most male fledglings (78%) died before the first breeding attempt. Of the young fledged in one year, 5% produced 50% of fledglings in the next generation, and 21% of males reared 50% of all fledglings produced by the population. Offspring survival from egg to fledgling was the most important component of LRS, followed by the life span and clutch size. Age of first breeding did not affect LRS, but polygynous males produced twice as many fledglings as monogamous ones. Among environmental factors, vole abundance was the most important determinant of LRS: males entering the breeding population in the low and increase phases of the vole cycle gained larger LRS than males recruiting in the peak and decrease phases. As the breeding life span of polygynous males was longer than that of monogamous ones and as there was no negative relationship between the brood size and the duration of breeding life, no evidence of reproductive costs could be obtained. Superior males may easily compensate for the large parental investment by increasing their food intake without risking their future survival. -Author",82,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,47,NA,NA

Providing that the life expectancy of the free-living larvae is more than 2-4 wk, the parasite can readily establish in grouse populations. Larval arrestment tends to reduce the intrinsic growth rate of the parasite and thus increases the size of the host population required for the parasite to establish. Grouse numbers will tend to cycle when the parasites exhibit low degrees of aggregation and parasite-induced reductions in host fecundity are greater than parasite-induced increases in host mortality. The population cycles produced in the model have the slow increase followed by a rapid decline characteristic of the grouse population studied at Gunnerside, Yorkshire. The period of the cycles is determined by the intrinsic growth rate of the grouse population and either larval life expectancy (Model I), or the duration of larval arrestment (Model II) . Cycle periods decrease as host population growth rate increases, and lengthen with increases in either free-living larval life expectancy, or duration of larval arrestment. If duration of larval arrestment is sufficiently long (>6 months), the cycles die out and the dynamics of the grouse-nematode system are very stable. Numerical analysis of the model's behaviour suggest that a model with limited arrested larval stages more closely corresponds to the grouse populatins in N England. The 4-5 yr cycles exhibited by these populations will be more sporadic, or absent on estates where the parasite is unable to establish.

For both life-history traits, the growth constant k is a major determinant. This constant describes the shape of the average individual growth curve: the lower its value, the slower is the asymptote approached. Maximum size and life span increase as the growth constant declines and the maximum age almost equals the time necessary to complete the growth pattern. With increasing latitude, from Spain to the polar circle, k declines, whereas age and size increase, attributed to the close relationship between k and metabolism. As temperature decreases, metabolic rate declines and rate of growth decreases; the asymptote is approached slowly and this leads to a long life. Simultaneously, there is probably a shift in the anabolic-catabolic-balance increasing the asymptotic size and hence the maximum size. The growth constant and maximum life span also respond to the productivity of the habitat. There is a negative correlation between k and eutrophication, and the maximum life span is reduced as the concentration of nitrate increases. It is concluded that this variability is a case of phenotypic plasticity with no adaptive value because: 1) plasticity must be attributed to unavoidable physiological responses; 2) between populations the relationships between maximum life span, maximum size and reproductive output are positive, whereas trade-offs would be expected if variation in life-history tactics was the source of plasticity; and 3) the demographic consequences of plasticity may be highly disadvantageous. -from Author",183,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,53,NA,NA

There was no evidence that either galler or parasitoid communities are saturated with species, a conclusion supported by high levels of variability in species richness found in individual trees and fruits and by generally low levels of resource utilisation by gallers.

This was due to the fact that individuals increased in reproductive success as they grew older. A possibly higher probability of survival among individuals that perform well in reproduction could not explain the higher reproductive success in older age-classes as compared to young age-classes of geese, because there were no associations between survival and reproductive success, and very few individuals did actually disappear between any two breeding seasons. Path analysis suggested age effects only at earlier stages of reproduction, ie timing of breeding and clutch size. These characters, in turn, were associated with number of fledged young. These findings were further supported by measurements of hatching success and rearing success, which did not seem to increase with age.

Parasitoids should never superparasitize when they search a patch alone. When parasitoids search in the presence of conspecifics, the evolutionarily stable strategy is to reject parasitized hosts at first but later, after a threshold has been reached, to accept them. The thresholds are expressed in gross rate of offspring gain. With an increasing number of parasitoids per patch, females should begin to superparasitize at higher rates of gain. The gross rate of gain at which a parasitoid leaves the patch (leaving threshold) influences the threshold rate at which they should begin to superparasitize. Patch time allocation and host acceptance decisions are interdependent. Both the handling time and the pay-off from an egg laid in a parasitized host strongly influence the threshold rate at which parasitoids should begin to superparasitize. This threshold is only weakly influenced by the number of hosts in the patch. The model predicts that patch time per female and degree of superparasitism are influenced by the number of females in a patch. The total number of offspring gained per unit time in the patch decreases with the number of females, even when the patch area per female and the number of hosts per female are kept constant; thus, superparasitism leads to interference. -from Authors",106,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,60,NA,NA

Species richness of the 14 parasitoids could be related to the high frequency and apparency of both the galls and the Phragmites monocultures. Four non-galling species of Cecidomyiidae attacking P. australis had only 2-3 parasitoid species, presumably due to the less visible and less heterogeneous microhabitat offered to the parasitoids. Distribution of midge galls was due to the several plant characteristics with percentage parasitism and parasitoid coexistence determined by the site of gall induction. The stem-boring moth Archanara geminipuncta (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) was a key factor for the heterogeneous gall distribution and thereby favoured coexistence of the galls' parasitoid species: Giraudiella-galls induced on side shoots, grown from Archanara-damaged shoots, increased percentage parasitism of two parasitoid species and reduced parasitism of one species. Parasitoid foraging was concentrated on temporally and spatially separated subpopulations with the microscale of host density (gall cluster size per reed internode) influencing percentage parasitism only in two out of eight species, and with the macroscale (gall abundance per habitat) having no effect at all.

Fish responded by increasing their appetite: appetite was negatively correlated with the estimated energy reserves of individual fish. Fish previously deprived of food regained their appetite and made up their lost fat within 4 wk of resuming feeding; their appetite then decreased to the level of control fish. The parallel changes in habitat choice and appetite in autumn may be a consequence of the decreased profitability and increased predation risk when feeding in winter.

There was a close correlation between male and female age at metamorphosis and male and female length at metamorphosis. As there was no correlation between mean length and mean age at metamorphosis for either sex, the phenotypic variability in eel age and length at metamorphosis is probably due to the expression of a fixed set of developmental pathways under different environmental conditions. Mean age at metamorphosis was strongly affected by variation in growth rate and, chiefly for this reason, was also correlated with latitude and longitude. Mean length at metamorphosis was not affected by variation in growth rate, but was correlated with both longitude and distance to the spawning area.

Size of snails eaten increased with increasing size of benthic charr. Size of charr eaten increased with increasing size of LL charr. This is explained in terms of ontogenetic gape limitations. Larger snails eaten by SB charr relative to those eaten by similarly sized LB charr may be the result of the larger head and more subterminal mouth of SB charr. LL charr may be ecomorphs of SL charr which, through ontogenetic shifts, switch from planktivory to piscivory at the size of 22 cm. All morphs except LL charr showed peaks in stomach filling and fish caught in gill-nets around the twilight in autumn. This may be linked with diel variation in availability of food organisms, and risk of predation by LL charr.

Also, reduction in number of Neuroterus galls per leaf did not lead to an increase in N levels in the remaining galls, or to an improvement in insect performance. Thus, there was no relationship between gall density and gall N content, nor between density and insect performance.
