Recent field recording of grazing activity in Patella vulgata has shown that limpets maintain an almost continuous grazing rate during the whole foraging excursion. Since previous assessment of the foraging strategy of this species, based on the assumption that grazing rate varied between foraging and travelling, led to conclude that this species adopts a time minimization strategy, we tested a new model based on a constant grazing rate whilst travelling. 2. Two opposite strategies were tested: (a) maximization of the energy gain (Emax), and (b) minimization of the time spent away from the home scar (Tmin). Predictions based on these two strategies, temporal constraints on foraging activity and on estimates of energy input and costs incurred by limpets, were compared with the behaviour of a population of limpets inhabiting a vertical wall at Menai Bridge (UK). 3. According to strategy (a) limpets would forage for the entire duration of their potential activity phase (nocturnal low tide), whereas according to strategy (b) they would only spend away from home the time necessary to balance energy expenditure, which roughly corresponds to one-quarter of the entire duration of the potential activity phase. Moreover, according to the energy maximization strategy, duration of grazing would be independent of size, while according to the time minimization strategy a positive correlation of grazing activity would be expected with size. 4. The comparison of empirical data with the outputs of the model showed that neither a pure time minimization nor the energy maximization hypothesis can provide good estimates for the behaviour of the studied population of P. vulgata, which appears somehow intermediate between the two strategies. The possible explanations for this result are discussed in relation to the biology of the species, the assumptions of the model, and the difficulties in estimating the critical parameters.",foraging strategies | grazing | herbivory | intertidal | time allocation,NA,NA

We examined assemblage structure of tropical fishes on small, artificial reefs to determine if differences in refuge availability could modify patterns of species richness and abundance of fishes established at recruitment. 2. Our artificial reefs were designed to provide prey refuge of two types (permanent and transient). Permanent refugia are those that physically exclude predators, i.e. small holes provide permanent refuge from large-bodied predators. Transient refugia result when habitat complexity increases the probability that prey will elude predators. These refugia do not physically exclude predators and thus provide no permanently safe sites. 3. We conducted this experiment at two widely separated locations on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The species pools of reef fishes, recruitment rates and predator densities all differ between these locations. 4. At neither location were patterns of recruitment influenced by the presence of either type of refuge. By the end of the experiment, however, there were more resident fishes on reefs with additional refugia. 5. Species richness of residents was positively related to total abundance of residents. Therefore, refuge availability indirectly affected species richness through its effect on abundance. There was no indication, however, that permanent refugia provided any greater protection to prey species than did transient refugia. 6. Our results therefore indicate that for these communities, patterns of species richness and abundance established at settlement can be modified considerably over small spatial and temporal scales by differences in refuge availability. Furthermore, habitat complexity need not provide permanently safe sites to affect patterns of coexistence.",artificial reefs | community structure | coral-reef fishes | Great Barrier Reef | habitat complexity | predation | recruitment | refuge | shelter,NA,NA

This paper examines long-term changes in the structure and composition of the groundfish species assemblage in three regions of the north-western North Sea. Scottish fisheries research vessel data collected during the months July September over the period 1929-53 are compared with more recent August groundfish survey data covering the period 1980-93. Trends in the whole groundfish assemblage, and in a subset of the assemblage that is not targeted by commercial fisheries, are described. 2. Long-term differences in species assemblage were subtle, and were most apparent in the dominance structure. Species diversity in the whole groundfish assemblage was marginally greater in the period 1929-53, but no difference was apparent within the non-target species assemblage. For the whole groundfish assemblage, diversity was greatest in the inshore region and least in the offshore area, but there was no obvious spatial gradient for the non-target species assemblage. 3. Multivariate analyses indicated long-term changes and between-area differences in the species composition for both the whole groundfish assemblage and the non-target species subset. More detailed examination of the data revealed that the long-term changes resulted from relatively small and subtle differences in the relative abundance of rarer species, such as grey gurnard Eutrigla gurnardus (L.) and spur-dog Squalus acanthius L.. In contrast, changes in the relative abundance of the more common species, such as Norway pout Trisopterus esmarkii (Nilsson) and whiting Merlangius merlangus (L.), explained much of the between-area variation. 4. Examination of species aggregated length frequency distributions suggested that by the 1980s there had been a shift towards assemblages in which smaller fish were more highly represented. This was only apparent, however, in the whole groundfish species assemblage; the length frequency distributions of non-targeted species were almost identical in the two time periods. 5. Overall, the results suggest that, although differences in the structure of the whole fish assemblage can be detected, the non-target groundfish assemblage appears to have remained relatively unchanged, despite a century of intensive fishing activity.",community structure | dominance | fishing impact | non-exploited fish assemblage | species diversity | whole fish assemblage,NA,NA

Regulation of populations by density-dependent mechanisms is one of the basic tenets of theory in population biology. Yet, it has been argued that population studies rarely reveal density dependence. We show that the detection of density-dependent processes is a function of study spatial scale, so that appropriately scaled studies commonly reveal density dependence, while inappropriately scaled studies do not. 2. The detection of density dependence and the potential for spatial structure in population density were examined in 79 insect population studies. The potential for spatial structure within the study area was estimated from population movement relative to the area over which density was measured. Relative movement was classified as 'high' (and potential for spatial population structure 'low') if more than 10% of the population moved across the boundary of this area each generation. Analyses were stage-based, addressing he prevalence of density-dependent processes, rather than population regulation. 3. In mobile stages (small and large instars and adults), density dependence was found in 69-73% of studies with low potential spatial structure ('high' relative population movement), and in 23-35% of studies with high potential structure ('low' movement). 4. In immobile stages (eggs and pupae), density dependence was rarely detected in studies larger than 0-1 hectare (7-16%), but often detected in smaller-scale studies (65-69%). 5. One-third of studies reporting both density relationships and 'key factors' (sources of mortality that are most correlated with population fluctuation) found the key factor to be directly density-dependent. Density-dependent growth was detected in at least one stage in 74-76% of studies that tested for density relationships. 6. Study length (in generations) was not related to the frequency of detection of density dependence in studies wit low potential spatial structure in population density. This result calls into question the need for long-term studies to detect density relationships. 7. The detection of population regulation may be hampered by scale effects similar to those demonstrated here.",dispersal | insects | key-factor analysis | metapopulation dynamics | structured populations,NA,NA

We report the role of dispersal in the metapopulation dynamics of a protist predator prey pair, the predaceous ciliate Didinium nasutum Muller feeding on the bacterivorous ciliate Colpidium cf. striatum Stokes. In previous work we showed that this extinction-prone pair persisted as metapopulations in subdivided habitats. 2. An experiment assessed the effects of habitat subdivision on persistence and dynamics. Undivided habitats were 270 or 750 mL in volume, and subdivided habitats (arrays) were sets of nine or 25 linked 30 mL bottles (270 or 750 mL total volume), each replicated three times. Undivided microcosms allowed maximum dispersal, whereas subdivision reduced dispersal. Within arrays, bottles with more connecting tubes allowed more dispersal. Nine and 25 bottle arrays also differed in the mean number of connections per bottle. The effects of dispersal on predator prey dynamics were tested by comparing subdivided vs. undivided microcosms, bottles with different numbers of connecting tubes, and nine vs. 25 bottle arrays. 3. We tested the following predictions from metapopulation theory. (i) Predator and prey persistence and predator abundance will be greatest at intermediate dispersal rates. (ii) Prey abundance, local population variability and asynchrony in population fluctuations will be greatest at low dispersal rates, (iii) Predator:prey ratios will be greatest at high dispersal rates. 4. Predictions were confirmed, except for the following. (i) Two measures of synchrony differed in whether they showed the expected pattern. Spatial synchrony (estimated viii correlation of densities among patches within sampling dates) showed high variance and did not vary with dispersal rates. However, spatial variability (CV of density across adjacent pairs of linked bottles), showed the predicted decrease with increased dispersal. (ii) Evidence that dispersal increases predator:prey ratios was inconclusive. Predator:prey ratios were lower in undivided 750 mL microcosms than in 750 mL arrays, possibly because predators over-exploited prey in undivided microcosms, so that both became scarce. Conversely, within arrays, predator:prey ratios were greatest in bottles that allowed the most dispersal, as predicted. 5. This work generally confirms the predicted effects of dispersal on predator prey metapopulation dynamics. It also demonstrates the need for models to include more realism, e.g. the possibility of over-exploitation with very high dispersal.",persistence | predation | Protista | rescue-effects | subdivision,NA,NA

The behaviour of ungulates foraging in non-patchy habitats is studied with the help of a new model of optimal foraging based on a time minimization utility function. The model predicts that an animal uses a foraging station only if the biomass exceeds a prescribed threshold level. Moreover, the forager does not consume all the available food but it gives up the station when food density reaches the threshold level. 2. The assumptions of the model were tested using 36 foraging paths of adult female fallow deer (Dama dama C.) in two different study areas (one wild and one fenced) and seasons (summer and autumn, respectively). Despite the ecological differences between the two sites, the deer exhibited the same pattern of search behaviour which can be described as a first-order biased random walk. Neither herd seemed able to detect and exploit food patches. 3. Partial consumption of food was regularly observed in both study areas. There is strong evidence that the fenced-in animals behaved in agreement with the model's prediction, abandoning the foraging stations when the biomass density fell below 10 g m-2 of dry matter. On the other hand, the deer living in the wild exhibited a more variable foraging behaviour. 4. The theoretical analysis shows that in comparison to the fenced-in deer those in the wild require more information to correctly evaluate the threshold level of their more heterogenous environment. 5. It is argued that the foraging behaviour of follow deer consists of two basic components: a random search for food coupled with a threshold in the selection of foraging stations.",fallow deer | food search | mathematical model | optimal foraging behaviour,NA,NA

Density-independent weather effects can have important consequences for the demography of terrestrial herbivores because precipitation, temperature and insolation influence plant phenology, forage quality and biomass production, which in turn affects the habitat carrying capacity. Since forage digestibility influences intake and weight gain, life-history traits of young, growing animals are likely to reflect variation in the prevailing weather. 2. This paper specifically investigates spatial and temporal variation in age at maturation in female red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Norway in relation to climate variables known to influence primary production. Our findings are corroborated by analysing differences in age at maturation in 21 cohorts of red deer on the Isle of Rum, Scotland. 3. In Norway the majority of females ovulated as yearlings and calved for the first time as 2-year-olds. The proportion calving for the first time at two years varied from 0.23 to 0.67 between regions and fluctuated from 0.46 to 0.76 between cohorts. On Rum, where age of maturation wits delayed at least a year, the proportion calving for the first tithe as 3-year-olds varied between cohorts from 0.0 to 0.89. 4. In a subset of yearlings culled in Norway at the time of conception, the spatial and temporal differences in ovulation rates were related to the geographical and annual variation in body weight. 5. Both the spatial and temporal variation in the proportion of 2-year-olds calving in Norway, and cohort differences in the proportion calving as 3-year-olds on Rum, were negatively related to variation in May-June degree days 12 months earlier. 6. Although primary production on the preferred herb-rich Agrostis Festuca grasslands was positively correlated with temperature in May and June on Rum, the proportion of females calving as three years old, was negatively correlated with annual differences in May-June primary production. 7. We argue that retarded phenological development, during periods of cooler weather, enhances diet quality because leaf:stem ratios and digestibility of plant parts decline more slowly. Thus, weight gain during the early summer growth spurt should be rapid during cool May June weather, increasing the probability of conception in the autumn. 8. Since density-independent variation in food availability also influences fitness components which commonly have a more pronounced influence on population demography, for example offspring survival, we argue that our results highlight the potential importance of variation in weather on herbivore abundance.",climate | diet quality | plant phenology | red deer | reproduction,NA,NA

In order to evaluate the potential effects of egg size, and of parental quality, on early nestling growth in the Antarctic petrel, we performed an experiment in which eggs of different size were swapped between nests. 2. From a sample of 300 nests with eggs of known size, we selected eggs belonging to the lower quartile (small eggs), and those belonging to the upper quartile (large eggs), with respect to volume. Half of the small eggs were exchanged with small eggs from other nests, and the other half with large eggs. A similar procedure was used for large eggs. Growth and survival of the nestlings were recorded until 12 days old. 3. Hatching success was positively related to egg size. 4. Egg size influenced nestling body mass until the age of 3 days, and tarsus length was affected until 12 days old. However, these effects were not due to an effect of egg size on growth rates, but reflected instead the influence of egg size on hatchling size, 5. In contrast to most previous studies, we found no effect of parental quality (as reflected in the size of own eggs) on foster nestling size or growth until 12 days old. This could be because egg size does not reliably reflect parental quality in the species, or because parental effects become evident only at later nestling stages. 6.

Costs of reproduction have been assessed experimentally by measuring subsequent survival and reproduction of parent animals raising enlarged and reduced numbers of offspring. Reported effects on survival have so far always referred to local survival of marked individuals in the study population. They do not provide definitive proof of a cost of reproduction, since reduced local survival may be due either to reduced survival or to an increased tendency to emigrate from the study area. Therefore, it is important to assess mortality rates in connection with brood size experiments. 2. We report an analysis of the time of death in 63 cases where kestrels, Falco tinnunculus L. had raised broods of manipulated size and were subsequently reported freshly dead. 60% of the parents raising two extra nestlings were reported dead before the end of the first winter, compared to 29% of those raising control or reduced broods. This result confirms our interpretation of the manipulation effects on local survival as due to mortality rather than emigration. The extra mortality occurred in the winter following the brood enlargement. 3. Kestrel parents in these experiments have been shown to adjust their daily energy expenditure to the modified brood size.

U. cardui is a monophagous stem gall former on the creeping thistle Cirsium arvense, forming a spatially structured population system due to the patchy distribution of the host plant with frequent extinctions of local populations and recolonization of patches. 3. Gall numbers of U. cardui proved to be proportional to patch area. Thus, patch area is a reliable predictor for population size. The size of newly founded populations was 50% below the population size expected from patch area. 4. The extinction probability of local populations was predominantly a function of population size and therefore patch area. The colonization probability of empty host plant patches was greater during years with low larval mortality and increased with patch size and neighbourhood density. 5. Within the studied population system isolation was of minor importance for the colonization of empty patches because the distance between patches is shorter than the mean dispersal distance of the tephritid species. The colonization rate depends mainly on the number of dispersing individuals and hence on the size of existing populations. 6. Between- and within-patch dynamics operate on similar, short time-scales. Nevertheless, metapopulation dynamics can occur as long as there are local breeding populations and a high risk of extinction of local populations. Presupposumption is that the species-specific dispersal ability by far exceeds the distance of patches.",colonization | extinction | incidence-function models | metapopulation dynamics | tephritid fly,NA,NA

The incidence of habitat destruction on the survivorship of a single metapopulation is studied by means of a spatially explicit model. 2. As the proportion of destroyed sites increases, the structural properties of the resulting landscape change in a non-linear way, showing the existence of critical thresholds and phase transitions. 3. Such critical thresholds are identified by means of an order parameter, which discriminates a quantitative process, i.e. habitat loss, from a qualitative one, i.e. habitat fragmentation. This difference is only well understood using a spatially explicit framework. 4. We introduce on such a fragmented landscape the dynamics of a metapopulation balanced by local colonization and extinction by means of the cellular automaton formalism. 5. The existence of extinction thresholds when a given fraction of habitat is destroyed is reported. These thresholds are determined both by the critical behaviour of the landscape structural properties, and by the demographic properties of the metapopulation. 6. Some differences between these results and those derived from the study of spatially implicit models are described and explained. In particular, the percentage of patch occupancy is lower for a given value of habitat destruction in the spatially explicit formulation Extinction threshold also take place for a lower destruction value.

Field measurement of bovine tuberculosis in badgers (Meles meles) suggests that disease prevalence varies between years in an apparently cyclic fashion. Here, the ability of the simple compartment model of the disease presented by Bentil and Murray (1993) to reproduce this behaviour is investigated. The model predicts that, for realistic parameter values, the disease prevalence will stabilize at a fixed equilibrium, although the transient motion towards this equilibrium may involve damped cycles. 2. The model is extended to include the effects of seasonality and stochasticity, both of which have been shown to reduce stability in similar models parameterized for childhood diseases in humans. However, these changes are found not to sustain the transient cycles. 3. It is argued that, by analogy with models of childhood diseases, the addition of age-structure to the model is unlikely to increase its propensity to exhibit cycles. 4. Finally, it is suggested that one of the fundamental assumptions underlying compartment models makes them unsuitable for representing this problem, which must be addressed using spatially explicit models.",badger | bovine tuberculosis | compartment model | epidemiology | stochasticity,NA,NA

The model suggests that tuberculosis could be eradicated from a possum population by reducing its density to 43% of the (no-disease) carrying capacity, which would require culling possums at a rate of 9.2% per year; or by maintaining 40% of the population in a vaccine-immune state, which would require vaccinating possums at a rate of 15% year-1. 3. The model suggests that the prevalence of tuberculosis could be reduced to 10% of its pre-control level within 5 years by culling possums at a rate of 12% year-1, or by vaccinating possums at a rate of 13% year-1. 4. Taken together, these results suggest that culling possums to maintain a low population density may be the most efficient method of preventing tuberculosis from establishing in an uninfected population, but vaccination could be as or more efficient as a means of removing tuberculosis from an infected population. Both of these statements are sensitive to changes in parameter values. 5.

It is insensitive to whether density-dependent population regulation acts through the birth or death rates. 6.

Using portable electronic balances, patterns of body mass variation in individual mountain bluebirds (Sialia currucoides Bechstein) were investigated to determine whether mass changes during the breeding season were an adaptation to the energetic demands imposed by young (flight adaptation hypothesis) or a consequence of those demands (stress hypothesis). To distinguish between the hypotheses, a food supplementation experiment was performed in which mountain bluebirds were provided with an estimated 25% of their daily energy needs. 2. Males and females had different patterns of body mass variation. Males maintained mass throughout the reproductive cycle, while females gained mass prior to egg laying, began losing mass during incubation, and lost the most mass during the nestling stage. Females were heavier than males during laying and incubation but reached the same mass as mules by the end of the nestling period. In both years, females lost 14% of their initial body mass. 3. Female mass loss during the nestling stage followed a decelerating pattern, supporting the flight adaptation hypothesis. 4. Mass variation patterns during the second breeding attempt were similar to those of the first except that females were lighter at the beginning of the second attempt than they were in the first. 5. Body mass variation patterns in supplemented birds followed the same patterns as those of unsupplemented birds, providing additional support for the flight adaptation hypothesis. 6. Results for females, in particular, support the flight adaptation hypothesis rather than the stress hypothesis. Females put on mass before incubation, perhaps as an energy reserve in case of unfavourable foraging conditions and reduced available foraging time. This extra mass is lost when conditions are more predictable, females are foraging for young, and decreasing flight costs and increasing flight performance is advantageous. Males may maintain a low body mass because their foraging time is not constrained by incubation. Body mass variation thus appears to be an adaptation to the energetic demands of the young and not a consequence of those demands.",body mass changes | cost of reproduction | flight adaptation | food supplementation | mountain bluebirds | parental investment | Sialia currucoides | stress,NA,NA

Brood reduction in birds is frequently associated with hatching asynchrony, wherein incubation commences before clutch completion, causing last-laid eggs to hatch after earlier eggs. In crested penguins (Eudyptes spp.), second-laid eggs typically hatch before first-laid eggs, but the mechanisms behind this reversal are unknown. 2. Through a multifactor field experiment with rockhopper penguins (Eudyptes chrysocome Forster 1781), I examined several factors that might influence incubation length: laying order (smaller first-laid eggs vs. larger second-laid eggs); incubation onset (exposure to immediate vs. delayed incubation); intraclutch dimorphism (incubated with an equal-sized vs. larger nest mate); laying date; egg mass; and egg composition (yolk and albumen content). 3. Three of these factors laying order, intraclutch dimorphism and laying date contributed significantly to variation in incubation length; first-laid eggs produced early in the season and incubated with a larger nest mate took longest to hatch. Differences in incubation onset did not contribute to incubation length when tested independently. The albumen content of both first and second eggs increased in proportion to fresh egg mass, but egg mass had no effect on incubation length. 4. Although Eudyptes parents can potentially adjust the degree of hatching asynchrony through variation in egg position, the effects of laying date and laying order are probably beyond facultative control. Together, these effects may contribute to the unique reversal in both hatching asynchrony and egg-size dimorphism characteristic of crested penguins.",egg composition | Eudyptes chrysocome | hatching asynchrony | rockhopper penguin,NA,NA

The transmission mode and reproductive rates of a parasite tire usually associated with its virulence. In this study, two experiments were carried out to quantify horizontal transmission rates and reproductive dynamics of hen fleas infesting a population of great tits. Our results provide experimental data on certain factors affecting the population dynamics of an ectoparasite in a host population. 2. Immigration of adult hen fleas occurred in 72% (29 out of 40) of previously deparasitized great tit nests. The mean infestation intensity was 5.8 adult fleas per nest and did not vary seasonally. Adult hen flea distribution within the host population was aggregated and did not differ from a negative binomial distribution. 3. In nests experimentally infested with 40 adult fleas, two discrete flea cohorts were found at the end of the hosts' breeding attempts. The first cohort consisted of adult fleas, the second cohort was much larger and consisted of second and third instar larvae. No first instar larvae were observed in the second cohort. A small proportion of larvae was found in cocoons. 4. The day in the season and the daily mean temperatures during the birds' 'brooding period' (i.e. from the start of incubation until the last young fledged or died) were not significantly correlated with the number of fleas in the nests. These results suggest that climatic and seasonal factors do not have significant effects on flea reproduction. 5. The number of adult fleas and larvae was not significantly different between nests where Gill chicks died and nests where at least one young P. Oged. Host reproductive success affected the number and proportion of larvae in cocoons which was lower in nests of birds that failed compared with nests of birds that fledged young. The proportion of larvae in cocoons increased with the number of days in the 'brooding period' of the birds. 6. Among infested nests, the number of adult fleas and the total number of larvae were positively correlated with the fresh mass of the nests, suggesting that density-dependent mechanisms within nests affect flea numbers. Great tits appeared to increase the mass of their nests following experimental infestations with hen fleas. 7. In nests of birds that fledged at least one young, the number of adult fleas and larvae was not significantly correlated with measures of the hosts' breeding performance (chick mass and number of fledglings). These results suggest that flea reproductive success does not depend on the hosts' reproductive performance. 8. These results emphasize the need to study the effects of host responses on survival and reproductive rates of parasites.

Interference with sandfly feeding is evidently host-mediated, as with some other bloodsucking insects. 4. The fact that female feeding success varies between sheds suggests that, with respect to bloodfeeding, female sandflies are not distributed according to the Ideal Free Distribution (IFD), i.e. they do not maximize individual resource gains. Probable costs of reduced bloodmeal size are discussed in terms of female fecundity anti mortality. 5. By fitting a generalized version of Sutherland's interference model, which allows patch quality as well as female interference to vary non-linearly, we infer that blood-feeding within sheds is predominantly on a subset of the available fowl. This too is consistent with the view that female flies disobey IFD. 6.

Analyses were based on assigning parasitoids to each of nine guilds distinguished by the host stage attacked, mode of parasitism, and the host stage from which parasitoids emerge. Host taxonomy and host feeding type were used to evaluate the relative influence of historical and ecological processes on parasitoid guild structure. 2. The number of parasitoid guilds that hosts support was highly variable both among host species and among populations within host species. Guild numbers were strongly associated with host taxonomy but weakly with host feeding type, suggesting that historical patterns of host and parasitoid evolution are much more important determinants of parasitoid guild structure than are current biological and ecological characteristics of hosts. The bulk of the variability in the number of parasitoid guilds occurred among host orders and among host species within genera. Differences among host families within orders, and among genera within families, contributed relatively little variance. 3. Summing levels of occupancy by parasitoid guilds within host genera indicated that a maximum of 69% of the potential parasitoid guilds that hosts could support are actually present. Using data from multiple populations within each host species indicated a maximum guild occupancy rate of 73%. Thus, we estimate that at least 25% of the parasitoid functional groups that could persist are absent from communities, suggesting that parasitoid communities are infrequently saturated with species. Across all parasitoid guilds, distributions of host utilization were not associated with either host taxonomy or host feeding type. However, levels of host utilization by specific guilds were associated with both variables. 4.

The methods of time averaging (Puccia and Levins 1985) are used to show that a positive correlation between predator and prey populations is neither necessary nor sufficient as evidence of density dependence. The sign of the correlation depends on which species is impacted by the environment. This is a general property of systems with negative feedback loops. Correlation patterns are useful for diagnosing the dynamics of populations and for evaluating control strategies. Multiple predators are modelled, with or without negative feedback or self damping in their own numbers, along with prey and plant resources, and the implications of environmental change are examined. Literature is reviewed to see how these models may help explain observed patterns. 2. Many authors have defined density dependence in terms of correlations between prey numbers and the rates of predation or parasitism. So defined, positive density dependence is less common than expected, which has led to much discussion about possible explanations and complicating factors, such as community interactions, time lags, and environmental disturbances. It is suggested here that the term density dependence be restricted to the biological effects of population density on the reproduction and/or survival of members of that population. 3. The impact of a natural enemy of the average population of its prey varies directly with the predation rate and inversely with its self damping. However, a predator that reduces the correlation between a pest and its host plant can reduce resource or yield loss without affecting the average pest population. 4. With self damped predators, environmental variability that acts directly on the plant resource generates a positive correlation between resource and consumer. Variation affecting a predator generates a negative correlation, so that pest populations are low when the resource is most available, favouring increases in that resource. Thus, for example, a biocontrol agent that is sensitive to the environmental change may increase yields. A combination of predators which reduce pest numbers and also the correlation with the resource may be preferable, including predators which are not self damped but are sensitive to the environment.",density dependence and correlation | environmental change | negative feedback | parasitoids | predators and | time averaging,NA,NA

Metapopulation dynamics of the silver-spotted skipper butterfly Hesperia comma were studied between 1982 and 1991 along a 25-km stretch of chalk hills on the North Downs, Surrey, UK. Sixty-nine patches of suitable habitat were identified, of which 48 were occupied in 1982. Over the 9-year period, 12 patches were colonized, seven went extinct and nine patches remained vacant. Patches were more likely to be colonized if they were relatively large and close to other large, occupied patches. Local populations in small, isolated patches were more likely to go extinct. 2. Within a 70-ha section of a metapopulation, murk release recapture techniques were used in 1994 to investigate the effects of local patch area and isolation on movement of individuals among local patches, 988 butterflies were marked of which 133 moved between patches, 67% of between-patch movements were less than 50 m, although the longest recorded distance moved was 1070 m. Butterflies were most likely to move between large patches that were close together. 3. Metapopulation models have assumed that the distribution of distances moved by migrants follows a negative-exponential function. In our study, this distribution fitted an inverse-power function better than a negative-exponential. The under-estimation of long-distance migration by negative exponentials, compared with inverse power functions, may explain why theoretical models have under-estimated the number of occupied patches in metapopulations of H. comma following natural colonization. 4.

However, in absolute numbers, more emigrants came from the largest patch where the source population was the largest. 5. The population system studied here shares attributes of several theoretical types of spatially structured population (patchy population, metapopulation, mainland island system, non-equilibrium system) depending on the temporal and spatial scale examined. The distribution and dynamics of metapopulations should be regarded as being affected by a variety of behavioural and population processes, and real metapopulations can rarely be characterized as a single theoretical type.",colonization | distribution | extinction | mark release recapture | metapopulation,NA,NA

Many studies of foraging in social species have identified benefits for individuals from foraging in groups, but few have demonstrated that there are also costs. We wanted to evaluate the effects of the group on individual foraging behaviour in a social antelope, and the way it affects resource perception by the forager when foraging in different group sizes. 2. We monitored the foraging behaviour of impala (Aepyceros melampus Lichtenstein) in Acacia scrubland in highveld Zimbabwe. We investigated the influence of group size on the foraging decisions of focal individuals, and the process by which impala select bushes to feed on, and how many bites to take 3. We demonstrated that group size had a major influence in the foraging decisions made by the impala, as it determined the number of bites taken from a selected bush by an individual. The cost of foraging in groups was higher when feeding on small bushes, i.e. the potential number of bites to be taken by an individual from low biomass bushes decreased faster with increasing group size than for high biomass bushes. 4. Impala appeared to be frequency-independent 'predators' with strong preferences for high profitability 'prey' types and seem to select bushes ('prey') on a potential gain basis (i.e. potential number of bites to be gained), and not on a strict biomass basis. This result implies that they were taking the group size into account when choosing the bushes. 5. We suggest that impala scanned the Acacia field at the bite level, the field being a mosaic of patches of different bite densities, and that the perception of the resource by individuals in a groups is strongly affected by the number of individuals foraging together.",Aepyceros melampus | browsing | group foraging | resource perception | selection function,NA,NA

We manipulated the size hierarchy in broods of marsh tits (Parus palustris L.) by simulating hatching asynchrony to study how nestlings of different competitive ability, allocate their share of parental feedings to different growth strategies. 2. The mean rate of mass increase and the mass when the growth curve had reached an asymptote increased with the predicted competitive ability of nestlings. In contrast, rate of wing length increase was not related to overall competitive ability. The smallest nestlings in a brood even grew their wings significantly faster than the largest ones. 3. Nestlings that died due to sibling competition showed a steady reduction in the rate of mass increase compared to surviving nestlings from at least 6 days before death. Rate of wing length increase in these dying nestlings was, however, equal to surviving ones right until the last day before death. 4. Nest-leaving was initiated by the largest nestlings in a brood. When the process had started all nestlings left the nest in close succession with the result that the young/small nestlings had to leave at a younger age than their larger nestmates. 5. It seems as if individual nestlings are able to choose how to allocate resources to growth of the wing in relation to mass. In this way small nestlings are able to keep pace with their larger and older nestmates with respect to wing length. 6. The selective pressure responsible for the growth strategy of small nestlings may be the need to leave the nest together with their larger nestmates, which depends on their ability to fly and, thus, the development of the wing. 7. We suggest that sibling competition is one of the most powerful forces to explain intra-brood variation in growth and survival.",brood reduction | growth curve | hatching asynchrony | nest-leaving | Parus palustris,NA,NA

In this study we investigated sources of variation in growth rate and survival in the common lizard Lacerta vivipara. 2. We conducted two experiments to identify factors that explain the pattern of geographic variation of life-history traits in this species. In the first experiment, we raised hatchlings from two French populations of L. vivipara, located at low (150m) and high (1400m) altitudes, under identical laboratory conditions. The hatchlings grew at the same rate when experiencing the same environmental conditions irrespective of their origin. This finding suggests that the observed differences in growth rate between these two populations of L. vivipara are driven by environmental factors (e.g. thermal environment) rather than genetic divergence. Although we did not find any genetic difference between populations, we found some evidence of within-population variation in growth rate. 3. In a second experiment, we raised hatchlings from the high altitude population in outdoor enclosures located at low and high altitudes. The site where hatchlings were raised had a large impact on both growth and survival. Lizards located in the low altitude site grew faster and had a higher mortality rate than lizards located in the high altitude site. These findings are consistent with the observed differences in growth and survival between the natural populations inhabiting the two localities. 4. In spite of the low statistical power of the models used to detect the family x environment interactions, we found a marginally significant interaction for survival (P = 0.054), which suggests that phenotypic plasticity of this trait may have some degree of genetic variance. 5. Finally, we did not find any evidence for a genetic correlation between growth and survival in the high altitude population. This suggests that the observed phenotypic trade-off between the two traits may arise from environmental constraints (e.g. more active lizards have higher growth rates but also have higher risks of predation). 6. Overall, our findings emphasize that environmental factors may play a major role in shaping patterns of life-history association in L. vivipara, and in explaining geographic variation of life histories.",genetic correlation | genotype x environment interactions | geographic variation | norms of reaction | trade-off,NA,NA

A large body of literature has addressed macroecological interactions between abundance, geographic range size and body size across species in animal assemblages. Studies have examined a variety of taxa, at a variety of spatial scales, using a variety of measures of the relevant variables, and with assemblages defined in different ways. Given this heterogeneity, it has been difficult to draw firm conclusions about the nature of these relationships. 2. Here we present an analysis of patterns in the abundance, geographic range size and body size of a monophyletic animal group, the Anseriformes (wildfowl), using data on global abundance and range size for almost all (probably) extant species and comparative methods to control for phylogenetic effects. As far as we are aware, this is the first study to examine these patterns for an entire group at this scale. 3. Population and range sizes are log-normally distributed in wildfowl, whereas the body mass distribution is positively log-skewed. There is a consistent relationship only between abundance and measures of geographic range size. Body size explains little variance in either of these two variables, but some variance in abundance unexplained by geographic range size can be accounted for by life-history traits relating to the rate at which offspring are raised. 4. Abundance, geographic range size and body size all show latitudinal variation, but this is not consistent between variables, and does not appear to affect the relationships observed between them. Wildfowl listed as threatened with extinction have smaller global population sizes and geographic ranges than species considered non-threatened, but it is population size, rather than range size, that seems to contribute most strongly to categorization as threatened or otherwise. 5. Phylogenetic and across-species analyses generally reveal the same patterns. 6.

Numbers of immigrants increased with patch area and abundance of flowering plants. 5. Results on emigration suggest that conserving an isolated butterfly population is more successful in an area with physical barriers to migration than in an open landscape.

Populations of wart-biter Decticus verrucivorus living on habitat islands in an intensively exploited agricultural landscape in south-eastern Norway were studied. Auditory recordings of singing males indicated that 27 (39%) of 70 habitat islands contained populations in the first year of the study, while 2 years (one wart-biter generation) later the number was 16 (23%). Dispersing male wart-biters were also observed, and the dispersal distances measured. 2. Predictors of island occupancy were identified by applying logistic regression models to the pattern of presence absence, probing the predictive power of both landscape variables (island size and isolation) as well as various microhabitat quality variables (vegetation, aspect and slope). The isolation of habitat islands relative to surrounding wart-biter populations was measured by two types of connectivity indices: one bused on the empirical probability distribution of dispersal distances, the other on the negative-exponential dispersal function. 3. Habitat area and the connectivity indices were by far the best predictors of occupancy. The probability of occupation increased with increasing area and decreasing isolation. Of the unoccupied habitat islands, the ones with observations of single males were less isolated than the ones without. From the pattern of occupancy, the average dispersal distance was estimated to be 40 m, while the observed average dispersal distance of males was 37 m. 4. In addition to the effects of area and connectivity, the probability of occupation wits positively influenced by increasing slope to the south, increasing amounts of the plant Achillea millefolium, and decreasing fraction of vegetation lower than 10 cm. The probability of local population extinction increased with declining habitat area and increasing fraction of low vegetation. 5.

We define a parasitoid as egg-limited if a shortage of eggs means that at some time she cannot utilize an opportunity to oviposit. 2. We develop models which consider the differing physiologies of pro-ovigenic and synovigenic parasitoids to investigate the potential consequences of egg limitation. Pro-ovigenic parasitoids emerge with their full complement of mature eggs. Synovigenic parasitoids also emerge with some eggs, but can mature more later in life. 3. The models indicate that egg limitation in pro-ovigenic parasitoids has no effect on stability. This result is independent of the egg load distribution in newly emerged parasitoids, and of the maximum number of eggs with which a female emerges. In synovigenic models, however, egg limitation is found to be destabilizing, though the reduction in stability is decreased by (i) an increase in egg load at emergence, and (ii) a decrease in the 'latent' time required for egg maturation and gut emptying following a host meal. The latent period, during which time the full gut precludes feeding on hosts, differs from a conventional handling time in that host attacks (via oviposition) are still possible if the female has mature eggs.

Bracon hebetor is a gregarious parasitoid with a female-biased sex ratio. While female-based sex ratios are often indicative of local mate competition (LMC), B. hebetor outbreeds, making LMC an unlikely explanation for biased sex rations in this species. In this study we examined an alternative hypothesis that may explain female-biased sex ratios: competitive asymmetries between larval sons and daughters. 2. We measured two types of competitive asymmetries: asymmetric density responses (differential responses to clutch size), and asymmetric composition responses (responses to change in clutch sex ratio). We measured competitive asymmetries in terms of their effects on body size, development time, survivorship, longevity, and daily and lifetime fecundity or mating ability. 3. Males and females emerged as smaller adults, developed more quickly and experienced higher rates of larval mortality when they developed in larger clutches. The effect of clutch size on body size and survivorship was similar for males and females. Increasing clutch size decreased male larval development time more than female development time, although the effect was marginal. 4. Male and female body sizes increased as within-clutch sex ratios became more male-biased, indicating that females, not males, are stronger competitors. This should lead to male-biased sex ratios, rather than the female-biased sex ratios that exist in B. hebetor. Sex ratio had no influence on developmental time or survivorship of either sex. 5. Larger males and females lived longer than smaller individuals, whether they fed on hosts or honey. Larger females had higher daily and lifetime fecundities than smaller females. Larger males copulated with more females and sired more daughters both per day and per lifetime than did smaller males. These body size effects were only detectable when hosts were abundant. At low host densities, differences between large and small and wasps were absent. 6. Although we detected asymmetric composition responses in terms of body size, the effects were slight. Therefore, we conclude that competitive asymmetries are unlikely to have important effects on male and female fitness or on the sex allocation decisions of B. hebetor.",body size | clutch size | fitness | parasitoid | sex ratio,NA,NA

Lough Neagh, Northern Ireland, has been invaded by three non-indigenous amphipod species this century: the North American Gammarus tigrinus and Crangonyx pseudogracilis, plus the European G. pulex. These species have come into contact with the sole native Lough species, G. duebeni celticus. 2. The Lough and its associated rivers were surveyed in 1993-94 and a selection of sites re-sampled the following year. The distributions, relative abundances and habitat utilization patterns of the four amphipod species were determined. All single and mixed species combinations of the four species were found. Gammarus pulex and G. d. celticus are ubiquitous in their habitat selection; however, the former species is replacing the latter. Gammarus tigrinus occurs in deep, mid-Lough areas and, to a limited extent, colonizes sheltered, vegetated shores. Crangonyx pseudogracilis has a fragmented distribution, but utilizes a variety of habitats. 3. Considering those habitat types utilized by all four species, evidence was found for species interactions from field data. First, although both North American species have much greater reproductive outputs, their mean densities were significantly lower than the mean densities of both G. d. celticus and G. pulex. Secondly, the mean density of total Gammarus was significantly higher where C. pseudogracilis was absent compared to where it was present. Thirdly, re-sampling at selected sites in 1994-95 revealed that G. tigrinus and C. pseudogracilis had disappeared from areas dominated by the other two Gammarus species. 4. Since differential mutual predation has been linked to the replacement of G. d. celticus by G. pulex in Irish rivers, predatory interactions among all other combinations of the four species of Lough Neagh were investigated. Male G. d. celticus and G. pulex preyed significantly more frequently on moulted female G. tigrinus than did male G. tigrinus in reciprocal interactions. Predatory/survival abilities may be influenced by body size (G. d. celticus > G. pulex > G. tigrinus). However, G. tigrinus preyed on female G. d. celticus significantly more frequently than on female G. pulex. 5. All three Gammarus species preyed heavily on the smaller C. pseudogracilis, with G. pulex the most severe predator, followed by G. d. celticus and then G. tigrinus. Such predation occurred regardless of the moult state of victims, and frequencies of predation were particularly high on reproductive females. Thus, high rates of Gammarus predation may explain the limited invasion success of C. pseudogracilis. 6. The dynamic nature of Lough Neagh's amphipod communities appears to arise from a combination of overlapping habitat utilization, differential predation and episodes of local immigration exclusion. Species diversity, and probably biomass, have increased following the introductions, which are likely to have significant effects on other species and at other trophic levels.",amphipod crustaceans | community structure | differential predation | habitat selection | Lough Neagh | species invasions,NA,NA

Among species which feed their young, particularly those with large size dimorphism, parental investment trade-offs between growth and survival of male and female offspring, and parental fitness, may be significant (sensu Trivers and Willard 1973). In contrast, little is known about the effects of variation in food supply on sex-differential growth and survival in species with precocial young. In such cases, where parental investment is generally smaller, the trade-off is more proximate; how should individual offspring allocate resources to maximize their fitness. We examined this question by assessing the effects of seasonal variation in feeding conditions on growth and survival of male and female offspring of an obligate avian herbivore with precocial young, the lesser snow goose (Anser caerulescens caerulescens L.), using long-term observational data from 1969 to present. 2. Snow geese show limited sexual size dimorphism, with males being 2-6% larger at all ages post-hatching. Growth of snow goose goslings has been previously shown to be extremely sensitive to variation in food supply, and previous analysis of this species indicated even small differences in growth rates may significantly affect the probability of survival. 3. We found a highly significant difference in the relative body mass, but not structural size, of male and female goslings at fledging in response to seasonal declines in food supply, with males showing a greater proportional fledging mass decrease than females. Despite growth differences there was no detectable seasonal variation in gosling survival between the sexes, and no difference between male and female goslings in survival to fledging overall. 4. Since the analysis involved only goslings which had survived to fledging, it can be difficult to determine if the seasonal decrease in dimorphism reflects either (i) seasonal differences in relative growth of male and female goslings, or (ii) increasing mortality of larger male goslings later in the season. However, the failure to find any sex-specific differences in mortality generally favours the hypothesis of proportionately slower growth of males hatched later in the season. The lack of sexual differences in survival despite measurable differences in sex-specific growth may reflect some level of adaptation to maximize the probability of survival of each sex. However, the possibility that the proportionately greater seasonal declines exhibited by males may reflect a simple constraint, rather than an adaptation, cannot presently be ruled out.",body size | growth rates | hatch date | sex ratio | snow goose | survival,NA,NA

However, augment females lost more mass following the mid-point of lactation than control females, so that the net mass difference between early lactation and late summer was negligible for both treatments. 3. Measurements of total body water at the mid-point of lactation confirmed that mass gains during early lactation reflected changes in body fat levels, indicating that females adjusted their energy stores according to their reproductive demands. 4. We also analysed the relationship between early lactation mass gain and natural litter size among a larger group of control females, studied at the same site between 1990 and 1994. There was a significant, positive relationship between natural litter size and female mass gain. Furthermore, females characterized by the largest gains in body mass had the highest levels of juvenile survival to emergence, indicating that early lactation mass gain is an important component of parental investment. 5.

The experiment was conducted in SW Sweden. One control branch, subjected to bird predation and with unaltered needle density, and three experimentally manipulated categories were used: (i) needle-sparse branches, (ii) net-enclosed branches on which bird predation was prevented but arthropods were free to leave and enter, and (iii) branches that were needle-sparse and net-enclosed. 3. Spiders (Araneae) were the most common arthropod taxa on spruce branches making up between 36-4% and 96-6% of the arthropod median densities. 4. In 37-5% of the data sets there were positive correlations between insect and spider abundances. No negative correlations were found. 5. Bird predation reduced insect abundance in three out of four experimental samples, and spider abundance in four samples. Interaction between bird predation and needle density was found in the autumn samples for spiders, and in the spring samples for insects. However, bird predation effects were found on needle-sparse branches in some samples and on branches with unaltered needle density in others. 6. Spider median body lengths on bird predation-free branches were consistently larger than the median lengths on branches subjected to bird predation. Interaction between bird predation and needle density affected spider size but the direction of the impact varied with time.

In the following three samples the median sizes in relation to needle density were reversed. 7. It is concluded that in the present system effects due to passerine birds predominate. Bird predation is strong and reduces arthropod density. Needle density has a less prominent impact in the system.

Each BMS transect is divided into sections and numbers (densities) of butterflies are recorded separately in each section. Local scale analyses examined population fluctuations on different sections within a single transect. Regional scale analyses examined fluctuations on different transects. 3. At the local scale population dynamics were found to be more closely synchronized between very close population units (sections) than more distant ones. There was considerable variation between data sets but on average this correlation declined relatively quickly over 1-2km. 4. At the regional scale, where local environmental heterogeneity was averaged out (sections were lumped together within transect sites), the decline in synchrony with increasing distance (up to 200 km) was very small compared with local scale decrease, and populations remain partially synchronized throughout the range studied due to regionally correlated weather patterns. 5. Butterfly dispersal had a significant effect on synchrony at a local scale (several km): the dynamics of populations of relatively mobile species remained correlated over relatively long distances. At the regional level, however, mobility was not a significant factor, implying that widespread environmental stochasticity is of overriding importance at this scale. 6. Although mobility and distance are significant factors in determining population synchrony/asynchrony, the low r2 values attributable to them indicate that these factors are actually contributing relatively little to the overall dynamics. Butterfly species show local variation in population dynamics, nested within broad scale synchrony which is presumably generated by the climate. Heterogeneity in population dynamics, in local environments, potentially aids metapopulation persistence by buffering the effects of high levels of temporal environmental stochasticity.",Butterfly Monitoring Scheme | Dispersal | Environmental heterogeneity | Metapopulation | Spatial scale,NA,NA

We tested the hypothesis that competitive ability and vulnerability to predation are primarily products of behaviour using larvae of three container-dwelling mosquitoes. 2. Aedes aegypti was more active, spent more time browsing, more time at the bottom and less time resting than did Aedes triseriatus. These differences lead to the prediction that A. aegypti is a more effective forager and competitively superior to A. triseriatus. 3. In the presence of the predator Toxorhynchites rutilus. A. aegypti spent more time thrashing, less time resting, more time at the bottom and less time at the surface than did A. triseriatus. These differences lead to the prediction that A. aegypti is more vulnerable to predation than A. triseriatus. 4. Survival time with T. rutilus was significantly lower for A. aegypti than for A. triseriatus, confirming the prediction of greater short-term (minutes) vulnerability of A. aegypti. 5. When exposed to T. rutilus (hatch to adult), cohorts of A. aegypti usually failed to produce adults, but cohorts of A. triseriatus always produced adults. At high Aedes density, predation by T. rutilus indirectly lowered development time and increased adult mass and estimated finite rate of increase for A. triseriatus, probably due to release from density dependence. These patterns confirm the prediction of greater vulnerability of A. aegypti. 6. For both Aedes species, survivorship and estimated finite rate of increase were not differentially affected by interspecific vs. intraspecific competition. Estimated finite rates of increase achieved when in competition gave no indication of a strong competitive advantage for either species. For female A. aegypti, mass at adulthood and development time were more detrimentally affected by intraspecific vs. interspecific competition. For A. triseriatus, development time was more detrimentally affected by interspecific vs. intraspecific competition. These results provide, at best, only weak support for the predicted competitive advantage for A. aegypti. 7.

Measures of intraspecific and interspecific aggregation, J and C, are modified to take account of variable patches. The discrete negative binomial distribution is not suitable to quantify crowding on variable patches. 3. A new criterion for coexistence in a patchy environment is developed that is a necessary and sufficient condition for the persistence of a specified species in the presence of other species. A previous criterion, the 'relative strength of intraspecific aggregation', A, represents only a necessary condition for the coexistence of two species. 4.

Tawny owl Strix aluco predation on its main prey (bank voles Clethrionomys glareolus and yellow-necked mice Apodemus flavicollis) and alternative prey (shrews, birds, and amphibians) was studied in the pristine deciduous forests of eastern Poland during a 7-year period (1985/86-1991/92) that included 5 years of moderate densities of rodents and 2 years of outbreak and crash triggered by a heavy seed crop of oak, hornbeam, and maple. 2. Number of resident owls was rather stable; 45-53 owls per 10 km2 in years of moderate and high rodent numbers, and 33 owls per 10 km2 in a rodent crash year. Numerical response of owls to rodent densities was log shaped. 3. In the cold season, the dietary (functional) response of owls to autumn density of rodents was of type II (logarithmic). No functional response of owls was observed to shrew numbers. Owl hunting rate on amphibians in winter was shaped by the mean temperature of the cold season and, to a lesser extent, by availability of rodents. Owl hunting rate on birds was inversely related to rodent abundance. 4. During the seven cold seasons (1 October-15 April), tawny owls removed 3-19 mice, 2-18 voles, 2-7 shrews, 0-2 birds, and 1-9 frogs from an average hectare of the forest. Total predation on rodents (N prey removed ha-1) was lowest during the crash of rodents and highest during the outbreak; it grew logarithmically with increasing density of rodents. On average, in the cold season, tawny owls removed 54% of autumn numbers of mice and 40% of those of bank voles. Percentage predation peaked at 22 rodents ha-1 in autumn. At both higher and lower prey densities, percentage predation declined. 5. The percentage predation curve of tawny owl was compared to the frequency distribution of autumn densities of rodents in Białowieża (from 23-year trapping). The heaviest predation fell to prey densities that occurred most frequently. 6. In summer seasons (July-September 1988-92), tawny owls (both adults and juveniles) consumed 0·5-19 mice and 0·4-10 voles from an average hectare. Percentage predation varied from 6% to 74% of rodent numbers recorded in July, but rodents bred rapidly and recruitment usually more than compensated for losses due to predation. 7. Total predation by tawny owls on rodents was quite stable as a consequence of high stability of owl numbers. Percentage predation, although heavy in all years except for rodent outbreak, was not density-dependent and therefore tawny owls did not regulate rodent numbers.

Beam-trawling is a source of physical disturbance to marine sedimentary communities in areas less than 50m deep, on the western European continental shelf. Chains attached between the beam-trawl shoes are designed to penetrate the upper few cm of the sediment, which leads to the damage or removal of some infaunal and epifaunal species. In some areas, beam-trawling may be frequent and intense, leading to speculation that it may generate long-term changes in the local benthic fauna. 2. As part of a larger MAFF study examining the ecological effects of beam-trawling, we investigated its local impact on an infaunal community in the north-eastern Irish Sea. Studies of this type are complicated by the heterogeneity of the environment, hence we adopted a replicated, paired control and treatment design to maximize the chances of detecting any effects due to trawling. 3. A side-scan sonar survey revealed that the experimental area was characterized by mobile megaripples in the south-eastern sector of the experimental area and stable sediments with uniform topography in the north-western sector. Multivariate analysis of the species abundances from the control areas separated the fauna into two distinct communities which corresponded to the different substratum characteristics. Data from the two regions were therefore treated separately when testing for the effects of trawling. 4. In the north-western sector, trawling led to 58% decrease in the mean abundance of some taxa and a 50% reduction in the mean number of species per sample. Multivariate analysis revealed that differences between control and fished sites were largely due to the reduction or removal of less common species. These effects were less apparent in the mobile sediments of the south-eastern sector, which had a naturally impoverished fauna and high level of heterogeneity. 5. Univariate variables, such as abundance and the total number of species per sample, indicated that the variation between replicate samples increased as a result of trawling disturbance. However, examination of the community data using an index of multivariate dispersion revealed no difference between fished and unfished areas. This suggests that the effects of fishing disturbance are consistent between replicate samples. 6. Fishing with demersal gears modifies communities in relatively stable sediments. Frequent and repeated physical disturbance by fishing gears may lead to long-term changes in the benthic community structure of these habitats.",Beam-trawling | Benthic community | Disturbance | Habitat | Infauna,NA,NA

Mountford's cliff-edge hypothesis states that asymmetrically low survivorship in large broods can account for the common observation that mean brood size is less than the most productive size. A graphical model demonstrates how state-dependent life histories can explain Mountford's hypothesis. The model is based on the optimal allocation of parental resources to reproduction. It assumes that the optimum brood size depends upon the state of each phenotype in the population. 2. Variability among individuals will cause some to produce either smaller or larger broods than their optimum. Juvenile survival is expected to decline with increases in brood size beyond the parental optimum. Juvenile survival from large broods produced by low-quality parents will be exceptionally low, thereby generating Mountford's cliff-edge effect. 3. I tested the model with field data on the success of litters produced by small and large females of the white-footed mouse. The data, in this initial test of state-dependent life history theory, were consistent with the state-dependent explanation. Small females that produced large litters had significantly lower recruitment from those litters than did larger females that produced litters of the same size. 4.

The latter is defined as the frequency of hitting the ceiling per generation per population. 3. With these models we examine the proposition that a metapopulation consisting of random walk local populations would persist without density dependence. 4. Long-term persistence of a metapopulation is not possible without local populations occasionally becoming large and hence being affected by density dependence. But it is possible to construct examples in which a metapopulation persists for a long time with a low incidence of density dependence, in which cases local populations typically have very short expected lifetimes. 5.

In the tropics, many plants offer housing and food for their specialized ant partners which, in return, offer benefit in the form of defence and/or nutrients, thus forming mutualistic bonds. Such ant-plants, also called myrmecophytes, occur together at a local scale, generating community patterns of mutualistic ant-plant associations. Here, we present the first fully quantitative description of an ant-myrmecophyte community. 2. The study site in Central Amazonian tropical rainforest had a high myrmecophyte density of about 380 ind. ha-1. Sixteen myrmecophyte and 25 ant species were recorded, the species abundance rank curves being highly uneven. 3. The ant-myrmecophyte matrix was highly compartmentalized, and a Monte Carlo simulation showed that the observed pattern was not a product of chance and sample size (P < 0-0001). Cluster analyses indicated that compartments were partially explained by occurrence of the ants in phylogenetically related host plants, but not by habitat specificity. 4. The connectance of the ant-plant community was 12%. This value seems quite low when compared with published results from other mutualistic systems (pollinator and seed-dispersor), after controlling for the total number of interacting species. The high frequency of null interactions in the ant-myrmecophyte system could not be explained by the 'phenological non-coincidence hypothesis', since both ant and plant partners occur together throughout the year. 5. Ant-plant interactions were highly asymmetrical: ant species had fewer partners than plant species and ants were more dependent on the plants than the reverse. These asymmetries are in the opposite direction to those recorded for plant-pollinators and plant-dispersors; however, they seem to be the product of the same underlying process: differential fitness benefits between mutualistic partners. 6. The low number of ant and plant partners per compartment, coupled with an apparently high temporal and spatial stability of ant-myrmecophyte interactions, suggests that compartments are the appropriate scale at which to investigate coevolution in ant-myrmecophyte systems.",Ant-plants | Coevolution | Community | Mutualism | Pollination,NA,NA

However, only female survival was related to the number of successful breeding attempts, with a negative correlation. 5. This enhanced mortality late in life is likely to result from an increased cost of reproduction due to the combined effects of increased competition (higher adult density) and increased investment in reproduction (more young to raise because of reduced nest predation).

Using data from a 9-year study of the great reed warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus L. carried out in Sweden, I tested the main assumption of the polygyny threshold model (that there is a cost of polygyny) and the main prediction (that this cost is compensated for). The main question was whether a female that chose a mated male (secondary females) experienced the same fitness as a female that at the same time chose an unmated male (primary females). The study includes a total of 192 breeding seasons of 104 individual females of which 40% settled with already mated males. 2. Eight potential correlates of fitness were examined; namely, clutch size, hatching success, fledging success, survival until breeding age, nest survival, mass of fledglings, mass of feeding females and annual survival rate of breeding females. I started each analysis by controlling for four potential confounding variables (year, study site, female age and breeding date). Then I compared the average fitness measure of primary and secondary females. 3. The only detected potential component cost of polygyny was a higher mortality among nestlings if a non-primary position within the harem was retained until hatching. This was supported by a natural experiment. Females that initially chose mated males but which achieved a primary position after failure of the originally primary female's nest enjoyed an increased fledging success, probably because of more male assistance. 4. The number of recruits, controlling for settling dates, for the two categories of females were almost identical (primary females 0·53 recruits per year, secondary females 0·51 recruits per year). Since secondary and primary females showed similar rates of survival until next breeding season the fitness of the two strategies appears to be equal.

The aggregation model of coexistence states that intraspecific aggregation over patches stabilizes species coexistence and allows high diversity in patchy systems. Until now, most of the empirical evidence for the model has come from temperate and/or artificial systems. We present general support for the model from a community of Drosophila and other insects breeding on fallen fruits of Spondias mombin in a neotropical forest. 2. Our data show weaker aggregation than has been reported from other data sets. Moreover, our data show that the usual practice of estimating aggregation from pooled samples collected at different times leads to an overestimate of aggregation at any particular moment, as is expected when densities fluctuate. 3. The number and the density of competitors in a patch have opposite correlations with patch size: while large fruits seem to be aggregations when numbers were considered, they in fact tend to be low-density refuges. Therefore, we use measures of intraspecific and interspecific aggregation that account for variable patch sizes. 4. We reconstruct mortality patterns by comparing distributions of immature stages and of emerging adults. Our data indicate that the usual practice of estimating aggregation from emerging adults instead of from eggs is only mildly conservative for Drosophila. 5. Associations between species have previously been interpreted as essentially random. We find that associations are consistent between years, and thus should be taken as real aspects of the community structure. 6. Our persistence criterion, the 'relative effect of competitor aggregation', indicates that aggregation can explain coexistence in this community. The exceptions confirm the rule: the species that do not meet the criterion rely more on other breeding substrates.

Two contrasting explanations of niche separation in ruminants emphasize the importance of body mass-related trends in energy requirements and food-processing ability (the diet-quality assumption) and of physiological adaptations to diet type (grass or browse; the diet-type assumption). 2. The quality of the diet consumed in the dry season by 21 species of African ruminants was estimated from observed fermentation rates in the rumens of culled animals using a simulation model of digesta kinetics. The model predicts the effect of food composition (including tannins) on a number of variables on which previous arguments about physiological adaptations have been based: cellulolytic activity, digestion kinetics and volatile fatty acid proportions. 3. The predicted diet quality (potential digestibility) varied from 0-90 in small animals to 0-75 in large ones, and was negatively related to body mass with a shallow allometric exponent (-0·035±0·0109). 4. The allometric exponent scaling body mass to predicted energy assimilation rate was 0·852±0·0474. The abundance and quality of food available were apparently adequate to allow greater net energy intake, relative to requirements, by large animals than small ones. 5. No difference existed in the predicted potential digestibility or net energy yield from the diet of browsing and grazing species after controlling for body mass. Therefore, although the diets differed in their botanical and chemical composition, the end result had little effect on the nutritional ecology of the animals with different diet types. 6. The model predicted that the level of cellulolytic activity of microbes in the rumen can affect the energy obtained from the diet. Microbial adaptation would cause browsers to suffer a penalty on switching from browse to grass, thereby reinforcing diet choice. 7. The presence of tannins in the diets of browsers was predicted to decrease rumen fermentation rate and increase the digestibility of the diet required to match observed fermentation rates.",Browser/grazer | Digestive strategy | Model | Rumen | Ruminant,NA,NA

The numerical response of great horned owls (Bubo virginianus Gmelin) to the 10-year population cycle of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus Erxleben) in the boreal forest was examined during 1988-93 in the south-western Yukon, Canada. Demographic parameters were estimated based on censuses (territorial pairs), nest visits (productivity), and radio-telemetry (survival, emigration, and integration of young birds into the population). 2. Hares rose to peak densities in 1990, and almost all resident owl pairs bred and raised large broods during years of increasing and highest prey abundance. In 1991, the first year of hare decline, all breeding parameters including post-fledging survival were reduced, and recruitment in autumn was very low. In 1992 and 1993, reproduction was completely suppressed. 3. Survival of young owls in their first 2 years of life was high during the peak of the hare cycle, and a large number of non-territorial 'floaters' were present. These birds were silent, and moved more than territorial owls. Their ranges overlapped broadly with defended territories, and floaters were affected by the hare decline before territory holders. 4.

Attempts to explain the abundances of species in assemblages using the biology of the species concerned have primarily concentrated on species body size. Body size is considered to be an important determinant of abundance, because it is related to resource requirements via metabolism. 2. There are a number of problems with this approach, including the rather poor correlation of body size with abundance in many animal assemblages, and the failure to test whether species metabolism is actually a better predictor of abundance than is body size. In fact, there are many correlates of body size which could potentially be determining species abundance, but their effects have never been tested. 3. Here, we use correlation and phylogenetic methods to test what aspects of the life histories of British birds, if any, are related to their abundances. Specifically, we are interested in looking for better correlates of abundance than species body size; we test specific hypotheses linking species metabolic rates, birth and death rates, and life-history correlates of birth and death rates, with population abundance. 4. Most life-history traits examined correlate with abundance across species, and in many cases the correlations are stronger than that of bird body size with abundance. Traits associated with fast offspring production explain the most variation in bird abundances, independently of body size, whereas the relationship between body size and abundance is generally not significant once other traits are controlled for. Within avian taxa, no variables are consistently correlated with abundance. 5. We find little evidence of a role for death rate as a possible determinant of bird abundance, although birth rate may be important, acting through the speed, rather than the quantity, of offspring production. We find no evidence that metabolic rate is an important determinant of the abundances of British birds. 6.

To examine these processes for a long-distance migratory bird species, we studied the population structure, age-specific reproductive output, and local survival of black-throated blue warblers (Dendroica caerulescens, Gmelin) in two breeding habitats differing in shrub density within northern hardwoods forests in New Hampshire, USA. 2. On forest plots with dense shrubs, warblers occurred at higher densities, and fledged significantly more young per capita per season than those occupying areas with lower shrub density. This differential productivity was due to higher reproductive output, mainly through double-brooding, of older (≥2 years of age) individuals, which were disproportionately more abundant in high shrub density sites. 3. Clutch initiation dates, clutch sizes, and predation rates at individual nests did not differ significantly between habitats. Mean body mass of nestlings on day 6 following hatching were higher on average on plots with high shrub density, but differences were not significant. 4. Annual return rates, as indices of local survival, did not differ between habitats for older males or for females. Yearling males, however, returned in subsequent years at a significantly lower rate to low shrub density plots, a result of either lower survival or, more likely, dispersal to more suitable habitat in their second year of breeding. 5. Parental age and habitat suitability interact in that older individuals, through their experience and/or dominance, acquire sites of higher quality, which results in higher reproductive output and probably higher survival. These differences between habitats in density, reproductive performance and local survival are consistent with an ideal-despotic/preemptive distribution of individuals, and suggest that this population could be regulated by the availability, distribution, and extent of high and low quality breeding habitats.",Avian reproductive success | Habitat quality | Ideal-despotic distribution | Neotropical migrant songbirds | Source-sink dynamics,NA,NA

Since the wasp progeny destroy seeds, the question arises as to why selection has not led to increasingly higher fig wasp fecundities and the eventual collapse of the mutualism. 2. The stability of the mutualism could be maintained by pollinators having short ovipositors, restricting oviposition to short-styled flowers so that long-styled flowers produce seeds. However, in most of the monoecious Ficus species where measurements were taken, pollinators generally possessed ovipositors of sufficient length to reach the ovaries of a large majority of the flowers. This was confirmed by the presence of pollinator progeny in flowers with long styles. 3. Complete seed destruction may also be avoided by a proportion of fig ovaries being inviolate to oviposition by fig wasps, independent of their style lengths. However, experimental increases in pollinator foundresses per fig in F. burtt-davyi showed that all the ovaries that could be reached by the wasps' ovipositors were potentially exploitable by agaonine fig wasps. 4. Relative production of wasps and seeds was found to be largely dependent on the interplay between the number of eggs inside each wasp, the number of accessible ovaries in individual figs, and the average number of foundresses entering each fig. On average, there were not enough foundresses entering each tig to utilize all accessible ovaries. 5. Possible factors affecting the total entry numbers of wasps into figs include ostiolar closure rates and wasp population densities in the areas surrounding fig trees. As many ovaries remain unused because of a frequent shortage of wasp eggs per fig, fig trees can continue to produce enough seeds for the continued evolutionary stability of the fig-fig wasp mutualism.",Agaonidae | Ficus | Mutualism | Ovipositors | Pollination,NA,NA

We test the hypothesis that avian social system (territorial vs. colonial) has an impact on the ecological characteristics of avian lice. We compared the louse loads of two congeneric host species, the territorial hooded crow (Corvus corone cornix L.) and the colonial rook (C. frugilegus L.). Each species harboured the same five genera of lice; one species of louse was shared, while the other four species on each host were host-specific. 2. More rooks harboured Myrsidea, Philopterus, Brueelia and Allocolpocephalum spp. than crows. 3. Rooks harboured more species-rich louse loads than crows. 4. Louse loads were also more diverse on rooks than on crows. 5. The frequency distributions of lice on rooks were less aggregated than on crows. 6. Sex ratios of lice were less biased on rooks than on crows. Biased sex ratios were correlated with the subpopulation size of lice on individual hosts, making it necessary to control for subpopulation size in comparative analyses. 7. These findings may result from the increased frequency of horizontal transmissions via increased body-to-body contacts among colonial rooks, compared to territorial hooded crows.",Biased sex ratio | Frequency distribution | Horizontal transmission | Local mate competition | Phthiraptera | Species richness,NA,NA

We investigate whether Venturia canescens marks areas previously searched for hosts and the implication of this behaviour with respect to optimal search patterns. 2. We show for the first time, that while searching on a host patch, V. canescens deposits a marking chemical on the surface of a patch. 3. This marker influences both the behaviour of parasitoids subsequently visiting the patch and the within-patch search pattern of the foraging parasitoid. 4. Individuals discriminate between the marks left by themselves or by conspecifics. 5. Search is not fully systematic, as marked areas are frequently revisited. 6.

It has generally been assumed that reduced winter fat reserves in small birds are symptomatic of environmental constraints on their ability to fatten further. Contrary to this, recent theoretical work on foraging and fat storage suggests that such observations result as a strategic response to environmental stress, determined by a balance of fattening costs and benefits that differ between individuals. Fat reserves should therefore be adjusted to the minimum required as insurance against some period of stress, but birds should respond to the resource variance (predictability) as well as the mean abundance. Hence, birds facing greater starvation risk should carry more fat than those facing less risk. 2. These hypotheses predict that, in a winter-flocking species with a clear dominance hierarchy, and in which social status may determine a bird's access to food, individuals of different social status should differ in the fat reserves that they carry as follows: (i) fat should increase with declining temperature; (ii) the rate of diurnal fattening should be reduced when food is abundant; (iii) fat reserves should be increased when food is scarce; and (iv) dominant individuals should carry less fat than subdominants. This paper tests these predictions by observations of fat reserves of live great tits within a marked, free-living population in Wytham Woods, Oxford, UK. It then examines the relationship between the winter fat and over-winter survival of known individuals. 3. Fat increased with declining temperature on the day of capture rather than at any previous time, suggesting that it acted as a proximate factor in fat regulation. The rate of fattening was lower when food was more predictable. Reserves increased when food was scarce but this depended on the bird's status, dominants carrying less fat than subdominants. Evidence that the ability to fatten might be subject to external constraint was found only in the least dominant individuals. 4. When food was abundant, fat reserves failed to predict over-winter survival, suggesting that the birds were able to maintain their individual optimum reserves. When food was scarce, low ranking birds were more likely to survive if fat, while the survival of dominants was independent of fatness, suggesting that they were still able to achieve their individual optimum reserves. 5. These results agreed with the predictions, so supporting the arguments (i) for a cost of fattening, (ii) that fattening follows a strategic response to resource predictability; and (iii) that social status is a component in that resource predictability.",Environmental constraints | Fat reserves | Feeding ecology | Social status,NA,NA

Molecular genetic information is becoming widely available and can reveal when (in relative or absolute time) pairs of individuals within a species or pairs of higher-level taxa last shared a common ancestor. 2. Such genealogical or phylogenetic information is usually ignored by ecologists when performing cross-taxonomic analyses, probably because ecological and evolutionary time-scales are considered to be very different. 3. Whenever ecologists attempt to understand which traits or characteristics allow different taxa to be successful in different ecological circumstances, phylogenetic information should be incorporated into their analyses whether the data are experimental or observational. Closely related species share many traits in addition to those responsible for ecological success in particular circumstances, and phylogenetically controlled analyses help to eliminate the effects of such confounding variables. 4. When genealogical information is available showing when, in relative time, a sample of individuals from a population or species last shared a common ancestor, it is often possible to infer the population dynamic history. In particular, some modes of population change (e.g. linear or exponential growth, population stasis, population decline) can be shown to provide a much better fit the data than others. 5. Phylogenetic analysis can show the relative extent to which new species evolve into vacant niches rather than partition old niches.",Comparative biology | Ecology | Genealogy | Niche occupancy | Phylogeny | Population dynamics,NA,NA
