The possibility for protected polymorphism is greater with soft than with hard selection. Protected polymorphism is more readily achieved with increasing isolation, an effect that is more pronounced with hard selection. The results are discussed in relation to selection components.",151,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,1

This is because age specific fecundity in many populations is not distributed in the same way for males and females. By functioning as that sex which has the higher fecundity in a particular age span, an individual could increase its reproductive potential relative to lifetime males or females. The magnitude of the reward that comes from sex changes depends on both the demography of the population and its spawning habits. Protandry may be selected for in populations where female fecundity increases with age, and where individuals mate at random. Factors which favor the evolution of protogyny are those which tend to depress male fecundity values at early ages, such as inexperience, territorially, or female mate selection. Selection for protogyny can also exist when female fecundity decreases with age, although this situation seems rare in the field. It appears that the nature of the fecundity schedule for females has a greater effect on the magnitude of the selection pressure for sequential hermaphroditism, than does the age structure of the population. If sequential hermaphroditism becomes genetically fixed in some members of a population with differential age specific fecundities, the frequency of the hermaphrodites should increase over time until they eliminate the gonochoristic individuals. The pattern of sexual transformation eventually reached in a population is predictable through the use of a simulation model developed here. The pattern depends on the age structure, female fecundity schedule, and mating characteristics of the population. For two examples, the predictions appear consistent with what is seen in nature. At equilibrium, the simulated populations consist of individuals which changed sex at one of 2 ages, and each type has essentially the same reproductive potential. This suggests that one should see a rather sharp break in age specific sex ratios in protogynous or protandrous populations. Some hermaphroditic populations exhibit such sharp changes, but others do not. The expected pattern would tend to be obscured by differing growth rates among individuals.",341,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,2

The 'open' system consists of polymorphic gene loci which recombine freely without drastic effects on viability. Examples are electrophoretic, polygenic, clonal, and subspecific variability. The 'closed' system consists of blocks of genes forming coadapted, internally balanced gene complexes with or without the presence of inversions as a stabilizing mechanism. Perturbation of these blocks (supergenes) by crossing over results in greatly reduced viability under normal natural selection. These blocks vary between but not within species. When natural selection is relaxed, as during a populational flush crash founder cycle, the coadaptive balances of the closed system may become disorganized and one or more discordant individuals may survive. Speciation may occur as selection operates on the perturbed genetic system to organize new closed systems which come to characterize the new species.",195,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,3
