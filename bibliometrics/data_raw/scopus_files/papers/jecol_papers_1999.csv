Growth, survival and reproduction were recorded for 1306 individuals in a 1-ha plot over a 4-year period. The volume of each individual was estimated, and transition matrices with nine size classes were constructed. Standard matrix analysis was performed, and the relative importance of individual life-cycle components to changes in the finite rate of population increase (λ) was determined. 2 Periodic matrix analysis projected a 29% annual increase in population size (λ = 1.29), while annual projection λ-values varied between 0.99 and 1.44. For both methods, elasticity of seedling recruitment was always very low in all 4 years, and the highest elasticities were generally associated with permanence in the same size class. 3 Periodic and annual projections predicted similar elasticity patterns, with the relative contribution to a change in λ of different demographic processes changing between 'good' and 'bad' years. However, annual matrices identified two bad years, with fecundity and growth elasticity decreasing relative to survival, whereas periodic analysis identified only one such year, and elasticity changes were seen only in fecundity and survival.",35,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Demographic parameters | Demographic triangle | Demography | Elasticity | Invasive species | Life history | Mesquite | Periodic matrices | Prosopis glandulosa | Sensitivity,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,1

In order to investigate these relationships, 10 species-area curves were constructed for 10 sets of nested quadrats (from 0.25 m2 to 150 m2) in herbaceous marshes where biomass ranged from 128 g m-2 to 1050 g m-2. 2 Slopes (z) of the species-area curves (logs = logc + zlogA) were positively correlated with production (whether measured as biomass or soil organic content). A possible cause of increased slope was larger potential species pools at high biomass. The constants (c) were negatively associated with production, which concurs with the general richness-productivity relationship. 4 Linear models were used to predict both c and z using biomass and soil organic content. Biomass explained about 38% of the variation in both z and logc. Soil organic content was a better predictor. It explained 60% of the variation in z and 41% of the variation in c. 5 The slopes (z) and constants (c) of the species-area curves were negatively correlated. Because c is the expected species richness at 1 m2 and z strongly affects larger-scale richness, the results suggest that small-scale richness is not a good indicator of larger-scale richness. There was no significant relationship between species richness in small-scale (0.25 m2) quadrats and large-scale quadrats (150 m2). 6 These results suggest that the conflicting data that have led to recent debate over the richness-productivity relationship may reflect both the effects of scale and the natural history peculiarities of the systems studied.",67,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Biomass | Productivity | Scale | Soil organic content | Species richness | Species-area curve,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,2

Mid- to late November hardening of shoots was enhanced, midwinter damage below - 30°C reduced and dehardening delayed nearer the upper limit. To here temperatures began to rise at least 3 weeks before dehardening began. Shade crown shoots were more susceptible to deep-freeze damage than light crown shoots. If the ultimate upper distribution limit was determined by frost hardiness, F. crenata would be expected to occur up to 1800 m altitude. 3 Betula ermanii is found between 1600m and 2800m, and intensive hardening occurred at all altitudes during the second half of October. Frost hardiness increased considerably with altitude up to the forest limit, where frost acclimation preceded the temperature decline by 2 weeks. Once maximum frost resistance had been attained freezing to -47°C failed to cause tissue injury. Dehardening began slightly later at the tree line, but the time-course was the same at all altitudes.

In contrast, in the 3-6 cm layer, these correlations peaked when root and rhizome frequencies were compared with plants above-ground displaced by a horizontal distance of 2 cm. This confirms the predominantly inclined growth of both roots and rhizomes; while the inclined growth has been shown regularly by studying single plants, the current study shows its prevalence at the community level as well. 4 The similarity to the above-ground patterns in the upper soil layer was due to the spatial constraints of plant presence above-ground; in contrast, the spatial patterns in the 3-6cm layer were independent of plant presence above-ground. The role of root growth plasticity is discussed in this context. 5 Autocorrelation analysis of the root data revealed that there was a pronounced difference in the grain of horizontal spatial pattern between total root biomass and species-specific root frequencies. All the species had rather loose root systems and clumps of one species rarely extended more than 0.5cm. In contrast, there was significant long-range clumping of root biomass up to 10cm. The below-ground heterogeneities in overall biomass and in species-specific distributions were therefore probably determined by different environmental processes. 6 No such difference in clumping range between total biomass and species-specific frequencies was observed in above-ground parts.

We examined factors influencing pollen limitation in Rhexia virginica (Melastomataceae), a species in which pollen transfer depends on bumblebees capable of buzz pollination. Experimental studies were conducted in two populations at Lake Matchedash, southern Ontario, Canada, where the species occurs at the edge of its familial range. 2 Supplemental hand pollination of flowers increased their probability of fruit set compared with open-pollinated control flowers by an average of 57.6%. Pollen limitation was assessed on a per flower basis because the median floral display size at Lake Matchedash was one flower. Pollen limitation was prevalent throughout the 34-week blooming period in one population, whereas in the other it was only evident at the beginning of flowering, despite their close proximity. 3 Bumblebee visits (primarily Bombus impatiens) to R. virginica flowers were infrequent and variable in their occurrence. Visitation was recorded on 14 days during flowering. The median number of visits was 0.65 bees per hour; on 6 days there was virtually no bee activity, but on 2 days visitation rates were high. Variation in pollinator activity was apparently unrelated to local weather conditions. 4 Field experiments demonstrated that the poricidal anthers of R. virginica dispense pollen gradually, with only 10.2% of pollen removed from flowers during a single bumblebee visit. This level of pollen removal is lower than reported in other flowering plants. On average, 47.3% of pollen remained in anthers at the end of anthesis. 5 Investigation of the relation between pollen dispersal and pollen limitation demonstrated a significant negative correlation between the proportion of pollen removed from anthers on a given day and the intensity of pollen limitation. It appears that the pollen-dispensing mechanism of R. virginica and infrequent visitation by bumblebees compromise pollen dispersal, causing pollen limitation in Ontario populations.",59,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Bumblebee | Insufficient pollination | Pollen removal | Poricidal anthers | Reproductive ecology,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,17

It has been hypothesized that plant species are limited in their distribution by abiotic factors towards the more extreme end of the gradient, and by competition towards the more favourable end. Invasion of the native clonal grass genus Elymus in many Wadden Sea marshes may be due to increasing atmospheric nitrogen input into a nitrogen-limited environment. However, at Thmlauer Bay, Germany, Elymus athericus does not occur in lower salt marsh communities that are dominated by a dwarf shrub (Atriplex portulacoides). We therefore hypothesized that at this site the downslope (= more extreme) distributional boundary of E. athericus is a result of competition with A. portulacoides rather than of physiological limits. 2 A factorial experiment was set up to investigate the effects of removal of each competitor and fertilization. The reciprocal effects of the species on each other were measured in terms of vegetation cover and above-ground biomass. The impact of the tidal regime on plant zonation was investigated by calculating inundation frequencies at the boundary between the two plant populations from water level recordings. 3 Elymus athericus extended its distribution into the lower salt marsh when A. portulacoides was removed. The latter increased in cover but not in biomass after the removal of E. athericus. Neither species showed a response to nitrogen fertilization. The boundary between the two species in the control plots varied considerably in elevation and inundation frequency. 4 The lower distributional boundary of E. athericus can be interpreted as the result of competition with A. portulacoides. Improvement of nitrogen availability in concentrations of the same order of magnitude as annual atmospheric input had no detectable effect on plant zonation and growth.

Designs for greenhouse studies of interactions between plants are reviewed and recommendations for their use are provided. 2. Papers published over a 10-year period showed the replacement series design to be the most popular, especially in studying crop weed interactions. Fifty per cent of the studies involved only two species, although studies testing the interaction between different genotypes of only a few species were also popular. 3. Limitations imposed by the choice of design, the variables measured, and the analysis used on the range of inferences that may be validly drawn from the experiment are frequently not well understood or appropriate for the questions that appear to be addressed. One example is the failure to distinguish the outcome of competition (the long-term outcome of interaction) and the effects of species on each other. 4. Studies in which only final yield is measured are severely limited as to the inferences which may be drawn. Effects due to interspecific interaction during the course of the experiment cannot then be separated from pre-existing differences, and interpretation may be biased towards species whose individuals were initially larger. In addition, measurements at several times are necessary to understand the changing dynamics of species interaction. 5. Simple pair-wise mixtures can assess the effect of treatment factors on the outcome of competition. Replacement series and related diallel designs generally produce results that may be size-biased even when initial interspecific differences are known. Additive designs (including target-neighbour designs), despite confounding density with species proportions, offer considerable scope for addressing mechanistic questions about interspecific interactions. Designs that allow response surface analysis can avoid many of the problems inherent in the other methods, but all need to be adjusted for initial interspecific differences. Designs for multiple species experiments are still largely untested, although several designs have been used.

In addition, we tested the effects of environmental factors on rhizome dynamics by (i) mowing in late summer, (ii) cutting of rhizome connections, and (iii) removal of close neighbour plants. 3.

This model provides a very narrowly defined set of testable quantitative predictions, and thus is the first falsifiable model of assemblage-level thinning. We fit this model to the species richness-above-ground biomass data from 14 empirical studies that are often cited as evidence of a general diversity-productivity relationship. In addition, we compared our model to two other models, one more flexible and one more constrained than our own. 3 We found that our model of species richness explained a substantial and statistically significant portion of the species richness observed in 11 of the 14 empirical studies of species richness-biomass patterns.

The probability of suffering herbivore attack was independent among the ramets belonging to the same clonal fragment, suggesting that clonal propagation might operate as a risk-spreading strategy in this species. 3 Leaf damage did not affect any measure of plant performance, probably due to the low amounts of leaf area removed by invertebrate herbivores. In contrast, vertebrate grazing affected all phases of the pseudo-annual life cycle of T. europaea. Grazing prevented flowering and fruiting, increased ramet mortality during summer and decreased tuber production. Furthermore, grazed ramets produced shorter stolons and smaller tubers, which in turn had a lower winter survival and produced smaller ramets in the following growing season. The large impact of grazing was due to the consumption of the whole of the single shoot of ramets of T. europaea.

Comparisons of biomass allocation were made to assess whether plants with hermaphrodite flowers were larger than unisexual plants. The seed fertilities of sex phenotypes were measured and related to the sex ratio of populations. 3.

Control strategies are needed for the clonal species Solidago altissima, which is an aggressive invader in Europe that propagates vegetatively by persistent rhizomes that produce annual shoots. 2. The shoot dynamics of a population of and altissima that had invaded an old-field site in 1984 were studied from 1987 to 1992. Shoots from 120 genets of the same cohort were followed in relation to their parent genets. We assessed the effect of yearly mowing, yearly cutting of rhizomes and repeated removal of close neighbour plants on growth, survival, probability of reproduction and flux of these shoots. 3. In unmown plots, both shoot survival until the end of the growing season and the proportion of shoots producing seeds decreased (59% to 36% and 67% to 32%, respectively, from 1988 to 1992). The proportion of rhizomes producing shoots, however, rose (from c. 50% to more than 90%) so that annual shoot density increased almost fivefold by the end of the study, when it had almost reached equilibrium. 4. In contrast, shoot density in mown plots remained roughly constant from 1988 to 1992, after an increase from 1987 to 1988. Shoots were much smaller and a smaller proportion of them reproduced than in unmown plots. 5. Rhizome cutting (reduced clonal integration) produced a small but consistent decrease in height and in the percentage of sexually reproducing shoots. 6. The removal of close neighbour plants increased shoot density, and a higher percentage of these shoots survived and reproduced. 7. Experimental demographic studies thus show that (i) continued regular mowing reduces the production of both seeds and shoots, and so would prevent further spread of an invading S. altissima population; (ii) clonal integration may contribute to the species' success as an invader because disconnected rhizomes produce smaller shoots with a lower chance of sexual reproduction; and (iii) competition decreases shoot density, mainly as a consequence of reduced shoot survival, and can therefore control S. altissima growth.",56,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Biological invasions | Clonal plants | Competition | Experimental demography | Rhizome cutting | Shoot dynamics | Solidago altissima,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,32

Population increases in Solidago altissima, an aggressive invader in central Europe, can be due to clonal growth by rhizomes or sexual reproduction by seeds. We studied transitions between different reproductive stages, to assess the potential of S. altissima to colonize new habitats by seed, and the influence of annual mowing on the dynamics of seeds and juvenile plants. 2. The dispersal of the numerous achenes, their subsequent fate on and in the soil, and the growth and survival of seedlings and juvenile plants were followed from 1988 to 1990 in an old-field population. 3. The seed rain was 49 000 seeds m-2 per annum in unmown and 1800 seeds m-2 per annum in adjacent mown plots. Survivorship and germinability of seeds in the soil decreased rapidly in the first 3 months after dispersal. Thereafter the declines were much slower. Germination within the established vegetation was very rare: only 12 out of 150 000 experimentally sown seeds (0.008%) became seedlings. 4. The survival and growth of seedlings transplanted into closed vegetation increased with age and developmental stage. Nevertheless, no transplants flowered during the 24 months over which their fate was followed. 5. Mowing affected neither seed survival nor germinability, nor did it have any effect on the growth, survival and reproduction of seedlings or juvenile plants. 6. The creation of 1-m2 openings in the vegetation strongly increased the number of emerging seedlings. Production of achenes was high (c. 20 000 per sexual shoot) and seed rain data suggested that 80-90% of all seeds may have been dispersed outside the study area. The colonization of nearby open sites is therefore quite probable. 7.

If there is no long-term cost of reproduction, then reproduction may be viewed as free in an evolutionary sense. 3. As is generally the case in dioecious species, females allocated more biomass and nitrogen to reproduction than males. Females also showed delayed costs of reproduction in terms of decreased growth and subsequent reproduction, whereas males did not. 4. The lack of measurable delayed costs in males suggests that with the evolution of dioecy, selection has reduced delayed costs of reproduction in S. grandiflora males In contrast, females that were prevented from reproducing were able to re-allocate resources to growth, and produced more stem length on average than males.

Seedling recruitment was monitored over 22 months in gaps established in the vegetation in summer 1995. 2 The most common species recorded from the seed bank in early summer 1995 were dicots (17 species), but perennial grasses (five species) were numerically the most abundant (65% of total).

Insects and molluscs had no effect on the size of the seed bank of any species. The number of species in the seed bank was not affected by any of the herbivore exclusions. 4 A comparison of seedling emergence in gaps formed over the original soil with gaps where the soil had been sterilized indicated that only Galium saxatile and Cytisus scoparius recruited from the seed bank. Seedling recruitment was almost entirely derived from the recent seed rain, was dominated by the most abundant perennial grasses in the vegetation (Festuca rubra and Holcus lanatus), and had a species composition that resembled the established vegetation. Results highlight that the potential for seedling establishment in gaps to bring about vegetation change in this grassland is low. 5 Six species had higher seedling densities on rabbit-fenced plots, but the significant effect of fencing disappeared by plant maturity for most species. Survival of seedlings was lower on fenced plots where non-grazed biomass accumulated, so that after 22 months Agrostis capillaris was the only species with more plants present where rabbits were excluded.

To describe the spatial scale at which soil pollen is related to neighbouring vegetation, pollen in 46 soil surface samples was compared with plant cover within concentric circular plots (0.5-1 m radii). Regression analysis of percentage pollen with plant cover at different distances from the surface sample had the highest correlation with radii < 1 m, confirming that entomophilous meadow species have very small relevant pollen source areas. 3. We analysed pollen records in soil columns at three sites representing a range of growing season lengths and community types within the meadow. Soils had aggraded by the deposition of eolian silt. Radiocarbon dates of pollen concentrates were similar to or older than radiocarbon dates on charcoal pieces at the same depth, suggesting negligible downwards movement of pollen in the soil profile. 4. The oldest soil pollen profile was from the wettest microsite, currently dominated by a snowbed Carex nigricans community. This site was occupied by a dry Juniperus community prior to c. 6000 BP (before present), when it shifted to more mesic communities dominated by Poaceae and Polemonium. The first appearance of a snowbed Carex nigricans community at this site, c. 2500-1500 BP, suggests a change to cooler and/or wetter regional climate. 5. High levels of Polygonum bistortoides at all sites indicated a shift to long snow-free periods and mesic summer conditions during an interval corresponding to the Medieval Warm Period (c. 1200-700 BP). After 500 BP (during the Little Ice Age) Carex nigricans re-established in the wet microsite, while relatively little change occurred at the other two sites.

In the pots that received fertilizer, the shoot nutrient content and above-ground biomass of Nardus plants increased to a greater extent than those of Calluna plants; this effect was more marked for Nardus plants growing with Calluna plants than for those growing with other Nardus plants. In contrast, Calluna plants growing in competition with Nardus failed to respond to the addition of nutrients.

The restriction of some vascular plants to soils high in gypsum under arid or semi-arid climates has been reported by many authors in different parts of the world. Factors controlling the presence of gypsophytes on these soils are far from being definitively explained. 2. The establishment of Helianthemum squamatum, an Iberian gypsophyte, was investigated during a 2-year period in a typical semi-arid gypsum gradient landscape in central Spain that included the three community belts where this plant can grow. 3. More than 500 seedlings were tagged. Their growth and survival were monitored periodically (23 census dates). Over 80% of the recorded seedlings emerged during the first year, which followed a severe and long drought period. Germination occurred principally in winter (over 85%), although seeds germinated sporadically even in late May. Emergence was clearly spatially confined, with seedlings appearing only in the summit area, which was characterized by gypsum outcrops (160 per m2), and at the boundary between gypsum slope and alluvial piedmont (273 per m2). Seedlings were very scarce in lower areas (Lygeum spartum and Artemisia herba-alba communities) and absent from the steeper gypsum slope. 4. Survival was size-dependent: larger plants had a better chance of surviving the first summer, which is the bottle-neck for recruitment. We detected few differences in the final survival percentage after the first year for cohorts or zones, and survival curves were also similar, except at the boundary between gypsum slope and piedmont. However, seedlings emerging in 1997 had a higher survival percentage than those emerging in 1996. 5. Proximity to a seed source was the most relevant predictor of emergence. This may be related to the presence of mucilaginous coats in H. squamatum seeds, which may enable plants to become established on crusted soils. 6. Our results seem to link gypsophily with some properties of the surface crust, which is thought to contribute to the restrictive behaviour of such soils. We detected seedlings emerging on soils with very high surface strength, but also in alluvial soils. This suggests that H. squamatum can penetrate hard soils but also has the potential to grow on less restrictive soils.

Pollen and charcoal analysis at two lakes in southern Switzerland revealed that fire has had a prominent role in changing the woodland composition of this area for more than 7000 years. 2. The sediment of Lago di Origlio for the period between 5100 and 3100 BC cal. was sampled continuously with a time interval of about 10 years. Peaks of charcoal particles were significantly correlated with repeated declines in pollen of Abies, Hedera, Tilia, Ulmus, Fraxinus excelsior t., Fagus and Vitis and with increases in Alnus glutinosa t., shrubs (e.g. Corylus, Salix and Sambucus nigra t.) and several herbaceous species. The final disappearance of the lowland Abies alba stands at around 3150 BC cal. may be an example of a fire-caused local extinction of a fire-intolerant species. 3. Forest fires tended to diminish pollen diversity. The charcoal peaks were preceded by pollen types indicating human activity. Charcoal minima occurred during periods of cold humid climate, when fire susceptibility would be reduced. 4. An increase of forest fires at about 2100 BC cal. severely reduced the remaining fire-sensitive plants: the mixed-oak forest was replaced by a fire-tolerant alder-oak forest. The very strong increase of charcoal influx, and the marked presence of anthropogenic indicators, point to principally anthropogenic causes. 5.

Genets with many ramets were patchily distributed at a metre scale. Analysis of genet structure on a scale of square centimetres, however, revealed that the genets were highly intermingled with no clear boundaries between them. The presence at both scales of sampling of many genets with unique multilocus genotypes indicated continuing genet recruitment within the population. 3. In the closed canopy habitat, the patches examined were each composed of a single unique multilocus genotype, suggesting that each had developed by asexual propagation following the establishment of a single genet. 4. The clonal structure of U. perfoliata patches in both gap and closed canopy habitats therefore appears to depend on recruitment patterns of genets. Populations in closed canopy habitats are characterized by a 'waiting' strategy, in which asexual ramet production maintains populations until genet recruitment by seed production can occur under the more optimal conditions associated with canopy gaps.

This spacing effect was particularly marked in Sloanea woollsii, but also present in Doryphora sassafras.

The number of woody species in tropical forests tends to increase with precipitation, forest stature, soil fertility, rate of canopy turnover and time since catastrophic disturbance, and decrease with seasonality, latitude, altitude, and diameter at breast height (d.b.h.). 2. A model is presented to account for these trends. Novel hypotheses include how increased rainfall and substrate fertility, and decreased seasonality, might (i) increase attacks by natural enemies, and thus the overall level of density-dependent plant mortality; (ii) increase shade tolerance, canopy turnover, and stem density of the species-rich understorey; and (iii) increase reliance on relatively sedentary forest-interior birds for seed dispersal, fostering high rates of speciation in understorey genera. 3. High rainfall and low seasonality in the tropics favour two key groups of natural plant enemies - insects and fungi - that are directly responsible for promoting high rates of density-dependent plant mortality. Lower rainfall, greater seasonality, soil infertility, or unfavourable rooting conditions favour greater allocation to anti-herbivore defences, and thus lead to lower rates of such mortality and thence to lower tree diversity. The increased number of individuals on rainier sites is a minor contributor to increased tree diversity, accounting for only about 17% of the 8.3-fold increase with rainfall in the lowland Neotropics. 4. Predictions of the model are consistent with many ecological patterns of variation in tropical tree diversity within regions, and may help explain the decrease in tree diversity with elevation and the accompanying decrease in horizontal patchiness (within-habitat β diversity). 5. Random drift over evolutionary time in the relative effectiveness of density-dependent control of individual tree species by specialized natural enemies may better account for the observed distribution of tropical tree abundance than a random walk of species abundance through ecological time.",328,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Anti-herbivore defences | Density-dependent mortality | Tree turnover | Tropical forests,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,48

We identified genets by a randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) method and used their size and spatial pattern, together with demographic parameters (genet spreading rate and mortality rate of shoots) determined in the field to estimate natality rates for Festuca rubra (red fescue). 2 In each of two sites (a species-rich and a species-poor site in a mountain grassland) three plots were established. Each plot contained two 1 m x 3.3 cm transects, composed of 3.3 x 3.3 cm square cells. Estimates of genet number per plot (18-49 and 27-33, respectively, in the two sites) were based on a randomization test. Mean genet size (1.2-1.6 cells) was not significantly different between the sites, nor was the spatial pattern of genets significantly different from random at either site. Interactions between genets therefore appeared to be negligible. 3 A spatial simulation model was developed for the genet population. Values estimated from the growth and demographic data over several years for the genet spreading rate (0.2-0.3) and for the mortality rate of shoots per cell (0.2-0.3) were among those used in the simulation. When a constant genet natality rate of 3-7 genets m-2 year-1 was included in the model, the simulation generated numbers and size frequency distributions of genets that were similar to those found in the field. 4 In this mountain grassland, F. rubra appeared to show repeated seedling recruitment, instead of the initial seedling recruitment following disturbance that is thought to be typical of many grasses. Founder effects were immaterial at the rates of seedling recruitment apparent in these populations. A stable population was achieved with the values of genet spreading rate and mortality rate of shoots per cell observed in the field, and repeated seedling recruitment.

The seed store of P. sessilis appeared to be being replaced annually, as seeds in the older fruits rapidly lost germinability and new fruits matured to replace them. For H. sericea, the seed store appeared to be accumulating each year, because older fruits retained a high level of germinability. 4 The study indicates that no one fire season will maximize the germinable seed release after fire for all species.

Discriminant analysis showed that the two groups could be separated by petiole length and the ratio of blade width to length, with those orthotropic species having short petioles also tending to have narrow blades. 3 The petiole length distinguishing orthotropy from plagiotropy showed a linear decrease with increasing latitude, as small-leaved short-petioled orthotropic species were relatively abundant at the temperate Australian sites. 4 The likelihood of a species being plagiotropic was weakly related to its shade tolerance and not related to adult stature or abundance, i.e. understorey leaf display was more closely related to leaf dimensions than to life-history attributes. This importance of leaf dimensions may reflect their influence on light interception and mechanical support requirements. 5 A smaller fraction of species was plagiotropic in the canopy than in the understorey, particularly in Australia, where many short-petioled species shifted from plagiotropic to orthotropic on attaining the canopy. 6 This switch from plagiotropy to orthotropy appeared to be associated with excess light levels relative to photosynthetic capacity, slow branch extension rates and low illumination angles.

A cell is 'black' if a plant established at that particular time and place; otherwise it is 'white'. 3 Each pair of black cells is connected by a 'join' that represents the association between stems established at two different places and times. Join 'length' is the pair of factors (s,t) that describes the distance between stems in space and in time, respectively. Spatio-temporal pattern is detected by comparing the number of joins of each 'length' in a particular lattice with the expected number calculated from lattices generated by three different random models. Colonization rates can be estimated if there are particular join classes that occur more frequently than expected. 4 Artificially generated lattices were used to examine the effect of background noise on the ability to detect underlying pattern. 5 Field data were obtained from a Populus balsamifera clone that was colonizing a grassland.

A canopy model was developed to calculate light absorption by individual shoots. Light absorption per unit mass (Φ(mass)) was used to quantify the efficiency with which plants utilized biomass to capture light. 3 The leaf mass ratio (LMR), average specific leaf area (SLA) and therefore the leaf area ratio (LAR) decreased with shoot height and light availability. Light absorption per unit leaf area (Φ(arca)) increased with shoot height, and this increase was observed to be much stronger at greater than at smaller shoot heights. 4 In the taller species (Miscanthus and Lespedeza) (Φ(mass) (the product of LAR and Φ(area)) increased, while in the shortest species (Potentilia) it decreased with shoot height. Clones of Miscanthus and Lespedeza may thus increase total light capture by allocating shoot biomass among fewer taller shoots, and a clone of Potentilla by producing a larger number of shorter shoots. 5 Shoots of the shorter species were equally efficient in capturing light (i.e. they had similar Φ(mass)) early in the season, but less efficient later in the season than shoots of the taller species. Shorter species appear to be able to use the earlier part of the season for efficient light capture, while shoots of taller species gain an advantage from their height later in the season. 6 This study shows how different above-ground growth patterns of the species in a tall-grass meadow allow them to use different positions in vertical space and different periods of the season to absorb light efficiently.

Within each photoperiodic regime, plants were labelled with 14C at one of three developmental stages at one of three leaf positions to assess the effects of architecture on carbohydrate translocation. 2 Perilla flowers in response to short days, i.e. southern-treatment plants flowered earlier and were smaller and more sparsely branched than northern-treatment plants. Branch number limits inflorescence number in Perilla, and southern-treatment plants therefore made fewer inflorescences. Inflorescences are, however, indeterminate, and the southern-treatment plants made more flowers per inflorescence than the northern-treatment plants, such that architecture did not constrain flower number. 3 As a result, plants in both treatments made a similar number of seeds and did not differ in total seed mass. 4 Increased seed production per inflorescence was associated with reduced carbohydrate movement between branches and more 14C-labelled assimilate per seed at the labelled node. 5 In summary, plasticity at the level of the inflorescence largely compensated for architectural constraints on inflorescence number, and was associated with differences in carbon translocation patterns between the photoperiod treatments.",16,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Carbon allocation | Indeterminate flowering | Integration | Meristem limitation | Photoperiod,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,61

They are, however, very difficult to investigate because of their low frequency. We reviewed the use of molecular markers in the population genetics approach to studying dispersal. With these methods the consequences of long-distance dispersal are studied, rather than the frequency of the dispersal events themselves. 2 Molecular markers vary, displaying different amounts of variation and different modes of inheritance: they may be either dominant or codominant, and may or may not be subjected to genetic recombination. Use of markers has inspired the development of maximum likelihood techniques that take the evolutionary history of alleles into account while estimating gene flow. 3 Inferring seed dispersal rates from indirect measurements of gene flow involves three steps: (i) quantifying genetic differentiation among populations and using this to estimate the rate of gene flow; (ii) producing a genetic dispersal curve by regressing geographical distance among populations against the amount of gene flow; and (iii) separating seed-mediated from pollen-mediated gene flow, by comparing differentiation in nuclear vs. cytoplasmic molecular markers. In this way, potentially very low levels of gene flow can be detected. 4 The indirect approach is based on a number of assumptions. The validity of each assumption should be assessed by independent methods or the estimates of gene flow and dispersal should be mainly used in a comparative context. In metapopulations, with frequent extinction and colonization, the relationship between genetic differentiation and gene flow is not straightforward, and other methods should be used. 5 Highly variable molecular markers, especially microsatellites, have facilitated a direct genetic approach to measuring gene flow, based on parental analyses. 6 The population genetic approach provides different information about dispersal than ecological methods. Thus population genetic and ecological methods may supplement each other, and together lead to a better insight into the dispersal process than either of the methods on its own.",337,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,Coalescence | Gene flow | Isolation by distance | Paternity analysis | Pollen-to-seed-migration ratio,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,62

Contemporary meteorological data were used to seek correlations with climatic factors affecting seed release. 3 Substantial seed release, estimated to be about 60% of the annual crop, was observed in the absence of fire. Seed release was distinctly seasonal, with high rates in spring and autumn, and was strongly correlated with short, infrequent but temporally predictable Sharav events (dry and hot weather). In the most extensive Sharav-induced seed release, seed density reached 117 seeds m-2 and 15% of the annual crop was released within 6 days. Stepwise multiple regression revealed that mean relative humidity (in both stands) and maximum temperature (in one stand) were significant predictors of seed release. 4 Vertical (upwards) wind velocity was significantly positively correlated with dry and hot weather. Seed counts in distant traps (> 20 m from the nearest tree) were significantly greater in periods in which Sharav events occurred than in other periods. Xeriscence may therefore have an adaptive value in promoting dispersal distance by wind. 5 Both xeriscence and pyriscence appear to be involved in determining serotiny in P. halepensis and provide means of exploiting establishment opportunities generated either by fire or by other factors.",100,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Dispersal distance | Serotiny | Sharav | Temporal pattern | Xeriscence,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,63

Half the data set was used in an exploratory phase while the other half was used in a subsequent confirmatory phase. 3 The exploratory analyses included multivariate statistics [detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)] with various options and combinations of variables, and led to the formation of hypotheses that were then tested. 4 We tested the hypotheses in a sequential analysis with CCA and Monte Carlo permutation tests: after establishing the influence of one set of environmental variables, this set was covaried out in subsequent analyses. In this way the influence of (i) season of sowing of the crop; (ii) geographical region; (iii) soil type; (iv) crop species; and (v) temporal trends was tested. The four latter were tested separately for spring- and autumn-sown crops. 5 The sowing season of the crop had an overwhelming influence on the weed flora, and many weed species, both annual and perennial, showed strong associations with either autumn or spring. There were significant differences in weed flora composition between the geographical regions and soil types as well as between crop species. There were significant temporal trends only in the weed flora of autumn-sown crops. 6 This study provides a protocol that combines exploratory 'data diving' with strict hypothesis testing using direct gradient analysis methods such as CCA.

We explored the possibility that high foliage allocation in shade-tolerant species could result in higher whole-plant nitrogen demands than in light-demanding trees of comparable diameters. We measured foliage mass and area, leaf life span, and nitrogen (N) content of fresh foliage and leaf litter for juveniles of 11 evergreen angiosperms in a Chilean temperate rain forest. This permitted estimation of annual nitrogen losses in leaf litter fall by individuals of a given diameter. 2 Leaf life spans were longest in shade-tolerant species. The highest leaf N levels were found in small short-lived early successional trees, whereas among longer-lived species there was no general relationship of leaf N with shade tolerance level. Shade-tolerant species had lower N resorption efficiencies, and therefore higher leaf litter N concentrations on an area basis, than light-demanding associates. 3 Foliage mass, foliage area and total crown N pool were strongly positively related to shade tolerance level. 4 Interspecific variation in annual N losses in leaf litter fall was more closely related to foliage area (R2 = 0.52) than to N concentration of leaf litter (R2 = 0.31) or leaf lifetimes (R2 = 0.01). Although the short-lived early successional species Embothrium coccineum had the highest annual crown N losses of the 11 species, shade-tolerant species had higher annual losses than light-demanding overstorey dominants of comparable longevities. 5 The results are consistent with the proposal that the costs of obtaining enough N for crown maintenance and expansion may constrain the fitness of shade-tolerant angiosperm trees in late successional stages on infertile sites, when soil nutrient availability is reduced by increased uptake and sequestration in biomass and litter. On the other hand, high N loss rates may be more sustainable for short-lived early colonists that complete their life cycles in the initial stages of secondary succession, when nutrient availabilities are often relatively high.",37,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Foliage mass | Leaf life span | Leaf nitrogen | Resorption | Tree nutrition,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,65

The bees' flower-handling routine may have become behaviourally fixed by the expectation of low pollen rewards, which prevailed in the experimental garden. 3 The effects of nectar provision on both pollen import (deposition on stigma) and export (removal from anthers) were studied. The amount of pollen transferred during a bumblebee's visit was affected only by the amount of pollen that the flower presented. 4 Manipulated flowers that presented a large amount of available pollen received approximately three times more pollen on their stigmas during a bee's visit than flowers with little available pollen, which suggests that autogamous pollen transfer contributes substantially to pollen deposition when pollen availability is high. The gradual dehiscence of the anthers in this species means that available pollen accumulates only if pollinator visits are infrequent, when the increased autogamy may act to ensure adequate pollination. 5 There was no relation between the quantity of nectar residue that a bee left after visiting a manipulated flower and the mean duration of its visits to unmanipulated flowers.

Half of the soil derived from each area was microwaved to reduce soil fungi, resulting in four different 'soil types'. 2 Chamaecrista fasciculata plants were smaller when grown in their native soil vs. that from under A. gerardii, but were unaffected by microwaving (i.e. fungal reduction). Andropogon gerardii plants were shorter with fewer inflorescences in nonmicrowaved soil, with the poorest growth occurring in non-microwaved C. fasciculata soil. 3 Fungi were isolated from roots of A. gerardii growing in the different soil types. We tested whether the fungi found differed between the four soil types and whether any species characteristic of C. fasciculata soil were responsible for the poor growth of A. gerardii in this medium. 4 Fungi unique to the non-microwaved C. fasciculata soil type reduced tillering and caused an early reduction in growth of A. gerardii. These effects were partially ameliorated when potentially mycoparasitic fungi associated with A. gerardii were also included. By the end of the experiment, both fungal treatments increased above-ground biomass but greatly reduced below-ground biomass of A. gerardii compared with controls, suggesting that the exposure to potential fungal pathogens from C. fasciculata soil altered biomass allocation within plants. 5 There was no evidence of negative feedback between the prairie species and their own soils. However, fungi associated with Chamaecrista fasciculata were detrimental to A. gerardii, one of the dominant perennials in the surrounding area, and may facilitate the annual's long-term persistence.

Litter had a stronger overall effect on plant germination than on establishment, suggesting that a litter-reducing disturbance will have more effect early in the growth season. 3 On average, vegetation was more affected by litter in field than in glasshouse studies and during 2-year than during 1-year studies. The effect on biomass switched from negative after 1 year to positive after 3 years. 4 The absolute effects of litter on germination and establishment decreased and the absolute effects on above-ground biomass increased with latitude. Ecosystem type also influenced the effects significantly. 5 Vegetation was generally more depressed by higher litter quantities.

We predicted that climate-induced effects would generate broad-scale patterns, whereas pathogen-induced mortality would be traceable among neighbouring thalli. 2 Spatial autocorrelation analysis was performed on the proportion of E. radiata affected by dieback in quadrats during an initial mortality event in 1991. The absence of any consistent spatial scale of affected thalli between 10 and 100 m suggested that small-scale spread of an agent might be occurring. 3 Individual thalli were therefore mapped at two sites during a subsequent mortality event in 1992/93, and the degree of damage recorded. Spatial analyses found little evidence of aggregation of either intact or affected thalli at scales of 1-150 cm. 4 The relative spatial patterns of healthy and affected plants in mapped quadrats during the 1992/93 mortality provided little evidence of spatial association or repulsion between these broad damage categories. 5 The large-scale mortality of 1992/93 was consistent with a physiological response to broad-scale light deprivation, although other agents, perhaps both a virus and amphipod grazing, might also have been involved.

A seed-addition experiment using seven co-occurring annual plant species with a range of seed masses was carried out in a limestone grassland in South Wales. 2. If seedlings compete for establishment sites, then large seed size may confer enhanced competitive ability. However, the simple reciprocal relationship found between seed mass and per capita seed output showed that species producing larger seeds suffer reduced fecundity. Seed size may therefore act as a surrogate in a competition/colonization trade-off. 3. Equal numbers of seeds of all species were sown in a mixture over a range of densities. As sowing density increases, all species should reach a higher proportion of the available microsites. If large-seeded species are the best competitors they are expected to win all the sites they reach, and hence to occupy an increasing proportion of sites as sowing density increases. 4. The three species with the largest seeds made up 49% of individuals at low-density sown plots but 83% of individuals in high-density sown plots. In addition, seed mass and plant density were not correlated in unsown plots, but were strongly correlated in high-density sown plots. However, all small-seeded species maintained a presence in sown plots. 5. Although species were sown at random with respect to one another, individuals were up to five times more likely than expected to have a conspecific as a nearest neighbour. This could be caused by interspecific competition and/or by environmental heterogeneity that favours different species in different patches. 6. The results suggest that seedlings do compete for establishment sites and that large-seeded species generally win when in direct competition. In unsown areas small-seeded species win many sites by forfeit (because large-seeded species are strongly recruitment limited) but there may be a restricted subset of potential sites for which they are the best competitors and which they can win outright.",329,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Annual plants | Recruitment | Seed limitation | Seed size | Species coexistence,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,77

We report on an experimental investigation into the effects of contrast in patch quality and patch size upon the performance of the clonal herb Glechoma hederacea in nutritionally heterogeneous environments. 2. There were six treatments providing different degrees of patch contrast. These ranged from maximum contrast, in which patches consisted entirely of compost or sand, to homogeneity, in which all patches contained 50% of each. These were combined factorially with two patch size treatments. Overall, all treatments provided the same quantity of compost and sand, and the same area and volume of higher and lower quality patches. 3. Clones in the large-patch environments produced significantly more root biomass in both rich- and poor- quality patches than the clones in the small-patch environments. At both scales there was a decline in root biomass in the rich patches, accompanied by an increase in root biomass in the poor patches, as patch quality converged. 4. The proportion of the root biomass of clones that was located in nutrient-rich patches was greatest at high contrast and declined gradually to become equal in all patches, as contrast between patches diminished to homogeneity. This effect was independent of patch scale. There was a close match between root placement and nutrient availability in different quality patches in all treatments except that with the highest contrast. 5. At both patch scales, root:shoot ratios of clone parts in rich patches rose (and those in poor patches declined) as patch contrast increased. This species is therefore capable of morphological specialization at a local level when clones grow in heterogeneous environments. These effects were also greater at the larger patch scale. 6. The effect of patch contrast on total clone yield was significantly modified by patch scale. At lower contrast, yield was similar at both scales, whereas at higher contrast, yield was significantly greater in the large-patch treatment. 7. Although G. hederacea can match its morphology to environmental heterogeneity in some habitats, it is less able to do so when patches are small-scale and highly contrasting.

Intraclonal regulation of the C4 caespitose perennial grass Schizachyrium scoparium was evaluated in response to various levels of above-ground (radiation intensity) and below-ground (soil volume) resource availability in the field for three successive growing seasons. We reasoned that the relative plasticity of clonal growth in response to various levels of resource availability may provide insight into the mechanism of intraclonal regulation. 2. Six naturally occurring clones were randomly assigned to each of five treatments: (i) unrestricted soil volume (control); (ii) large soil volume in which roots were confined to a cylinder of soil with a radius four times that of the clone; (iii) small soil volume, twice the clone radius; (iv) large soil volume with radiation intensity reduced to 55% of ambient; and (v) small soil volume with reduced radiation intensity. 3. Ramet recruitment increased within the first season following root confinement in large soil volumes, while ramet and leaf growth exhibited less plasticity. The effects of a reduction in radiation intensity were smaller, and, in contrast, increased ramet and leaf growth, but did not modify ramet recruitment. 4. The pattern and magnitude of ramet mortality in clones confined to the large soil volume were similar to those of clones in unrestricted soil volume, indicating that intraclonal regulation was sufficient to reduce ramet recruitment and thus density to within the carrying capacity established by resource availability. 5. Similar growth and ramet demography of clones in the unrestricted and small soil volumes suggest that unrestricted clones normally access resources from a soil volume similar to that of the small soil volumes. 6. Rapid clonal growth in response to root confinement to large soil volumes, resource acquisition from a relatively small soil volume that contains the zone of resource accumulation, and the capacity for rapid expression of ramet plasticity provide circumstantial evidence that individual caespitose clones may respond to resource accumulation in soils beneath them.",23,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Caespitose growth form | Clonal biology | Plant-induced soil heterogeneity | Ramet recruitment | Self-thinning,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,80

We investigated habitat exploitation by the rhizomatous grass Elymus repens in a heterogeneous environment in both productive and unproductive habitats. We tested whether there was selective entry of rhizomes into favourable microsites or random exploration of the habitat, and whether the benefits of selective exploitation were higher in productive than unproductive habitats. 2. Trays were divided into four quadrants around a common central area. Homogeneous environments were created by planting vegetation throughout the trays; heterogeneous environments were created by planting only centre and two opposite quadrants. Contrasting productivity levels were established by fertilizing half of the trays of each environment type. A single rhizome fragment of E. repens was planted in the centre of the trays and allowed to exploit the trays for two growing seasons. 3. Elymus repens effectively exploited habitat heterogeneity at both productivity levels. However, only unproductive trays showed preferential growth of rhizomes into bare quadrants. 4. In the productive trays individual rhizomes that grew into bare quadrants showed a significantly greater production of shoots and total biomass than those that grew into vegetated quadrants. Smaller, non-significant effects were observed at lower productivity. 5. Increased growth of primary rhizomes, once they had entered a bare quadrant, with or without selective growth into these patches, led to similar increases in heterogeneous compared to homogeneous trays at the two productivity levels (3.0 vs. 2.7). Heterogeneity was not therefore more effectively exploited at high productivity. 6. We suggest that sectorial transport of nutrients through the rhizomes, resulting in directional outgrowth of bud meristems into the bare quadrants, may have been responsible for the selective placement of rhizomes in the unproductive trays.

Seed germination in light and dark, and responses to irradiance and light quality, were tested in shadehouse experiments for 19 West African tropical forest tree species representing a wide range of ecological types. Germination in forest gaps of different size was tested for 11 species. 2. Percentage germination was reduced in the dark only for three small-seeded species that are common in forest soil seed banks: Musanga cecropioides, Nauclea diderrichii and Milicia excelsa. Percentage germination of the other 16 species, including four widely regarded as 'pioneers', was unaffected. 3. Effects of different irradiances in shadehouses, where the seeds were watered, were significant for some species, but there was no consistent pattern. Irradiance effects in forest gaps, where the seeds received only natural wet season rainfall, were more widespread and substantial, and were most commonly shown as a depression of percentage germination at high irradiance. 4. Effects of light quality (neutral vs. green shade; red: far-red = 0.43) were insignificant at 5% irradiance in shadehouses for all species except Nauclea diderrichii. In growth chamber experiments, the low energy response was only evident at 1.0 μmol m-2 s-1 (< 1% of unshaded forest irradiance) in Musanga and Nauclea. 5. The speed of germination was affected by irradiance in many species, but the effect was small compared with differences between species, in which time to complete germination varied between 3 weeks and over 6 months. 6. Seeds of Ceiba pentandra and Pericopsis elata planted in deep forest shade (2% irradiance) and in a small gap (30% irradiance) germinated well in both sites, showed exponential biomass growth in the gap but a linear decline in mean seedling biomass and subsequent death in deep shade. 7. Light-mediated germination is relatively rare among these forest trees, even among pioneers, so that the working definition of a pioneer should be seen to depend more on a species' ability to survive in forest shade.

Arctic terrestrial ecosystems, which are important components of the global carbon (C) cycle, are expected to undergo considerable future climate change. However, predicting arctic C budgets is complex because the landscape is highly diverse and plant biomass very variable. 2. We investigated the diversity of vegetation at 14 sites along an arctic transect in northern Alaska, including sites on wet coastal tundra, tussock tundra, heath and shrub tundra. We applied these data to a model of the soil-plant-atmosphere (SPA) continuum, to investigate how variations in vegetation structure might affect landscape patterns of gross primary productivity (GPP). 3. Although the dominant species varied, there was a highly significant relationship for vascular plants between the leaf area index (LAI) and total foliar nitrogen (N; g m-2 ground area) at each site. 4. A modelled response surface of GPP to changes in both N and LAI indicated that for tundra plants there is an almost constant ratio between the sensitivity of productivity to the two variables. 5. The conservative nature of canopy LAI-N ratios simplifies the task of generating regional predictions of C assimilation by vascular plants (for which LAI and N are key requirements) because measurements of LAI can be used to infer N. 6. Spatial and temporal patterns of LAI and N must be determined if the photosynthetic component of regional C budgets is to be modelled accurately for diverse arctic ecosystems. Patterns of solar irradiance, together with air temperature and soil moisture constraints, are also influential but less important.

The potential cost of polyphenolic (phlorotannin) production in the brown seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum was investigated by testing for phenotypic trade-offs between phlorotannin content and annual growth. Relationships between tissue nitrogen and phlorotannin content, as well as between tissue nitrogen content and annual growth, were also examined to evaluate the importance of the carbon-nutrient balance in explaining intraspecific variation in phlorotannins. 2. Annual shoots were collected from a total of 300 A. nodosum individuals in natural populations at three sites in each of two study areas, in 2 consecutive years. 3. Data were analysed using analyses of covariance (ANCOVAS), which showed that there was a significant negative relationship between phlorotannins and growth in both study areas in both years. Shoots with a relatively high phlorotannin content (> 9% dry weight) had a mean reduction in growth that varied from 25% to 54%, compared with shoots with relatively low concentrations (< 6% dry weight) of phlorotannins. 4. Predictions about variation in the cost of carbon-based chemical defences were supported by regression analyses with subsampled data sets that revealed that the trade-off between phlorotannins and growth was most pronounced in individuals with relatively high tissue nitrogen levels. 5. The relationship between tissue nitrogen and phlorotannin content, as well as between nitrogen content and growth, was weak and variable. 6. Production of phlorotannins in A. nodosum under natural conditions appears to involve a substantial cost in terms of individual growth. This cost varies spatially and temporally, at least partly as a consequence of variation in nutrient availability. 7.
