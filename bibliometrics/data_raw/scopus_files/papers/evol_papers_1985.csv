Few species or populations are fixed at complete selfing or complete outcrossing. A low level of selfing in primarily outcrossing species is unlikely to be selectively advantageous, but will not reduce inbreeding depression to the level where selfing is selectively favored particularly if accompanied by reproductive compensation.

As a consequence, coevolution-structured commmunities tend to be more stable than comparable invasion-structured communities, but more open to invasion. Both invasion-structured and coevolution-structured communities have niche separations that are significantly different than would be expected if species were assorted at random. Two-species communities formed by the invasion-only algorithm under asymmetric competition had the majority of their niche separations in the range 0-0.5. All other communities had niche separations greater than expected. The most common separations were in the range 1.0-3.5.

Contrary to present formulations of 'species selection', clades (or other higher taxa) do not fulfil the basic structural and dynamic criteria to be so considered. Clades are not localized, their members do not share an environment, and they cannot be said to respond to local selective regimes. Traditional species selection does not provide a causal mechanism for evolutionary change in terms of the interaction of the units of selection with a shared environment in the way that conventional organismic selection does; as used by some authors, species selection is a purely descriptive term. Communities do fulfil the criteria required by a theory of natural selection. Within communities, selection is among the populations of different species that make up the community, here termed 'avatars' of those species. Avatars are the closest analogues of individual organisms in traditional selection theory. Just as populations evolve by organismic selection, communities evolve by avatar selection, and more inclusive units, the higher-level analogues of the species, evolve as their component communities do. This formulation of higher-level selection reveals a congruence with processes at the lower, organism-based level and suggests the most profitable direction to be taken in attempts at formal extension of selection theory. -Author",all,All Open Access

Bird predation thus is sufficient to have played a major role in shaping the evolution of the monarch's overwintering and aggregation behavior. Substantial daily variation in predation intensity occurred, 26% of which was attributable to the birds eating more butterflies on colder days, 30% attributable to a 7.85 day predation cycle. The hypothesis is put forward that the birds feed cyclically because they build up toxic levels of cardenolides or other defensive chemicals contained in the butterflies. The cyclic predation may reduce total predation on the colony by as much as 50%. Such chemical-based group protection is interpreted as a fortuitous by-product of the evolution of unpalatability through selective processes acting on other phases of the monarch's life history.-from Authors",all,All Open Access

The presence of a variety of biological differences between species - including as a subset those which result from resource underutilization - leads to divergence with respect to a quantitatively inherited character, due to interspecific competitive interactions. The resulting displacement can be large and depends little on the parameters chosen. The only exception, involving a character with very low heritability, occurs when the non-interactive phenotypic differences are much greater than those associated with studies of character displacement in natural populations.

Total trait values are divided into phylogenetic values, inherited from an ancestral species, and specific values, the result of independent evolution. This allows quantitative assessment of the strength of the phylogenetic inertia, or burden, displayed by a character in a lineage, so that questions concerning the relative importance of phylogenetic constraints in evolution can be answered. Separation of phylogenetic from specific effects allows phylogenetic factors to be explicitly included in cross-species comparative analyses of adaptation, solving a long-standing problem in evolutionary comparative studies. The phylogenetic autocorrelation model was applied to a comparative analysis of the determinants of sexual dimorphism in weight among 44 primate species. In addition to sexual dimorphism in weight, mating system, habitat, diet, and size (weight itself) were included in analysis. All traits except diet were substantially influenced by phylogenetic inertia. About 50% of variation among primate species is due to phylogeny. Size, or scaling, could account for a total of 36% of the variance, making it almost as important as phylogeny in determining the level of dimorphism displayed by a species. Habitat, mating system and diet account for minor amounts of variation. Thus, in attempting to explain why a particular modern primate species is very dimorphic compared to other primates, we would say first because its ancestor was more dimorphic than average, second because it is a relatively large species, and third because it is terrestrial, polygynous, and folivorous. -from Authors",NA,NA

It is shown from tape-playback and female-choice experiments that calls represent bona fide reproductive isolating mechanisms between the two species. Call analyses of F1, F2, F3 and backcross progeny of the 2 species confirm polygenic control of call expression, in which different alleles at each of several loci are fixed in each taxon. Sex linkage of traits is absent, but the various features of the calls are not completely independent of one another in their patterns of inheritance. These and other life-history data cast doubt on several major premises of the sympatric speciation hypothesis and suggest that call alteration might have triggered the speciation event giving rise to the siblings. A complex of cryptic 'song morphs' physically and ecologically identical to C. plorabunda and C. downesi, but singing different songs, exists in the mountains of western North America, while the Alps of central Europe harbor populations of C. carnea that have undergone call differentiation in an analogous but independent manner.

This is the sex whose fitness is subject to the most effective parental control. The bias acts to increase the fitness of the rarer, controlled sex and to increase parental productivity. In the specific case of the evolution of the female-biased Hamiltonian ratios, LPC can affect the mating success of sons but has no effect on the success of daughters.

The importance of positive association is well established in the special case of kin selection.

There is significant population differentiation in the plant-fungus association over distances of 1 km or greater: plants transplanted back into their population of origin become heavily infected, while foreign plants from populations 1 or 100 km away experience little or no infection. Local population differentiation in plant-pathogen compatibility may be related to A. bracteata's high degree of self-pollination. Limited long-distance recombination in A. bracteata due to self-pollination and spatially restricted pollen flow may be a major factor preventing the evolution of increased plant resistance to fungal attack.-from Author",all,All Open Access

A jackknife procedure revealed highly significant differences among correlation matrices representing 34 local samples from eastern North America. Despite significant differences among localities, spatial autocorrelation tests failed to reveal any significant geographic pattern in correlations. Factor analyses of the pooled within-locality correlation matrices reveal appendage and body-size factors for both alates and stem mothers. It is hypothesized that the apparently random geographic differences in correlation are caused by change differences in the mode of response to short-term selection. Geographic patterns in trait means are established by selection, but, because local population sizes are finite, similar response to selection occurs by diverse physiological or developmental mechanisms in different populations.-from Author",all,All Open Access

Rates of amino acid and ammonia excretion were significantly dependent upon Lap genotype; individuals with the Lap94 allele exhibited greater rates of nitrogen loss. These differences among genotypes were most evident in the fall. The genotype-dependent component of rates of nitrogen loss were also largest relative to the total rate of excretion during the fall period. Other aspects of the nitrogen metabolism (acquisition) and rates of carbon metabolism were independent of Lap genotype. -from Authors,all,All Open Access

The presence of either predator reduced survival levels by 24%. There was no consistent effect of tadpole density on survival, but, at low tadpole density the presence of salamanders did not affect tadpole survival levels; effect of the salamanders was restricted to the higher densities. The combined effect on overall survival of the 2 predators was additive. One sibship (denoted A) consistently displayed a higher survival level than the other (denoted B), but the level of differential survival, measured as the survival of B relative to A, varied among predator combinations. Survival differences among treatments and sibships were related to body size differences. The changing levels of differential survival between sibships reflected an ecologically mediated change in the relationship between the level of body size variation and the subsequent level of survival variation. -from Authors",NA,NA
