However, during the dry season months of July and August, nectar from Symphonia globulifera (Guttiferae) accounted for 22-31% of tamarin feeding time. These primates are highly destructive in their nectar-feeding activities: a single adult tamarin may destroy 6-14 Symphonia flowers per feeding minute. Foraging activities associated with nectar feeding are reminiscent of traplining behavior and characterized by goal-directed travel to particular feeding trees. S. mystax and S. fuscicollis appear to be aware of the distribution and location of flowering Symphonia trees in their home range and select nectar sites largely on the basis of proximity. Expectations regarding amount and variance of the food reward were also important in tamarin foraging decisions. By minimizing random foraging movements and bypassing trees with limited food rewards, these small-bodied primates can exploit widely scattered but predictable resources. -from Author",79,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,24

Compared with trees having no or few O. longinoda, trees with large ant colonies had reduced levels of nocturnal fruit removal and an increased proportion of fruits that fell undispersed. Diurnal fruit removal did not differ significantly between trees with different densities of ants. This shift in fruit dispersal characteristics resulted from the clustering of aggressive O. longinoda on the fruiting rama at night. Although ant-plant mutualisms are commonly thought to have evolved from the enhanced fitness that aggressive ants confer on occupied trees by reducing herbivory or competition, reduced seed dispersal in zoochoric species may be an important evolutionary block. -Author",10,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,25

The severe environmental disruptions of the El Nino caused the food supply for the coastal population of condors to decrease, while the food supply for the foothill population increased 17-fold. In response to the increase in food, almost all condors in the foothill population bred in the months following El Nino. No condors in the coastal population bred after El Nino, and breeding of condors in the high-elevation population was presumably unaffected. If they can reproduce only during the unpredictable El Nino years, coastal and foothill condor populations may barely be able to maintain their numbers without ingress from more regularly breeding populations.

Nearly all species of Santa Rosa plants are not fed on by any given species of caterpillar either because the plants contain chemicals that render them unacceptable or because the caterpillar refuses to eat foliage that lacks a feeding stimulant. The negative impacts of inclement weather and carnivores prevent any given species of caterpillar from usually defoliating the few species of plants that it can eat. The Santa Rosa carnivore fauna ranges from absolutely monophagous to highly polyphagous, Its caterpillar food supply fluctuates enormously with year, season, position in a season, and microsite.
