It was found that stable environment-dependent sexual isolation has been established between cage populations of Drosophila melanogaster maintained under different environmental conditions for about 5 years, whereas the isolation of populations alone did not lead to ethological isolation. The highest isolation index detected was 0.388 ± 0.108. Postmating barriers were not associated with premating ones; yet, a tendency for the development of postmating isolation barriers was observed. The genetic differentiation among the populations studied, as measured by the allozyme frequency analysis of nine loci, proved to be low (Ī = 0.982, D = 0.018) and not associated with the sexual isolation observed. In general, the evolution of behavior of Drosophila melanogaster is strongly influenced by environmental conditions. Hence, it appears that the initial steps in the genetic process of speciation could be considered as the result of adaptation: However, one can not exclude the contribution of random events, which in combination with selection could speed up speciation processes.",86,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Current theories of speciation tend to be explanatory but not predictive, and the lack of a mechanistic classification of modes of speciation is a great hindrance to developing predictive theories. A tentative mechanistic taxonomy is proposed in which speciation mechanisms are subdivided into two major categories: transilience modes and divergence modes. In transilience modes, the evolution of isolating barriers depends upon a genetic discontinuity characterized by extreme instability of the intermediate stages. The pattern or mechanism of inheritance itself induces this instability. This nature of the discontinuity also implies that natural selection alone cannot induce a transilience; rather, the transilience is characterized by overcoming some selective barrier. Hence, the primary driving force of a transilience is the interaction of selection with other strong evolutionary forces and genetic constraints - such as founder events interacting with strongly epistatic polygenic systems, extreme inbreeding and drift overcoming strong underdominance, or hybridization followed either by selection for hybrid maintenance or by recombination coupled with some sort of hybrid dysgenic phenomenon. Under divergence, the isolating barriers evolve in a continuous fashion with some type of natural selection being the primary driving force - such as selection independently operating in extrinsically isolated subpopulations, selection on a geographic cline with isolation by distance, or selection over diverse habitats in the absence of isolation by distance. This mechanistic taxonomy is used to generate expectations concerning genetic distances.",98,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA,NA
