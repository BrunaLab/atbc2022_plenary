Models of this category (assuming that in groups food finding by one results in food sharing by many) conclude that patch-finding rate improves with group size. Interference among individuals reduces pooled searching efficiency of the group. The author introduce a term, s, the probability of an individual's being among the ones sharing the food in a patch found by the group. Such fine-tunings prolong food-finding rates that push individuals in the group toward the foraging status of a solitary individual. With phenotype-related differences in s, foraging in groups turns out to be a less profitable option the lower an individual is ranked in the group. The option of foraging alone may easily be a better strategy than that of a low-ranking individual foraging in a group. If so, the model also suggests groups assorted by phenotype. -from Authors"

The core-satellite species hypothesis is discussed in light of these models. This hypothesis predicts that the distribution of patch-occupancy frequencies is bimodal in many species assemblages. The authors extend the original concept by demonstrating that the bimodal distribution of patch-occupancy frequencies can be generated by structurally more complex and more realistic metapopulation models than the original one; that the bimodal distribution is predicted by deterministic models, with no or infrequent switches of species between the core and the satellite state; and that metapopulation extinctions of rare species may be compensated by migration from outside the metapopulation (from a mainland), or metapopulation extinction may be prevented by low extinction probabilities of local populations in large or high-quality habitat patches. In every case the bimodal core-satellite distribution is due to the rescue effect, ie the increasing migration rate and hence the decreasing probability of local extinction with an increasing fraction of patches occupied. -from Authors"

When there are differences in the reproductive successes between the migratory and nonmigratory strategies, then the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) may be very sensitive with respect to these differences. When there are differences in the reproductive success between the migratory and nonmigratory strategies, then applying the same behavior throughout life may not be an ESS (ie as the individual grows older, it tends to change from migration to nonmigration). On the other hand, when there are differences in the reproductive successes among ages, then this change in strategies with age is not expected. Uncertainty may or may not bias the ESS fraction of migratory animals depending on whether uncertainties affect the average population levels. -Authors"

Using the criterion that animals should minimize the ratio of mortality to growth rates, it is shown that, when both growth and mortality rates are linear with activity levels, the latter should be either maximal or minimal depending on resource level. If growth rate is a decelerating function of activity, then speed or time active should decrease with increases in resources, handling time, or the effect of activity on mortality rate. If mortality rate unrelated to activity increases, then activity rate also should increase. Predictions are developed for cases in which time horizon is critical using a dynamic programming framework. The general patterns of predicted activity responses are similar to the time-invariant analytical solutions, but foraging speed is reduced relative to the analytical solutions when time remaining is long or when accumulated reserves are high. This effect is ameliorated when accumulated reserves (size) increase resource capture efficiency or reduce mortality risk. If resources decline with time (eg because of competition) optimal foraging speeds are also higher than predicted by the analytical solutions. -from Authors"

Because of physiological linkages between growth-related traits and the SRS, any heritable change in a key growth-related trait will pleiotropically affect the SRS. Therefore, heritable changes in these key growth-related traits could be accompanied by evolution of the entire SRS. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from single-gene mutants that differ in many stress-related traits, rapid evolution of metal-tolerant populations that are broadly stress-resistant, and consistent patterns of traits in species along gradient in resource availability. Rapid evolution in response to changing environmental stress may allow many short-lived species to respond to human-induced environmental change and provide opportunities to develop stress-resistance crops. However, the time lag between generations of long-lived species that dominate most natural vegetation may not allow mature individuals of these species to keep pace with rapid global change. -from Authors"

Brood reduction is an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) only when offspring fitness is higher following parental readjustment of effort.

Two parental policies of resource allocation among contemporary siblings were examined: equal, in which food is distributed evenly, and despotic, in which food is distributed according to a sibling dominance hierarchy. Parental fitness was diminished slightly by despotic allocation, but the risk of parent-offspring conflict was also diminished. When conflict did occur, the fitness costs and benefits for parents and offspring, respectively, were modest, particularly for despotic allocation.

Therefore, comparisons of such variance across studies and taxa will only be valid if the life cycles employed are complete (an entire generation), precisely defined (eg, egg to egg or adult to adult), and identical. Given a well-defined life cycle, the authors present methods for obtaining estimates of the variance of lifetime reproductive success among individuals using demographic data. The estimates are based on the assumptions of no selection and negligible covariance between life span and reproductive effort. The techniques can be used to investigate the effects of alternate life histories on the dstribution of reproductive success in a population, as well as to obtain estimates of effective population size. They may also provide a null model for investigations of selection. -from Authors"

Species differences in the capacity to sustain locomotion are related to the interaction of locomotor cost and the maximal capacity for aerobic energy production during exercise. Hence, analyses of metabolic correlates of behavioral activity should incorporate estimate of economy as well as capacity. Resting and maximal rates of metabolism are positively correlated, even when the confounding effects of body size and phylogeny are removed. Inferred evolutionary changes in metabolic rate proceeded from low rates in neotropical ancestors to higher rates among descendant species in temperate habitats. Adaptation to facilitate activity at low temperatures may have been responsible for this evolutionary shift. Findings support the ""aerobic capacity' hypothesis for the evolution of metabolic rate in which evolutionary increases in metabolic rate are brought about by natural selection favouring increased abilities for sustained activity. -from Author"

Thus, variance in maternity apportionment among nest-mate queens or internest movement of ants need not be invoked as determinants of colony genetic structure. Average worker nest-mate relatedness results from the opposing effects of two groups of factors: single mating by queens and the apparent closed nature of the societies elevate relatedness, while the presence of multiple queens and their low relatedness to one another depress it. Consistent differences within nests in the matrilineal composition of worker and queen brood constitute further evidence for inequities among nest-mate queens in the allocation of their progeny to the two castes at a single point in time. -from Author"

This study explores the qualitative behaviour of such a connected system. At low levels of connections between the consumer and its nonpreferred resource, the two subsytems rapidly come into phase with one another, thus exhibiting entrainment. As the level of connectedness increases, the sequence of period doubling is observed that leads to a chaotic attractor. When the symmetry assumption is relaxed, the system exhibits intermittent chaos, with populations occasionally flushing between long periods of rarity. These general patterns appear to be insensitive to the particular consumer-resource model, depending only on the assumption that both consumer-resource subsystems exhibit limit-cycle-type behavior. -Author"

The author examines male courtship in relation to female preference for body size in Trinidadian guppies Poecilia reticulata. A simple change in the environment (low vs. high light level) reversed a trend of attractive (large) males courting more often than small ones. When large (attractive) males reduced their courtship under high light levels, they also lost their former twofold mating advantage over small males. This reduced mating success supports the differential-cost hypothesis and not the differential-benefit hypothesis for correlations between sexually selected traits: in this example the correlation may become negative when light-mediated risks of predation outweigh benefits of courtship by conspicuous males. -from Author"

Both prey and predator characters are under stabilizing selection even without predation, and predation adds an additional linear selection component to both characters. The nonlinear system of differential equations is studied analytically by using local linearization near the equilibrium points. Parameters related to intrinsic growth and death rates and stabilizing selection determine whether there are zero, one, or two equilibria. Additive genetic variances do not have an effect on the equilibrium points, but genetic variability is crucial for determining their stability. Analysis of the linearized model shows that at most one equilibrium can be stable, and stability is achieved when additive genetic variance is high enough in both the prey and predator populations. The stability properties are illustrated by numerical examples of the full dynamics of the original nonlinear model. -Author"
