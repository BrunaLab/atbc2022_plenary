This is particularly true in the Neotropics, where bats represent important components of biodiversity from taxonomic and functional perspectives, and provide critical ecosystem services (e.g., seed dispersal and pollination). We assessed the degree to which conversion of lowland Amazonian rain forest to agriculture, and its subsequent abandonment and secondary succession, affect the abundances of populations of phyllostomid bats in the vicinity of Iquitos, Perú. During 90,720 net-m-h of sampling, we captured 3789 bats of five families; of these 3764 were phyllostomids representing 44 species, 23 genera, and three feeding guilds. We focus on the 24 most abundant species of phyllostomids. In terms of abundance, frugivores dominated assemblages in all habitat types and seasons. Eight species consistently responded to habitat conversion, two species consistently responded to season, two species responded consistently to both habitat and season, and five species responded to habitat conversion in a season-specific manner. Frugivores and nectarivores were abundant in areas that had been converted to agriculture, which suggests that these bats are resilient to extant levels of disturbance and may be important in promoting secondary succession. However, this result may be scale- or context-dependent. If habitat conversion continues and dramatically reduces the areal extent and increases fragmentation of mature forest, then a complex metacommunity dynamic may characterize the region and source populations of bats may become threatened or extirpated locally. © 2007 The Author(s).",103,Journal,ar,Article,100,9,9,Amazonian rain forest | Anthropogenic change | Conservation | Deforestation | Habitat use | Lowland | Neotropical bat biodiversity | Population dynamics | Seasonal dynamics,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Then, in an inoculation experiment, we determined the pathogenicity of 75 tropical isolates of unknown pathogenicity and seven pathogenic temperate isolates of Pythium on seeds and/or seedlings of eight tropical tree species. Only three tropical isolates, one identified as P. ultimum and two as P. aphanidermatum, were pathogenic. Tropical pathogenic isolates were pathogenic on 4-6 of eight tree species. Temperate isolates were pathogenic on 0-4 of eight species, indicating that some tropical tree species are susceptible to novel isolates of Pythium. No tree species was susceptible to all isolates and two species were not susceptible to any isolate. Collectively, these results indicate that these Pythium isolates vary widely in their pathogenicity, causing differential mortality of potential host species; likewise, the tree species vary in their susceptibility to a given Pythium isolate. These differences in pathogenicity and susceptibility indicate some support for the Janzen-Connell assumption of host specificity.

Population dynamics and temporal and spatial distribution of frogs before and after the earthquake correlated closely with the hydrology of the stream and ponds. The movement patterns of frogs before and after the earthquake were similar, suggesting frog behavior did not change in response to drastic changes in hydrology, and frogs continued to exhibit strong site-fidelity. Following the earthquake, stream water volume was much lower, especially in the summer, which allowed the normally winter-breeding frogs to breed year-round.

Leaf water repellency was measured by calculating the contact angle of the leaf surface and the line tangent to a water droplet through the point of contact on the adaxial and the abaxial surface. Leaf water repellency was significantly different between the three study areas.

Drought led to a gradual reduction of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance over time, whereas respiration and photosynthetic water-use efficiency initially increased with drought and then declined. Seedlings gradually went through the different wilting stages, until they eventually died, but the trajectory differed for the four species.

It also predicts higher mortality among pioneers. Consequently, recruited and dead trees are expected to differ in species composition, with highest species richness for the recruits.

Compared to other landslides, the recovery process was strongly influenced by the extreme abiotic heterogeneity, climate seasonality, and human use in the area. The study of succession in tropical dry landslides located in densely populated zones should focus on understanding the response of regional ecosystems to a complex disturbance regime in which human-induced disturbances play a major role. © 2007 The Author(s).",24,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Environmental factors | Forest recovery | Human disturbance | Plant communities,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,16,NA,NA

We studied seasonal patterns of microclimate, net CO2 uptake and growth of adult individuals during the dry, rainy and northwind (late fall to winter) seasons in separate populations located in a coastal dune and in a dry forest. To provide an assay of primary productivity, we measured the production of new axillary buds (areoles) from the apex. We found that patterns of net CO2 uptake in the three seasons were consistent with obligate crassulacean acid metabolism. The reduction in soil water potential and the increase in water vapor pressure deficit led to a reduction in 24-h net CO2 uptake from 18.0 to 1.3 mmol CO 2/m2, after 30 d of drought. Dry-weight gain was maximal during the rainy season and there was no growth during the dry season, thus seasonal patterns of net CO2 uptake and growth for M. gaumeri reflected soil and atmospheric water contents. Annual dry-weight gain increased linearly with plant size and with total daily photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) up to 80 percent of ambient. Maximal growth was in exposed microhabitats receiving 60-80 percent of total ambient PPFD.

Three transects with 0.095-ha plots at seven distances from forest edges were established in each of six forest patches. Stem density, basal area, and aboveground biomass in trees and palms ≥ 10-cm diameter at breast height were measured in all plots. In addition, hemispherical photographs were taken to determine leaf area index, understory light availability, and percent canopy openness. Linear mixed-effects models showed significantly higher tree stem density at forest edges, relative to interiors, a pattern reflected by increased stem density, basal area, and aboveground biomass in small diameter trees (≤ 20 cm) growing near edges. No differences in total tree basal area, aboveground biomass, or hemispherical photograph-derived parameters were detected across the forest edge to interior gradient. The recruitment of small diameter trees following edge creation has contributed to the development of dense vegetation at the forest edge and has aided in the maintenance of similar tree basal area and aboveground biomass between edge and interior environments.

At the ecosystem level, i.e., per forest area, herbivory rates were 132 kg biomass/ha/yr and 1310 m 2 foliage/ha/yr. For the area on BCI where A. colombica occurs (100 ha), this is equivalent to 2.1 percent of the foliage area in the forest or 1.7 percent of the annual leaf-area production. This value is considerably lower than previously published estimates of leaf-cutting ant herbivory rates in tropical forests. © 2007 The Author(s).",47,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Atta colombica | Barro Colorado Island | Consumption rate | Folivory | Insect herbivory | Leaf area,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,33,NA,NA

However, so far quantitative, long-term, and large-scale assessments of their impact on these ecosystems are rare, because the available assessment methods were laborious and/or destructive. We describe a rapid, nondestructive, and inexpensive method to estimate the long-term harvest of Atta colombica colonies. Workers of A. colombica dump the colony refuse (exhausted fungal substrate) outside the nest. A single trail connects the refuse pile and the nest. In contrast to the foraging activity, the refuse deposition rate (the number of deposited refuse particles per minute) is diurnally constant and varies little on subsequent days. The number of refuse particles deposited per day was tightly correlated with the number of harvested fragments in nests of differing sizes (R2 = 0.77, P < 0.0001). Therefore, the daily harvest of a particular colony can be calculated from short-term counts (5 min) of the refuse deposition rate at any time of the day. Combining these data with information on average fragment size (weight and/or area) allows the calculation of the total daily amount of biomass and/or foliage area harvested by the colony.

Because of the crucial trophic position of herbivores and their far-reaching impact on plant communities, it is important to understand how edge influences herbivory. In the present paper, we investigated whether and how leaf-cutting ant foraging is altered in the forest edge, as this habitat is characterized by an increased proportion of pioneer species. We assessed basic foraging data as well as the herbivory rate (i.e., the proportion of the leaf material harvested by a colony in relation to the available leaf area in the foraging area) of Atta cephalotes colonies at the edge versus interior sites of a large remnant of the Atlantic forest in Northeast Brazil. Our results indicated clear edge effects on leaf-cutting ants: equally sized A. cephalotes colonies located at the forest edge removed about twice as much leaf area from their foraging grounds than interior colonies (14.3 vs. 7.8%/col/yr). This greater colony-level impact within the forest edge zone was a consequence of markedly reduced foraging areas (0.9 vs. 2.3 ha/col/yr) and moderately lower leaf area index in this habitat, whereas harvest rates were the same. Our results suggest that forest edges induce increased leaf-cutting ant herbivory, probably via the release of resource limitation. Together with the increase of leaf-cutting ant populations along forest edges, this may amplify environmental changes induced by habitat fragmentation. © 2007 The Author(s).",107,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Atlantic forest | Atta cephalotes | Bottom-up control | Foraging area | Northeast Brazil,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,43,NA,NA

We quantify the proportion of small juveniles (> 0.5 m tall-1 cm diameter at breast height, DBH) of large primate-dispersed tree species found underneath heterospecifc trees that are also dispersed by large primates at two protected sites in Manu National Park and one hunted site outside Manu N.P. in southeastern Peru. The forests are comparable in edaphic and climatic qualities, successional stage, and adult tree species composition. We found that hunting locally exterminates populations of large primates, and reduced primates of intermediate body size (hereafter ""medium primates"") by 80 percent. Moreover, tree species richness was 55 percent lower and density of species dispersed by large and medium-bodied primates 60 percent lower in hunted than in protected sites. In addition, richness and density of abiotically dispersed species and plants dispersed by non-game animals are greater in hunted sites. Overhunting threatens to disrupt the ecological interactions between primates and the plants that rely on them for seed dispersal and recruitment. Sustainable wildlife management plans are urgently needed, because protected areas are at risk of becoming ""island"" parks if buffer zones become empty of animals and have impoverished flora. © 2007 The Author(s).",114,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Bushmeat | Conservation | Hunting | Manu | Peru | Primates | Recruitment | Regeneration | Seed dispersal | Tropical forest,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,50,NA,NA

Available evidence suggests that defaunation is typically differential: medium/large mammals are most affected while small rodents are less affected, or even favored. In heavily impacted areas, such as Los Tuxtlas, the residual mammalian fauna is dominated by small rodents. We tested the expectation that if small rodents will preferentially attack small-seeded species, large-seeded species may escape predation in the absence of medium/large seed predators and that this may affect germination and, possibly, recruitment. Experiments with caged rodents (Heteromys desmarestianus) under laboratory conditions showed a preference for smaller seeds. A field experiment involving seeds of contrasting size showed that small, unprotected seeds experienced a predation risk 30-times larger than protected seeds, while the effect of protection was not significant for large seeds. These patterns of predation led to significant differences in germination: protected small-seeded species had a fourfold greater germination than unprotected small-seeded species, while germination was not significantly different between exposed and protected large seeds. The observed contrasts in germination suggest that under heavy defaunation, small-seeded species are likely to be penalized by the overabundance of small rodents, while large-seeded species escape predation. Our results are consistent with the observation of dense seedling carpets dominated by large-seeded species in the understory of Los Tuxtlas. We speculate that the patterns we uncovered may explain, at least partly, the impoverished diversity of the understory vegetation that characterizes heavily defaunated understories and that this has the potential to affect forest regeneration. © 2007 The Author(s).",118,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Differential defaunation | Los Tuxtlas | Mexico | Recruitment | Seed germination | Seed predation | Seed-size,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,52,NA,NA

Overall, food availability was the strongest determinant of flying fox abundance, and spatial aspects of the islands (land area within 10 km) had only a small influence. Food availability appears to regulate flying fox abundance only when food resources are low, but when food sources are plentiful, flying fox abundance may be high or low.

Next, we highlight the potential indirect effects of hunting for other groups of organisms. Our final goal is to consider what could be done to ameliorate the demographic threats to harvest-sensitive game species caused by unsustainable hunting. Three conclusions are possible at this time concerning the impact of hunting for tropical forest plant communities: (1) Hunting tends to reduce seed movement for animal-dispersed species with very large diaspores; (2) Hunting reduces seed predation by granivorous vertebrates for species with large seeds; and (3) Hunting alters the species composition of the seedling and sapling layers. The cascading effects of hunting are already known to affect bruchid beetles and dung beetles and are likely to affect other, nongame taxa. To ameliorate these problems, several lines of research should be further explored to facilitate the development of game management plans including: (1) alternative use of sources of animal protein; (2) income supplementation for local people from sources other than wild meat; (3) outreach and extension activities for communities; (4) recognition and facilitation of the shifting of attitudes towards hunting; (5) implementation of community-based wildlife management programs in regulated-use areas such as extractive reserves; and (6) landscape-scale conservation planning that maximizes the source-sink dynamics of harvested and unharvested game populations and enforces game regulations in strictly protected areas. © 2007 The Author(s).",122,Journal,re,Review,100,4,4,Bushmeat | Management plans | Plant community structure | Seed dispersal | Seed predation,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,54,NA,NA

What are the consequences of these changes for the adult plant community in the next generation and beyond? Here, I derive equations showing how reduced seed dispersal reduces plant reproduction by intensifying kin competition, increasing vulnerability to natural enemies, and reducing the proportion of seeds passing through disperser guts. I parameterize these equations with available empirical data to estimate the likely effects on next-generation abundances. I then consider the indirect effects and longer-term feedbacks of changed seed or adult abundances on reproductive rates due to density-dependent interactions with natural enemies and mutualists, as well as niche differentiation with competitors, and discuss their likely qualitative effects. The factors limiting seed disperser and seed predator populations in natural and hunted forests emerge as critical for determining the long-term effects of hunting on rates of seed dispersal and seed predation. For example, where seed dispersers are held to a constant abundance by hunters, decreases in the availability of their preferred food plants are expected to lead to increased per-seed dispersal probabilities, potentially to the point of compensating for the initial disperser decline.

We compared primary and secondary seed removal and predispersal seed predation of two tree species between hunted and nonhunted sites in Central Panama. Seeds of Oenocarpus mapora (Arecaceae) are 16-times greater in size than those of Cordia bicolor (Boraginaceae).

The mean pollen dispersal distances were estimated at 69-355 m for C. guianensis, and 86-303 m for S. rubra, depending on the pollen dispersal model and the estimate of reproductive tree density used. The multi-locus outcrossing rate was estimated at 0.918 and 0.945, and the correlation of paternity at 0.089 and 0.096, for C. guianensis and S. rubra, respectively, while no significant levels of biparental inbreeding were detected. Comparing trees with high and low local density of conspecifics, we found no evidence for differences in inbreeding levels.

Annual mean individual tree basal area increments ranged from 7.0 to 79.6 cm2/yr for all S. alba trees and from 4.8 to 27.4 cm2/yr for all B. gymnorrhiza trees from Micronesian high islands. Diameter increment for S. alba on Butaritari Atoll was lower at 7.8 cm 2/yr for the one year measured. Growth rates differed significantly by hydrogeomorphic zone. Riverine and interior zones maintained up to seven times the annual diameter growth rate of fringe forests, though not on Pohnpei, where basal area increments for both S. alba and B. gymnorrhiza were approximately 1.5 times greater in the fringe zone than in the interior zone. Time-series modeling indicated that there were no consistent and statistically significant annual diameter growth patterns. Although rainfall has some seasonality in some years on Kosrae and Pohnpei and overall growth of mangroves was sometimes related positively to quarterly rainfall depths, seasonal diameter growth patterns were not distinctive.

Dependence of phenological events on abiotic (rainfall and day length) and biotic factors (herbivore abundance/damage) was quantified to discern potential relationships. Leaf flush and flowering were not associated with periods of highest rainfall as might be expected in a dry tropical forest. Rather, these events were highly correlated with day length. We observed that most leaf flush began in March and April, which was several months before the wettest period of the year (August to November). This result is consistent with other studies that show that leaf flush in Plumeria is under photoperiodic control and that the plants initiate growth and reproduction when cloudiness is low and seasonal light availability is greatest. Herbivore damage by caterpillars of the sphinx moth Pseudosphinx tetrio is restricted primarily to the wettest season, consistent with the hypothesis that early leaf flush and reproduction has been selected to avoid herbivory. It is not clear whether photoperiodic control of leaf flush and reproduction serves to maximize seasonal light availability, minimize the impact of herbivores, or both.

The first core yielded charcoal at most stations. Charcoal ages of a random subsample ranged from less than 200 YBP to 9500 YBP with a noticeable peak between 1000 and 1250 YBP. Results reinforce a view that most closed-canopy tropical forests in eastern Amazonia have been subject to palaeo-fire events of unknown severity with a peak in charcoal age consistently appearing between 1000 and 2000 YBP. The two samples dated to the early Holocene represent some of the oldest indicators of paleo-fire known from upland Neotropical forest soils.

Much of the variation in resource use derived from shifts in the use of flowers and fruit, highlighting the importance in resource phenology for birds. Insectivory was more frequent in winter than summer for the coffee layer, and in summer for the shade layer. Given the vegetative structural similarity of the two coffee agroecosystems included in this study, floristic differences probably accounted for much of the difference in the bird communities between the management systems, especially given the strong seasonal response to flowering and fruiting.

We investigated whether rain forest monkeys and duikers alter their antipredatory behavior in response to hunting by humans in southwestern Gabon. We compared monkey and duiker responses to human observers in an area where hunting is prohibited, to those in a nearby area where hunting pressure is moderate but spatially variable. The results of our study indicate that monkeys become more secretive when hunted, commencing alarm calls only when at a certain distance (typically > 50 m) from humans. We found no difference in monkey group size between hunted and no-hunting areas. In no-hunting areas, duikers often freeze in response to approaching observers, but in hunted areas they abandon this strategy and rapidly flee from humans. Duikers also whistle more often in areas where they are hunted frequently. Our findings have at least two important implications. First, behavioral observations of monkeys and duikers may be useful in gauging local hunting intensity in African rain forests. Second, duiker densities are likely to be overestimated in hunted areas, where they more readily flee and whistle, and underestimated in no-hunting areas, where they rely on freezing behavior to avoid detection.

A field experiment revealed that, at the beginning of their foraging activity, ants discovered food sources located at the end of fallen branches earlier than those located on the leaf litter. Additionally, laden ants walked faster along a fallen branch than along soil tracks of the trunk trails. This increment in speed was higher in slow-walking ants (e.g., with larger loads) than in fast-walking ants (e.g., with smaller loads). These results suggest that the presence of fallen branches may direct the searching effort of leaf-cutters and increase the foraging speed of laden ants when these structures are part of the trunk trail system.

Nevertheless, these recent studies still indicate that a majority of fig species have one or more host-specific pollinator. The extent to which specificity barriers in these species are leaky will have important consequences for the evolutionary process in Ficus.

Leaf harvest for the international floral greenery trade does not kill palms, but has been shown to reduce flowering frequency and has been projected to reduce population growth. Because C. radicalis is dioecious and wind-pollinated, a reduction in flowering density from leaf harvest or other anthropogenic factors may lower pollen movement between flowering conspecifics and lower fruit production. Such reduced fecundity in harvested populations can contribute to an Allee effect, where the per capita rate of population growth declines at low density. We tested for these effects by sampling C. radicalis along transects in ten populations, spanning a range of densities, during May (flowering peak) and August (fruiting peak) 2002. We applied path analysis using structural equation modeling (SEM) to test a set of hypothesized relationships between substrate, female size, several population parameters, and female fecundity. SEM models revealed that female fecundity was not dependent on any measure of population density or sexual composition, providing no evidence for an Allee effect. The strongest model (R2 = 92.9%) related C. radicalis reproductive output only to substrate, female size, flower number, and proportional fruit set. This model revealed that palms on rock outcrops were larger, produced more flowers, and had higher proportional fruit set than palms on the forest floor. This finding suggests that protection of females on outcrops should enhance population growth and viability. © 2007 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2007 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.",10,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Allee effect | Arecaceae | Dioecy | Fruit set | Mexico | Path analysis | Sex ratio,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,81,NA,NA

For C. erosum, we compared the allometry of stems and branches against three allometric models that predict that plant height or branch length increases at the 1, 2/3, and 1/2 power of stem diameter. Only the geometric similarity model (scaling exponent of 1) seemed to hold when plants were exposed to the wind. We found relatively fewer leaves per number of branches produced and fewer leaves per increment of branch diameter in the plants of C. erosum exposed to the wind. Mean petiole length ratios (petiole length/basal radius) of P. acuminata were higher on leaves of barrier-protected plants for both simple and compound leaves, indicating that petioles were stouter and mechanically safer in the wind-exposed plants.

This review, intended to complement existing data reviews on this topic, focuses on three major classes of challenges that we currently face when trying to detect and interpret directional changes in tropical forests. One is the very limited existing information on the historical context of study sites. Lasting effects from past climate, natural disturbances, and/or human activities could be significantly affecting current-day processes in tropical forests and need to be investigated for all active field sites. Second, while progress has been made in recent years on standardizing and refining research approaches, a number of methods- and data-limitations continue to affect efforts both to detect within-forest changes and to relate them to ongoing environmental change. Important outstanding needs are improved sampling designs, longer time-series of observations, filling key data gaps, and data access. Finally, forest responses to ongoing environmental change are complex. The effects of many simultaneously changing environmental factors are integrated by the plants, and their responses can involve significant lags, carryovers, and non-linearities. Specifying effects of individual environmental changes, however, is required for accurate ecosystem-process models and thus for projecting future impacts on these forests.

For three of these species, body temperature and rate of metabolism were measured as a function of ambient temperature from 10°C to 35°C. In these species body temperature was highly variable, and declined with ambient temperature in Andropadus virens. Such variation, in conjunction with behavioral adjustments, may reduce heat loss at low ambient temperatures. Body mass accounted for 98 percent of the variation in the basal rates of metabolism presented here. Basal rates in these species ranged from 81 to 90 percent of values predicted by the Aschoff-Pohl relationship for passerines, whereas previous measurements ranged from 56 to 72 percent of predicted values. This difference may reflect differences in species or measurement techniques, which, if the latter, suggests that the reduction in metabolic rate in this family may be less than originally thought.

Inia neonates in Peru and Bolivia were seen in all seasons, and were observed most often in falling water (season was defined by relative water level). Conversely, neonates in Venezuela were seen at the end of low water and in rising water, yet were never observed during falling water. Inia mating behavior in Peru was observed in all seasons, while mating was observed only during falling and low water in Bolivia. Our review of the literature from throughout the range of Inia indicates variation in reproductive seasonality, with year-round reproduction in some areas.

The study site experienced a severe drought in 1997-1998 associated with the El Niño Southern Oscillation event. The drought effect on heath forest productivity was also assessed by evaluating changes in wood mass increment rates. Allometric relationships suggested that heath forest trees had leaves with smaller specific leaf area (SLA), and large heath forest trees allocate more to leaf mass compared to mixed dipterocarp forest trees. Aboveground biomass (for trees ≥ 4.8 cm DBH) in two 1-ha plots, P1 and P4, totaled 244.8 and 232.0 Mg/ha. Aboveground wood mass increment rate was -0.1 and 4.7 Mg/ha/yr in P1 and P4 during the drought period (from February to August 1998), while it quickly recovered to 8.1 and 8.5 Mg/ha/yr during the post-drought period (from August 1998 to August 1999 for P1 and from August 1998 to November 1999 for P4). This suggests a severe impact of the drought on heath forest productivity.

The tree cover types surveyed included secondary forests, riparian forests, forest fallows, live fences, pastures with high tree cover and pastures with low tree cover. We captured a total of 3084 bats of 39 species, including two new species records for the country (Lonchorhina aurita and Molossops greenhalli). Of these, 2970 bats and 27 species were in the Phyllostomidae family. There were significant differences in mean species density, abundance and evenness of phyllostomid bats across the different types of tree cover, but not in bat diversity. Riparian forests had the highest mean species density and bat abundance per plot. In contrast, mean bat abundance and species density were lowest in pastures with low tree cover. Of the 1947 phyllostomid bats marked, a total of 64 bats of eight species were recaptured. The average linear distance between extra-site recaptures was 2227 m (± 228 SE) and the maximum distance was 10.6 km. Bats were recorded moving between almost all types of tree cover, and especially to and from riparian forests.

In many cases, interindividual sex separation is not complete, as individual plants, although nominally dioecious, may produce both types of reproductive structures. A common form of this sexual variation is the production of female structures in otherwise male individuals, commonly referred to as fruiting males. Here we report the existence of fruiting males in the dioecious tropical tree Jacaratia mexicana (Caricaceae). We show that fruiting males can constitute up to 45 percent of all males in some populations of a tropical forest in Southern Mexico. In order to determine the functional significance of fruiting males for the breeding system of J. mexicana, we compared the relative performance of male- and female-borne seeds. Our results show that seeds from fruiting males are three times less likely to germinate and survive than seeds from female trees. Based on relative seed fitness data, and sex ratios in natural populations, we estimate that 6-15 percent of the genes contributed by fruiting males to the next generation are transmitted via ovules, meaning that morphological variation in gender is at least partially accompanied by functional gender variation.

One group of artificial fruits received the corresponding oil isolated through hydrodistillation and the other received water only. Fruits with oils attracted significantly more fruit-eating bats, especially Artibeus lituratus that regularly crosses open habitats to reach other forest remnants. The highly significant attraction of A. lituratus by the oil of Piper was unexpected, since this bat is a specialist on Ficus fruits. We hypothesize that in habitats with no fruit available it is possible to attract frugivorous bats with the odor of several ripe fruit species. Furthermore, we verified that almost half of the individuals captured defecated seeds, indicating that the oils also attract recently fed bats, even when their preferred food is available nearby.

Elasticity, a measure of the effects of proportional changes in life-history transitions to the long-term population growth rate, varied across both stages and sites. Elasticity shifted from large plants in young sites to small plants in older sites.
