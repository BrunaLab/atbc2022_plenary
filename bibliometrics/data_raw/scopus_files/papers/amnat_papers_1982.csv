Two hypotheses illustrate how fruit flags may increase conspicuousness of fruiting species thereby increasing visitation by frugivorous birds. In temperate deciduous forests, foliar fruit flagging species lose energy from photosynthesis by changing leaf color early, but create a large contrasting signal. The contrasting leaves may attract migrant frugivores that are unfamiliar with resource locations at any given stopover point along their migratory route. Contrasting long-distance fruit flags may also be important for some tropical plant species. Preripening fruit flags do not create a long- distance signal but rather alert resident frugivores to the presence of fruit that will soon ripen. This increases the probability that resident frugivores will remove the fruit and disseminate the seeds before the fruits are rendered unacceptable through microbial attack. This pattern is found in both tropical and temperate systems.-Author",82,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,1

To clarify the relation between the maximization procedure and the constraints, a simple iterative approach to achieving maximization and simultaneously satisfying the constraints is described. To arrive at the instantaneous decomposition, it is shown that reproductive value arises as an adjoint variable in an optimal control formulation, where effects across age classes are explicitly incorporated in a variable representing physiological state.

When absolute abundances were tripled (relative abundances were held constant) the folivore population significantly altered its proportional consumption of food types. In general, preferred foods were consumed in greater relative proportions when abundance was increased and the relative utilization of less preferred foods declined. Otherwise, results were problematic in relation to the predictions of the energy maximization model of optimal foraging theory. Not all foods of low rank decreased in consumption when the abundance of high-ranked foods was increased. The partial consumption of low-ranked foods is contrary to the tenets of energy maximization. Also, preferences did not remain consistent from phase to phase; ranks shifted considerably, especially with respect to high-ranked foods. Folivores may represent an example of the special case of optimal foraging with nutrient constraints, the partial consumption of low-ranked foods would then be expected. Also, the encounter rate for a given item or type is probably not constant in time or space; the rate of encounter is affected by an animal's degree of satiation, and dependent upon its degree of familiarity with the distribution of food items within its foraging area. This suggests that animals are optimal foragers only in the short term. The probability of accepting an item when it is encountered will be either zero or one in the short term, but in the long term it will assume an average value between zero and one. Finally, consumers should evolve search images for types or species, when within-type variability is very small and overlap among types minimal. When within-type variability is large, and distributions of food value overlap a great deal, natural selection should favor consumers that select high value items and do not generalize on a type's average values.

In general, obligately biotrophic parasites which exhibit narrow host ranges, specialization as biotypes or races, and which cause minimal tissue damage act to stress the host by causing physiological disruption such as altered photosynthesis, transpiration, or respiration.

Another consequence of the theory should be the phenotypic partitioning of relatively homozygous and heterozygous genotypes as CV decreases; homozygotes should occur with greater frequency in the tails of phenotypic distributions, while heterozygotes should occur near the mean witn increasing frequency.

It is a form of interference competition in which the chance of an individual's winning or losing is largely determined by priority of arrival at a vacant unit of resource. A simulation model is developed to explore the effect on local persistence of differences among the competing species in 1) their survivorship after gaining a unit of resource, 2) their fecundity, 3) the age, after gaining the resource unit, at which individuals become sexually mature, and 4) the shape of their stock-recruitment curves (which relate number of recruits in a cohort to the size of the adult population, and thus to the number of eggs produced initially). The effect on persistence of the number of species involved in the competition, and of some resource units remaining unused was also examined. The shape of the stock-recruitment curve was very important in determining local persistence. Linear curves prevented persistence for all except determining local persistence. Linear curves prevented persistence for all except ecologically very similar groups of species. However, when the relationship had moderate curvature (with number of recruits becoming asymptotic as population size increased) persistence for ecologically realistic periods of time was possible for groups of species which differed substantially in the other attributes affecting their competitive abilities. Such curved stock-recruitment relationships are usual for species such as most fish in which there is production of large numbers of larvae which suffer a heavy mortality prior to recruiting to the juvenile and adult habitat.

Herbs growing in areas with sparse herbaceous cover are unlikely to be next to and thus under an opponent. Hence, they reap little advantage by being taller, whereas the opposite is true in areas of dense cover. Therefore, the evolutionarily stable strategy favors greater leaf height in productive herb communities having dense coverage than in less productive communities with sparse coverage. In deciduous, cool temperate forests, winter photosynthesis may be limited more by leaf temperature than by light intensity, and thus may favor recumbent basal leaves in evergreen or wintergreen species and seasonal morphs. These ideas are confirmed by data on plant height and coverage from a study along a topographic gradient from a dry oak woods, through a mesic forest, to a floodplain forest. Maximum leaf height roughly doubles with each 7% increase in herbaceous cover, corresponding to quantiative predictions based on independent measures of the allometry of support tissue as a function of leaf height. The low stature of evergreen herbs favored by winter conditions appears to restrict their occurrence to dry, sterile sites with low coverage by summer competitors, and may be another factor favoring an association between evergreenness and soil poverty in temperate forest herbs. Patterns of leaf height among orchids native to the NE United States correspond to qualitative predictions of the model. Extensions of the model are sketched for herbs in open habitats; woody plants; higher leaves in reproductive individuals; selection on flower or fruit height; evolution of altruism along relatives. If a species occurs in herbaceous communities of high density only when its neighbors are close relatives, selection may favor the evolution of lower, more 'altruistic' leaf heights than with unrelated competitors. Aster macrophyllus, which usually has basal leaves even though it occurs in dense herb communities, is a possible case of altruism in that its stands are nearly monospecific and appear to be maintained by allelopathic compounds. -Author",273,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,46

For these populations the minimal speciation time is an increasing function of Ne/u, the ratio of the effective population size and the spontaneous rearrangement rate. With moderate Ne and either strong rearrangement homozygote selective advantage or drive, isolation can occur by fixation of a few strongly underdominant rearrangements. Under these circumstances, speciation occurs at a more rapid rate, provided that such rearrangements occur with sufficient frequency. For large Ne, only rearrangements which are meiotically driven can become fixed, so that isolation times reflect the average strength of drive. A somewhat counterintuitive result for meiotic drive is that in certain cases the minimal speciation times decrease as the effective population size increases. The implications of these results for stasipatric speciation are that mildly to strongly underdominant rearrangements (those with h > .01) can contribute to hybrid sterility only in very small populations (Ne < 50) which are likely to have a high extinction probability and suffer inbreeding depression, or in moderate to large populations which have a high spontaneous occurrence rate of driven rearrangements. Even in populations with a high occurrence of driven rearrangements, only those rearrangements with D > h (the drive coefficient) can contribute to increasing hybrid sterility. Thus, the conditions under which the stasipatric model of speciation will operate in a reasonable time are fairly strict and speciation by fixation of a large number of weakly underdominant (cryptic) rearrangements is often more likely. -Author",109,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,51

This is invalid, both within the framework of r- and K-selection theory and within a demographic model which takes age structure into account. In both cases, the patterns favored in an equilibrium population are even more intensely favored in a nonequilibrium population which happens to spend most of its history in a state of population decline. The only characteristic which seems to distinguish equilibrium populations is a lower absolute magnitude of selective pressure on some traits. The traits favored in declining populations include long lifespan, slow development, delayed reproduction, iteroparity, low degree of senescence, and perhaps a relatively high degree of investment in whatever offspring are produced. The traits favored in increasing nonequilibrium populations are largely the opposite: short life, fast development, and early reproduction, semelparity, senescence, and perhaps less investment in individual offspring. Over evolutionary time, nonequilibrium populations will diverge in one direction or the other. This model predicts the existence of suites of species with dinstinctly 'declining' (K-selected) characteristics, and other groups with distinctly 'increasing' (r-selected) characteristics. Because the same traits that increase the proportion of its history that a population spends in decline also increase the time required for extinction, the former group will occupy relatively stable habitats, the latter group more disturbed habitats. This requires no equilibrium assumptions; all of the species involved may be local losers.

She reduces her own clutch by the number of eggs added by the parasite. 3) The host is an indeterminate layer and estimates the number of parasitic eggs. She responds in an optimal fashion and reduces her own clutch with approximately half the number of parasitic eggs, hence maximizing the production of host offspring. With 2 + 2 eggs added on adjacent days early during the host's laying period, prediction (2) is substantiated. However, the host did not lay fewer eggs if experimental eggs were added late during her laying period. Experimental parasitism with one or 2 + 2 eggs during the laying period did not raise the frequency of nest desertion. When 7 eggs were added on the same day, no clutch was incubated, indicating that the host female detected the parasitism and abandoned the nest. This might be adaptive, since a large proportion of the clutch would not be her own. When parasitism occurs early during the laying period of the host, the relative reduction in host chick production equals the proportion of parasitic eggs in the nest. The reproductive success of the parasite should increase in proportion to how early she begins laying in the host nest. Intraspecific nest parasitism may have evolved mainly among ducks because (a) suitable nest sites are often rare, (b) the nest is easy to locate, (c) female philopatry makes it likely that host and parasite are genetically related, and (d) ducks do not defend their nests during the laying period.-from Authors",123,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,55

A literature survey of 60 predaceous species reveals that unsuccessful predation is widespread; only 19 of 100 prey species (19%) were attacked in one or more vulnerable size classes with an efficiency (measured after the prey was detected) of 90% or more. The nature and effectiveness of antipredatory defenses can be evaluated by measuring the efficiency with which predators detect, pursue, and subdue prey. The most effective defense of the prey is that used during the phase of predation in which efficiency of the predator is lowest. For prey which are drilled by gastropods, for example, the hypothesis that escape is the primary defense is supported by data on predatory efficiencies during the pursuit and subjugation phases. The incidence of sublethal damage is a conservative estimate of the potential for selection in favor of resistance to subjugations. -from Author",276,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,66

The eggs of some birds take much longer to hatch than expected. Highly variable and long incubation periods are explained using fork-tailed storm petrels Oceanodroma furcata as an example. Their eggs take 2-3 times as long to hatch as eggs of similar size. Egg neglect causes the extreme variability in incubation periods within a species. Low incubation temperatures prolong incubation, but long incubation periods may also be a result of selective forces that favor hatching well-developed young that can be attended infrequently. Selection has produced a continuum between cheap eggs and expensive care for the relatively helpless (altricial) young or expensive eggs and inexpensive care for the relatively independent (precocial) young. The distant foraging habits of the Procellariiformes have favored independent hatchlings. -from Author",61,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,67
