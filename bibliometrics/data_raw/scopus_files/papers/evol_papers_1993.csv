Anadromous and lacustrine smelt may inhabit the same watershed and there are several instances where dwarf and normal populations reside within the same lake. The authors assayed variation among smelt for morphological traits linked to feeding performance in fishes to see if trophic ecology might promote life-history diversity. They also examined mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) restriction site variation among forms to assess their evolutionary interrelationships. Conclusions are 1) that trophic ecology is an important factor promoting differentiation in smelt life histories; 2) that smelt ecotypes are polyphyletic and there have been multiple, independent divergences of Osmerus life-history types throughout NE North America; and 3) that the biological mtDNA differences between coexisting dwarf and normal lake smelt argue strongly that their genetic isolation may have developed sympatrically. -from Authors",123,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,1

The authors looked for differential donor success in the field by simultaneously applying equal amounts of pollen from two pollen donors, using Erythronium grandiflorum. Following simultaneous application of self and outcross pollen, significantly more seeds were sired by outcross pollen donors. Seed set following simultaneous application of two outcross donors was also nonrandom. Pollen donors from 100 m were more likely to sire seeds when competing with pollen from plants nearby (1 m). Outcross pollen was applied 3 or 24 h after self pollen. In spite of this time delay, most seeds were again sired by outcross pollen.

Increases in the minority sex consistently occurred from one generation to the next across all populations, first establishing and then maintaining a balanced sex ratio until termination of the experiment at 8-10 generations. Two populations that experienced high temperatures each generation displayed a loss of ESD, and in one of these ESD was virtually eliminated. This suggests that temperature-insensitive, sex-determining genes were being selected. In populations maintained in low temperature environments, however, the level of ESD did not decline.

Since a full handicap model proves immediately unrealistic, they modify the model to incorporate realistic assumptions about predator learning. Using this model they explicitly compare the handicap theory with a purely ""conventional' signalling model and with a null model. Predictions relating to three key design features (conspicuousness, pattern similarity, and Batesian minmicry) are compared, and tested against available data. Although many predictions remain to be tested adequately, the authors conclude that: 1) conspicuousness is most plausibly explained by the conventional signalling theory that ascribes the function of conspicuous coloration to signal efficacy rather than waste; 2) pattern similarity, within and between species, is unlikely to be the result of the need to produce similar degrees of conspicuousness, as predicted by the handicap theory, but is plausibly explained as the result of pattern generalization amongst discriminating predators, as predicted by the conventional signalling theory; and 3) Batesian mimicry is predicted by the conventional signalling theory, but not the handicap theory.

There was evidence of two maternal effects: m was the negative effect of mother's clutch size on daughter's condition, when mother's condition was held constant; M was the positive effect of mother's condition on daughter's condition, when mother clutch size was held constant. These two effects oppose one another because mothers in good condition also lay many eggs. The maternal effects were large: experimentally adding an egg to a mother's nest reduced clutch sizes of her daughters by 0.25 egg (ie m = -0.25). Measured degree of resemblance between mother and daughter clutch sizes yielded M = 0.43. Results weakly support the presence of heritable genetic variation in clutch size: additive genetic variance/total phenotypic variance = 0.33. This estimate was highly variable probably because mother-daughter resemblance may depend hardly at all on the amount of genetic variance when maternal effects are present. Daughter-mother regression is consequently a poor guide to the amount of genetic variance in clutch size. -from Authors",101,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,42

To obtain the effective population size, three different overlapping generation methods were used to estimate an effective density with demographic data from six permanent plots. The effective density ranged from 0.040-0.351 individuals per m2. The product of effective density and neighborhood area yields a direct estimate of the neighborhood effective population size (Nb).
