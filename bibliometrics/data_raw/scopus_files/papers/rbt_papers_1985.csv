In three mice and two rats, helicoidal bacteria were observed, with 8 to 11 periplasmic fibers and terminal branches of 8 to 11 structures, similar to flagella. In one of the rats, coronavirus-like particles were observed. Campylobacter fetus ssp. jejuni was isolated in cultures from two mice and Aeromonas hydrophila from two rats.",1,3916393,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,1

Only slight variations were evident when three pools of freeze-dried venom, that had been kept at -30 degrees C for several months were compared with fresh venom. These results suggest that L. muta venom is not altered drastically when stored under these conditions.",1,3880381,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,2

All the individuals were Rh+ and the I degrees allele had a high frequency (0.89). There are 4 polymorphic alleles in ceruloplasmin, including a possible new variant (3.8%). Transferrin Dchi had a remarkably high frequency (0.11). These results indicate that this group is of Amerindian origin although there are Caucasic and Negroid genes present. The genetic constitution of Matambú differs from that of the other Amerindian groups such as the Guaymí, from Chibcha stock, which supports the hypothesis of a Mesoamerican origin.",4,3939739,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,3

Several types of satellite associations showed higher frequencies in the mothers than in the neonates. The associations most frequently found in the two groups were those of two chromosomes, followed by those of three chromosomes. The D/G ratio was 1.43 in the children and 1.40 in the mothers. The number of associations per cell in the mothers was almost twice that of the children. The mean number of acrocentric chromosomes per association was 2.2 in the children and 2.35 in the mothers. No significant difference was found between observed and expected values of D and G chromosomes in the two groups. Thus, the probable factors responsible for the increase of satellite associations in the mothers similarly influenced the two types of acrocentric chromosomes.",1,3880380,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,4
