Fog interception and rainfall were measured monthly during 1988-1989 with artificial fog catchers and rain gauges, respectively. Fog interception was highest on ridges and increased with increasing altitude. Fog interception contributed between 2.4 and 60.6% of the total water input, depending on altitude and exposure to the prevailing winds. Absolute amounts of annual fog interception ranged from 142 to 2295 mm. Although low clouds were more frequent in montane forests, clouds close to the ground also occurred in the lowlands. During the study period, there was a gradient of increasing total rainfall from the Caribbean (3355 mm) to the Pacific side (5759 mm) of the Central Cordillera. Nevertheless, rainfall was more seasonal on the leeward side of the mountain range. Seasonal variation in fog intereption was different from rainfall patterns and no correlation was found between monthly (or annual) rainfall and fog interception.

In both populations, fat deposition occurred shortly after the rainy season due to an increase in feeding activity. In contrast, the timing of reproduction varied between sites according to the availability of suitable water bodies. Nevertheless, females with mature oocytes were predominant during the dry season, even in populations that bred throughout the year in permanent ponds. This suggests that seasonal variations in the nutritional condition of adults may also result in a tendency towards cyclicity in the reproduction of B. marinus in tropical regions. Analyses of allometric relationships of reproductive and storage tissues with body weights indicated that the fractions of weights in reproductive tissues did not vary either with the size of females or between populations. On the contrary, not only did larger toads have proportionally larger fat bodies, but those from wet sites had greater fractions of weight allocated to fat bodies than those from dry sites. This suggests that reproductive output may be fixed in this species and, therefore, excess energy is allocated to fat bodies. Given that the initiation of ovarian cycles depends on the restoration of proper nutritional levels, energy stored in fat bodies during breeding may allow females to resume a new ovarian cycle shortly after spawning and thus maximize the number of reproductive events.",14,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Bufo marinus | Fat deposition | Gonad development | Life-history traits | Tropical anurans,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,2,CSIRO,Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation,NA,NA

This study provides a detailed characterization of landscape-level changes in light below the canopy of these forests after the hurricane. Hemispherical photographs were taken below the forest canopy at four sites at permanent points 1 m above the ground between 7 and 33 mo after the hurricane. For each photograph photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was computed. PAR declined exponentially in all sites during the period of measurement. During the first 24 mo after the hurricane. PAR beneath the canopy was significantly greater in sites that had been defoliated during the hurricane than in sites where few trees had been defoliated. By 28 mo after the hurricane there was no significant difference in PAR beneath the canopy among the four sites. By 33 mo after the hurricane canopy recovery was nearly complete and PAR was only slightly higher than measurements made before the hurricane. Our results were compared with studies of changes in light environment resulting from treefall gaps and under deciduous canopies. PAR during the first 18 mo after the hurricane was similar to that recorded in small canopy gaps in other forests. Widespread defoliation caused by hurricanes can thus increase PAR beneath the canopy over large areas and consequently opportunities may arise for widespread recruitment of tree species in response to increased light levels.,59,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Defoliation | Hemispherical photographs | Photosynthetically active radiation | Tropical forest,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,8,NA,NA,NA,NA

The frequency distribution of the ratio of sepal length to nut length was bimodal The gyration-dispersed group with longer sepals comprised 74% of Dipterocarpaceae studied. The group with short sepal mainly comprised understorey trees, but there were a few emergents. In both groups, sepal areas were expressed as a power function of nut volumes'. Because fruit weight per sepal area increases with fruit size, larger fruits fall more quickly than smaller fruits, and sepals of the former can not serve so effectively as propeller blades. This is consistent with the fact that a few emergent trees with large nuts have short sepals and are not dispersed by gyration. Therefore, the re-evolution of short fruit sepals appears to have been mainly due to two reasons: reduction of tree height and enlargement of nut size.",25,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Allometry | Dipterocarpaceae | Evolution | Fruit | Malesia | Sri Lanka | Tropical rainforest | Wind dispersal,23435,03041064,0,FALSE,18,NSF,National Science Foundation,NA,NA

Most fruit species were black (45.1%) or red (24.3%) and 85.9% had a mean diameter <13 mm. Nutritional characteristics varied widely between species with ranges and median values as follows: pulp percentage (range 10.0-99.2%, median 69.2%), water content of pulp (11.1-94.0%, 78%), lipid (0-84.0%, 2.0%), soluble carbohydrate (4-88%, 53%), nitrogen (0.2-3.4%, 0,86%), neutral detergent fibre (1-44%, 14.3%). Fruit development time (50-360 d, 156 d) showed a negative correlation with lipid content, but no significant correlation with fruit or seed size. Principal components analysis of fruit characteristics was dominated by a trend from single-seeded fruits with a thin, lipid-rich pulp layer to multiple-seeded fruits with much, watery, carbohydrate-rich pulp. Bird-dispersed species cover the full range of fruit characteristics except those too large to swallow and too hard to peck bits from. Mammals (bats, civets and/or macaques) are known or suspected to consume most of the fruits too large for birds as well as many bird fruits but none with high-lipid content.

Heavy logging resulted in large areas of herbaceous tangle, which attracted elephants who suppressed forest regeneration by damaging young trees and perpetuating the herbaceous tangle. The Tangle directly competed with regeneration of young trees while also attracting elephants and rodents (seed and seedling predators) and facilitating increased windthrow of trees.

Trunk allometry is related tomechanical requirements for support, including the need to withstand greater wind forces in the upper canopy. The common canopy species, Pentaclethra macroloba, which comprises 40% of the basal area at La Selva, is particularly wide-crowned and thick-trunked at its maximum height. On the other hand, the comparatively narrower crowns and trunks of the other canopy species allow them to reach a given height with less biomass.

Here we examine population trends of the 219 most numerous species in the plot, assessing the impact of a long-term drying trend. Population change was calculated as the mean rate of increase (or decrease) over eight years, considering either all stems ≥10 mm diameter at breast height (dbh) or just stems ≥100 mm dbh. For stems ≥10 mm, 40% of the species had mean growth rates <1% per year (either increasing or decreasing) and 12% had changes ≥5% per year. For stems ≥100 mm, the figures were 38% and 8%. Species that specialize on the slopes of the plot, a moist microhabitat relative to the plateau, suffered significantly more declines in abundance than species that did not prefer slopes (stems ≥10 mm dbh). This pattern was due entirely to species of small stature: 91% of treelets and shrubs that were slope-specialists declined in abundance, but just 19% of non-slope treelets and shrubs declined. Among larger trees, slope and non-slope species fared equally. For stems ≥100 mm dbh, the slope effect vanished because there were few shrubs and treelets with stems ≥100 mm dbh. Another edaphic guild of species, those occurring preferentially in a small swamp in the centre of the plot, were no more likely to decline in abundance than non-swamp species, regardless of growth form. Species that preferentially colonize canopy gaps in the plot were slightly more likely to decrease in abundance than non-colonizing species (only for stems ≥10 mm dbh, not ≥100 mm). Despite this overall trend, however, several colonizing species had the most rapidly increasing populations in the plot. The impact of a 25-year drying trend and an associated increase in the severity of the 4-month dry season is having an obvious impact on the BCI forest. At least 16 species of shrubs and treelets with affinities for moist microhabitats are headed for extinction in the plot. Presumably, these species invaded the forest during a wetter period prior to 1966. A severe drought of 1983 that caused unusually high tree mortality contributed to this trend, and may also have been responsible for sharp increases in abundance of a few gap-colonizers because it temporarily opened the forest canopy.

Six habitat types were defined and habitat preferences were measured from every encountered birds and from the association between individual abundances and the coverage of habitat types on plots. The overall species richness steeply declined with elevation in all three countries. The raptor community consisted mostly of tropical species that rapidly decreased in both abundance and frequency of occurrence with elevation. A small set of subtropical-temperate forest specialists partly replaced them at mid-elevation and only two species occurred in the paramo of Venezuela, against 5-7 in the other countries. Although originally the gradients were probably almost completely covered with forest, a large part of the raptor community is flow composed of grassland species, three of them extending from the lowlands to the tree line. The relative impoverishment of the Venezuelan community, especially at upper levels, is attributed to a peninsular effect at the narrow extreme northern tip of the Andes and perhaps also to former forest fragmentation. Within some species, different subspecies had discrete altitudinal distributions and interspecific competition may explain differences in the range extension of some species between countries. Today, however, accelerating deforestation may result in a severe decline of forest-interior species and a probable reduction in the altitudinal range of at least some of them. Species naturally associated with forest gaps or edges usually tolerate a high degree of forest fragmentation and degradation but only one of them may become abundant in heavily human-altered woodlands.

The fate of dispersed and non-dispersed seeds and seedlings was examined experimentally. The findings suggest that a trade-off exists between factors that promote seedling growth in areas with high seedling density and Factors that promote dispersal by fugivores. For example, dispersal of Mimusops bagshawei increases both seed and seedling survival; seeds placed away from adult conspecifics had a 8% lower probability of disappearing than seeds placed under adults and seedlings away from adults had a 30% greater probability of surviving than seedlings grown under adults. In contrast, for Uvariopsis congensis, dispersed seeds had a 56% greater probability of disappearing than seeds directly under a parent tree, while the survival of dispersed and non-dispersed seedlings was similar.

Rates of growth and mortality were generally highest in seral species and lowest in main canopy taxa. Mortality rates were also highest amongst the smallest trees enumerated (dbh <30 cm). Changes in composition and structure over the survey period are believed to reflect forest recovery after low intensity pit-sawing was curtailed from 1951. Forest recovery also may have caused the reduced growth rates and turnover recorded for the most recent survey period, by restricting the opportunities for light-demanding, faster-growing and relatively productive seral taxa, and to have outweighed any effects of externally- driven processes, such as changes in atmospheric conditions.",19,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,permanent plot | stand dynamics | tropical forest | Uganda,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,59,NA,NA,NA,NA

Above ground biomass production was estimated for mopane (Colophospermum mopane) woodlands, a principal food source for elephants) which grows over much of northern Botswana. Densities of trees and shrubs, dimensions of plants and elephant densities were recorded within stratified plots situated according to a regional rainfall gradient. Mean estimates of above ground biomass (foliage and twigs) were 9.41 and 7.83 t ha-1 for shrubs and trees respectively. A logistic model described the maximum levels of biomass removal from plants before over-utilization of mopane occurred. Variables incorporated in the model included above ground biomass of mopane shrubs and trees, growth rates of plants and expected off-take by elephants. The model predicted a complete biomass regain within 10 y if no elephant browsing occurs. Intensive elephant browsing in woodlands containing 15 elephants km-2, however, can suppress biomass production if growth rates of plants fall below 70% of the maximum annual rate.

The relations between xylem pressure potential and transpiration made it possible to determine the hydraulic conductivity of the soil-plant system. Two types of results were obtained. First, there was considerable diversity in water status of the different species. Minimum predawn xylem pressure potentials (dry season) ranged from -1.5 MPa to -5 MPa depending on species, with interseasonal variation from 0.08 MPa to 2 MPa. Response to rainfall was very rapid (a few days) or very slow (several months). The three functioning types defined using these results were compared with the phytogeographical status of the species.
