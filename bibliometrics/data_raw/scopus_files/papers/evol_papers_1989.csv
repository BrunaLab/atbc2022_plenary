Dispersal distances also shifted over the season within a given population. Unlike the variation among populations, these seasonal changes were associated in part with changes in flower density. The mean distance of pollen dispersal from an individual plant was unrelated to date of 1st flowering, but did reflect 2 floral characters. Plants with higher variance in stamen length across flowers delivered pollen farther on average, as predicted by computer simulations of pollen carryover. Plants with lower mean stamen lengths also delivered pollen farther. Such effects of plant characters of pollen dispersal are a critical prerequisite for dispersal to evolve in response to its effects on fitness. -from Authors",55,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Nevertheless, differences in rates of speciation or extinction must largely account for the observed species-level correlation between dispersal and breeding system. Determining whether a feature and a performance advantage were strictly historically correlated or followed one another in sequence helps to distinguish whether the trait is an adaptation or an exaptation for the function. Cladograms of seed plants suggest that double fertilization arose incidentally prior to the origin of angiosperms and that the resulting product was later co-opted and elaborated as a nutritive tissue for the developing embryo. The order of character assembly in a lineage also bears on the evolution of functional and developmental interdependencies. In particular, it may be possible to trace the evolution of a character's ""burden' from an initial period, during which change is more likely, through later stages, wherein successful modification is less likely owing to the evolution of dependent characters.

The polyphyletic origin of these clones, combined with their microevolutionary potential, provides an explanation for their broad geographic distribution.

At anthesis, this spot is yellow; 14 days later it changes to purple. After the change, purple flowers remain on plants an additional 5-7 days before corolla abscission; purple flowers were avoided by pollinators, presumably because they contained less pollen (rewards) than yellow ones. Pollinators preferentially approached and foraged on plants with greater numbers of flowers per inflorescence; they did not discriminate between yellow (rewarding) and purple (nonrewarding) flowers at interplant distances >0.4 m but would preferentially forage on plants with more total flowers, even if these individuals contained fewer rewarding flowers. Thus, spent flowers increased the overall attractiveness of plants to pollinators. By directing pollinators to rewarding flowers, the change may increase pollinator foraging efficiency; pollinators visit more flowers before leaving plants (pollinator-tenure mechanism). By directing pollinators to receptive flowers, the color change may prevent incoming pollen from being wasted on unreceptive stigmas and may prevent collection of inviable pollen (pollination-efficiency mechanism). The pollinator-tenure mechanism was tested by removing pollen from yellow flowers, thereby reducing the reliability of the color-reward signal. Pollinators visited fewer total flowers on experimental plants, resulting in reduced seed production in one year. -from Author",86,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,45,all,All Open Access

There was little difference between the performance of sexual and clonal tillers after 2 yr, despite strong treatment effects and high mortality. Sib competition does not generate an advantage for sexual reproduction in biotically simple environments. -from Author",22,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,66,NA,NA

This model is reexamined, as is a related model that incorporates the possibility that sexual and asexual lines differ in their speciation rates. In these models; the long-term advantage of sex is opposed by a strong short-term disadvantage arising from the twofold reproductive cost of producing males. Once some sexual lines become established, then group selection can act to maintain sex despite its short-term disadvantage. The short-term disadvantage is included in the model by assuming that, if asexual individuals arise by mutation within a previously completely sexual species, then the asexuals quickly displace their sexual conspecifics and the species is transformed to asexuality. The net result of group selection is that sex is maintained because of its lower extinction rate (or higher speciation rate) and because asexual mutants only rarely arise. -from Author",80,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,67,all,All Open Access

Results showed a substantial fitness advantage for sexual tillers, but the advantage of sex did not increase with increasing numbers of colonists in the patch, there were multiple survivors among colonists, and an advantage was observed even for singly planted tillrs. When a truncation-selection scheme was imposed ex post facto on the data, the relative performance of sexual tillers was similar to that predicted by the Bulmer (1980) model, suggesting that sib-competition models fail due to the violation of the assumption of truncation selection. The advantage of sex was not correlated with the presence of other species, total percentage cover, or species diversity, although sites where sex was favored were physically clustered. -from Author",27,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,70,all,All Open Access
