The development of its aquaculture, to begin with genetic breeding programs, requires the identification of molecular biomarkers, particularly those associated with salinity stress. With this purpose, specimens of A. tuberculosa were collected from the adjacent mangroves of Puerto Pizarro bay (Tumbes, Perú), from January 2015 to February 2016. Different assays (groups of ten animals in triplicate) were undertaken in separated periods of 16 days: hypo-osmotic stress (extreme: 5, 10 ppt); (Moderate: 15, 25 ppt) and no stress (control group: 33 ppt). The presence of salinity stress biomarkers was assessed at the genetic level throughout PCR detection of 19 genes reported to be key actors in osmoregulation, and at the proteomic level with the sequencing of peptides (tandem mass spectrometry MALDI TOF/TOF), expressed in ark tissues exposed to different salinities. None of the tested genetic markers could be amplified by PCR, suggesting that A. tuberculosa has significant genetic differences compared to other mollusks. Proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry on A. tuberculosa gill tissue, allowed to identify 26 peptides expressed in presential and differential forms at different salinities, highlighting possible markers such as HSP70 and trans-membrane chloride channel transportation protein, to be related with salinity adaptation. These amino acid sequences will allow the design of target specific primers for A. tuberculosa, to implement future research in ecophysiology of this important fishery resource. Rev. Biol.

Loxechinus albus is considered one of the most economically significant resources from the littoral-benthic systems in the South Pacific Ocean from Peru to Chile. The objective was to determine artificial diets effects on the organoleptic traits of gonads, reproductive condition, body growth and survival of Loxechinus albus. Two types of diets were administrated (low carotene content diet (LC): balanced food with 0.02% β-carotene and high carotene content diet (HC): balanced food with 0.045% β-carotene) for 16 weeks. As a measurement of growth rate, test diameter of sea urchins fed with artificial diets was measured at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. At both times, size (GI) and color (CI) of the gonads were recorded in ten individuals from each treatment and ten from the natural population (NP). Energy density (ED), energy content (EC) and total carotenes (TCC) were determined by calorimetry and spectrophotometry, respectively. Histological sections were examined microscopically and the sex was identified. Each female was assigned to a gametogenic stage (reproductive condition) and determined: number and diameter of the oocytes, gonadal area occupied by oocytes, and relative frequencies of reproductive stages. At the end of the experiment in relation to the NP, it was possible to achieve higher GI values for both artificial diets. The NP showed higher gonadal area occupied by oocytes and larger oocyte diameter at 16 weeks (P<0.01). In addition, individuals fed with both artificial diets, presented “growth” and “advanced growth” gonad stages (both times), while the NP individuals, presented stages of “prematurity”, “maturity” and “partial spawning” at week 16. The data shows the highest CI value for the HC diet at eight weeks (P<0.01). Moreover, TCC values for the NP were significantly higher at week 16 (P<0.01). Loxechinus albus is an appropriate species to be kept in captivity, as their mortality is very low, facilitating the achievement of long-term experiences of gonadal improvement. According to our data the optimal time to improve the organoleptic characteristics is eight weeks with a high carotene artificial diet, since optimal gonad coloration was reached, and GI values did not differ significantly from the ones achieved at the end of the experiment for both diets, or the ones shown in the NP. This is translated into a lower cost by a reduced cultivation time.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Beagle channel | Echinoculture | Gonad histology | Gonad improvement | β-carotene,13567,PIP 0128,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,2,CONICET,Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas

However, a different approach (ethic-based epistemology) is equally valid and questions the assumptions of traditional ethics. This new insight does not demand facts to demonstrate that living beings should be considered ethically, since ethics should be first than epistemology (facts). Thus, all living beings should be treated with respect and a relationship based on empathy should be established. In this context, we discuss all the advances made in echinoderm research in the last 3000 years and the different uses humans made of these organisms.

In the Beagle Channel, the females of A. antarctica brood their eggs for seven months and do not feed during this period. The endoparasite Dendrogaster argentinensis (Crustacea: Ascothoracica) causes castration in several species of Anasterias. We randomly collected four samplings of adults in May, August and October (brooding period) and January (non-brooding period). The gonad (GI) and pyloric caeca index (PCI) were calculated as organ wet weight (g) x 100/total wet weight (g). Each individual was sexed by microscopic examination of the gonads. Sex ratio, brooding females/non-brooding females and mature females/ non-mature females ratios was 1:1. The male GI reached maximum values in January, when most individuals were sexually mature. The GI of non-brooding females reached its maximum during October when it was significantly higher than those from brooding females. The PCI was minimum in October, being lower in brooding females (August and October). During the non-brooding period, mature females had a significantly higher GI than non-mature females. The PCI did not vary neither between males, nor between mature and non mature females. By the end of the brooding period, non-brooding females showed a higher GI than the brooding females. This is explained by proliferation and increase of the oocytes size of non-brooding females. Mature females showed an incremented GI with presence of mature oocytes, while non-mature females exhibited more abundance of previtelogenic oocytes. Males showed synchronicity in reproductive condition. The females that have not brooded presented a process of active gametogenesis, reaching the summer with a high GI, therefore becoming mature females. Females that had brooded were probably lacking energy for new gonadal maturation. The pyloric caeca would be performing the role of a reserve organ in the brooding females, decreasing its size during the brooding period. Prevalence of D. argentinensis in A. antarctica was 11.06%.

However, the division seems to be better defined by distribution patterns and endemism of specific marine taxa.

In this study, we describe the energy reserves variation in the gonads, pyloric caeca and stomach among the gametogenic stages of a population of Cosmasterias lurida from the Beagle Channel, Argentina. Adult individuals of C. lurida were collected from the subtidal zone of Ushuaia Bay during four seasonal sampling periods (August 2010 to June 2011). Indices, energy density (kJ/g ash-free dry mass) and energy content (kJ) of gonads, pyloric caeca and stomach were determined. Oocytes number and diameter were evaluated. Cosmasterias lurida had a major peak of gonadal index (GI) in mature gonads (M), with a great decrease towards the spawning (PS/PSR) and remature (RM) periods. No variation was observed in the energy density of the gonads (EDG). The energy content of the gonads (ECG) presented a similar pattern to the GI. Thus, the gonadal storage cycle can be explained through the variation in gonad mass more than in its energy density. Females had higher ECG and EDG values than males, which suggest a greater energy contribution in females during the reproductive cycle. The stomach and the pyloric caeca indices, energy density and energy content remained unaltered among the stages. The energy density of pyloric caeca (EDPC) was higher in mature males than in mature females. Likewise, the energy density of the stomach (EDS) was overall higher in males than in females. This inverse pattern between sexes in relation to the EDG may suggest a transference of energy from the pyloric caeca and stomach to gonads during maturate stage playing a storage role for reproduction.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Body indices | Energetics | Gametogenic stages | Oocyte size distribution | Reproductive biology | Sea star,13567,PIP 0128,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,16,CONICET,Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas

Often, their population density experience markedly fluctuations that promote a state shift in the ecosystems they inhabit. Population increments of some sea urchins may cause catastrophic changes in temperate areas of the planet by decimating the erect macroalgae cover. These population increments results in unproductive and very stable assemblages, known as “blanquizales” (ericeras/moradales), or sea urchin barren ground. Macroalgae are the main ecosystem engineers in temperate areas and generate a suitable nursery and feeding habitat for fishes. These algae stands are also important zones for biofiltration of coastal waters and CO2uptake. The main consequence of vegetated biomass lost is a trophic disequilibrium that generates important economic losses for artisanal fisheries and tourism. In tropical areas, sea urchin’s outbreaks can cause bioerosion in coral reefs. However, the most important event to highlight was the mass mortality occurred in the Caribbean during the 80’s. This event favored the development of algae communities that suffocated the coral reef ecosystem. Therefore, both in temperate and tropical areas of the planet, these boom-bust echinoids generate undesired ecosystems states. Very recently, various global scale collaborative papers have highlighted a clear anthropogenic cue. Human activity though overfishing or favoring global warming, weakens marine ecosystem resilience and promote these catastrophic ecosystem shifts. To mitigate the effects of these population changes different management strategies have been used. For instance, in temperate areas, sea urchin reduction actions (manually or by using quick lime), sea urchin harvesting or the implementation of marine reserves have been used, with contrasting results. In Caribbean coral reefs affected by urchin mass mortality, some sea urchin juvenile’s reintroduction plans have been used but with very low effectiveness. The more feasible ecosystem scale strategy due to its preventive nature, seems to be the implementation of protected areas. However, the impact of global warming will exceed our capacity to manage marine ecosystems locally and will required more efficient global actions to prevent undesired sea urchin fluctuations.",4,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Climate change | Community ecology | Marine reserves | Population dynamics | Predation | Sea urchins,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,24,NA,NA

Thus, hormones such as testosterone (T) would be expected to mediate the inhibition of aggression toward pups and the onset of paternal care. However, the effect of T in onset of this behavior seems to depend of sexual experience. The aim of this study was to determine whether T induces paternal behavior in sexually inexperienced males of the Mexican volcano mouse (Neotomodon alstoni). For this, 33 non-paternal males were selected based on paternal behavior tests. These non-paternal mice were organized in three groups: 10 males were castrated, 10 subjected to sham procedure, and 13 underwent castration and T replacement. After of these treatments, the males were again evaluated by a second paternal behavior test, and blood samples were obtained to measure plasma T levels by radioimmunoassay. Castrated males with T replacement changed their behavior; 46.2 % of these males displayed paternal behavior despite 92.3 % of these males having previously displayed aggressive behavior in the selection test. An increase in T facilitates the onset of paternal behavior in sexually inexperienced males of Mexican volcano mouse, as occurs in sexual experience males. These results support the hypothesis that an increase in T levels would be involved in the neuroendocrine mechanisms that suppress infanticide and promote the onset of parental behavior in Mexican volcano mice males. Future studies in this mouse will investigate whether T regulates the onset of paternal behavior via conversion to estradiol or whether both T metabolites are involved in its onset.",5,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Neotomodon alstoni | Paternal behavior | Paternal tests | Sexually inexperienced males | Testosterone,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,29,UNAM,Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México

The continuous contamination of aquifers and the absence of planned water resource utilization, boost its scarcity, and has been the only way in which our societies become aware of the urgent need to process the generated wastewater. The objective of this research was to evaluate the nitrifying capacity of different autochthonous bacterial isolates from soils from nearby sources of domestic wastewater drainage. For this, bacteria were isolated from Pirro River, contaminated with nitrogen of domestic sewage. Nitrifying bacteria were counted by serial dilution and agar plates, and were isolated until obtaining axenic colonies. These were identified by biochemical batteries or genetic sequencing, and the quantification of their nitrifying capacity was obtained by the methods 4500- NH4 + -F and 4500-NO-2-B, all between September 26, 2011 and March 16, 2014. A total of seven strains of nitrifying microorganisms were isolated and purified, including four Streptomyces sp., one Pseudomonas putida, one Sphingomonas sp. and one Aeromonas sp. We found that there were 2.23 x 105 UFC/g of soil of ammonium oxidizing bacteria and 2.2 x 104 CFU/g of soil of nitrite oxidizing bacteria in the samples. The quantification of the nitrifying capacity of the strains by colorimetric methods, determined that the maximum ammonium removal capacity was 0.050 mg N/L/day and 0.903 mg N/L/day of nitrite. The collection of few strains of nitrifying organisms and a low CFU count, can be attributed to the technique used, since this only recovers 1 % of the microorganisms present in a sample, which, however, is acceptable for studies which main purpose is to obtain cultivable microorganisms.

Therefore, comparisons between wetland bird assemblages based only on species identity may disregard turnover within ecological groups, and eclipse important variations between habitat types. We studied bird assemblages from mangrove and estuary habitat types from a coastal lagoon system in Oaxaca, Mexico. For this, we used 640 point counts to obtain data on bird species using those habitats between October 2009 and May 2012. We ascertained guild structure by classifying 139 species in a scalar hierarchy of two-levels: 17 key-resource guilds nested within seven trophic guilds. To evaluate variation in guild structure between habitat types, we contrasted richness and diversity across trophic guilds and tested for variation in abundance within key-resource guilds. We exposed a tendency of greater diversity within terrestrial guilds in mangrove and within aquatic guilds at the estuary. However, these differences were compensatory and neither richness nor diversity varied between habitat types in comparisons across the sets of trophic guilds. Parallel analyses at two hierarchical levels supported the theoretical prediction of greater change at lower levels. Herpetofauna, wood invertebrates, aquatic invertebrates and seeds emerged as dietary components that may explain the distribution of abundance in key-resource guilds. Although the guilds from mangrove and estuary produced comparable sets of richness and diversity values, the actual identity of guilds with high values varied between habitats. On the other hand, species abundance comparisons within guilds pinpointed specific associations with habitat types and this method represents a suitable strategy for identifying habitat preferences in complex wetland bird assemblages.",4,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Aves | Estuary | Hierarchy theory | Key-resource guild | Mangrove | Oaxaca | Trophic guild,13567,222996,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,31,NA,NA

In Colombia the tropical dry forest is one of the most threatened and least known ecosystems; these have been impacted by different transformation processes and habitat fragmentation, which have affected bird conditions and survival. This research evaluated the influence of landscape elements (forest and pastures with different tree covers) on bird diversity in the tropical dry forest of Córdoba, Colombia. The study was developed within an extensive livestock landscape to characterize the avifauna in four habitat types formed by fragments of secondary forests with different tree cover: Secondary forest, pastures with high tree cover, pastures with low tree cover and only pastures. The influence of tree cover on bird diversity was evaluated with monthly samplings in 200 m long transects (per habitat), with two observation intervals (6:00 - 9:00 and 15:00-18:00), from September 2011 to May 2012. A total of 6 667 individuals belonging to 180 species and 48 families of birds were registered. The most abundant species were Columbina talpacoti (5.37 %), Brotogeris jugularis (5.14 %), Tyrannus melancholicus (4.81 %) and Bubulcus ibis (4.80 %). The most abundant family was Tyrannidae (16.4 %), followed by Psitacidae (9.0 %) and Columbidae (8.2 %). The family with the highest number of species was Tyrannidae with 28 species, followed by Accipitridae and Icteridae with 10 species each. The greatest species richness was present in the secondary forest habitat, followed by the pastures with high tree cover, and pastures with low cover. The lowest abundance and species richness was found in pastures without tree cover with significant differences between the habitats (Fisher, p <0.05). According to the Shannon index, the diversity of birds was higher in the secondary forests. In contrast, the lowest diversity was found in pastures without tree cover. The greatest species richness occurred in the months of October and November. In the rest of the sampling period, the number of recorded species and individuals showed some stability. The importance of trees presence in extensive livestock areas was evidenced because they help to contain an important diversity of bird species, and they also generate connectivity among fragments of secondary forests in the cattle landscape.",4,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Biodiversity | Birds | Caribbean region | Cattle ranches | Silvopastoral systems,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,34,NA,Institute of Infection and Immunity

The aim of this study is to screen the trypanocidal activity of methanolic extracts from Hematoxilum brasiletto, Marrubium vulgare, Schinus molle, and Cympongon citratus, against T. cruzi epimastigotes, followed by the chromatographic separation, and identification of active compounds of the best candidate by colored chemical reactions; furthermore, it was also determined their cytotoxic effect in human lymphocytes and the brine shrimp Artemia salina. The extract of H. brasiletto showed the highest anti-T. cruzi activity with a inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 543 µg/mL; in descending order, it was followed by M. vulgare (IC50 = 647 µg/mL), S. molle (IC = 827 µg/mL) and finally, C. citratus (IC = 1 210 µg/mL). The chromatographic fraction Fr22 from H. brasiletto showed the best anti-T. cruzi effectivity (IC50 = 0.238 mg/mL), when compared to the other fraction or the whole extract, with no cytotoxic effect against human lymphocytes or A. salina. The active compounds were identified as tannins, quinones, flavonoids and sesquiterpenlactones. In conclusion, active compounds against T. cruzi were identified for the first time in H. brasiletto, with non-cytotoxic effects.

The standard length found along the study period showed that the average was higher in males than in females. The trophic spectrum was composed of 13 food items, principally crustaceans, molluscs and fishes; in addition, cannibalism was observed over young individuals during March and April. The most advanced stages of gonadal maturation were recorded from November to March for males, and from November to February in females; generally, the Gonadosomatic index (IGS) recorded the highest values from November to April.

Its fishery in San Andres Island-Colombia is artisanal without any regulation, leading to a decrease in its population. Taking into account the socio-economic, cultural and ecological importance of C. pica and its vulnerability to extinction, it is urgent to develop management actions directed to increase the resilience of the species and its sustainability as a fishery resource. To assess the current population state of C. pica from San Andrés Island, we estimated size structure, sex structure, maturation size, and growth parameters, based on length-frequency data analysis. From September to December 2013, and January to March 2014, we randomly collected 458 individuals at eight representative sites of the rocky shores of the island. We measured the longest diameter of the shell base, determined the sex by the color of the gonad, and thus determined the minimum maturation size. We found, that 80 % of the population consisted of small individuals < 25.5 mm sizes. The sex ratio was 1:1 except in November, where males were more abundant.

All documents of that period with Cameroon in the address field were included in the study. The document type, language, trend and collaborations were analyzed, as well as the output of different subject categories. Performances of countries, institutions and authors, including total, single, collaborative, first author, and corresponding author publications were also analyzed. Articles were analyzed by the scientific output and research performances of individuals, institutions and collaborative countries with Cameroon. Analyses included 8 457 articles (85 % of 10 591 Cameroonian publications). These bibliometric analyses of Cameroonian publications provided interesting insights concerning authors, institutions and collaboration patterns. Results showed that research in Cameroon was highly dependent on foreign collaborations, and the international collaboration was responsible for the increasing number of publications over the years. It was found that the articles with either first authors or corresponding authors from outside Cameroon got more citations than the others, and that the articles without any international collaboration had lower citations. The number of articles indexed by SCI-EXPANDED has seen an increase in terms of Cameroonian articles that is considerably greater that the increase in number of all articles in SCI-EXPANDED.

Campylorhynchus yucatanicus (Yucatán Wren, Troglodytidae) is an endemic bird of the Northern coast of the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, with a distribution restricted to a narrow strip of habitat, between Campeche and Yucatán states. Currently, the Yucatán coast has lost more than half of the coastal dune vegetation, and other habitats have been modified mainly because there is no urban development plan and the natural resources management is poor. These factors threaten C. yucatanicus, which is listed as a near threatened species by IUCN and as an endangered species by Mexican law NOM-059-2010. In this paper, C. yucatanicus’s potential distribution was modeled using 64 presence records from several sources (1960 y 2009), a set of climate variables, and a vegetation index layer of normalized difference (NDVI). To assess the degree of landscape connectivity we used a map of vegetation types and land use, distance to villages and paved roads. The potential distribution model showed an area of approximately 2 711 km2, which is 2 % of the total area of the Yucatán Peninsula distribution. In this area, only 27 % is protected by Biosphere Reserve category and only 10 % belong to core conservation areas, with land use restrictions and relatively effective protection. The populations from Ría Lagartos and Western Celestún regions appear to be the most isolated following the model of landscape connectivity. Landscape permeability among fragments of dune vegetation near the coast is low, mainly due to the distribution of urban areas. These results can be used to establish management strategies, and show that the species is in more delicate conditions than what it has been described by IUCN.

Some of these impacts, like pollution by pesticides, may depend on land use and cover. Our objective was to assess the effect of land use/cover using a previously published index of biotic integrity (IBI), based on fishes and designed for shallow streams in the Hondo River basin. Our hypothesis was that land uses that cause deforestation and pollution, such as urbanization, cattle breeding, or sugar cane fields, would be reflected in low IBI values, at least at some spatial scales. The 23 sites originally used in 2008-2009 to estimate by electrofishing the relative abundance and other characteristics of selected fish species and guilds to construct the IBI, were revisited in February 2010, to validate by direct inspection the type of land use/cover suggested by landscape information in digital databases. We analyzed the effect of seven types of land use/cover (agriculture, pasture, human settlements, water bodies, wetlands, forest, and secondary vegetation) on the IBI values, at four spatial scales, i.e., the percent of every land use/cover at progressively larger circles (125, 250, 500, and 1 000 m diameter) centered on the water body where the IBI value was measured. Correlations were established among the percent land/use cover by scale around 23 sites, and with their corresponding IBI values. Then, Student’s t tests were calculated to examine significant differences in land use/cover between groups of localities above and below the median IBI value, and Mann-Whitney’s U tests were applied to compare IBI values between localities with and without a given landscape cover. Agriculture, human settlements, and secondary vegetation correlated negatively with the IBI; forests positively. Differences were significant (p<0.05) for forest (higher in sites with higher IBI values) and human settlements (lower in sites with higher IBI).

However, previous researches on growth have focused only in lineal dimension, and alometric changes have not been studied. In the current paper I described changes in body proportions during growth in seven ardeid species, and analyzed body growth under a phylogenetic point of view, to identify the primitive morphology pattern among genus Butorides and Nycticorax. For this purpose, I calculated bill/tarsus rate in 353 nestlings, measured between 1998 and 2006, and assessed their changes with age and body weight. All species showed marked differences in proportion changes extension between hatching and an analogous growth moment, except Bubulcus that grows almost isometrically. Alometric changes during growth and at hatch, generate a differential growth that produced the different adult morphologies expressed among egrets and herons. The general trends were toward a slight increase in the middle of the growth period up to a lowering to almost the same initial proportions. Growth in the first life stages tends to be more isometric and differences get higher latter in growth. The hypothesis of Nycticorax as peramorphic morfotype is more parsimonious with changes trends in the group, resulting in a relative extremities extension with positive alometry in bill and tarsus in all species.

For these species, we used the potential geographical distribution maps that were obtained through the Maximum Entropy algorithm, published in 2014.

Parrots must be given a special care and protection within the states of Campeche and Quintana Roo, since there are areas with high parrot diversity and are importantly affected by human activities.

Nevertheless, human activities like poaching and land use changes, and the low genetic diversity detected with mitochondrial DNA and allozymes in previous studies, have supported the urgent need of management strategies for this species, and suggest the definition of management units. For this, it is necessary to study the genetic structure with nuclear genes, due to their inheritance and high polymorphism, therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the variation and genetic structure of L. flavigularis using nuclear microsatellites. We sampled four populations of L. flavigularis and a total of 67 jackrabbits were captured by night sampling during the period of 2001 to 2006. We obtained the genomic DNA by the phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol method. To obtain the diversity and genetic structure, seven microsatellites were amplified using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR); the amplifications were visualized through electrophoresis with 10 % polyacrylamide gels, dyed with ethidium bromide. Genetic diversity was determined using the software GenAlEx v. 6.4, and genetic structure was obtained with ARLEQUIN v. 3.1; null alleles were evaluated using the program Micro-Checker v.2.2.2. Additionally, a Bayesian analysis was performed with software STRUCTURE v. 2.2.3., and the isolation by distance (IBD) was studied using the program PASSAGE v.2.0.11.6. Our results showed that the genetic variation found was low (HO = 0.30, HE = 0.24) when compared to other jackrabbit species. Fixed alleles and moderate levels of genetic differentiation (FST = 0.18, P = 0.001) were detected among populations, indicating the effect of the genetic drift and limited gene flow. Bayesian clustering analysis revealed two groups: (1) jackrabbits from Montecillo Santa Cruz, and (2) individuals living in Aguachil, San Francisco del Mar Viejo and Santa María del Mar. No evidence was found of isolation by distance. It is possible that the geographic barriers present between populations (e.g. lagoons, human settlements), rather than the geographical distance between them, may explain the observed genetic structure. The inbreeding coefficient was negative (FIS = -0.27, P = 0.03), indicating genetic sub-structure in populations. We suggest two management units based on the genetically closer populations, which will help define precise conservation actions in L. flavigularis. This research is the basis for defining translocation of individuals between populations, nevertheless, a more extensive future study, with specific molecular markers for L. flavigularis, is required.

Although already described areas (Celestún, Ría Lagartos) are certainly important, new sites hosting considerable populations at some stage of this species life cycle were detected (e.g. Humedal Progreso; Salamandra, Laguna Rosada; Xcambo). These new sites should be given more attention and important security measures and protection are recommended to all of them. It is necessary to seek new support sources for studies that determine the flamingo population’s status in difficult access areas for which little information is available.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Adults | Caribbean flamingo | Endangered species | Juveniles | Phoenicopteridae | Yucatan peninsula,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,52,NA,NA

This study evaluated the structural attributes and production of leaf litter of mangrove species in Mecoacán Lagoon. We established six monitoring sites and studied the floristic composition, diameter at breast height (DBH), and density of adult, juvenile and recruited trees, as well as seedling density; additionally, the basal area, importance value index (IVI), and coverage were also calculated. Monthly samples (from November 2014 to October 2015) of the leaf litter production of different mangrove species, were collected using litter traps, and the physical-chemical parameters of surface, interstitial, and subterranean water were determined using piezometers. The study sites were classified into two physiognomic types: fringe (Boca, Aspoquero, Arrastradero, and Pajaral) and basin (Cerros and Mojarrero). The average density of mangrove trees was 2 870 trees. ha-1. The highest basal area was found in Pajaral (41.7 m2. ha-1). Avicennia germinans presented the highest IVI value in all sites. An average coverage of 17.5 m2 was recorded. The species were zoned with respect to interstitial salinity levels. A. germinans had a greater density in areas with high salinity (hypersaline) and Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle in areas of lower salinity. The leaf litter production was 5.15 ton. ha-1. year-1 and showed a positive correlation with rainfall and a highly negative correlation with salinity level as well as with interstitial and subterranean oxidation redox potential (ORP). The results indicated that variability in the composition, structure, and production of leaf litter in Laguna Mecoacán is locally determined by the species capacity to adapt to environmental conditions (rainfall, salinity, redox potential). Several recommendations include the establishment of the sites evaluated in this study, as permanent monitoring areas and to estimate the above and belowground biomass, in order to understand the nutrient dynamics, as mangroves provide sources of energy both in situ and that may be exported to neighboring areas.",7,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Litterfall | Mangrove | Mangrove structure | Redox | Salinity,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,53,NA,NA

Freshwater ecosystems are under severe anthropic pressure (e.g. agriculture and mining), which generates adverse effects on the diversity of aquatic insects. We evaluated the insect community in streams impacted by agriculture and mining, and determined how these activities affected the community. We studied six streams in Caldas (Colombia), two with mining and two with agriculture impact. We collected the insects using a Surber net with three replicates per substrate (fine sediment, stones, and litter). In total, 12 502 aquatic insects were collected. The most representative genera were Baetodes, Simulium, and Cricotopus (57.7 %). Streams with agricultural activity had lower aquatic insects diversity than mining impact (F2,309 = 21.82, p = 0.001). The agriculture areas presented a structure dominated by Simulium and Cricotopus (Diptera, pollution-tolerant morphospecies). Baetodes dominated in stones substrate, Cricotopus in sediment, and Simulium and Cricotopus dominated in litter (F2,309 = 2.84, p = 0.001). Therefore, both factors (impact and substrate type) are being important in determining the diversity of aquatic insects.

These organs are characterized by their morphological complexity and usefulness in taxonomy and systematics. Here we described the structural and ultraestructural details of Chara hydropitys gametogenesis. The fertile material from the algae was collected in a tributary stream of the Río Meléndez in Cali, Colombia (3°21'23'‘N - 76°32'5.2'‘W) in March 2011. The specimens were fixed and processed following the standard protocols for inclusion in resin. Thin sections (0.3-0.5 µm) were stained with toluidine O, and were observed by photonic microscopy, and additional ultrathin sections (60-90 nm) were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM); other samples were processed and observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We found that the oosporangia are covered with spiral cells, forming 10-12 convolutions and ends in five coronula cells. The immature oosporangia wall is formed by two layers that correspond to the wall of the spiral cells and to the oosphere. In mature stages, the oosporangia wall is composed by six additional layers, three of them are provided by the oosphere and the other three are provided by the spiral cells. Oosphere size increases progressively while the spiral cells grow and divide. The cytoplasm of the immature oosphere does not exhibit conspicuous cytoplasmic inclusions, nevertheless, with the maturation, the number of starch granules increases, occupying most of the cell volume. In the spiral cells of the mature oosporangia we observed large number of chloroplast with starch accumulations, between thylakoid lamellae and a vacuole that occupies almost the entire cell. By using SEM it was possible to appreciate, that the external wall of the oospore, more accurately, on the fossa area, shows verrucose micro-ornamentations with verrucae elevations. In mature antheridia, shield cells are strongly pigmented orange due to the presence of a large number of plastoglobules between thylakoid lamellae. The spermatogenous filaments are developed from cells of the secondary capitulum; those, by unidirectional and sincronic mitotic divisions develop the spermatocytes. The biflagellate antherozoids are developed from the haploid cells by spermiogenesis. The subcellular events related with these division and differentiation processes, include first, chromatin condensation, loss of nucleoli and more activity in dictyosomes. Subsequently, retracts the cytoplasm and the organelles are aligned along the condensed nucleus and flagellar apparatus. Mature antherozoids emerge through a side wall pore of the spermatocytes.

We firstly evaluated the in vitro antifungal activities of endophytic fungi extracts by the well diffusion method. Secondly, the cells of C. albicans were treated with the potent extract to observe significant ultrastructural changes. To further investigate the in vivo antifungal activity of the extract, some laboratory experiments with mice were undertaken, and posteriourly, the different organs were studied under the electron microscope for any deformities. Phomopsis asparagi showed the best anti-candidal activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 46.9 µg/mL. The fungal test pathogen (C. albicans) exhibited various cell deformities when treated with the extract of P. asparagi. Histopathological studies of the vital organs of mice treated with the potent fungal extract did not show any significant pathological conditions when viewed under scanning electron microscope.

The area shelters a high diversity of habitats, representing the main formations found in this sub-region: grasslands, savannah, forested savannah, riparian forests, bays and salines, and Negro river itself. This habitat variability determines the structure and dynamics of the bird community, because most species are closely related to specific habitats. For this, we studied the abundance of bird species from 2001 to 2004 in a Pantanal area of Fazenda Rio Negro, Aquidauana, Brazil. The abundance was compared among those four consecutive years, seasons (dry and wet), time of the day (morning and afternoon), and also between seven different habitats, in order to determine the variation in distribution patterns and habitats used by birds. For this, we used the linear transect method in each of the seven habitats, and recorded bird abundances to obtain richness. The richness registered in the mosaic of habitats was of 201 species for the savannah, 87 in forested savannah, 116 in the riparian forest, 75 in grasslands, 120 in bays, 92 in the salines and 64 in the Negro river, accounting for 348 species in the Pantanal of Rio Negro. Overall, 98 species of migratory birds were registered. The results highlighted some important issues regarding the total abundance of birds in Nhecolândia: Psittacidae was the most abundant family in the region, with prominence in all environments. Recurvirostridae, a monospecific family, showed expressive abundance due to the dominance of Himantopus mexicanus in the salinas, followed by Ardeidae, Anatidae and Cracidae. Other families with high abundance were Tyrannidae, Columbidae, Thraupidae and Emberizidae, all in predominantly terrestrial environments. Moreover: a) The highest number of specimens was recorded in the morning period and in the dry season, regardless of the habitat; b) there were no differences in abundance in the same habitat along the years, but the abundance was different among habitats. In general, the results indicated that there is a relatively stable bird population in each habitat along the annual cycle, but there were differences in abundance among habitats. Thus, additional studies on food availability in dry and wet seasons should be better explored in the future, either in this region or in other Pantanal regions.

Conversely, the high pressure on available resources during dry periods can also affect the fauna diversity and distribution. Even though birds have shown to be excellent ecological indicators of these shifts in the environment, currently little is known about the avifauna of the Argentine Chaco Serrano phytogeographic district. Our aim was to study the resident bird population status in the Southern Chaco Serrano, its fluctuations in richness and abundance, and its relationship to seasonal variations, in monthly and annual hydroperiods. In order to assess the resident bird status over a two year period (2011 Mar.-2013 Feb.) we carried out 18 sampling surveys during pre-breeding (spring), breeding (summer) and non breeding periods (autumn-winter), in the Northeastern part of the Valle Fértil Natural Park, San Juan province, Argentina. During each site survey, we recorded bird assemblages found in six transects, and obtained bird abundance and species diversity. A mixed general linear model was employed to evaluate relationships between the studied variables. We found a total of 98 species of birds belonging to 33 families (44 resident species, 23 spring visitors, six summer visitors, two winter visitors and 23 with scarce registers). We also registered 68 of these species in both hydroperiods, 28 only during rainy periods and only two during the dry period. Both richness and abundance showed the highest values during the pre-breeding and rainy seasons, while different tendencies were detected during the isolated monthly rainfalls. These changes in bird densities were associated with the arrival of migratory species, mainly spring visitors, and probably in relationship with their reproductive activity, and to seasonal fluctuations in food resources. The Southern Chaco Serrano is a subtropical semiarid place that seems to be an important breeding habitat for many migrant bird species, which in turn promoted seasonal changes in species density and diversity, mainly during rainy years.

We have studied the details of its pollination ecology which was hitherto unknown. The work was done during three consecutive years 2012-2014, based on 118 plants occurring in three widely separated wild populations in West Bengal, India, together with 25 individuals grown in an experimental plot. Details of flower structure and dynamics of floral events, pollen production and pollen dispersal, visitors and pollinators, floral attractants and floral rewards and pollen transfer mechanism have been worked out by standard methodologies with a 10x high resolution hand lens (IRL), a Leica WILD M3B Stereo-binocular microscope (Switzerland) and a Leica DMLB compound bright field light microscope (Germany). The tubular flower of four-day longevity attracts its visitors by visual cues. Flowers are visited regularly by ten species of insects. On the basis of the visitor behaviour, these can be classified into three distinct categories, viz., visitors belonging to Category-I act on cushion and trichome nectaries of calyx and corolla respectively, those of Category-II act on the dehisced anthers and trichome nectaries of corolla while those of Category-III act on dehisced anthers as well as receptive stigma. Majority of the visitors belong to either Category-I or Category-II. They visit only the 2nd day flowers and never visit a 3rd day flower when the stigma assumes receptivity. Therefore, they are not regarded as pollinators but, act as pollen and/or nectar robbers. Those are discriminated by offering secretions from extra-nuptial nectaries of the flower. Visitor species of Category-III, represented by a species of Trigona, constitute the legitimate pollinator of the plant and thereby, making the plant monophilic. Pollen presentation from the bisexual, dichogamous and protandrous flower takes place on the 2nd day, while the stigma assumes its receptivity on the 3rd day of flower opening. Pollen transfer to the body of the pollinator by a 2nd day flower in its male phase is achieved by offering edible pollen grains. On the other hand, a 3rd day flower at its female phase is devoid of the reward (pollen grain). The yellow shiny receptive stigma of such a flower strikingly mimics the freshly dehisced anthers and the pollinators being lured by such a stigma inadvertently transfer pollen onto it.

Debarking practices have modified the shape of plants, their architecture and morphometry; but it is unknown if some topographic and edaphic factors may also influence in these attributes. Here we propose that the ecological conditions of this species distribution and harvesting areas, may determine the morphometric characteristics and the individuals variation in their architecture. To test this hypothesis we assessed the relationship of topographic and edaphic factors on the morphological characteristics of saplings (n = 143) and adults (n = 117), in eight harvesting areas of H. latiflora. The harvesting areas, with a surface of 0.6 ha, were selected randomly with the support of participatory mapping elaborated by gatherers of the study site. Data were analyzed using principal components (PCA) and canonical correspondence (CCA) analyses. The first three PC explained 92.1% of the morphological variation; height, basal diameter, and coverage, explained morphometric differences in both, saplings and adults, in all eight harvesting zones. The terrain slope, slope orientation, soil depth and stoniness, were ecological factors statistically related with morphometric differences. A lower terrain slope, little stoniness, soil depth, slope orientation E-W in saplings (azimuth 90°-270°) and N-S in adults (azimuth 0°-180°) were the factors associated to height, number of basal branches, basal diameter and coverage of H. latiflora. Areas with higher harvesting intensity were composed by monopodic trees and some reiterated basitone individuals; the adults of these areas also had more fruits. At these sites, plants of H. latiflora were more abundant and produced more bark, but the high-intensity of harvesting, changes plant architecture, forming shrubby, multi-stemmed individuals, that originally were mesotone trees. Areas with lower harvesting intensity were characterized by steep slopes, shallow and rocky soils, and were dominated by basitone trees of smaller size, thin and scarce in the area. These sites are the least recommended for harvesting, because they produce less bark per tree, and serve to preserve the species at the site. Based on these results, we can develop restoration programs in areas affected by commercial harvesting, establish forestry plantations in key sites to ensure the establishment and development of individuals with desirable characteristics for bark harvesting and contribute to in situ conservation of H. latiflora in the Alto Balsas Basin.",5,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Commercial harvesting | Medicinal bark | Plant architecture | Plant morphometric | Tropical deciduous forest,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,64,CONICYT,"Consejo Nacional de Innovación, Ciencia y Tecnología"

Currently, few studies have described the gametophytes of some species in this family, and our objective was to contribute to the knowledge, and to describe and compare different aspects of their germination, gametophyte development, and to determine if the prothallus characters are useful for taxonomic delimitations in the group. For this purpose, specimens and spores of each taxon were collected in the field, spores were sown in Petri dishes containing agar and Thompson nutrient medium, and grown in a plant growing chamber under controlled conditions of light (12 hr light/darkness), (50%) humidity, and temperature (18 °C night, 25 °C day). Additionally, observations of fresh materials were made and photomicrographs were taken using both optical and scanning electron microscopes. Our observations allowed distinguishing two types of germination Gleichenia and Cyathea; and three types of prothallial development Marattia, Osmunda and Drynaria. Gametangia presented more than three cells, and this is considered a primitive feature by other authors. As some variations in the germination type were observed and have not previously been reported in the literature for this family, and because of the heterogenity in the patterns of the prothallial cell development, and gametangia of more than four cells, it is important to broaden the study to other species, in order to determine the taxonomic value of the morphological characters of the gametophyte, as well as to determine if these variations are present in other species of the family.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Dicranopteris | Diplopterygium | Germination | Gleichenella | Mexico | Polypodiophyta | Sticherus,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,65,NA,NA

In the same way, these differences may be reflected in the composition of climbing plant species found in these two forest types. Thus, in this study we compared the climbing species in two forest fragments of Serra de Maracaju to understand: (1) Are species richness and floristic composition of climbing plants similar in cerradão and seasonal deciduous forest?, (2) What degree of floristic compositional difference exists between the two vegetation types?, (3) Do the two vegetation types differ significantly in climbing mechanisms, life forms, and dispersal syndromes represented among climbing species? For this, we established and sampled four plots per forest type over 24 months. Species were identified and each one classified, based on three discrete traits. Proportional differences were analyzed using chi-square tests. Our results showed that species richness and floristic composition of climbing plants in the cerradão and the seasonal deciduous forest were not similar. Climber species richness in cerradão was 37 while in the seasonal deciduous forest it was 31; they share only 13 species. Four families, Dioscoreaceae, Fabaceae, Malpighiaceae, and Sapindaceae, included over 60% of the climbing species. The morphological traits most common in both forest types were herbaceous life form, apical twining mechanism, and wind dispersal. Dioscoreaceae was found to be the dominant family, but is the first time to be reported for this condition in Brazil. Bignoniaceae and Passifloraceae ocurred only in the cerradão, and Asteraceae and Combretaceae in the seasonal deciduous forest; some species were found exclusively in a type of forest. Floristic composition of the cerradão and seasonal deciduous forest fragments were substantially different, in spite of physical proximity. However, their climbing species are not statistically distinct in morphological characteristics, possibly due to uniform climatic conditions and the similarity of species because of a shared ancestry (similar families).",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Cerradão | Climbing mechanism | Dioscoreaceae | Dispersion | Life form,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,66,NA,NA

We modeled the potential distribution of the A. finschi considering the two main activity seasons for the species: reproductive and non-reproductive. We used 428 historical occurrences (1882-2014), obtained from open access databases, combined with five environmental layers: three climatic and two topographic for each season, to perform ecological niche models using Maxent. We then transferred each model to the rest of the months to analyze the seasonal movements guided by climate. Differences in ecological variables between seasons were evaluated using a t-test. The geographic correspondence among the parrot distribution and the resources (plants) distributions were analyzed by superimposing maps. A marked seasonality in the distribution of A. finschi was observed. Ecologically, the species displays greater amplitude during the breeding seasons in terms of minimum temperature, but a noticeable reduction as far as precipitation is concerned. The distribution of food and nesting resources largely corresponds to the distribution of this parrot. There is a wide area in the center of the geographical distribution in which the species finds conditions that meet both periods of activity, as well as transition conditions between these periods.

We analyzed fish stomach contents by the numerical (% N), volume (% V) and frequency of occurrence (% FO) methods; we also calculated the index of food importance (IA), coefficient of emptiness (CV), trophic niche breadth (used H’) and condition factor (K). Additionally, we determined the sex ratio, gonadosomatic index (RGS), fecundity, minimum and average size at sexual maturity, and oocyte diameter by standard methods. The Gaira River has irregular meanders with clear waters, and high current velocity through its drainage; it is generally oligotrophic, with a tendency to eutrophic condition in some places. Observed dissolved oxygen values were high (5.4 mg/L), electrical conductivity was 68.63 μS/cm, and pH was found neutral. We analyzed stomach contents of 477 specimens, and found a 1.59% coefficient of vacuity. The species was found euryphagic in its feeding habits (H’= 0.69), omnivorous tending to insectivorous; its diet consisted mainly of Trichoptera larvae (Atanatolica sp.), followed in importance by snails (Gastropoda Pomacea sp.) and dipteran larvae such as Simulium sp. Significant differences in both frequency of occurrence and the volume consumed were observed for the different size classes, as well as between different seasons of the year.

Depredation was the main mechanism of nest failure, mostly during incubation. We identified operating variables at site and patch scales. Through analysis of binary logistic regression models for each scale, we predicted which variables increased the probability of nesting success. We also performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis to rule out possible interactions among variables. At nest scale we found that nest height, ranging 4.2 - 5.1 m had increased nesting success, while at patch scale, the probability of nest success was greater at sites with a tree density ≥ 12. Our results indicated that the probability of nesting success did not show a relationship between scales. We suggest a decoupling between scales and mechanism. Thus, habitat changes occurring at local scale did not seem to interfere with the patch scale. Also, our results showed that variation in characteristics at nest scale could also influence depredation, when depredation had been presented at random, since nests with medium and high probability of being successful, failed also for this reason.

There were three collection points (PC: river confluence; PNC: near the cages; PD: dam site). The water environment analysis of abiotic variables included: temperature, transparency, coefficient of vertical light attenuation, dissolved oxygen, pH, electrical conductivity, alkalinity, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, and reactive soluble phosphorus. Phytoplankton samples were collected into a Van Dorn bottle, and were then preserved in acetic lugol and were quantified using an inverted microscope to determine phytoplankton density and biomass; the identified species were assembled in functional groups. The data were explored by canonical correspondence analysis.

The overflow reservoir served as a natural disturbance reducing the phytoplankton biomass to less than 50% and the dominance of cyanobacteria, promoting the domain of functional groups F, M, MP, Lo, and X2. The nutrient inputs from intensive fish farming, associated with a low local depth (Zmax = 7.7 m) close to the cages (PNC), resulted in a significant human disturbance that increased the prevalence of functional groups S1, SN, and K, which are composed primarily of cyanobacteria. We concluded that, in reservoirs, overflow events are natural disturbances that have the ability to reduce phytoplankton biomass and alter the structure of local communities, and that intensive fish farming is an anthropogenic disturbance that increases the availability of nutrients and stimulates an increase in biomass of the functional groups that include cyanobacteria.

A Mantel correlation test was performed to determine if the geographic distance has effect on the floristic similarities between TFF’s and UF´s of the Yucatan peninsula. The TFF under study was characterized with a low level of diversity (2.79) and species richness (56), and a high dominance level (52.3% of RIV in five species). Dominant species such as Haematoxylum campechianum, Dalbergia glabra, Cameraria latifolia, Byrsonima crassifolia, Crescentia cujete and Terminalia buceras showed a floristic neotropical affinity typical of floodable habitats. The structure of the community was characterized by an inverted “J” pattern for the distribution of individuals in the diametric and height classes. The high density of woody lianas, mainly of Dalbergia glabra (22% of the recorded individuals) suggested an optimal state of conservation of the studied area.

This study compared the species richness and abundance of dung beetles captured using various types of baits, to demonstrate attractiveness differences in variable habitats of the Brazilian Amazon. Samplings were carried out with pitfall traps baited with human faeces, rotten banana, rotten meat and a non-baited trap, in February, March, June, September and October 2015. Habitats included native forests, agriculture areas, pastures and disturbed forests in different regeneration stages. A total of 13 736 Scarabaeinae beetles were captured, distributed over 98 species. Most individuals were captured using traps baited with faeces (76.7% of individuals), followed by rotten meat baited traps (17.8% of individuals), fermented banana baited traps (3.9% of individuals) and finally by non-baited traps (1.6% of individuals). A significant difference in attractiveness of the different baits used and habitats types was observed. Most of the captured assemblages were composed by coprophagous (42%), generalist species (32%), necrophagous (15%) and none was classified as saprophagous. Approximately 54% of the specimens were tunnelers, 25% were rollers and 12% were dwellers. The species of Scarabaeinae sampled in the region revealed qualitative and quantitative differences among their assemblages and the phytophysiognomies. The forest environments housed the greatest species richness observed, and a fraction of these is exclusive of those areas.

The reproductive biology of characid fish B. henni, in the Nare and Guatapé Rivers, Magdalena River Basin, Colombia was studied, and suggestions for conservation are presented. Ten field samplings were carried out between October 2007 and February 2012, in periods of rain, dry, transition from rain to dry and transition from dry to rain. A total of 848 specimens were collected, 360 of which were females, 441 males and 47 indeterminate. Males predominated in the catches, and the sex ratio of 1.00: 0.82 deviated significantly from the theoretical distribution 1:1. The average size captured for the total number of individuals studied was 121.5 mm SL (38.5-304.0 mm), with 133.1 mm SL for females (53.5-304.0), and 116.9 mm SL (38.5-232.5) for males. Based on the monthly variation of the gonadosomatic index (GSI) and the proportion of mature specimens, the spawning season occurs during periods of highest water levels in the rainy season. The lower values of hepatosomatic index HSI that coincide with the maximum values of the GSI, suggest that liver substances are transferred during the maturation of the ovary. The mean size at sexual maturity (L50) of B. henni was 171.5 mm SL in females, and 132.6 mm SL in males. The fecundity varied from 655 to 8 213 oocytes/female (mean= 2 072, SD= 1 648) and relative fecundity was 16.1 oocytes/g of total weight (SD= 5.9). The diameter of the oocytes was 1.24 mm (SD= 0.23). A similar development was observed in all oocytes, suggesting massive spawning activity concentrated in short periods of time. The protection of creeks and riparian habitats is a conservation priority, and protected areas such as fluvial nature reserves should be created to guarantee the survival of this species.

Illegal trade is one of major threats in Neotropical islands, because birds are captured for domestic and international illegal market. This study was undertaken with the aim to characterize the domestic market, in which captive wild birds are used as pets in the central region of Cuba. For this, a census and random survey to identify, and describe wild bird richness and abundance in 10 localities of urban and rural environments, was undertaken from August to November 2014, and from June to October 2015. Our results detected that at least 24 species and 973 individuals from six orders and 11 families were captive. The best represented order was Passeriformes (13 species), followed by Accipitriformes (four species). The best-represented families were Thraupidae (3.3 ± 0.33) and Cardinalidae (2.6 ± 0.45). Besides, the localities of Patria (17), Morón (13) and Bolivia (13) in the urban area had the highest richness.

Vanilla farming is associated with many Mexican cultures such as the Totonac, Mayan, Chinantec, and Mazatec, among others. Currently, this crop is threatened by technical, social, ecological, and climatic conditioning factors, limiting its production and the preservation of wild and cultivated species. It is therefore necessary to ascertain the current diversity status of each of these species, as well as some of their main bioclimatic profile indicators, in order to help decision-making, aimed at preserving and genetically improve these species. During 2008, we gathered data from IPN, MEXU, and XAL herbaria, as well as from CONABIO’s World Information Network on Biodiversity (REMIB), the Global Biodiversity and Information Facility (GBIF), and we also used data from live access to BUAP’s vanilla germplasm bank, obtained between 2008 and 2014. Distribution maps were generated using a geographical information system. Bioclimatic profiles for each species were obtained considering 19 WorldClim variables and altitude at a spatial resolution of approximately 1 Km2. Variance, Mean, and standard deviation for each of the 19 variables were calculated at each of the registered points. Extreme environmental condition intervals (minimum, average, and maximum) were also obtained. In order to determine the most important distribution variables of the species, we performed a principal component analysis and carried out Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s tests on the variables identified as significant. Results indicated records for V. planifolia, V. pompona, V. insignis, V. inodora V. odorata, V. cribbiana, and V. sprucei in Mexico, distributed throughout nine states in the country. V. planifolia presented wide intervals of temperature and rain precipitation, while V. pompona, V. odorata, V. insignis and V. inodora presented intermediate intervals. The amplitudes of extreme data for each species can be considered in locating areas where ex situ regional preservation strategies could be put in place, as well as in establishing areas for cultivation. The bioclimatic profile we found, allows for an indirect inference of each species’ genetic condition, which could be used in genetic improvement programs; for instance, V. odorata grows at high altitudes and tolerates low temperatures, while V. inodora tolerates high temperatures, and V. odorata, V. pompona and V. planifolia tolerate low rain precipitation.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Altitude | Biodiversity | Orchids | Rain precipitation | Species | Temperature,13567,554375,0,FALSE,NA,NA,79,CONACYT,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología

Species richness, abundance and reproductive activity peaked alongside the stream with the greatest number of breeding sites (e.g. pools). We found temporal segregation in the occupancy and reproductive activity of species in all streams which were mainly associated with precipitation. However, occupancy and reproductive activity of some species overlapped up to four weeks during part of the breeding season. Most species used specific substrates for particular reproductive activities (e.g. oviposition), but used a range of microhabitats (leaf-litter, water, rocks, branches, leaves, logs, etc.) for others (e.g. calling).

Unfortunately, some reports have stated that Rhizophora mangle propagules are frequently attacked by Coleoptera and Lepidoptera before and after their dispersion period. The beetle species Coccotrypes rhizophorae is an obligate parasite that can cause mortality in propagules and seedlings of R. mangle, and may modify the structure of its populations. Because of the importance on this mangrove species, survival and increasing human impacts in the area, this study evaluated the presence of propagules with C. rhizophorae boring evidence in the Tumilco mangrove, in Veracruz State, Mexico. For this, three sampling areas were established: 1) mangrove core of R. mangle, 2) most impacted edge of an unpaved road with R. mangle and A. germinans, and 3) edge with Typha latifolia and R. mangle; in each area, three 25x25 m random plots were analyzed. The number of bored propagules per site was recorded every 15 days over a sampling period of one year (n= 567) from January to December 2012. We also observed the damaged part of the propagule (basal, central, apical) and the number of live and dead bored propagules per season, and compared results for different seasons in the area: rainy, cold northerly fronts or “norte” and dry. Insects were identified by an expert. Our results showed that a higher number of bored propagules was observed during the dry season, mainly in zones 2 and 3. Survival of bored propagules was higher when the perforation occurred in the basal part of the plant, and during the dry and norte seasons. Study zone 2 in particular presented a higher number of live propagules when the damage occurred in the basal part of the propagule. In all three zones, mortality was higher when the damage was apical. Zones 1 and 3 presented higher propagule survival during the dry season, while survival in zone 2 was higher during the rainy and norte seasons. The number of propagules decreased with rising flooding levels. The results showed that C. rhizophorae has a wide distribution in the Tumilco mangrove, but the mortality of R. mangle propagules is influenced by the part of the propagule that suffers damage, as well as by the season of the year and the characteristics of the area in which the infestation occurs.

This work aimed: 1) to identify the dietary habits of Claudioperla tigrina immature stages along a wide altitudinal as well as latitudinal gradient in North Argentina; 2) to define the functional feeding group (FFG) of C. tigrina; 3) to evaluate differences in diet in the studied sites. Studied nymphs were collected from localities widely scattered in Northwestern Argentina and they fell into different developmental stages (four size classes). The ingested material was extracted from the foregut and midgut by using thorax ventral dissection. Dietary profiles were analyzed through the estimation of parameters associated with a Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. ANOVA’s were performed for each food item using sites as factor. Multidimensional Scaling was used to identify sites with similar dietary profiles. An analysis of food-niche breadth was also performed to evaluate the degree of dietary diversification for the resources consumed in each site. Mouthparts are similar across the different size classes, excepting the increasing sclerotization recorded with age. Mouthparts retained most of the typical chewing groundplan, showing relatively short labial and maxillar palps, and strong, sclerotized and denticulated mandibles and maxillae. Our results pointed out that the nymphs of C. tigrina always ingest two or more food items (CPOM, FPOM, invertebrates and algae), suggesting thus a flexible diet. The diet changed in relation to body size, while finer particles were consumed in the early stages, larger particles were ingested in final stages. Coarse particulate organic matter was the dominant food item, with signals of shredding during ingestion. Differences between sites for FPOM, invertebrates, algae and sediment were detected, but not for MOPG. Correlations were obtained for the first two axis of the MDS analysis. Sites AP, LT, LI, C and M (Yungas Rainforest and Humid Grassland) were negatively correlated with the axis 1 which was associated with increased consumption of FPOM.

This study was conducted in order to investigate size variations of benthic megafauna in the tropics and to identify the effect of biotic and abiotic factors that may produce changes to these organisms, testing unresolved hypothesis and paradigms of deep sea ecology from subtropical and temperate areas. The study area covered the continental shelf of the Colombian Caribbean. The samples were collected during 1998, 2001 and 2005, using semi-globe demersal net for a water depth of 10 to 500 m. The most common species were selected for further study: Eudolium crosseanum, Cosmioconcha nitens, Nuculana acuta (mollusks), Astropecten alligator, Brissopsis atlantica, B. elongata (equinoderms), Anasimus latus, Chasmocarcinus cylindricus and Achelous spinicarpus (crustaceans). Generalized Additive Models were used to detect significant changes in size and to infer the effects of biotic and environmental factors on organisms’ size. The dependent variable was size and the predicting model variables were depth, temperature, intraspecific density, interspecific density, richness, latitude, and longitude. A total of 7 000 individuals were measured. Six species showed an increase in body size towards deeper and colder sites. These species inhabit shallow and deep environments that exceed a variation in temperature of 10 °C. There was a remarkable size reduction in areas affected by the Magdalena River, possibly due to major physicochemical changes caused by the river. This region has the lowest planktonic primary productivity within the study area. An increase in sizes was observed north of the Magdalena River (74° - 71°W & 11° - 13°N), which may be attributable to the coastal upwelling occurring in this part of Colombia. The relationship between the density of benthic organisms and size was not clear. However, five species showed an inverse relation with intraspecific density and three with interspecific density. Temperature and depth were the variables that best explained the variations in size. Most of the studied species showed an increase in body size when temperature dropped along the bathymetric range. The trend of increasing size in deeper zones is contrary to the prediction of the optimal size theoretical model (but consistent with recent studies), which indicates a reduction in organisms’ size in the deep sea, due to food limitation with increasing depth. It is possible that this increase in size is an adaptation to maximize energy, which is frequently observed in the coldest habitats of several species. Future studies in Caribbean should examine variations in size of benthic megafauna towards deeper zones (more than 500 m), were temperature is less variable and then other factors can play a more important role determining the size of these organisms.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Benthic megafauna | Body size | Colombian Caribbean sea | Predictor variables | Tropical soft-bottoms,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,87,NA,NA

We investigated the effect of diurnal rainfall on the nocturnal activity of the wandering spider species Phoneutria reidyi in nights without rainfall. Our study included two different areas and periods: a coconut plantation, located 108 km from the city of Manaus, containing an area of 80 x 80 m with 105 palms, from July 2014 to July 2015; and an area of 80 x 80 m in a rainforest fragment in Manaus, from December 2015 to March 2016. Each night, we counted active spiders (found outside refugees) searching carefully on the vegetation and on the ground using a headlamp between 19:00-00:00. Spiders were not captured to avoid the effect of disturbance, and were measured by approaching a caliper rule. We used an index to measure the diurnal rainfall effect (DRE) which was the percentage of change in the number of active spiders at night after a diurnal rainfall, considering 100% the number of spiders active at the previous or following night, without previous rainfall during the day. This pairwise approach was used to avoid seasonal bias and included 15 pairs of nights in the plantation, and 15 pairs in the forest. A total of 2 243 active spiders were counted. The number of active spiders was always smaller in nights after diurnal rainfall, with a mean reduction of 53.4%. The abundance of active spiders reduced significantly in both areas after a diurnal rainfall, and the effect was not different between areas. Larger spiders (mostly adults) reduced their activity (-62.8%) more than smaller spiders (juveniles, -48.5%). The amount of rainfall during the day had no effect on the nocturnal activity, i.e., the effect of strong diurnal rainfall is similar to the effect of a weak rainfall. The air temperature did not change significantly at night after diurnal rainfalls. The seasonality of rainfall apparently has a weak or absent effect on the abundance of P. reidyi, which was approximately constant through one year. We believe that the moisture, which may affect the chemical cues of prey, is the major cause to reduce the active spiders after rainfall, but we discuss other potential causes. Smaller individuals are probably more active under less favorable conditions due to the stronger need of food for growing. If this effect of rainfall on the behavior is common for wandering spiders in general, the rainfall events may have important consequences for the entire community of arthropods and small vertebrates. We suggest that studies based on relative abundance of spiders should take in account this potential effect in collection and analysis of data.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Behavior | Censuses | Phoneutria reidyi | Rainforest | Venomous spiders,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,88,UFAM,Universidade Federal do Amazonas

The aim of this study was to report the type of interactions that different biological forms of macrophytes stand in the eutrophic tropical reservoir of Penha reservoir, Northeastern Brazil. Data collection was captured every two months from October 2009 to October 2010, considering the hydrological cycle in one-year period. For this, twelve perpendicular transects (separated by 10 m) at the reservoir’s water edge were defined; each transect had two plots of 625 cm2 (25 x 25 cm, separated by one meter) from which samples were obtained. Plants were collected and transported in identified plastic bags for subsequent quantification of the dry weight biomass; additionally, pressed samples were made in the field for identification purposes. The relative interaction index (RII) was used to identify the existence of positive and/or negative interactions between the biomass of the biological forms of aquatic plants. Student’s t-tests were used to analyze variations in the abiotic data and biomass over time, and to determine differences between the dry and rainy seasons. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to determine correlations between the biological forms and the biomass of the macrophytes, as well as environmental variables and RII. In the dry season, the environment was mainly composed of floating macrophytes (1 013.98 g/m2), with mats of submerged macrophytes (98.18 g/m2) that demonstrated a range of positive (RII= 1.0) to negative (RII= -0.2) interactions. The biomass of emergent macrophytes increased throughout the dry season (4.87 to 106.91 g/m2) due to the nurse plant effect that served as a substratum (RII= 1.0). During the rainy season the biomass of submerged macrophytes was reduced by 97% due to direct and indirect relationships (RII= -1.0) to other macrophytes. Rainfall and emergent plants contributed to a reduction in the biomass of floating macrophytes (19.16 g/m2). The emergence of a third group of plants (emergent) lead floating plants to occupy other areas and excluded submerged plants.

Therefore, this study’s aim was to develop management recommendations, based on easily interpreted conclusions that can be used to address the socio-ecological difficulties that the artisanal, bottom-longline fishery in Bejuco, Pacific coast of Costa Rica faces. The results of previously recorded fisher socio-ecological perceptions and an evaluation of the spotted rose snapper’s, Lutjanus guttatus, population dynamics were assigned a measurable set of indicators in reference to the fishery’s natural, human and management sub-systems.

According to these results, a stock assessment for the fishery’s target species and research to determine the composition and magnitude of the fishery’s discarded species were recommended. Fisher economic dependence on bottom-longline activities led to the recommendation to develop alternative livelihood strategies. Also, the promotion of alternative markets and sustainability certification strategies for the snapper fishery are advised. Enlargement of the multi-use marine protected areas within the fishery’s grounds and improvement of their management strategies is also recommended. In order for this to occur, improved resource user coordination in the form of a fisher association that has the capability to lobby for increased enforcement of the protected areas from destructive fisheries must be realized.

The objective of this paper was to calculate the maximum allowable catch for the five ornamental fishes included in the NOM-059-SEMARNAT (protected by federal mandate), and the net monetary gain that the resource might generate. Censuses (N=1 610) were conducted in 21 reef sites of the Mexican Pacific and Gulf of California in order to estimate population density of each taxon; also, natural mortality rate (M) was calculated from maximum size (L∞), individual growth rate (k) and temperature (C), and the total allowable catch was estimated on the basis of M. Finally, considering the prices of the species paid to fishermen at the beach, an estimation of the economic value of a single fishing season for an area of 220 hectares (representative of the catch area assigned in average to a cooperative in Mexico) was produced. The results indicated that the areas with the best economic potential were Encantadas Islands, Los Angeles Bay, and San Lorenzo Archipelago (all in the state of Baja California).

For this purpose, three pulls with a beach seine monofilament (20 m long by 3 m height, mesh opening 1.5 cm, 5 to 10 minutes) per station were made within a 1 km2 area. Information obtained was used to calculate the fishing efficiency analysis (CPUE con org./Evaluated Area Unit) and to determine the relationship with the environmental parameters. Our results showed that the abundance in the stations 1 to 3 was from 7 to 19 org./km2 from April to August 2014; less organisms were observed in stations 6 to 10 (an average of 1 org./ km2) from October 2013 to March 2014. The multiple correlation steps analysis indicated that there is a strong association between the CPUE and some environmental investigated variables, and a 70.9 % variability of the data was observed. The salinity resulted the most important variable because it determined a 64.3 % of variation; it was followed by the temperature with a 3.6 %; meanwhile, dissolved oxygen explained only the 2.9 %, this was mainly because within the area there are several geological, oceanographic and biological factors that favor the distribution of this species due to seawater contribution through the Tupilco bar. With the provided data with this investigation we were able to determine the fishery potential of this resource for Tabasco state. However, additional research is required to allow an extended quantification of this resource, to determine the commercial exploitation areas, and drive studies about reproductive and feeding habits, that may provide the necessary information to establish plans for sustainable use.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Abundance | Distribution | México | Stomolophus meleagris | Tabasco,13567,EG 93/4-2,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,98,DFG,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Due to the rapidly occurring riparian land use changes, and the several impacts these may have on fish assemblages, it is highly valuable to describe and understand the current relationships between these assemblages and the local environmental conditions, especially in barely know areas. In this research, we studied the taxonomic composition and fish assemblage attributes variation in three streams with different riparian conservation conditions: forest, intermediate and pasture. Samplings were performed every two months from October 2011 to September 2012, in three 1st order streams in the Machado River Basin, Rondônia. Fish were collected using trawls (seine net with a mesh size of 2 mm) and dip nets (2 mm mesh) along the entire stretch; the obtained samples were preserved and identified per site type. A total of 2 141 fish specimens belonging to 59 species, 17 families and five orders were recorded. Unlike the intermediate and pasture streams, the forest stream showed a high richness and low abundance. The forested stream exhibited the highest diversity and evenness value, and had low dominance, unlike the other streams. The variance partitioning and partial Redundancy Analysis (pRDA) indicated that assemblage composition was significantly explained by the environmental variables such as: depth, water velocity, pteridophytes and grasses, but not by spatial predictors. The non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis showed that intermediate and pasture streams separated from the forested stream. We concluded that both, the stream environmental variables and fish assemblage attributes were influenced by the different conservation status and land cover. Given the influence of regional processes, which have a pervasive role in local fish assemblages, land use at the watershed scale is important, especially to explain the higher richness and diversity found in forested streams.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Complexity | Conservation | Fish assemblages | Richness,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,99,NA,NA

High demand of P. laticuspis as a medicinal plant has decreased its natural populations, and propagation of the species has not yet been reported. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the vegetative propagation of the species through cutting and air layering, as well as its sexual propagation in a preserved population. For this, concentrations of 1 000, 4 000 and 6 000 ppm of a commercial root enhancer, with indole butyric acid (IBA), and a control treatment without IBA, were applied to the cuttings and air layers. Germination was evaluated under light and dark conditions using lots of freshly collected seeds and lots of seeds that had been stored for three months at 4 °C or 24 ± 2 °C. All experiments were performed in a completely randomized design. The cuttings did not develop roots in any concentration, whereas 100 % of the air layers rooted, displaying vigorous roots in the presence of 4 000 ppm IBA, after four month of treatment application. Regarding germination, more than 60 % of the freshly collected seeds germinated, whereas less than 20 % of the seeds stored at 4 °C, and close to 50 % of the seeds stored at 24 ± 2 °C germinated under light and dark conditions. No significant differences were observed between light and dark conditions, so they were categorized as indifferent photoblastic seeds. The observed moisture content of 13.5 % and germination behaviour as the response to cold storage, suggest that the resultant seed quality was intermediate. P. laticuspis propagation for short-term foliage production can be carried out in air layers, in populations with a high density of adult plants as a source of plant material and for the restoration of disturbed areas, in the same locality. On the other hand, large-scale seedling production, medium-term foliage production and preservation of species variability can be achieved using seeds.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Air layers | Cuttings | Germination | Intermediate seeds | Phyllonoma laticuspis,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,101,NA,NA

The knowledge of the regenerative potential of mining disturbed areas provides valuable information for their ecological restoration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of age of abandonment of mines and their distance from the adjacent forest, on the formation of soil seed bank in abandoned mines in the San Juan, Chocó, Colombia. To do this, we determined the abundance and species composition of the soil seed bank, and the dynamics of seed rain in mines of different cessation period of mining activity (6 and 15 years), and at different distances from the adjacent forest matrix (50 and 100 m). Seed rain was composed by five species of plants with anemocorous dispersion, and was more abundant in the mine of 6 years than in the mine of 15 years. There were no significant differences in the number of seeds collected at 50 m and 100 m from the adjacent forest. The soil seed bank was represented by eight species: two with anemocorous dispersion (common among the seed rain species) and the rest with zoochorous dispersion. The abundance of seeds in the soil did not vary with the age of the mine, but was higher at close distances to the forest edge than far away. During the early revegetation, the formation of the soil seed bank in the mines seems to be related to their proximity to other disturbed areas, rather than their proximity to the adjacent forest or the cessation activity period of mines. Therefore, the establishment of artificial perches or the maintenance of isolated trees in the abandoned mines could favour the arrival of bird-dispersed seeds at mines. However, since the soil seed bank can be significantly affected by the high rainfall in the study area, more studies are needed to evaluate management actions to encourage soil seed bank formation in mines of high-rainfall environments in the Chocó region.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Abandoned mine | Forest away | Gold and platinum mining | Natural succession | Passive revegetation,13567,BPIN 2013000100191,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,102,NA,NA

Thus, in this study we describe for the first time this important biological aspect of this unknown Neotropical bat species through the examination of external reproductive characteristics of males (inguinal or scrotal testes) and females (pregnant, lactating, post-lactating), based on 211 individuals (120 males and 91 females) captured between September 2008 and August 2009, in Cueva del Parque Las Escaleras, Estado Táchira, Venezuela. During this period of monthly sampling for a full year, most males displayed large scrotal testes, averaging 10 mm maximum length. The examination of females indicated that although pregnancy was first observed in November 2008, it reached a maximum during January and February 2009. Although adult males with scrotal testes throughout the year could imply that females have more than one pregnancy, our results suggested a seasonally monoestrous reproductive pattern for A. amplus. This study represents the first report of reproductive pattern for this poorly-known Neotropical frugivorous species. The observed monoestrous reproductive pattern supports the existence of synchronization between precipitation and reproduction.

In this research we studied the changes in the song parameters of the pale-breasted thrush (Turdus leucomelas) in an urban environment of the metropolitan area of Belém (Brazil). To this end, bird songs were recorded and ambient noise was measured between September and November 2008, in three different acoustic environments (urban, suburban and rural) along an urban gradient. The songs of 12 individuals per area were selected (a total of 36). Possible differences between song parameters were analyzed by ANOVAs. To assess the noise impact on bird song, we only considered the spectrum of environmental noise within the range of vocalizations of the species. In general, birds of urban habitats presented songs with higher maximum frequencies and with a wider range of notes, than their counterparts in suburban and rural areas. The differences were more pronounced in relation to rural areas. No differences in the minimum frequencies, the concentration of energy, or the average duration of the notes were found.

Our study aimed to understand the behavioral patterns between parasitoid phorids and their host Atta colombica from a forest fragment of Córdoba department, Colombia. We observed three nests of Atta colombica, from December 2013 to Januray 2015 (including dry and rainy seasons), for a total effort of 189 hours. We observed Phorids, their attacks to ants and collected their loads; we also considered differences in the way the parasitoids attacked and observed the microhabitat they preferred. A total of 52 individuals of Eibesfeldtphora attae and 54 of Apocephalus colombicus were collected. Apparently there was no preference for the size of the ants that were attacked by phorids, but larger loads were selected to land on them. When the ants responded to the phorid attack, they used individual defenses (adopting positions or increasing their speed) or grupal defenses (closer ants attacking the phorid). Parasitoid phorids have specialized their behavior, in order to ensure a successful attack on their host, who responded by modifying its behavior, according to the attacker (parasitoid).",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Host behavior | Host selection | Interactions | Leaf-cutting ants | Parasitism,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,111,NA,NA

Pitcairnioid bromeliads have floral traits assumed to promote outcrossing through biotic pollination systems; however, the reproductive biology of most of the species of this group has not been documented. Pitcairnia heterophylla is an epiphytic (seldom saxicolous) bromeliad occurring from Southern Mexico, into the Northern Andes. We studied the pollination and breeding system of P. heterophylla in an epiphytic population at a mountain forest in Costa Rica from January to April 2013. We performed hand pollination experiments (agamospermy, autonomous self-pollination, hand self-pollination and hand cross-pollination) on 89 flowers from 23 individuals (3-6 flowers per individual) in 2013 flowering season. Nectar production was measured on 18 unvisited flowers of six individuals with a hand-held refractometer. Simultaneously, floral visitors were recorded on eight individuals with trail cameras for a total of 918 hours (115 ± 52 hours per individual, mean ± SE). Under natural conditions, seed set (540.4 ± 55.2) was similar to manually selfed flowers (516.3 ± 41.5) and autonomously selfed flowers (521.1 ± 29.0), but lower to manually outcrossed flowers (670.2 ± 31.3). The flowers of P. heterophylla are self-compatible, capable of autonomous pollination, and non-agamospermous. Intrafloral self-pollination is facilitated by adichogamy and lack of floral herkogamy. The scentless red flowers of P. heterophylla with tubular corollas and nectar production suggested ornithophilic pollination which was confirmed by video recording of 46 hummingbird visits. The most common floral visitor was the short-billed hummingbird Lampornis calolaemus which accounted for 78 % of the visits. However, the visitation rate during the flowering season was low (0.6 visits per day per plant). Selfing in P. heterophylla might be explained as a mechanism of reproductive assurance and to reduce interspecific pollen flow with taxonomically unrelated plants. Rev. Biol. Trop. 65 (2): 735-743.

The most important fish species of the Vaupes river is known as a Warakú tres puntos (Leporinus friderici), the most representative migratory Characidae from the Vaupés state, Colombia, with a significant importance in food security of indigenous communities. To contribute with the knowledge of its basic biology, we determined the habits and food preferences of Leporinus friderici, during one hydrobiological cycle (March 2014 to May 2015) in the Vaupés river, Colombia. Three sites were sampled, two of them along the Vaupés river (Yacayacá and Santa Cruz communities) and the other one in the Cuduyarí river, tributary of the Vaupés river (Piracemo community). Physical and chemical water parameters from the surface and depth level of the river were determined. Stomach contents from 316 fish were analyzed by frequency of occurrence (FO), gravimetric index, vacuity index (VI) and relative importance index (RII). Vaupés’s average depth in ascending water period was of 3.7 ± 0.6 m, during rainy season of 5.9 ± 1.4 m, in descending water period of 4.6 ± 1.3 m and during dry season of 2.4 ± 1.0 m. The higher acidity and turbidity were observed during the ascending water period. The average VI was 14.5 % for the period, but it reached 40 % in descending waters. In general, a FO of plant material was the most frequent (44.4-66.7 %), followed by insects (21.1-33.3 %, secondary diets). The gravimetric indices showed that plant material was the most consumed item, followed by insects, and in almost in equal proportion, invertebrates and animal material. The differences in diet composition confirm the opportunistic nature of this species with a predominance of omnivorous habits.

Spatio-temporal variability in macroalgae can alter coastal ecosystems, a relationship particularly visible along upwelling-influenced coastlines. As a result of its equatorial location and nutrient rich, upwelling-influenced waters, the Galápagos Archipelago in the East Pacific, hosts a productive and biodiverse marine ecosystem. Reports and collections of macroalgae date back to the Beagle voyage, and since then, more than three hundred species have been reported. However, their ecology and functional role in the ecosystem is not well understood. According to various disparate and in part anecdotal sources of information, abundant and diverse communities exist in the Western regions of the archipelago, the North is essentially barren, and in the central/South abundance and distribution is variable and less well defined. Both oceanographic conditions and herbivore influence have been theorized to cause this pattern. Extensive changes in macroalgal productivity and community composition have occurred during strong ENSO events, and subsequent declines in marine iguana (an endemic and iconic grazer) populations have been linked to these changes. Iguanas are only one species of a diverse and abundant group of marine grazers in the system, highlighting the potentially important role of macroalgal productivity in the marine food web.

The main objective of this study was to make a comparative analysis of the morphology of mature ovary and testis in six fish species of the family Anostomidae. A total of 212 specimens, presenting maturing gonads, were captured from the São Francisco River, Três Marias Reservoir area, in Southeastern Brazil, between August 2008 and December 2010. The six analyzed species had mature ovaries and showed a grayish color. In vitellogenic oocytes (VO), cortical alveoli (CA) were composed by small vesicles in all Leporinus species, but in Leporellus vittatus and Schizodon knerii the CA were large vesicles. However, the CA of all species showed similar histochemical content.

Lionfish abundance and size was investigated on mangroves through visual census on ten transects of 30x2 m/station, and on coral reefs (15 and 25 m deep) with stereo video on six transects of 50x2 m/station. Additionally, incidence of potential native competitors and predators on coral reefs were also estimated. Over the three years, the average density of lionfish varied between 0.0-1.3 indiv./100 m2 per sample stations and it was not significantly different among habitats (mangroves with 0.6 indiv./100 m2, reefs at 15 m - 0.4 indiv./100 m2 and reef at 25 m with 0.3 indiv./100 m2). Lionfish’s density was equal to or lower than competitors’ density, and was equal to or higher than predator’s density in both depths. While lionfish density on mangroves and on reefs at 25 m remained temporally stable, it decreased on reefs at 15 m. Temporary increase in the competitor’s density was observed and the predator´s density did not change during the monitored time. Lionfish size varied between 5 and 39 cm; the average fish size from mangroves (12.6 cm) was consistently lower than from reefs (25.2 cm) and showed no variations among years.

Such data are useful for establishing baseline information and assessing potential changes in cetacean occurrence and distribution relative to natural (e.g., El Niño-Southern Oscillation, climate change) and anthropogenic factors. A visualacoustic survey for cetaceans occurred as part of a monitoring and mitigation program during an academic geophysical seismic study off Nicaragua and Costa Rica, during November-December 2004. Approximately 2 067 cetaceans representing at least seven species were seen in 75 groups during 373 h (3 416 km) of daytime observations from the seismic research vessel (R/V) Maurice Ewing. The humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) and the pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) were the most frequently sighted species (30 % of all groups sighted); both were seen in shelf waters < 100 m deep and in slope waters. The bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus; 10 % of sightings) was the third most frequently sighted species and was only seen in water > 100 m deep. In addition, sightings were made of spinner dolphins (S. longirostris), short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis), Risso’s dolphins (Grampus griseus), short-finned pilot whales (Globicephala macrorhynchus), and unidentified dolphins and whales. Unconfirmed sightings of a minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) and a pod of false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) were also recorded. An additional six groups of dolphins (50 % confirmed to species, all pantropical spotted dolphins) were made during 187 h (1 549 km) of observation effort during darkness, two of which were detected within 30 m of the vessel bow using a night vision device. A total of 217 cetacean detections occurred during 633 h of passive acoustic monitoring. A small concentration of 12 humpback whales was seen in eight groups, and two humpbacks were recorded singing in the Gulf of Fonseca on 9 December 2004. To our knowledge, such concentrations of humpback whales, particularly singing humpbacks, have not been previously reported in this specific area. In addition, a humpback mother-calf pair, likely from the Northern Hemisphere population, was seen off Northern Costa Rica on 25 November 2004. Although cetacean sighting rates were significantly different during seismic and non-seismic periods even when corrected for differential detection probability related to sea conditions, our survey results do provide information to address previous data gaps on cetacean occurrence in shelf and slope waters off the Pacific coast of Central America during late fall.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Central America | Eastern Tropical Pacific | Geophysical survey | Marine mammal | Passive acoustic monitoring,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,122,NSF,National Science Foundation

This is particularly important for those with calcified structures such as the molluscs and their larval stages. We studied Strombus gigas larvae, a gastropod of commercial importance in the Caribbean Sea, in order to know the effect of water temperature and acidification on their development, growth, mortality and calcification during the larval period. A larval culture with triplicate samples was carried out employing four treatments of temperature and pH (Control = 28 °C - pH 8.1, T1 = 28 °C - pH 7.6, T2 = 31 °C - pH 8.1 and T3 = 31 °C - pH 7.6) in August 2015. We registered hatching (No. of eggs – No. of larvae hatched) and organs development, while shell growth and mortality ratio were evaluated over time. Shell calcification was studied in 30 days old larvae using EDX and RAMAN analysis. Our results showed that organs development and shell growth were higher at 31 °C treatments (initial size of 230 ± 4.12 to 313.27 ± 11.34 µm, and final size from 829.50 ± 11.33 to 1 054.50 ± 11.13 µm; from T1 to T2 respectively), and the same pattern was recorded for hatching time (18 hr) and mortality rate (~ 57 %).

Functional morphology corresponds to adaptive responses to changes in the environment. In phytoplankton, traits such as the development of mucilage, oil vesicles, filaments and variation in the surface/volume ratio, allow algae to deal with sedimentation, optimizing light and nutrient uptake. The aim of this research was to evaluate the relationship between traits and variation in physical and chemical conditions in Tota Lake (Boyacá, Colombia). For this, ten samplings were undertaken in a monthly basis between October 2013 and July 2014. We measured water pH, conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, oxygen saturation, alkalinity and total hardness; we also quantified Total Kjeldahl nitrogen and Total phosphorus. Algae were collected at different depths according to Secchi transparency. Taxonomic composition and abundance were estimated by the chamber sedimentation method. Morphological traits were measured for each taxa according to geometric models, allowing traits classification into morphologically based functional groups (MBFG) and having algae biomass expressed as biovolume. The variables were evaluated through Principal Components Analysis, which included time-space effect and it was interpreted according to variation in water level. Through Canonical Correspondence Analysis we established the relationship between phytoplankton biovolume accumulated in form categories and environmental variables. The ordination showed that limnological conditions are influenced by seasonal changes, which are mainly represented by oxygen saturation percentage, Secchi transparency, TKN, hardness and alkalinity. Four MBFG were found: IV, V, VI and VII, being MBFG IV and VII the most representatives. ACC was significant (Monte-Carlo Test, p<0.05).

Heterogeneous oocyte distribution requires a standardized sampling protocol to prevent bias in estimates, whereas homogeneous distribution, allows sampling of any portion of gonads with no risk of bias. We studied gonad oocyte distribution patterns in the hogfish Lachnolaimus maximus population from Southern Gulf of Mexico. For this, 23 mature females were selected from a total of 47 individuals exhibiting visible oocytes in the ovaries. These females were classified by reproductive phase and sub-phase (early developing-ED, developing-D, spawning capable-SC and actively spawning-AS). Six histological sections were taken from the anterior, middle and posterior regions of the left and right ovary lobes of each individual. Digital image processing (AxioVision and Image ProPlus programs) was used to estimate oocyte density per unit area, and for different development stages. Contingency tables were used to analyze oocyte distribution frequencies between the regions of each lobe, and between the lobes of each ovary. This was supported with a Pearson’s χ2 test for goodness-of-fit and a replicated G test to confirm distribution heterogeneity. Oocyte stage distribution was homogeneous in almost all 23 females regardless of the ovary lobe. In the left ovary lobe, oocyte distribution was uniform in all three regions sampled regardless the female phase or sub-phase. In the right ovary lobe, oocyte frequencies were similarly uniform for the ED, D and AS phase and sub-phases; nevertheless, during SC phase, some heterogeneity was observed in tertiary vitellogenesis-Vtg3 oocytes, especially in samples from middle and posterior regions of this lobe. Females in AS sub-phase are normally used to estimate batch fecundity in fish such as L. maximus, which has shown to have asynchronous oocyte development and batch spawning. Given the homogeneous oocyte distribution pattern within and between the ovary lobes in females in AS sub-phase, no systematization is required of the gonad histological sampling protocol to estimate species batch fecundity. Nevertheless, due to the heterogeneous Vtg3 oocytes distribution in the right ovary lobe of females in the SC phase, it is best to systematically take sections of any region in the left ovary lobe when conducting a study encompassing all of a species’ reproductive aspects.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Gulf of Mexico | Hogfish | Ovarian homogeneity | Reproduction,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,127,CONICYT,"Consejo Nacional de Innovación, Ciencia y Tecnología"

We selected 15 streams in three micro-basins (Mazán, Llaviuco and Matadero) within or in the vicinity of Cajas National Park where we deployed litterbags for 15, 28 and 64 days. We used two types of mesh (coarse and fine) for the litterbags in order to separate the contribution of macro-invertebrates and microorganisms in the decomposition process and also tested two different leaf sub-strates: Alder (Alnus acuminata) and Miconia (Miconia bracteolata). In each collection period we determined physical and chemical parameters, applied the riparian quality index (QBR-And) and river habitat index (IHF). Decomposition rates (-k) were determined from the time period at which approximately 50 % ash-free mass would have been lost. We used Ktotal and the ratio of the rate of decomposition between coarse and fine mesh (Kg/Kf) to define the functional condition thresholds. To test the metrics sensitivity we used graphical methods, one-way ANOVA and discriminative efficiency (ED). The analysis of watershed land-use and cover showed a gradient of intervention: Matadero ≥ Llaviuco > Mazán. The composition of the environmental variables of Mazán streams were different with respect to Llaviuco and Matadero, whose values were similar to each other. The QBR-And index showed a significant gradient from very low levels in Matadero (27.5), moderately high values in Llaviuco (66.5) to high values in Mazán (87).

This industrial activity, however, generates several by-products that can threaten environmental sustainability. Seawage, for example, can contain organic pollutants and heavy metals; therefore, its deposition must be preceded by adequate water treatment. In this study, we isolated, characterized, and molecularly identified eight bacteria on the basis of their capability to degrade phenol. First, we determined the rates of bacterial growth and phenol degradation using different concentrations of the aromatic hydrocarbon (500, 800 and 1200 mg / L), and then used sequential statistical designs to select optimal conditions for its degradation. Results showed that all isolated strains were capable of degrading phenol as the sole carbon source; the degradation kinetics and phenol tolerance, however, widely varied among strains. We chose the strain Pseudomonas sp. Sps1 for further studies due to its remarkable tolerance and capability to degrade phenol. By using a Plackett Burman design, followed by a fractionated factorial design in which several carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus sources were evaluated, and phenol degradation was used as the response variable, we found optimal conditions for phenol degradation by Sps1. Finally, we compared phenol degradation in seawage by the use or not of the optimal conditions established by the statistical methods. Results showed that biostimulation dramatically increased phenol degradation compared with the control. In conclusion, we found that bioaugmentation with the native bacteria Sps1 and a statistically-based biostimulation approach provided an economically and environmentally friendly alternative for the removal of pollutants from oil industry sewage.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Colombia | Hydrocarbon | Native bacteria | Nutrients | Oil extraction,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,134,NA,NA

Good quality seed collections can be used in conservation, research and ecological restoration. To evaluate seed quality of wild and endemic species, some compounds are used as effective promoters of germination, such as potassium nitrate (KNO3) and gibberellic acid (AG3), because they increase seed germination capacity and reduce latency. The triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (tetrazolium) test correlates seed viability because it is based on the activity of dehydrogenases in live tissues that catalyze mitochondrial respiration. The objective of this study was to obtain information on size and weight of capsules and seeds and seed germination and viability of H. perotensis, collected in Veracruz in the year 2012 and 2015. The hypotheses were 1) that seed germination and viability are independent of the year of collection, 2) that there is a tetrazolium concentration that can identify seed viability better than others, and 3) that pretreatment with KNO3 or AG3 improves seed germination. Seed germination was assessed using a completely randomized design with three treatments (control and the germination promoters 0.2 % KNO3 and 500 mg/L AG3), four treatments for the viability test (control, 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 % of tetrazolium) and six replicates for each treatment. A total of one hundred seeds for germination experiments, and 25 seeds for the viability test were used. The results between and within years were analyzed with ANOVA and multiple comparison with the Tukey test. The proportion of non-germinated seeds was quantified along with the number of normal and abnormal seedlings, seeds with viable embryo, seeds without embryo, and seeds with low or no viability. On average, for the 2012 collected sample, 36 % had viable embryos, 7 % had low viability, 24 % were not viable and 33 % had no embryo. This result was significantly different from the 2015 sample, for which 87 % of seed showed viable embryos, 10 % had low viability, 0 % was not viable and 3 % had no embryo.

In recent years, different ecotoxicologic studies have been made with the South-American gordiid species, Chordodes nobilii, that have demonstrated the capacity of this group to act as a bioindicator of contamination. Despite the Gordiida’s ecologic relevance, further studies are still needed to elucidate different aspects of the biology of the class, and among those, the infective capacity, a parameter that can be evaluated by the infection index mean abundance (IIMA). A knowledge of the intrinsic variability in the infective capacity of C. nobilii would warrant priority in order to establish, the range of acceptable responses for normal or standard conditions in the laboratory, and, to compare the criteria among different assays. The objective of this study was to establish a baseline value for the infective capacity for C. nobilii larvae, under controlled laboratory conditions, by employing the IIMA as the evaluation parameter. To that end, we analyzed the infective capacity of C. nobilii larvae that had hatched from different strings of eggs laid in the laboratory by a total of 12 females. The C. nobilii adults were collected from streams within the Argentina Sauce Grande basin, between 2006 and 2009. Once in the laboratory, after mating, the females were placed in individual containers for oviposition. The egg strings obtained from each female were cut in 3 mm long segments; and when free larvae were observed, the segments (N= 90) were placed together with 30 Aedes aegypti larvae for evaluation of the gordiids’ infective capacity. After 72 h, the mosquito larvae were observed by microscopy in order to quantify the C. nobilii larvae in body cavities. The IIMAs were calculated as the total number of C. nobilii larvae present divided by total number of A. aegypti larvae examined. For analysis of the IIMAs obtained, the data were grouped according to the female who made the original ovoposition. Our results enabled the corroboration of an ample range of responses in the infective capacity of this species, a characteristic that would normally be linked to the progenitors originating the hatch. Because this relationship prevents the establishment of a baseline for making comparisons among assays with gordiids, through the IIMA as a response parameter, we recommend expressing the IIMA values in each assay relative to their respective controls. These findings also provide evidence for the greater success in infections by certain members of the progeny over others. Finally, on the basis of the results obtained from this study, we stress the relevance of the use of the IIMA as a decisive aspect to be considered in different studies on the biology of Gordiida.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Female | Infection index mean abundance | Infective capacity | Nematomorpha | Parasite,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,136,NA,NA

In this study we evaluated changes in the use of microhabitat by two syntopic species of tree frogs, Agalychnis dacnicolor and Smilisca fodiens along a successional gradient of Tropical Dry Forest in the region of the Biosphere Reserve of Chamela-Cuixmala at the coast of Jalisco, Mexico. We hypothesized that because these two species are habitat generalists, microhabitat use would change in response to secondary forest succession and to the climatic season of the year. Although both species were registered in both secondary and mature forests, A. dacnicolor was associated to mature forest, whereas S. fodiens was more associated to disturbed sites. Neither species showed differences in biomass among successional stages (ES) or between climatic seasons. Unlike S. fodiens, A. dacnicolor presented larger sizes during the rainy season. Body temperature of both species varied between ES and climatic season. S. fodiens presented a more constant temperature among individuals in pastures, while A. dacnicolor in mature forests. Environmental and structural habitat variables that influenced the presence of both species in ES were substrate temperature, height of tree or shrub where the frog was perching and percentage cover of litter, grasses, shrubs, trees and bare soil. The variables that best explained biomass, snout-vent length (LHC) and body temperature of S. fodiens were cover of dry branches and substrate temperature, whereas biomass of A. dacnicolor was better explained by cover of herbs, LHC, height of the tree or shrub where the frog was perching, body temperature and the substrate temperature. Both species used differentially environmental and structural variables of microhabitats along the gradient of initial to late ES. The variables that separated the species were the height of the shelter or perch and the percentage of trees in different ES. Whereas A. dacnicolor was more associated to the lowest strata of vegetation, S. fodiens showed plasticity in microhabitat use, especially in height of shelter or perch. Our results suggested that even when both species are considered habitat generalists, in anthropic landscapes, A. dacnicolor is specialist in microhabitat use, whereas S. fodiens is a species with greater ecological plasticity in microhabitat use. These differences in microhabitat use in response to habitat disturbance may help explain the success of these species in these new landscapes, as well as the importance of secondary forests in different stages of succession to maintain adequate microhabitats for the permanence of species in anthropogenic landscapes.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Chronosequence | Habitat features | Hylidae | Secondary forest,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,137,NA,NA

Mangroves have several mechanisms of resistance to salinity and most species exhibit some xeromorphic features in order to conserve water. Leaf area and stomatal density play an important role in maintaining water balance, and gas exchange is regulated by their aperture and density, two traits that vary intraspecifically in response to environmental conditions, such as water stress and salinity. In this study, we evaluated the effects of salinity on stomatal density, leaf area and plant size in R. mangle and we tested for associations among the three variables, across three sites along a natural salinity gradient in the XelHá Park, Quintana Roo, Mexico. We hypothesized that high salinity sites would produce smaller plants, with smaller leaves, and fewer stomata. Three sampling sites with different environmental conditions were chosen and salinities were monitored monthly. A total of 542 plants were tagged and tree heights and diameters were measured for each individual within each of the three sampling sites. Three leaves from 20 trees from each site were measured to determine leaf area. Stomatal densities were determined in each leaf using nail polish casts, examining ten 1 mm squares per leaf under an optical microscope. A principal component analysis was used to assess association between tree height, leaf area, and stomatal density for each plot. The salinity gradient was reflected in plant size, producing smaller plants at the higher salinity site. The largest leaves were found at the low salinity site (51.2 ± 24.99 cm2). Leaf length was not correlated to plant size (LL vs. tree height: r= 0.02, P= 0.8205; LL vs. trunk diameter: r= 0.03, P= 0.7336), so we concluded that leaf length is an environmentally plastic trait of red mangroves that may vary as a function of environmental conditions, such as hydric stress caused by elevated salinity. The larger leaves from the low salinity site had lower densities of stomata (65.0 stomata.mm2 SD= 12.3), and increasing salinities did not decrease stomatal density (intermediate salinity site: 73.4 stomata.mm2 SD= 13.5; high salinity site: 74.8 stomata.mm2 SD= 17.3). Our results confirm that stomatal density is inversely related to leaf area (r= -0.29, P < 0.001), especially leaf width (r= -0.31, P < 0.001), and that salinity may increase stomatal density by causing reduction of leaf size.",14,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Leaf area | Leaf plasticity | Mangroves | Stomatal densities | Tree height | Water stress,13567,243375/ 374628,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,138,NMSU,New Mexico State University

Bathypterois atricolor had broader environmental niches (depth: 0.47, temperature: 0.46, DO: 0.39), and inhabits deeper and colder sites (Electivity positives: > 1 000 m, < 3.2 °C, 1.0-1.62 mL/L) than B. ventralis, which had narrow environmental niches (depth: 0.34, temperature: 0.32, DO: 0.28), with high affinity to warmer sites and lower DO concentrations (Electivity positives: 778-1 400 m, 3.3-5.8 °C, < 1.0 mL/L). Both species used different environmental strata (niche overlap; depth: 0.34, temperature: 0.32, DO: 0.28). The adaptation of B. atricolor to live in a broad range of DO concentrations explains its almost circumglobal distribution, while B. ventralis lives almost permanently in the Oxygen Minimum Zone (< 0.05 mL/L), so the DO could be a limiting factor, reducing its potential geographic and bathymetric distributions.

While in Aspidoscelis genus, clutch size and relative mass are mainly associated with latitude and altitude, in Aspidoscelis gularis, winter rainfall favors two reproductive seasons, which may determine season variable clutch size. With the aim to study this, samplings were undertaken from May-July 2013, and May-September 2015. A total of 65 individuals lizards of the Southeast clade were obtained, and body length and interaxilar distance measurements were taken; furthermore, hepatic tissue samples were taken for DNA extraction, which allowed us to analyze phylogenetic relationships through a Bayesian Inference analysis, and subsequently, to apply Phylogenetic Comparative Methods (like phylogenetic signal, phylogenetically independent contrasts and reconstruction of ancestral character). Our results showed that there is a low phylogenetic signal regarding body size and shape, while the phylogenetically independent contrasts and reconstruction of ancestral characters suggest that small body sizes are associated to locations with highest rainfall. This can be associated to an establishment of an early sexual maturity, which reflects the maximum size of adults. Furthermore, according to an ANOVA and ANCOVA, there were statistically significant differences in body size and shape respectively, which promote a system for sexual competition for males and a system for fertility in females.

Fish responses to stressors were estimated through variations in length, weight and inter-circuli spaces or circuli spacing in fish scales.

Ants are key into the ecosystem because act like engineers; hence, the loss of ants’ biodiversity may be a guide to measure the loss of essential functions into the ecosystems. The aim of this study was to evaluate soil ant’s richness and to estimate whether higher taxa levels (Subfamily and Genus) can be used as surrogates of species richness in different vegetation types (fallows, old-growth forests and agroforestry systems) in Eastern Amazon. The samples were taken in 65 areas in the Maranhão and Pará States in the period 2011-2014. The sampling scheme followed the procedure of Tropical Soil Biology and Fertility (TSBF). Initially, the vegetation types were characterized according to their age and estimated species richness. Linear and exponential functions were applied to evaluate if higher taxa can be used as surrogates and correlated with the Pearson coefficient. In total, 180 species distributed in 60 genera were identified. The results showed that ant species richness was higher in intermediate fallows (88) and old secondary forest (76), and was lower in agroforestry systems (38) and mature riparian forest (35). The genus level was the best surrogate to estimate the ant’s species richness across the different vegetation types, and explained 72-97 % (P < 0.001) of the total species variability. The results confirmed that the genus level is an excellent surrogate to estimate the ant’s species richness in the region and that both fallows and agroforestry systems may contribute in the conservation of Eastern Amazon ant community.",12,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Amazon | Conservation | Rapid richness assessment | Surrogates | Taxonomy,13567,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,145,NA,NA

This study was aimed at analyzing the neutralizing efficacy of a polyspecific bothropic-crotalic antivenom manufactured by BIRMEX in Mexico against lethal, hemorrhagic, defibrinogenating and in vitro coagulant activities of the venoms of Bothrops jararaca (Brazil), B. atrox (Perú and Colombia), B. diporus (Argentina), B. mattogrossensis (Bolivia), and B. asper (Costa Rica). Standard laboratory tests to determine these activities were used. In agreement with previous studies with bothropic antivenoms in Latin America, a pattern of cross-neutralization of heterologous venoms was observed. However, the antivenom had low neutralizing potency against defibrinogenating effect of the venoms of B. atrox (Colombia) and B. asper (Costa Rica), and failed to neutralize the in vitro coagulant activity of the venom of B. asper (Costa Rica) at the highest antivenom/venom ratio tested. It is concluded that, with the exception of coagulant and defibrinogenating activities of B. asper (Costa Rica) venom, this antivenom neutralizes toxic effects of various Bothrops sp venoms.

A caudal stripe, extending forward from the caudal peduncle, is characteristic of this species. This stripe is sloped downward in nearly all individuals of V. melanura, but the degree of the slope is highly variable throughout its range. The slope and shape of the stripe has previously been used in diagnosing and differentiating between species of Vieja. The purpose of this study was to use objective methods to investigate morphological variation in the caudal stripe and body shape throughout the range of V. melanura. We studied geometric morphometric analyses of body shape and empirical measurements of the slope of the caudal stripe in 215 specimens of V. melanura. We also used the mitochondrial cytochrome b marker to study population level patterns within V. melanura. Results from our analyses showed significant geographic variation in body shape and patterns of coloration with little mitochondrial phylogeographic structure. These patterns likely correspond to differences in riverine habitats throughout the species’ distribution.

In Venezuela they are caught by artisanal fisheries along the entire coast. However, studies on their biology that would help establish fishing regulations are scarce. To study reproduction aspects of these species, we analyzed 1 325 individuals of C. undecimalis and 2 025 of C. ensiferus caught by artisanal fishing in the Laguna de Tacarigua in Northern Venezuela, from July 2009 to September 2010. Total length, total weight, sex and stage of gonadal development were recorded. The sex ratio varied throughout the year: there was a significant difference in favor of C. undecimalis males (1.5:1), and C. ensiferus females (1:3.3). Differences were also evident in the sexual proportion at each size group. For both species, males dominated in the lower size ranges while females dominated in the larger size ranges. These results suggested sequential hermaphroditism (protrandry) in both species. Size at sexual maturity (Lm50) for C. undecimalis was ♀= 73.6 and ♂= 59.3 cm, and ♀= 26 and ♂= 21.5 cm for C. ensiferus. C. ensiferus reproduced throughout the year with two periods of higher intensity (August to September and February to April). Although we found very few mature individuals for C. undecimalis, February showed an important reproduction peak. Growth differences were found between males and females of C. undecimalis: positive allometry for females (P= 0.0022*L3.353) and negative allometry for males (P= 0.0108*L2.945). Both males and females of C. ensiferus showed a positive allometric relationship (P= 0.0049*L3.235). Lack of fishing regulations and controls, evidenced in this study by significant volumes of immature individuals in the catches, and the particular reproductive biology of these species, strongly indicates the need to establish regulations to ensure their responsible use.

Traits such as boldness, activity rate, and tendency to explore can all be shaped by predation risk. Our study examines the effects of predation on these behaviors by considering a natural system in which two sister species of livebearing fishes, Brachyrhaphis roseni and B. terrabensis, experience divergent predation environments. In February of 2013, we collected fish in the Río Chiriquí Nuevo drainage, Chiriquí, Panama, and conducted behavioral assays. Using open-field behavioral assays, we evaluated both juveniles and adults, and males and females, to determine if there were differences in behavior between ontogenetic stages or between sexes. We assessed boldness as ‘time to emerge’ from a shelter into a novel environment, and subsequently measured activity and exploration within that novel environment. We predicted that B. roseni (a species that co-occurs with predators) would be more bold, more active, and more prone to explore, than B. terrabensis (a species that does not co-occur with predators). In total, we tested 17 juveniles, 21 adult males, and 20 adult females of B. roseni, and 19 juveniles, 19 adult males, and 18 adult females of B. terrabensis. We collected all animals from streams in Chiriquí, Panama in February 2013, and tested them following a short acclimation period to laboratory conditions. As predicted, we found that predation environment was associated with several differences in behavior. Both adult and juvenile B. roseni were more active and more prone to explore than B. terrabensis. However, we found no differences in boldness in either adults or juveniles. We also found a significant interaction between ‘sex’ and ‘species’ as predictors of boldness and exploration, indicating that predation environment can affect behaviors of males and females differently in each species.
