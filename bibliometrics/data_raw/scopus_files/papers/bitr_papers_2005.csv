Unlike other army ants, C. andicola workers use their sting during prey capture. The workers' unusual mandibles and potent stings may be adapted for piercing and gripping the integument of nonarthropod prey animals, and for rapidly subduing large-bodied prey, respectively. The genus Cheliomyrmex may be the sister taxon to other Neotropical army ants (Ecitoninae), and Cheliomyrmex shares features of mandibular morphology and prey selection with Old World driver ants in the genus Dorylus.

We determined the timing of the phenology cycles in relation to seasonal rainfall, temperature, and solar radiation. Regression analysis was used to examine how variations in rainfall and temperature influenced deviations in the peaks and troughs of phenology cycles. We also investigated whether populations that fruit during periods of community-wide fruit scarcity were those populations with relatively long- or short-fruiting duration. Flower, fruit, and leaf-flushing phenophases all exhibited 12-mo cycles. The broad peak in flowering began with the northward zenithal passing in April and ended with the southward zenithal passing in September. Fruiting peaks occurred in the long dry season, and leaf flushing peaked in the long dry season but continued into the wet season. Deviations from phenology cycles were largely attributable to short-term fluctuations in rainfall and/or temperature. Fruiting durations of species were related to the mean diameter at breast height.

These results suggest that remote sensing methods that ignore downregulation cannot capture within-stand variability in actual carbon flux for this diverse forest type. Instead, these findings support a sampling approach that derives photosynthetic fluxes from a consideration of both canopy light absorption (e.g., normalized difference vegetation index) and photosynthetic light-use efficiency (e.g., photochemical reflectance index).

Two- to five-yr-old forests produced significantly less litter than 12-25-yr-old secondary forests (4.6 vs. 6.2 Mg/ha/yr), but the difference between older secondary forests and mature forests (9 percent) was not significant. Litter production increased with rainfall, but not significantly so. The pattern of litterfall was similar across locations and age classes, with a peak during late March or early April. However, litterfall seasonality was most pronounced in the old secondary and mature forests. Litterfall was more evenly distributed throughout the year in forests under 10 yr old. Seasonality of litterfall was also less pronounced at the wettest site, with less disparity between peak litterfall and off-peak months. Seasonality was not related to soil texture. Forest age and rainfall are important drivers of litterfall dynamics; however, both litter mass and degree of seasonality depended more strongly on forest age. Thus, the impact of land-use change on litter nutrient cycling is as great, if not greater, than the constraint imposed by the major natural environmental factor affecting tropical dry forests.",65,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Land-use change | Litterfall | Mexico | Precipitation gradient | Seasonality | Secondary forest | Tropical dry forest,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,18,NA,NA,NA,NA

Crotalaria retusa is self-compatible and capable of automatic selfing. Inbreeding depression was expressed at the level of percent seed germination, but not seed set. Few insects visited the inflorescences. Legitimate pollinators were two large carpenter bees, Xylocopa frontalis and Xylocopa grisescens which, together, accounted for more than 90 percent of the visits. The former foraged on C. retusa exclusively and has low pollen spread potential. The latter flew longer distances between plants and visited fewer flowers per inflorescence, potentially increasing the extent of pollen carryover, but at the risk of increasing heterospecific pollen transfer, because it visits other Crotalaria species during the same foraging bout. The different foraging strategies, allied to morphological disadvantages represented by pollen overlap on X. grisescens' body, may partially explain the much lower seed germination observed in C. pallida and C. lanceolata.

We followed the loss of mass and the changes in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentrations and respiration rates associated with the decomposing leaves. The breakdown rate was fast (k = -0.0672/d, k d = -0.0031/degree-day), with 81 percent loss of the initial mass within 24 days. This high rate was probably related to the stable and high water temperature (22°C) favoring strong biological activity.

To determine the relative importance of fungi and bacteria during leaf decomposition, ATP concentrations, and respiration rates were determined in samples treated with antibiotics, after incubation in the stream. The results of the samples treated with the antifungal or the bacterial antibiotic suggest a higher contribution of the fungal community for total microbial biomass and a higher contribution of the bacterial community for microbial respiration rates, especially during the later stages of leaf decomposition.

First, the climbing life form is rare among myrmecophytes. Secondly, it is surprising that a pseudomyrmecine should be the obligate associate of a liana. Pseudomyrmecine plant-ants often prune vegetation contacting their host plant. This behavior functions in part to protect against invasion of the host by ecologically dominant ants. In contrast, T. tessmanni does not prune and is associated with a plant whose success, and thus that of its resident ant colony, depends on contacts with many other plants.

The main goal of this study was to determine if artificial defoliation induces trichome production in three natural populations of the tropical shrub Cnidoscolus aconitifolius. First, we performed trichome counts for each population before imposing artificial defoliation to assess differences in trichome loads between populations. Trichome densities (trichomes/cm 2) were quantified for leaf blades, petioles, and flower stalks. To determine if defoliation induced trichome production, three defoliation treatments (0% leaves defoliated or controls, 50% of total leaves defoliated, and 100% defoliation) were applied once at the beginning of the reproductive season. Trichome counts were performed on each structure every ∼20 d during a 3-mo period after the application of treatments. Trichome counts showed significant differences in trichome densities between populations for all three structures. In turn, artificial defoliation increased trichome density. Significant differences among treatments were found for trichome densities on leaf blades and petioles. In both these structures, the 100 percent defoliation treatment differed significantly from control plants, presenting higher trichome densities. In addition, the treatment x population interaction was not significant for leaf blades and petioles, indicating that induction is a generalized response in this species, at least at the study sites.

Contrary to our expectations, significantly more germinants established on intact litter than on exposed mineral soil 3 mo after seeding.

G. dewevrei, while displaying a low-light threshold for growth, exhibited a surprisingly high growth response to increasing light comparable to more shade-intolerant species, a response that may help explain its local competitive dominance in the region.

The causes for such a decline are not completely understood; however, climate change has been identified as a possible cause for amphibian extinction, among others. Ecological niche modeling has proven to be a useful tool to predict potential distribution of species in the context of climatic changes. In this paper, we used the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) to model the potential distributions of two species of plethodontid salamanders: Pseudoeurycea cephalica and P. leprosa. We projected their potential distributions under climatic scenarios expected in 50 yr based on a conservative scenario of global climate change and assuming a moderate dispersal ability for both species. Our analyses suggest that climate change effects may pose an additional long-term risk to both species of plethodontid salamanders, with a more dramatic scenario in the case of P. leprosa. By the year 2050, this species may lose almost 75 percent of its distributional area, and this projection is even worse when deforestation (in the way it is occurring at present) is considered within the predicted model. Our results concur with those obtained for species with limited dispersal capability because they do not track changing climates, but rather face a loss of distributional area. The survival of these species is not secure, even though their potential distributional area falls within a considerable number of natural protected areas.",42,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Amphibian decline | Climate change | Ecological niche modeling | Mexico | Plethodontid salamanders | Pseudoeurycea cephalica | Pseudoeurycea leprosa,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,69,NA,NA,NA,NA

We divided the cone into five variables (horizontal projections of the cone base and stilt root height up and down the slope, and width of the cone base), from which we extracted the first two principal components and used them to measure the effects of slope and palm size on stilt root structure. We found stilt roots to be determined by palm size, not by slope conditions.

Here we examine the efficacy of epigaeic invertebrate species as ecological indicators of Afromontane forest condition. Epigaeic invertebrates are potentially good ecological indicators because they play an important role in maintaining ecosystem processes, such as nutrient cycling, rely almost entirely upon the resources provided by the organic leaf litter layer, are known to be sensitive to environmental changes, and are easily surveyed. Epigaeic invertebrate communities were sampled using pitfall traps for 21 days in each of 11 forests that spanned a gradient from large and relatively undisturbed to small and highly disturbed forest patches. Using canonical correspondence analysis, we identified a suite of potential ecological indicator species (eight out of 140 species) and showed that gradients in their population response (abundance) reflect overall forest condition, as judged from the correlated vegetation indicators and position of the forests of varying condition along this gradient. The abundance ot all but two of the eight indicator species (a spider and the landhopper, Talitriator africana [Amphipoda]) decreased with increasing disturbance. As a group, the rove beetles (Staphylinidae) show promise as ecological indicators and comprised four of the eight potential indicators species.

To evaluate these plantations as habitat for wildlife, we compared the diversity and abundance of understory birds, flowers, and fruits between juxtaposed 40-yr-old patches of exotic Chinese ash (Fraxinus chinensis) plantations and naturally regenerated forest of the same age. We observed more fruiting species in the regenerated forest, but there were no differences in total flower and fruit availability between habitat types. We also observed differences between habitats in the size of some understory shrubs, but these differences did not lead to differences between habitats in the diversity and abundance of birds. Capture rates of nectarivores correlated with resource abundance at sampling plot scale, but no such correlation was found for frugivores. Understory frugivorous birds are apparently functioning at a larger spatial scale than the patchiness created by the two habitats.

The number of fruits removed by avian seed dispersers per visit was similar among focal trees (typically 2-4). In contrast, visitation rate was highly variable (range: 0-71 visits per 4 h). We used multiple regression analyses to evaluate the relative roles of crop size (focal tree ripe fruit abundance) and fruit neighborhood variables (measured within 30 m of focal trees) in affecting visitation to focal trees by avian frugivores. Visitation rate was positively related to crop size (although this variable was only significant in one of four regression models considered) and negatively related to the presence or abundance of conspecific fruits, suggesting that trees competed intraspecifically for dispersers. Relationships between visitation and heterospecific fruits were mixed - some kinds of fruits appeared to enhance visitation to focal trees, while others seemed to reduce visitation.
