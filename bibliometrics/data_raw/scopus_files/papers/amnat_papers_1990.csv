Foraging success does not vary significantly with group size when prey is abundant. Female lions live in fission-fusion social units (prides) and forage only with members of their own pride. If lion grouping patterns were primarily related to group-size-specific feeding efficiency, females in prides containing <5 females should forage alone when prey is scarce; females in larger prides should forage alone or in groups of 5-6. However, females in small prides most commonly forage in as large a group as possible, even at the expense of foraging efficiency. Females in large prides most often forage in intermediate group sizes of 4 or 5. However, mothers keep their cubs in a creche and form highly stable maternity groups that are effective in defending the cubs against infanticidal males. Most large prides contain a creche involving 4 or 5 mothers; in the absence of a creche, large prides show no preference for any group size. Females also compete aggressively against neighboring prides, and larger groups successfully repel smaller ones in territorial disputes.

Genotypes collected from the same neighborhood exhibited competitive standoffs or transitive competitive relationships. Competitively subordinate genotypes from different neighborhoods, however, belonged to different species. Competitive relationships at the genotype level (across neighborhoods) were complex and often intransitive.

Variability in species composition among assemblages was lower in Finland, suggesting that a large proportion of the fauna could maintain populations across a broad range of environmental conditions. The Wisconsin fauna comprised more specialized species. Three types of fish assemblages were identified in Wisconsin, whereas Finnish assemblages presented a hierarchical continuum based on species addition. Data suggest that habitat specialization and the exclusion of small prey species from lakes with piscivores contribute to the occurrence of presence-absence assemblage types in Wisconsin. Biotic interactions can affect population densities of Finnish species without exclusion, and assemblage types could be identified in Finland only on the basis of species' relative abundance. Because of similar relations, discriminant functions from one region could successfully identify the assemblage types that occurred in lakes from the other; this community-level predictability suggests that fish assemblage structures in northern forest lakes are influenced by common sets of environmental factors.

Examples of such traits may include the conspicuous male traits, or displays, that increase a male's mating success but decrease his viability. The authors consider the case of 2 viability classes controlled by a single haploid locus and a 2nd modifier locus, which modifies the expression of the trait in one or both of the viability classes. Variation at the viability-class locus is maintained by a balance between selection and a force, like mutation or migration, that restores the less fit class. As a result of the prior differences in viability and the effects of the trait, overall fitness in each viability class is maximized at different values (optima) of the trait. In the absence of modifiers that can differentially express the trait in the different viability classes, the evolutionarily stable value of the trait is a compromise between the optimum values for the 2 fitness classes. Modifiers that can act independently on the trait in the 2 viability classes allow the trait to take on its optimum values in the 2 viability classes. Since the optimum of the trait for the high-viability class is greater than that for the low-viability class, evolutionary modification should allow such traits to be used as reliable indicators of genetic fitness. -from Authors",31,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,5,NA,NA

On a continental scale, the presence of C. mexicanus may have accelerated widespread declines in the density of P. domesticus in areas of sympatry, possibly because of the energetic demands of interference competition. The dissimilar behavior and foraging strategies of the competitors may permit coexistence in all habitats, such that the niche of P. domesticus is included in the niche of C. mexicanus.

These latter results are consistent with the PTM, but they are also consistent with an alternative model based on the asynchronous settlement of harem females. Settlement of female marsh wrens in the same territory is asynchronous. In addition, nestling weight at 8 days correlates positively with the number of days between females. Staggered settlement reduces the overlap in nestling stages and presumably reduces competition for male help and food in the territory.

An implication of this cycling is that the ratio of elements released by the herbivore is a ""supply ratio' as defined in resource-competition theory. Three alternative models (a constant, mass-specific basal metabolic release of N and P; a constant efficiency of accumulating N and P in grazer biomass; and an adjusting efficiency of N and P accumulation that maintains a homeostatic ratio of N to P (N:P) in the bodies of the grazers) all predict a positive correlation between the N:P in the algal pool and that released by the animals. Data provide strong supportive evidence for this relationship. The model of basal metabolism is rendered unrealistic by a lack of relationship between the N:P released by grazers and that in the zooplankton pool. The other 2 models differ only in whether grazers maintain a homeostasis of the N:P in their bodies. Data indicate that homeostasis of the N:P is a reasonable constraint but that homeostasis is not strict. Constant accumulation predicts a direct proportionality between the N:P released and the N:P in the algal pool. Homeostasis predicts a curvilinearity in this relationship, such that imbalances of the N:P in the food compared with that in the zooplankton are accentuated. Comparison of the N:P released calculated from alternatives 2 and 3 with measured values showed good agreement with both models, but especially for the homeostatic one. Homeostatic grazers appear to establish an unstable equilibrium in the N:P in the algal pool and thus, presumably, in the nutrient-limitation patterns of the algae. Whichever element appears in the food in low relative proportion will be recycled by the grazer with relatively low efficiency. The model of strict homeostasis thus predicts a role for grazers not predicted by other theoretical approaches: grazers cause the nutrient-limitation patterns of their algal prey to diverge. -from Author",303,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,12,NA,NA

This paper emphasizes natural selection acting directly on females and their offspring. Although females are expected to pay lower costs in noneconomic mating systems, this need not translate into examining fewer males or spending less time in this activity. Furthermore, various direct (nongenetic) benefits may accrue. In species in which males offer benefits that are more variable, such as territories or parental care, females should evolve toward greater investment in mate choice, especially when these resources cannot be shared among females. Any tendency for females to be more selective in noneconomic mating systems, despite lower benefits, can probably be explained if the much lower costs of search, and thus net benefits, are considered.

In katydids, males and females invest parentally by providing material investment to eggs, with the male donation derived from spermatophore materials eaten by the female. There is intraspecific variation in sexual selection acting on females; only certain populations show a courtship role reversal in which females compete for access to males. Male and female katydids were maintained on diets that differed in food quality. Both sexes were given daily access to sexually receptive members of the opposite sex. As predicted, males on a low-quality diet mated less frequently than males on a high-quality diet. Females on a low-quality diet, however, increased mating frequency, apparently to obtain additional spermatophore nutrients. Data suggest that male parental investment in the spermatophore increases in its relative importance when diet is low in quality. The effects of diet on mating frequency result in different estimates of the operational sex ratio, which accord with observations in nature: for the high-quality diet, there are fewer fertilizable females than sexually active males; similar conditions in nature would be predicted to result in a male-to-male competitive (polygynous) mating system.

Palatable butterflies were active (and were captured) toward late morning, during sunny weather, and in open microhabitats; unpalatable butterflies were not so constrained and were captured more evenly across time and microhabitat categories. Within the same microhabitat, palatable butterflies have a higher mean thermal excess than unpalatble species. The higher thermal excess of palatable species could result from 1) greater net influx of radiative energy, 2) greater production of metabolic heat or 3) lower conductive and convective heat loss. The ambient radiation in which the butterflies are active tends to be maximum when and where the palatable species are active. Palatable butterflies tend to fly more quickly and erratically (which may mean that they require more metabolic energy to fly the same distance than do unpalatable ones) but may suffer greater convective heat loss. They also posses wider thoraxes, which may retain more metabolic heat.

For self-incompatible plants, the evolutionarily stable inflorescence size-number combination is determined by the functional relationship between the resources available for flower production, seed set per flower, pollen contribution per flower, and the inflorescence size-number combination. Factors promoting the evolution of many small inflorescences per plant include fixed costs per inflorescence that accelerate with inflorescence size, sectorial transport of resources within the shoot system, and seed set and/or pollen contribution per flower that decreases with inflorescence size. Factors promoting the evolution of one large inflorescence per plant include free intraplant transport of resources, fixed costs per inflorescence that decelerate with inflorescence size, and seed set and/or pollen contribution per flower that increases with inflorescence size. Intermediate inflorescence size-number combinations can occur in a wide variety of situations in which resources available for flower production, seed set, and pollen contribution do not all change in the same direction with inflorescence size or in which one or more of these fitness components is maximized in intermediate-sized inflorescences. The local stability of many of these strategies is determined by the shapes of the relationships between the fitness components and the inflorescence size-number combination. For self-compatible plants, the relationship between self-fertilization rate and inflorescence size and the magnitude of inbreeding depression are additional factors that can influence the evolution of inflorescence size and number.

Tests of the model with data from forest yield tables indicate that 1) average-sized trees of even-aged stands follow the predicted ESS until reaching at least 70-90% of their maximum height; 2) trees that are larger than average have thicker-than-expected trunks to withstand disproportionately greater wind forces in the upper canopy; 3) height growth may cease in very old stands, as predicted; and 4) height growth appears to cease gradually rather than suddenly.

Departures from equilibrium are hypothesized to reduce interspecific competition and facilitate coexistence. When competition between 2 algae for one resource is modeled using Monod equations, the species that wins at equilibrium does not usually win when recources are supplied as periodic pulse, if the second competitor has the higher maximal growth rate. For model parameters typical of N and P limitation, this selection for species with high maximal growth rates is strong. Theory suggests 2 reasons to doubt that selection for species with high maximal growth rates occurs by this mechanism in nature. 1) When variability in resource supply occurs as sinusoidal fluctuations, rather than as pulses, selection for species with high maximal growth rates is weak. 2) When intracellular storage of resources occurs, selection for species with high maximal growth rates is also weak. Under either of these conditions, it is common for algae that are superior competitors at equilibrium to be superior competitors under nonequilibrium conditions also. Under all conditions, tested, coexistence of 2 competitors on one resource is less common than competitive exclusion.

Dorward's (1962) insurance-egg hypothesis explains the production of a 2nd egg as insurance against the 1st egg's failure. The insurance-egg hypothesis predicts that, if a 2nd egg sometimes produces a fledgling after a 1st egg fails, then the evolution of insurance-egg production in single-chick species is governed by the ratio of the benefit of the increased probability of producing a hatchling to the cost of egg production. In the obligately siblicidal masked booby Sula dactylatra, 2nd eggs contribute a surviving hatchling after the 1st egg's failure in 19.2% of 2-egg clutches. The primary source of hatching failure was exceptionally high infertility or early embryonic death. Not all single-chick booby species produce insurance eggs, however, and the prediction of the insurance-egg hypothesis that the occurrence of insurance eggs is associated with the high benefit-to-cost ratio was supported by a compilation of booby breeding parameters. Because females make similar relative investments in each egg, the cost of insurance eggs is assumed to be constant across species, but benefits differ: hatching success in obligately siblicidal species ranges from 51-61%, whereas that in single-egg species is at least 85%. -from Author",89,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,54,NA,NA

The 2 species were in competition when raised together. Notophthalmus reduced the density of Bufo and caused the survivors to metamorphose early and at a small size. Anax caused an even greater reduction in survival but not as strong an acceleration of metamorphosis. Newts also reduced the density of Rana, but survivors benefited by growing rapidly. The effects of Anax were even stronger: the only Rana tadpoles that were able to metamorphose in the 2 mo of the experiment were from ponds in which Anax reduced densities enough to permit rapid growth of the surviving tadpoles. In systems with 1 predator and 2 prey, the anurans shared the risk of predation and were mutualists rather than competitors. In systems with 2 predators and 1 prey, the risks of predation were additive. In systems with all 4 species, risks were again spread over both anurans, making them mutualists. One- and 2-species systems predicted low and nearly equal survival of the two prey at the end of the experiment (4% for Bufo and 7% for Rana). The observed survival in the 4-species systems was 35% for Bufo and 59% for Rana. -from Authors",189,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,63,NA,NA

Thus, worker genotypes that adopt low work loads are expected to accumulate during colony growth at the expense of hard-working types if both occur in the same colony. When mature colony size is reached, this accumulation could, through nepotism, bias the production of sexuals toward the accumulated genotypes. A formal model shows that a gene coding for low levels of work load could indeed spread in a population of hard-working colonies, if colony workers are not always full sibs, that is, with polygyny or polyandry. The work load that is evolutionarily insensitive to slightly deviating mutants is predicted to decrease with the degree of polygyny (number of egg-laying queens), with polyandry (number of males contributing sperm), and with an increase in the degree of nepotism. Work load should also vary with ecological variables, such as the length of the colony's growth period before reproduction. To evaluate this hypothesis, several measures for work load (inactivity, self-grooming, brood care, risky tasks) are compared across species of ants.

Sexual differences in mean adult size are determined by processes operating on juveniles: sex differences either in growth rate or in the age at maturation, 2) Mean adult SSD is determined mainly by sex differences in growth or survival rates during adult life.

The particular outcome depends on 4 main factors: 1) the finite rate of increase of the host, 2) the clumping of parasitoid (and pathogen) attacks, 3) the relative extrinsic potentials of competitors, and 4) the relative intrinsic potentials of the competitors. Although situations may arise in which the host is best controlled by only one natural enemy, multiple introductions are likely to be a sound strategy for a wide variety of systems. -from Authors",72,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,85,NA,NA

The need to balance these conflicting demands plays a role in ontogenetic habitat shifts, including the spectacular shifts characteristic of complex life cycles. Previous theory has led to rules that are independent of time to predict the size at which habitat shifts take place. The authors develop a model that incorporates time constraints, but assuming that reproduction or some other major event, such as diapause or metamorphosis, must occur by a specified time or date; and incorporate recent formulations of dynamic programming that allow strategies to balance conflicting behaviors by expressing them in the common currency of future reproductive output. The resulting theory predicts optimal strategies for pre-reproductive output. The resulting theory predicts optimal strategies for pre-reproductive habitat shifts that depend on both time and body weight. -from Authors",224,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,86,NA,NA

If male and female relatednesses and male immigration rate are independent of patch density, then the model predicts that the mean number of non-dispersers per unit of reproductive resource remains constant among patches. Experimental data from the colonial, wing-polymorphic thrips Hoplothrips karnyi support this prediction of the ""constant-non-disperser' principle. -Authors",50,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,87,NA,NA

Damage to young fruits by genetic defects, by insects, or by climatic factors is probably an important factor that increases the optimal number of female flowers and decreases the fruits-to-flowers ratio. This includes parental selection for seed or fruit equality. Short-term increases in either pollination probability or resource levels do not increase fruit production by plants that had reached an evolutionary equilibrium under constant conditions. Random variation in pollination level, young-fruit survival, or resource level can cause a significant increase in the number of female flowers and a decrease in the fruits-to-flowers ratio, especially when the cost of flowers or young fruits is low relative to that of mature fruits. The evolutionarily stable sex ratio in most plants selects for a high number of functionally male flowers. The cost of adding female reproductive organs to male flowers to produce bisexual flowers is considerably less than the cost of producing female flowers. This lower cost may provide the selective advantage that explains the prevalence of plants with bisexual flowers. -Authors",48,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,88,NA,NA

Discriminant analysis showed that the distribution of North American plant formations was more highly correlated with water balance (actual evapotranspiration and deficit) than with the more traditional measures of climate (eg temperature and precipitation). Much of the improved correlation could be attributed to the ability of the water balance to distinguish between climates similar in mean annual energy and water supplies but different in the seasonal timing of the two. Consideration of the water balance aided in the interpretation of possible mechanisms controlling the distribution of plant formations, eg coniferous forest occurred at low actual evapotranspiration (low simultaneous availability of energy and water), consistent with the suggestion that conifers are better adapted than deciduous trees to environments with a low potential for primary production. Implications for vegetation response to climatic change are noted. -from Author",554,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,89,NA,NA

The use of language differences as a variable concomitant to gene frequencies allows inferences about past processes - despite the complex relationship between language and genetics in populations. Seven methods that test varying aspects of this relationship show genetic differences among speakers of different language families in Europe, in addition to differences among the populations due to geographic differentiation. A model, based on the known history of each language-family boundary, was constructed to predict the likelihood of genetic differences at the boundaries. The genetic-linguistic patterns observed in Europe are consistent with the combined operation of spatial differentiation and aboriginal genetic differences among speakers of different languages before they moved to their present locations on the continent. -from Authors",47,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,90,NA,NA
