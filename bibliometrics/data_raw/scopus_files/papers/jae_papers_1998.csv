Maternal and birth colony effects on offspring survival to weaning and to reproductive age were examined for Weddell seals using mark-recapture models and over 25 years of mark-resight data from McMurdo Sound, Antarctica. 2. Pre-weaning mortality (proportion of the total pups found dead on the ice surface) varied significantly with maternal age and was significantly higher for primiparous mothers than for multiparous mothers. 3. Offspring survival to reproductive age also increased significantly with maternal age and experience. Survival of offspring from birth to 6 years of age increased significantly with maternal body length only for male offspring. 4. Increased survivorship of offspring with maternal age was only evident for offspring of multiparous (rather than primiparous) mothers. This suggests that the age when mothers have their first pup may not affect survival of offspring, although lack of effect of age on offspring survival for primiparous mothers may be due to insufficient variation in age of first reproduction in our sample for us to detect a trend. 5. Pre-weaning survival of offspring also varied significantly among pupping colonies. In 1983, a year of low reproduction and low first-year survival for the McMurdo population (Testa 1987b; Hastings 1996), first-year survival was lower for offspring born in Outer Erebus Bay (west of 166·7°E) than for offspring born in Inner Erebus Bay (east of 166·7°E). 6. Maternal effects on offspring survival may be related to quality of breeding site. Maternal age and experience varied significantly among pupping colonies. That pup population size was stable at all colonies over the study period suggests non-random age-distribution of mothers may not be an artefact of population growth, but instead result from intraspecific competition for space in good pupping colonies. 7. Offspring survival, pup population size, and mean maternal age at colonies were significantly positively correlated. This suggests that favourable environmental conditions and high maternal or paternal quality may interact to enhance survival of offspring at larger colonies.",44,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Birth colony | Leptonychotes weddellii | Maternal effects | Offspring survival | Pinnipeds,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Nitrogen-containing nutrients have long been considered a frequently limiting resource to the growth of herbivore populations (nitrogen limitation hypothesis). To explore this hypothesis, we examined the relationships between availability of essential amino acids and concentrations of phenolics in the diets of hispid cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) in central Oklahoma and the intrinsic characteristics of their non-cyclic populations. We posited that lower quality proteins (i.e. essential amino acid composition) and elevated phenolic levels (protein digestion inhibitors) in diets of cotton rats from low-compared to high-density populations, especially during the breeding season, would be supportive of the nitrogen limitation hypothesis. Replicated low- and high-density populations were censured by live-trapping at 3-month intervals. Samples of stomach digesta were collected from cotton rats in similar habitats adjacent to trapping grids to determine the botanical and nutrient composition of their diets. 2. During the breeding season, concentrations of essential amino acids were as much as 43% greater in diets of cotton rats from high-density populations. Dicots, typically higher in protein than monocots, were an important component of diets and were preferred forage in all seasonal collections. Seeds and arthropods were frequently utilized by cotton rats as additional high-quality sources of essential amino acids. Concentrations of total phenolics in the diet (greater in diets from low-density populations) were consistent with the nitrogen limitation hypothesis. 3. Density was consistently higher in the high-density populations throughout the study. Other demographic and body condition parameters were similar between low and high-density populations in the non-breeding season, but reproductive activity was greater in high-density populations during the breeding season. Total number of juveniles recruited into the trappable population over the entire study was about five times greater in high- compared low-density populations. 4. Our data did not refute the nitrogen limitation hypothesis where levels of essential amino acids and phenolic compounds in the diet during the breeding season may determine annual peak densities of cotton rats that can be supported in their habitat. However, we could not rule out the involvement of other environmental variables such as overhead cover (as well as other unmeasured variables) as contributing factors to determining annual peak densities.",29,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Amino acids | Cotton rat | Food quality | Herbivore nutrition | Nitrogen limitation | Phenolics | Population dynamics | Sigmodon hispidus,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,2,all,All Open Access

For a full assessment of explanations for the evolution of host-specificity it is necessary to estimate the probability that a dispersing parasite finds a host. We develop a method of estimating this success rate from samples of dispersing parasites and populations resident on hosts. 2. Applying this method to data on the bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), from southern Scotland in 1984-92, we estimate that 0.6% of the autumn migrants find hosts. 3. With such a low success rate, there should be selection for a broadening of host range, to include any host on which the colonist's fitness is more than about 0.6% of that on the normal hosts. We argue that neither nutrition nor the need for 'enemy-free space' are sufficient explanations of the host-specificity of this animal, and propose instead that it is the host's role as a rendezvous for mating that constrains the migrants to their costly host-specificity. 4.

The population dynamics of an introduced population of Epilachna niponica (Lewis) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) was investigated for a 7-year period following its introduction to a site outside of its natural range. A population from Asiu Experimental Forest was introduced to Kyoto University Botanical Garden, 10 km south of its natural distribution. 2. Arhropod predation was much lower in the introduced than in the source population. As a result of the lower predation in the Botanical Garden, larvae reached densities five times higher than in the Asiu Forest and host plants were frequently defoliated. Food shortage caused larval deaths from starvation and increased dispersal. 3. The density of the introduced population was much more variable than that of the source population. The variation in population density in both the introduced and source populations is limited by density-dependent reduction in fecundity and female survival. However, variation in the introduced population's density was increased due to host plant defoliation that resulted in overcompensating density-dependent mortality. In years with high larval density plants were defoliated and this increased adult mortality during the prehibernation period. Besides, the density-dependent regulatory mechanisms that produce population stability were weaker in the introduced population than in the source population.",14,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Epilachna niponica | Host plant defoliation | Introduction experiment | Natural enemies | Population dynamics,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,4,all,All Open Access

The aerial distribution of Bemisia tabaci Gennadius (the sweetpotato whitefly) was studied during the early ascent phase of flight, to test the degree to which dispersal patterns reflect the flight behaviour of individuals. 2. Marked whiteflies were trapped at four heights between 0 and 7.2 m above fallow ground, and at six distances between 0 and 100 m from the insect source. Insects were trapped during a 2-3 h period after the initiation of flight activity during the summers of 1995 and 1996. 3. Analysis of trap catch data revealed a clear negative exponential relationship between height and aerial distribution, and a slightly weaker negative power relationship between distance and aerial distribution. Marked insects were caught in the uppermost traps adjacent to the source, indicating that a portion of the population had a strong capacity for ascent out of the flight boundary layer. 4. Eggload decreased with the height, but not the distance, at which whiteflies were trapped. Mean eggload close to the ground was significantly greater than that for those trapped at 4.8 and 7.2m, supporting the hypothesis that there is a trade-off between flight and oogenesis in weak-flying insects. 5. Air temperatures during the trapping periods were positively correlated with the proportion of male and female B. tabaci caught in the highest traps, but not in the most distant traps. 6.

The distribution of brown bears (Ursus arctos L.) expanding into suitable habitat in Sweden following near extermination was estimated using harvest data from the period 1981-93. Core areas were defined as female concentration areas, where 90% of the hunter-killed females were taken. 2. Three predictions were tested, based on results of earlier bear dispersal studies, which show that females are extremely philopatric. Prediction 1: the relative density of females declines more rapidly from the centre of a core area towards the edge than for males. Prediction 2: males dominate in the peripheral areas, especially males in the age of most active dispersal (2-4 years of age). Prediction 3: females in the periphery are found closer to the edge of the core area than males. 3. The results of the present study supported Predictions 1 and 2, but not Prediction 3. This indicates that males were more prone to disperse from the core areas than females. However, females that did disperse did not differ from males in distance from the core areas, and females were found up to 80-90km from them. Such long-distance female dispersal has apparently not been previously documented in other bear populations that are stable or declining. The results strongly suggest that presaturation dispersal, i.e. dispersal occurring before the carrying capacity of the habitat has been reached, is occurring in this increasing population. This phenomenon might be more common in increasing populations of large mammals than was previously thought. Regarding conservation of bears, this result is positive for gene flow and metapopulation dynamics and negative for livestock losses in formerly bear-free areas. 4. Core and peripheral areas can be identified based on the age and sex of shot bears. This allowed us to rashly Norway as a peripheral area.

In many groups of species, range size and population density are positively correlated (the 'distribution-abundance relationship) and range size is positively correlated with latitude ('Rapoport's Rule'). This study investigated these two relationships among Australian forest mammals, and also tested for the existence of a relationship between population density and latitude in the same fauna. 2. All three relationships were significant, with the distribution-abundance relationship the strongest pattern of the three, and Rapoport's Rule the weakest. Partial correlation analysis showed that: (i) range size and population density remained positively correlated when latitude was held constant; and (ii) population density and latitude remained positively correlated when range size was held constant; but (iii) latitude and range size were not significantly correlated when population density was held constant. For (i) and (ii), partial correlation did not reveal stronger relationships than were revealed by simple correlation. These results suggest that the distribution-abundance relationship is conditioned by latitude to produce small ranges and low population densities in the tropics, and that tropical species tend to have low population densities relative to range size. 3. Body mass accounted for little variation in population density, and for no variation in range size and latitudinal position. The small ranges and low population densities of tropical species were not related to a latitudinal gradient in species richness, which did not occur in this fauna. 4. The latitudinal gradient in population density held within widespread species as well as among species. The effect of Bergmann's Rule (the tendency for organisms in cool environments to be larger bodied than organisms in warm environments) meant that in some species, population energy use rose more steeply with latitude than did population density. 5. I argue that all three relationships might be due to a tendency for the foraging efficiency of animals to be lower in tropical than in temperate ecosystems, as a result of a lower concentration of nutrients in tropical ecosystems. For resource-limited species, foraging efficiency should influence both range size and population density. Differences in foraging efficiency may therefore produce the distribution-abundance relationship as well as latitudinal gradients in range size and population density.",52,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Distribution-abundance relationship | Marsupials | Rapoport's Rule | Rodents | Species richness,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,7,NA,NA

Density-dependent factors appeared important for the survival of juvenile Atlantic salmon in the River Imsa whilst density-independent factors were more important for the older fish at sea. In fresh water, density dependence was indicated by a stock-recruitment relationship with increasing loss-rates from eggs to smolts and from eggs to adults as egg density increased. 73% of the loss-rates were explained by variation in egg density. At sea, density independence was indicated by the lack of a significant relationship between loss-rates and smolt densities. 2. The relationship between smolt density and initial egg density was best described by an asymptotic 'Cushing' type relationship with a plateau at densities higher than approximately 60 000 eggs for the total fiver areas of 10 000 m2. The number of smolts developed from the eggs spawned varied between 350 and 2400. 3. The relationship between smolt biomass in wet mass (kg 10 000 m-2) or energy (kJ 10 000 m-2) and the amount of salmon eggs in the River Imsa increased asymptotically. Annual smolt biomass ranged from 13 to 88 kg 10 000 m-2, or 66 000 and 431 000 kJ 10 000m-2. Variation in egg density accounted for approximately 45% of the variation in smolt biomass (mass or energy). 4. Total wet mass and energy of adults (kg 10 000 m-2 and kJ 10 000 m-2) produced in relation to the amount of eggs at the start of the year-class, were not significantly correlated, due to a high variation among years.

Under these conditions RMA gives slope estimatess which are consistently closer to the true slopes than OLS regression. 3. The triangular relationships reported by some workers are found over smaller mass and abundance ranges than linear relations. Scatter in slope estimates is much greater and positive slopes more common at small sample sizes and sample ranges. These results support the notion that inadequate and truncated sampling is responsible for much of the disagreement reported in the literature. 4.

We tested for costs of chick rearing in the black-legged kittiwake Rissa tridactyla (Linnaeus) by removing entire clutches from 149 of 405 randomly selected nests, in which one or both mates was colour-banded. After the manipulation, we monitored adult nest attendance and body condition at unmanipulated and manipulated nests, and measured the survival and fecundity of these adults the following year. 2. Late in the chick-rearing period, adults from unmanipulated nests (i.e. with chicks) went on significantly longer foraging trips, and were significantly lighter for their size, than adults from manipulated nests (i.e. without chicks). 3. Adults from unmanipulated nests also survived to the following nesting season at a significantly lower rate than those from the manipulated nests (0.898 vs. 0.953), suggesting that attempting to raise chicks can reduce life expectancy by 55%. 4. There was a tendency for adults from nests that were unmanipulated in year one to have lower reproductive success in year two, primarily because of reduced fledging success, and a higher incidence of non-breeding. 5. These findings suggest that mass loss in kittiwakes during chick rearing may not be adaptive. Raising chicks can lead to reproductive costs, and the causal mechanism appears to be a reduction in body condition. 6. We compare our results with previous brood (or clutch) size manipulation experiments that have measured adult body condition, survival and/or future fecundity. Although the empirical evidence suggests that long-lived species are more likely to experience survival costs than short-lived species, we believe the opposite may be true. We suggest that shifting the experimental protocol of cost of reproduction studies from brood enlargements (an approach taken in most prior studies) to brood reductions will provide more accurate quantifications of naturally occurring costs. 7. The cost of reproduction is one mechanism proposed to explain the reduced survival rates reported for kittiwake populations in the North Atlantic relative to those in the North Pacific ocean.

Two hypotheses may explain how long-lived seabirds regulate the food provisioning to their chick. The fixed level of investment hypothesis states that the parents provide food for their chick according to an intrinsic rhythm, independent of their chick's need. The flexible investment hypothesis states that the parents adjust their food provisioning both according to their chick's and their own need. 2. We tested how the Antarctic petrels adjust the food-provisioning according to their own body condition or to their chick's need. First, we selected parents in poor and good body condition. Then we gave all parents randomly a chick of different body mass, but of the same age. We then measured the chicks daily until they were fed for the first time after swapping. 3. Parents in good body condition at hatching were more likely to produce a chick that was still alive 9 days after hatching than parents in poor body condition. Chick body mass at day 9 and at the end of the guarding period was positively related to the mean body condition of the parents at hatching. 4.

Parents in good body condition delivered more food to small than to large chicks, whereas no such relationship was found among parents in poor body condition. 5.

We analysed the foraging behaviour of two closely related parasitoid species (Cotesia rubecula and Cotesia glomerata) with respect to leaving tendencies from patches in different environments. We investigated how intrapatch experiences like contact with feeding damage and encounters with hosts influence patch leaving decisions. We also estimated the effect of experiences in previously visited patches on leaving decisions in the present patch. 2. For this analysis we applied the proportional hazards model (Cox 1972) to data collected in three versions of a multiple patch set-up. These set-ups consisted of different host species or combinations of host species: (1) Pieris rapae, (2) Pieris brassicae and (3) both P. rapae and P. brassicae. The larvae of these hosts differ in their spatial distribution on plants: P. brassicae occur in clusters and the distribution of larvae is heterogeneous; P. rapae larvae fed solitarily. 3. The specialist parasitoid C. rubecula used a simple strategy: highest leaving tendency on empty leaves, lower leaving tendency on leaves infested with the non-preferred host P. brassicae, lowest leaving tendency on leaves infested with the preferred host, P. rapae. In the environment with both host species, the leaving tendency only decreased on leaves infested with P. rapae. 4. The generalist C. glomerata used a more complex set of rules. (a) Multiple ovipositions on the present path decreased the leaving tendency on leaves containing the gregarious host. (b) Once the parasitoid had encountered two or more hosts, it had a lower leaving tendency during subsequent patch visits. (c) The leaving tendency increased with the number of visits on infested leaves. In environments where the less preferred host P. rapae was present, C. glomerata switched to the same simple type of rule as used by C. rubecula. 5.

We tested a set of hypotheses to predict egg-laying behaviour in Aedes triseriatus in the field in Massachusetts. These hypotheses reflect three main themes: females avoid competitive or predatory threats to their larvae; females judge larvae or eggs as cues to future permanence or productivity within a treehole; and females are either opportunistic ovipositors, or hedge their bets by scattering their eggs in multiple habitats. We predicted that mosquitoes might vary in their response depending on whether their offspring will hatch immediately or enter diapause and hatch the next year. 2. We stocked artificial treeholes with larvae at four densities ranging from 0 to 90 larvae per habitat for four trials in 1992 and eight trials in 1994. In 1992, we added predatory Anopheles barberi larvae to half the replicates of each density level. In 1994, we tested for an interaction between egg and larval density by stocking additional traps with eggs in batches of 0, 20 and 200, and larvae in densities as in the previous trials. 3. The population revealed a significant interaction between time of year and larval density. More eggs accumulated in traps stocked with fewer larvae (0 or 15) early in the season, but females showed a slight positive response to higher densities (45 or 90) later on, after their offspring were all likely to enter diapause. These results suggest that potential ambiguities of larval cues, with indications of habitat permanence as well as adversity of future competition, are resolved by females. Females did not respond differentially to the predatory Anopheles barberi larvae. 4. The estimated batch size obtained in oviposition traps did not differ from the fecundity of field-caught females allowed to oviposit under confinement in laboratory vials, suggesting that bet-hedging by scattering of eggs among multiple habitats did not occur. 5. An unexpected result, a positive response to higher egg densities, is discussed in light of studies on other insects. This result conflicts with our predictions based on females choosing less competitive environments for their larvae and also conflicts with previously published accounts of avoidance of eggs in this species. Preference for habitats with conspecific eggs might be explained if eggs reflect habitat stability or if larvae gain an advantage from being in an aggregation. Neither hypothesis is resolved by the present study.",73,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Aedes | Competition | Density-dependent | Habitat selection | Oviposition,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,14,all,All Open Access

Interactions between aphids and ants are considered to be mutualistic, with both partners benefiting. Costs associated with such interactions are likely to be less obvious, although they can be expected, especially if these associations are facultative. 2. It is demonstrated here that there are costs in several life-history parameters to individual aphids resulting from ant attendance. Over several generations Aphis fabae cirsiiacanthoides feeding on Cirsium arvense, at a range of developmental stages, suffered significant costs when tended by Lasius niger, e.g. in terms of a prolonged developmental time, delayed offspring production, proportionally smaller gonads, fewer well developed embryos and a reduced mean relative growth rate. These effects are similar to those observed when aphids feed on poor quality plants. 3. This is the first indication that there is a cost for aphids associated with ant attendance.

The extent to which environmental heterogeneity interacts with genetic heterogeneity to affect individual fitness within populations has the potential to affect the dynamics of natural populations and the amount of genetic variation maintained in natural populations, yet is a relatively poorly investigated topic in either ecology or evolutionary biology. 2. Many individual-based studies are precluded from such investigations by the practical problems of measuring heritability of traits affecting fitness and the difficulties of experimental manipulation of the study population. One way of demonstrating how commonly genotype by environmental interactions affect fitness, though not their overall importance in determining fitness, is to investigate fitness in a population subdivided by genotype at one or more marker loci. 3. We analyse data on calf winter survival from a population of red deer from the Isle of Rum, Scotland. Data on individual survival, environmental fluctuations and genotype at 13 loci were collected from 1982 to 1994. 4. We found associations between survival over the first winter of life and calf genotype at two out of three allozyme loci and five out of 10 microsatellite loci. All of the results remained significant under randomization tests. Other genotypes that initially appeared to have an association with survival were rejected when bootstrapped, usually due to insufficient data or anomalies in the data. 5. Our results suggest that associations between fitness and genotype are common. Five out of the seven associations found involved interactions with environmental variables. Four of these showed density-dependent selection with different genotypes showing high survival at high population size compared to low population size and one interacted with autumn rainfall.

We tested for effects of habitat fragmentation in a controlled, replicated, field experiment, in south-eastern Australia. Our experimental subjects were eight carabid beetle species, and the carabid assemblage (45 species). Monitoring was by pitfall trapping in forest remnants and in adjacent continuous-forest controls. Remnants were of three sizes (0-25, 0-875, 3-062 ha.). Monitoring commenced 2 years prior to habitat fragmentation. Here we present results for 6 years after habitat fragmentation (4 years for species richness). 2. We tested four hypotheses. Hypothesis one: habitat fragmentation reduces species richness in the remaining remnants. Carabid species richness was not different in habitat remnants compared to continuous forest, neither was carabid richness different for remnants of different sizes, or at monitoring sites close to remnant edges compared to sites in remnant interiors. 3. Hypothesis two: populations decline as a result of habitat fragmentation. Two species of eight were completely isolated on remnants and both declined in abundance on remnants compared to control plots in continuous forest. The other six species responded in various ways, which included relative increases and decreases in abundance and no change, but as they were not completely isolated on remnants, their responses could not be explained by isolation. 4. Hypothesis three: remaining subpopulations decline further on smaller habitat remnants than on larger remnants. Three species responded to remnant size; one was most abundant in small remnants, the second was most abundant in large remnants, and the third was equally abundant in small and large remnants and less abundant in medium-sized remnants. 5. Hypothesis four: populations near to remnant edges decline further than populations in remnant interiors. Two species were more likely to occur in remnant interiors than at edges, whereas three species were equally likely to occur in remnant interiors and at edges. 6. The effects of habitat fragmentation may be the consequence of: (i) isolation; and (ii) habitat modification. In this study, we were able to consider effects of isolation for two carabid species.

In the last two decades predator - prey models have shown that 'refuges', in which prey can seek respite from predation, are crucial for the persistence of prey and predator. This concept is equally applicable to interspecific competition and, in a heterogeneous environment, species with low competitive ability should seek out 'competition refuges' where competition is reduced. 2. Cheetahs have low competitive ability compared with their principal competitors, hyenas and lions, which are directly responsible for their low density. This study uses distribution data collected in the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania over a 4-year period to show that cheetahs are more strongly associated with each other than with their competitors and utilize areas with low-density prey. 3. Cheetahs exhibit local avoidance behaviour in both space and time with respect to lions and hyenas. This behaviour is facultative and is strongest when cheetahs are engaged in activities that might expose them to food loss or increase the risk of close interactions, such as when they are hunting or eating. 4. Lactating cheetahs, whose range is restricted, are more likely to have difficulties finding prey and come into more frequent contact with lions than free-ranging animals. 5. It is argued that although cheetahs always lose in direct competition, they persist in the ecosystem by seeking out 'competition refuges' with low densities of lions and hyenas and that their mobility is the key to their continued coexistence with these predators. This pattern of distribution may be generally applicable to other species which, although widely distributed, always occur at low densities.",283,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Cheetahs | Migration | Predator avoidance | Rarity | Spatial heterogeneity,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,19,NA,NA

Theoretical studies of the costs and benefits of migration predict that evolutionary changes in dispersal traits may take place in response to habitat fragmentation. 2. For the butterfly Plebejus argus, we investigated five morphological characters potentially associated with flight ability, in locations that varied in level of habitat fragmentation. The traits were: total mass, relative thorax mass (containing flight muscle), relative abdomen mass (containing reproductive organs), relative wing area and wing aspect ratio. All characters were measured on individuals reared in a common environment. 3. Morphology was related to the level of habitat fragmentation in both limestone and heathland habitats. Total mass increased with decreasing heathland habitat area (over the range 13000-10 ha). Relative allocation to the thorax increased, while allocation to the abdomen decreased, with declining limestone habitat area (over the range 3.5-0.2 ha). Morphological characters were not significantly correlated with habitat isolation. 4. Significant family effects for total mass, relative thorax mass, relative abdomen mass and (for females only) relative wing area indicate that these traits may have a heritable component, and therefore have the potential to respond to selection acting on flight ability. 5. We suggest that evolutionary changes in life history traits are taking place in response to changes in landscape structure: in P. argus, these traits may be influenced by the effects of mate-location strategy on emigration rates. Specific changes in traits can be complex, and may vary among species and populations. 6. P. argus had a 50% chance of occurring in heathland fragments of 33 ha, and was present on all heathlands above 50 ha, but population systems may not yet have achieved equilibrium. P. argus is unlikely to undertake major evolutionary changes in response to reduced habitat area in heathlands > 50 ha. Extinctions from smaller heathlands can be explained most plausibly by population/vegetation dynamics. Therefore, evolutionary changes in morphology may be more likely to be symptomatic of populations with altered costs and benefits of migration, rather than to be a direct cause of extinction.",110,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Dispersal | Evolution | Metapopulation | Migration | Plebejus argus,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,20,all,All Open Access

Because different diversity gradients occur in the various subgroups of the Ichneumonidae, as well as among their hosts, general explanations are unlikely to account for this 'anomalous diversity.' Hypotheses of ecological causation are best tested at the taxonomic level where the pattern of interest applies. 3. Phylogenetic trends in the distribution, abundance, and palatability of butterflies (Papilionoidea), a group that increases dramatically in species richness towards the tropics, are presented as a case study for evaluating hypotheses of parasitoid species richness. Evidence is presented that supports the 'nasty host hypothesis' as an explanation for the lack of diversity of associated parasitoids. 4. An examination of hypotheses and the approaches used to test them suggests that the nasty-host hypothesis is best supported by the limited evidence available, while evidence in favour of other hypotheses is either lacking or ambiguous.

We describe the functional response of oystercatchers (Haematopus ostralegus L.) searching for cockles (Cerasloderma edule L.) by touch, using a multiple-prey version of the disc equation developed by Charnov (1976). 2. The model includes probabilistic time costs associated with the successful and unsuccessful handling of prey, seasonal changes in the flesh content of prey, and factors that affect prey availability. The encounter rate with cockles is estimated using a simple random search model. This model calculates the likelihood that a bird would locate a cockle buffed in the sand per unit of time spent searching, as a function of the touch area of buried cockles (the largest cross-sectional area of the shell enlarged by the surface area of the bill-tip) and the bird's probing rate. 3. Prey profitability increased with cockle size, and the model predicted birds should preferentially take cockles > 15 mm in length to maximize their rate of energy intake. The birds showed a systematic seasonal departure from the model's predictions. During late winter, the observed and predicted maximum intake rates for individual birds were comparable. However, the mean size of cockles observed being taken by the birds was consistent with the predicted mean size taken by a bird, including all size classes in its diet, rather than the predicted size for a bird taking only size classes > 15 mm (for a bird maximizing its intake rate). During early winter, observed intake rates were lower than predicted values for a bird feeding unselectively, suggesting birds either reduced their searching effort, preferentially ignored the larger, more profitable size classes, or experienced longer time costs. The lower than expected intake rates observed during early winter resulted from prey choice: birds preferentially ignored the larger, more profitable size classes. 4. Data presented in this paper suggest that birds attempting to maximize their intake rate incur significant costs, in addition to those associated with searching for and handling prey, which are included in the model. Such costs could include a risk of bill damage when attacking large cockles, an increased risk of parasitism associated with large cockles, or a mass-dependent metabolic or predation cost incurred by birds storing any excess ingested food in the form of fat. 5. A simple graphical model is presented to show how such costs, together with the need to achieve a given intake rate to avoid starvation, might interact to determine optimal intake rates. Within this framework, the maximum intake rate predicted by Charnov's model should be viewed as a means of describing the constraints on intake rates, rather than as an explicit optimality model. Depending on energy demands and the costs of maintaining a given intake rate, birds could experience a range of optimal intake rates, but only under certain conditions would the optimal intake rate be the maximum. This has implications for models of the dispersion of predators across a gradient of resource densities, and behaviour-based models of population dynamics, both of which implicitly assume that a predator would maximize its fitness by maximizing its rate of energy intake.",39,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Bivalve mollusc | Energy intake | Optimality model | Shorebird,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,22,all,All Open Access

The parasitism rates at the level of local populations showed a similar trend. 3 Hyposoter horticola females moved frequently among larval groups, whereas C. melitaearum females often spent several days at a single larval group. In agreement with these behavioural observations about movements within populations, H. horticola was found to have a higher colonization rate of host populations than C. melitaearum. 4. At the within-population level, C. melitaearum tended to occupy large larval groups in the centre of the host population, whereas H. horticola parasitized also small and more isolated (peripheral) larval groups, especially in the presence of C. melitaearum. At the metapopulation level, host population size had a significant positive effect on the presence of local populations of both parasitoid species, but isolation had a significant negative effect on the presence of C. melitaearum only. 5.

A seasonal reduction in water flow, due both to prevailing weather conditions and anthropogenic disturbance, is a prominent feature of the habitat in many riverine systems, yet the response of many aquatic vertebrates, such as juvenile Atlantic salmon, to low flows is not well understood. However, in accordance with general fitness optimization theory, it might be predicted that salmon will emigrate from shallow areas to seek refuge in pools as water levels decrease to critically low levels (fitness approaches zero). To test this prediction, we directly measured the movement response of individual Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) (74-109 mm) to drought in near-natural mesocosms. 2. In five separate trials during summer, groups of salmon were introduced into enclosed 30-m long sections of stream, each comprising a central 10-m long region of shallow riffle habitat bordered upstream and downstream by 10-m long regions of deeper water. After fish had settled into home ranges, those fish inhabiting deep areas were removed and the water flow was later decreased to zero over 2 days, so that the riffles were nearly dry. The movements of each individual fish within the enclosures were monitored remotely and continuously using a passive integrated transponder (PIT) tracking system. 3. Of the total of 33 fish with home ranges that included only riffle habitat, 14 moved into deep water at some point during drought, but only seven of these fish (0-50% between trials) established new home ranges that included deep areas. The others returned to regions of riffle during the drought. None of the eight fish that definitely had not sampled in pool habitat prior to settling on riffle emigrated during drought. 4. The optimal response of salmon parr to moderate natural drought appears not to be fixed, but for many individual fish it may be to stay in shallow riffle areas. The optimal response of salmon parr to extreme natural drought and anthropogenic dewatering will, in many cases, be to move. An increase within the population of traits that promote an ideal response to natural drought will therefore make it more vulnerable to severe drought and anthropogenic de-watering and vice versa. 5. The absence of emigration by salmon from shallow areas during acute drought can be reconciled with fitness optimization theory if, when natural drought progresses, fish become stranded in shallow areas some considerable time before the point at which they die.",47,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Adversity | Habitat manipulation | Ideal free distribution | Taylor Principle | Water flow,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,25,all,All Open Access

The population dynamic effects of refuges, which hosts enter and leave by diffusive movement, in host-parasitoid interactions are explored using simple models in continuous time. 2. This type of refuge has a stabilizing effect on a host-parasitoid interaction, which is contrary to the implications of some previous models. 3. Stability can be explained by considering how depletion processes lead to a refuge proportion (proportion of hosts protected at a given instant) that increases as parasitoid density increases. This effect is synonymous with pseudointerference in the context of the model. 4. Very high rates of movement of host larvae largely destroy this stability process. Stability is greatest at intermediate levels of movement. 5. Density-dependent host movement can alter the effect of these refuges such that they are either more stabilizing, or tend to destabilize, the dynamics of host-parasitoid systems, depending on the type of density dependence assumed. The conclusion that intermediate movement rates are likely to generate stability with this general type of refuge is not altered in the presence of any type of density dependence, unless the density dependence is at levels which we consider unrealistically high and unlikely to be encountered in nature. 6. It is the assumption that larvae do not move into the refuge prior to becoming vulnerable to parasitism that ensures top-down population control in the model. Thus, parasitoids attacking very early instars make good candidates for biological control when faced with a structural refuge.",25,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Continuous-time model | Host-parasitoid | Pseudointerference | Stability | Structural refuge,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,28,all,All Open Access

Reintroduction of plants and animals has become a common practice in the attempt to establish, re-establish or augment endangered populations. The fate of these translocation programmes is likely to depend, on the one hand, on several ecological attributes of the introduced species, on the other hand on introduction effort. 2. In a recent paper, Veltman, Nee and Crawley (1996) reported the correlates of introduction success of exotic birds released by humans in New Zealand before 1907: introduction effort (minimum number of release events and minimum number of released propagules) accounted for most of the variance in introduction success. 3. One of the factors potentially affecting the establishment of new populations concerns the intensity of sexual selection. Sexually selected species may be more vulnerable to extinction risks for several reasons (they may be more sensitive to both environmental and demographic stochasticity) and therefore have lower introduction success when compared to nonsexual selected species. 4. In the present study the data set reported by Veltman et al. (1996) was used to address the particular issue concerning sexual selection and introduction success. Each bird species was scored as monochromatic or dichromatic; plumage dichromatism is supposed to have evolved under sexual selection pressures. These scores were then correlated to the fate of introduction. 5. Plumage dichromatism was found to be, as expected, a significant predictor of introduction success, after removing the potential confounding effect of introduction effort. Dichromatic species had lower introduction success than monochromatic species. This pattern holds true for nonpasserines and passerines, although the correlation between plumage dichromatism and introduction success was not significant for the latter. 6. These results indicate that dichromatic species may experience reduced chances of establishing new populations when compared to monochromatic species. The presumed mechanisms involved in this phenomenon range from a reduced ability to adapt to a novel environment, to an increase in the risks of extinction through environmental and demographic stochasticity.",91,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Conservation | Extinction | Management | Sexual selection | Stochasticity,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,29,all,All Open Access

Unlike a neighbouring sea-trout population that showed strong density-dependent survival, a resident trout population (Salmo trutta L.) showed simple proportionate survival in the early life-stages. However, this persistent population fluctuated within narrow limits. Mature adults, especially during spawning, were the only possible life-stage left in which regulation might occur. 2. An October census, just prior to spawning, was made at five sites (total area 300 m2) from 1965 to 1983. Gravel nests (redds) associated with females of known size were excavated outside these sites to obtain a power-function relationship between egg density per redd and female length (range 181-280 mm, n = 26). This relationship and the census data for females (range 186-284 mm) were used to estimate egg densities in each year-class. 3. The census data for the early life-stages (0+, 1+, 2+ trout) confirmed proportionate survival with no evidence for density-dependent regulation. In contrast, the number of spawning females produced in each year-class was strongly density dependent on the initial number of females that laid eggs at the start of the year-class. Similarly, total egg production in each year-class was density dependent on initial egg density. 4 Both relationships were well described by the Ricker and Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment models (P < 0.001) and the goodness-of-fit was similar for both models.

Traits that benefit males through sexual selection are simultaneously expected to impair males by provoking costs through natural selection.

We studied the benefits and costs of male mate searching and sexual signalling activity in the wolf spider Hygrolycosa rubrofasciata. In the field, males search females actively and court them by drumming dry leaves with their abdomen. Females have been shown to prefer males with high drumming rate. Male moving and especially drumming is energetically highly demanding and drumming results in significant mortality costs. 3. Our objective in this study was to determine whether male mate-searching activity or drumming activity affect male mating success and the risk of males being predated. 4. It was evident that both higher mate-searching activity and higher drumming activity benefited males by increasing their mating success. Higher mate-searching activity clearly impaired males by causing direct increase in predation risk. There was also a slight tendency that more actively drumming males had higher risk of predation and from all of the predated males 13.3% were caught directly after they had drummed. Furthermore, male drumming activity decreased drastically in the presence of the predator. 5.

In the laboratory, fecundity, fat reserves and longevity without food were positively correlated with size. 3.

NDD was also studied in relation to ultimate factors, assessed from total number of chicks fledged to 1994, survival of breeding adults, and fitness-related life history traits, including brood size and hatching date. The Farallones colony is an unusual case in that it includes 50% of the species population and 90% of all western gulls breeding within a radius of 1000 km. Hence, potential recruits could choose between locations within the Farallones colony, but had limited choice to recruit at other colonies. 2. Among prebreeders, distance from natal site to prospecting site increased with age among gulls aged 2 to 4 years, and stabilized in 4- to 8-year-olds. Most 2-year-olds prospected on their natal sites. 3. Compared to other bird species, natal philopatty was strongly developed in both sexes, but was significantly greater in males (median distance between natal and recruitment site among males, 17 m; median distance among females, 50 m). 4. More philopatric males nested in areas of higher density and with a tendency for more nest cover (P = 0.080, when controlling for the effect of density). A non-linear relation between NDD and recruitment age among males resulted from shorter NDD in 4-, 5- and 6-year-olds compared to 3-year-olds and males older than 6 years. There was no relation between NDD and recruitment age in females. 5. Males who had hatched early in the season (individuals who were, on average, more dominant, with higher prebreeder survival and recruitment probability; Spear and Nur 1994) had shorter NDD than males who hatched later. 6. Fitness costs associated with natal philopatry were detected in both sexes. More philopatric males survived significantly less well than did less philopatric males. Average number of chicks fledged among experienced females (6-11 years breeding experience) was significantly lower among more philopatric compared to less philopatric individuals, as was cumulative number of chicks fledged for all females (as of 1994). 7. Thus, whilst philopatry was well developed in these gulls, the trait appeared maladaptive. This paradoxical result may be related to an extended period of poor food supply (1989-94) in the Gulf of the Farallones. We hypothesize that fitness costs associated with philopatty reflect different life history strategies where high philopatry may be part of a high effort strategy characterized by higher reproductive effort and lower survival.

The Tasmanian native hen (Gallinula mortierii) exhibits mate-sharing by both males and females, with monogamy, polyandry, polygyny and polygynandry all occurring in a single population. 2. Multivariate models are used to investigate the relationships between reproductive success and a number of aspects of group compositions and territories in a population of Tasmanian native hens studied at Maria Island, Tasmania, Australia, over five breeding seasons. 3. Mating pattern did not remain a significant explanatory variable in most of the models of the factors affecting reproductive success, suggesting that the reproductive success of individuals is not affected by their mating pattern. The only exception was that mating pattern was significantly related to clutch size, because co-breeding females laid combined clutches. 4. Breeding success (per group, per breeding male and per breeding female) was most significantly related to the total length of edge between short pasture and tall, dense vegetative cover present in a territory. It is proposed that edges between short pasture and cover allow the Tasmanian native hens' precocious chicks to be near good feeding areas while also remaining close to protective cover. 5. Individual components of breeding success were most significantly related to different variables. The presence of water in the territory increased the probability that a group laid eggs.

Key factor analysis is widely used as the first step in analysing census data to identify factors responsible for population change, but is generally considered to be flawed. The conceptual problems can be overcome by assessing the effects of variation in the life-history parameters on population growth rate, λ. We refer to this as λ-contribution analysis. The difference from key factor analysis is that now each life history parameter is weighted by the sensitivity of λ to that parameter. The rationale for this modification is that population growth rate is the best available measure of population change. 2. The advantages of the new method are: that it correctly assesses the effects of life history parameters on population growth rate; that birth rates are included in the analysis in a natural way without making arbitrary assumptions about birth rate mortalities; that post-reproductive individuals who do not contribute to population growth rate are zero-weighted; and that the analysis can be applied to populations with overlapping generations. 3.

The virus increases developmental time and decreases fecundity of the moths. 5. A significantly nonlinear additive autoregressive model of order 3 appears to give a parsimonious description of the series. 6. The demographic (birth and death) nature of the stochasticity inherent in the system is explicitly incorporated in the statistical model for the time series by assuming an overdispersed Poisson process. The variability around the skeleton is found to conform closely to this assumption. The demographic nature of the stochasticity cannot be fully understood on the basis of Gaussian (least-squares) models on transformed (variance-stabilized) data. 7. Significant density dependencies are found at a 1-week lag, a 2- to 3-week lag and at a 6- to 7-week lag. These are argued to be the signatures of within-stage competition, between-stage interactions and reproduction, respectively. Negative and statistically significant density dependence is apparent for the first two of these. No significant negative density dependence is apparent in the lag corresponding to reproduction. 8. The fluctuations in both the VF and VI system appear to represent limit cycles or weakly dampened cycles clothed by Poisson demographic stochasticity. 9. The enhanced cycles of the VI system are demonstrated to be consistent with a situation where the functional forms for the interactions are nearly the same as for the VF, but with delay structure shifted by just less than a week.",80,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Additive Poisson autoregression | Competition and cannibalism | Ecological dimension | Nonlinear dynamics | Periodic fluctuations | Stage-structured model | Stochastic limit cycle | Time series analysis,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,42,all,All Open Access

In many small rodent species, females are philopatric and may reproduce in proximity to their female relatives. The prevalence of clusters of relatives in populations reflects previous patterns of immigration, local recruitment and mortality. Kin-structuring among females will be most prevalent in populations which have experienced successful reproduction and philopatric recruitment. If population kin-structure influenced key demographic parameters this would introduce a potential time-delay in the regulation of population size by social factors. 2. We tested the influence of population kin structure among female Townsend's voles on nestling survival, using data from a replicated experiment with two non-enclosed populations. Most nestlings were marked before weaning, so that we knew which recruits were related to one another and to which adult female. The average size of matrilineal groups was experimentally manipulated by removing immigrants, and preventing predation by birds, on the high kinship treatments (Kin), and by removing members of family groups on the low kinship treatments (Non-kin). We compared preweaning survival of pups marked in the maternal nest between high and low kinship treatments using the recent generalisations of the Cormack-Jolly-Seber statistical models as implemented in the software SURGE. 3. The manipulation was effective in that the number of breeding females with relatives among the six nearest breeding female neighbour was higher on the high-kinship treatment grids than on the low-kinship treatment grids. Most first degree related females were nearest neighbours and the prevalence of any relatedness relationship among the six nearest neighbours declined with neighbourhood class. The degree of matrilineal relatedness influenced the distance between the nests (and pups) of breeding females; first degree relatives and second degree relatives were, respectively, 1-32 and 1.19 times closer to each other than unrelated females. Unrelated females and more distant relatives had similar internest distances. The relationship between matrilineal relatedness and distance was similar for the six nearest breeding female neighbours and was not influenced by year, season or treatment. 4. The parsimonious capture-recapture models selected included a gradual increase of trappability during the first 5-7 weeks of life and three age-specific survival rates. Survival over the first 2 weeks of life was estimated as a single parameter and was relatively low. Weekly survival probabilities were very high (0-96, SE = 0-012) from week 3-5 and decreased later in life (week 6-15, 0.85, SE = 0-012) possibly as a result of emigration. 5. The experimental manipulation of female kin-structure had a significant influence on the weekly survival probabilities of nestlings during their first 2 weeks of life. Pup weekly survival was higher on the high-kinship treatment (0.76, SE = 0-018) than on the low-kinship treatment (0.67, SE = 0.020). 6. Pairs of first degree relatives among the six nearest neighbours were present, although in different proportion, within both treatments and we asked whether this within-treatment variability in relatedness was reflected in within-treatment variability in early age survival. Estimates of pup survival for the three replicates with the largest sample size suggest that this was the case in 1990 (on both treatments) but not in 1991 (high kinship treatment). This suggests that between-treatment differences probably reflect differences in the prevalence of related and unrelated females rather than the presence of immigrant females on either treatments. 7. A simple age-structured demographic model, using values of juvenile and adult survival measured for populations with high and low kinship, indicate that this factor may have a substantial impact on the rate of growth of microtine populations (predicted monthly multiplication rate λ = 1.48 vs. 1.72 for low and high kinship, respectively). Thus, the impact of kinship on demographic parameters may introduce powerful time lags in the social regulation on vole populations.",90,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Cooperation | Demography | Dispersal | Kin selection | Microtus | Philopatry | Survival | Time lags,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,43,all,All Open Access

A bird's mass in winter should reflect the trade-off between the benefits of an increased energy store to reduce starvation risk, and its costs in terms of increasing mass-dependent predation risk. State-dependent models of this trade-off predict that as starvation risk increases then energy reserves should (i), increase, and (ii) be acquired earlier in the day. 2. Blackbirds increased their minimum weight by 25±1.5% in midwinter; adults weighed significantly more than juveniles in midwinter, but weighed less in late winter. Weight for both sexes, and particularly adults, decreased with increasing daylength, but weight increases with respect to temperature decreases were most pronounced in males. Female blackbirds showed relatively small seasonal weight changes so that their midwinter mass-dependent predation risk relative to males was independent of diurnal weight changes. 3. Blackbirds lost at least 1-9% of their body weight overnight depending on temperature. Over 60% of the weight lost was then regained in the first 3 hours after dawn, with only 5% being regained after 12.00 h. The pattern of early morning weight gain was maintained throughout the winter, with the ratio of weight gain rates in the first 4h of dawn compared to the rest of the day being c. 3:1 in midwinter (when individuals maintained high weights) and in early spring (when individuals were losing weight seasonally). 4. The results agree with the theoretical prediction that energy reserves should increase as risk of starvation increased (as measured by seasonal factors such as cold, short midwinter days). There was, however, little change in the seasonal pattern of diurnal weight gain, with weight always being gained early in the day. In the likely absence of foraging constraints within the study system, this result fits the predictions of state-dependent foraging models where animals can escape from predation after achieving weight gains, by either using refuges or adopting low-risk foraging options.",82,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Blackbird | Diurnal | Mass-dependent predation | Seasonal | Weight changes,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,44,NA,NA

We predicted that moths which are strong fliers but uncommon on the islands have a higher incidence on scattered islands than on islands in a group, because the latter 'compete' for immigrants from the mainland. In contrast, we predicted that weakly flying species with potentially large local populations on the islands occur more frequently on islands in a group due to enhanced colonization rate. 3. Both predicted patterns were observed. Island occupancy increased significantly with the number of individuals caught on the rocky skerries, which is our measure of migration rate from the mainland, supporting the basic assumption that the species occur on the islands in a balance between colonizations and extinctions. 4.

Sooty shearwaters are abundant in waters too distant from their colonies to account for the observed average frequency with which the chicks are fed. This, and the unexplained cyclic pattern of attendance at their colonies, have led to contradictory interpretations related to evolution of the extreme life histories of pelagic seabirds and their relationship with the marine environment. 2. Study of the provisioning behaviour of individual parent sooty shearwaters indicates that they can rely on productive distant waters, probably 1550 km away, to build up their body reserves and to provision their chick. These long foraging trips on average last 11 days and account for 84% of the foraging time. 3. Birds use this stored energy to cover the costs of performing several successive foraging trips of short duration in nearby less productive waters. These brief trips double the energy flow to the chick and take only 16% of the foraging time but are at the expense of adult body condition, i.e. there is a net energy loss. Foraging successively with short and long trips allows parents to increase by 20% the energy flow to the chick over what it would get if foraging was exclusively in distant waters. 4. The results suggest that maximal fitness in this pelagic seabird is not achieved by maximization of foraging efficiency but is the result of a trade-off system whereby at some stages birds forage with net energy losses. The decision to feed close to or far from the colonies, i.e. to allocate to the chick or to store body reserves, is not related to any endogenous rhythm, nor to the nutritional status of the chick, nor to the length of the previous foraging trip. Rather, it is under the sole control of adult body condition, with the possible existence of a threshold body mass around 750 g. Thus, adult body mass plays a central role in foraging decisions, linking foraging and allocation. 5. The synchronized return of foraging birds every 2 weeks is not due to environmental factors. By modelling attendance patterns with an increasing variance in the foraging routine, it is shown that the periodicity of feeding times is retained throughout the chick rearing period, with a cyclicity of 14 days. This result indicates that cyclic attendance at the level of the whole colony is an emergent property of the two-fold foraging strategy of individual adults. 6. One main consequence of this system appears to be a reduction in competition close to the breeding grounds and this may help explain the existence of huge populations of sooty and short-tailed shearwaters that rely on distant food resources.",175,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Allocation | Antarctica | Chick growth | Energy gain | Foraging efficiency,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,50,NA,NA

Sex-related differences in parental care were found in both species. Males responded more readily to avian predators and foraged farther from the nests and chicks than did females. In contrast females carried out a greater share of the incubation, and played the larger part in caring for the young. 3. There were condition-related differences in parental investment by both species: heavier females and males incubated for longer than lighter parents, and males found tending chicks in the late-tending period had been heavier at the start of the incubation than males that were not present in this period. 4. Weight loss during incubation was recorded only in lone females and those laying a replacement clutch when the first had been destroyed. Adverse weather increased the proportion of the female time budget spent in incubation and, as a consequence, their body weight declined but they were able to regain their former condition, godwits faster than lapwings. 5. The more important role of godwit males than lapwing males in care was found. The stronger pair-bond in godwit than in lapwing was supported by: (i) they have fewer females incubating alone; (ii) more godwit pairs tended together in the late-tending period; (iii) more godwit females that laid replacement eggs were tending chicks during the late-tending period. 6. The results of this study suggest that reduced parental care may lead incidentally to polygamy in the lapwing but the greater demands for caring made on black-tailed godwits act against polygamy developing in this species.

A population of brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in the Orongorongo Valley, near Wellington, New Zealand was live-trapped three times a year for 15 years. Almost all births occurred in a single autumn pulse, and many young were tagged while still with their mothers in spring before becoming independent in summer. Yearlings could be distinguished from adults until the following summer. An age-structured mark-recapture analysis distinguished in situ recruitment from immigration. 2. The sex ratio of young in June, soon after birth, was male-biased (56.1%); by September, late in the pouch phase, the observed ratio was closer to parity (52.5%). Disappearance immediately after independence was not sex-biased and did not coincide with noticeable immigration, so it is believed to be due almost entirely to mortality. 3. Recurrent seasonal patterns of disappearance and immigration differed between sex and age classes. Adult disappearance was high in winter (June-September), particularly among males, and low through the rest of the year. The disappearance of yearlings, which seldom bred, showed the least sexual dimorphism in winter. Almost no immigration was detected for either age class over winter. Winter disappearance was therefore attributed to in situ mortality, made worse in adult males by their abrupt loss of condition during the autumn breeding season. 4. The largest seasonal influx of immigrants was of nominally adult males in the intervals September to February and February to June. Many of these were young males in their second summer that could not be distinguished from adults by body size. It is inferred that the majority of natal dispersal was delayed until after their first winter of independence, which may have the effect of reducing dispersal-related mortality. 5. Immigration by males exceeded that by females in both adult and yearling age classes, and at all times of year. In total, 74% of immigrants were males. About three in four breeding males and one in five breeding females were immigrants. 6. The inverse seasonal relationship between mortality and dispersal suggests that the proximate motivation for dispersal in brushtail possums is not related to weather or food shortage. Immigration probably exceeded emigration, indicating that dispersal was not a strategy to escape high densities. Dispersal appears to be an integral part of male development.

A method for finding the consequences of long-term generalized press perturbations in multispecies ecological communities, with relatively modest requirements for data, is explicated. The approach uses energetic and allometric reasoning to set some parameter values for which data are not available. The remaining unknown parameters are treated as random variables, enabling the calculation of probability distributions for the outcomes that are of interest. 2. The method is used to investigate the effect of a cull of fur seals on fisheries in the Benguela ecosystem, using a 29-species foodweb for that system. In the case of Cape fur seals treated here, it is found that a cull of seals is more likely to be detrimental to total yields from all exploited species than it is to be beneficial. 3. The influence of weak links on the effects of a cull is investigated. Using both consumption by each species and consumption of each species to define link strength, a clear threshold in link strength is found, indicating that 44% of all links could be deleted from the foodweb without affecting the predictions significantly. Even using a criterion based on consumption by each species alone (conventional dietary proportion data), about the same number of links can be deleted without seriously affecting the predictions of the model.

Transmission of insect pathogens is traditionally described by a term which states that transmission is proportional to the densities of the susceptible hosts and the infectious units, multiplied by a constant, the transmission coefficient. Theoretical studies suggest that deviations from this can be important in host-pathogen population dynamics, but little is known of how commonly pathogen transmission conforms to the conventional model. 2. We describe a test of the traditional assumption for the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) (Hubner) and its granulosis virus using a modification of the previous methods, which allows for unpredictable declines in the amount of infectious material present. 3. The estimated transmission coefficient increased with the density of susceptible hosts and showed a marked decline with density of infectious cadavers. This suggests that the usual assumption does not adequately describe transmission in this system. 4. The reasons for this deviation from the usual assumption are likely to be a combination of behavioural and physiological changes at high host density, and differential susceptibility to the pathogen leading to an effect analogous to pseudo-interference in parasitoids.",54,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Density dependence | Host-pathogen interactions | Parasite-host models | Transmission coefficient,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,56,NA,NA

Individuals are expected to balance the costs and benefits underlying the trade-off between current and future reproduction. If starting to breed does not seriously lower future reproductive output, individuals that start breeding early in their life should have a higher fitness than individuals that postpone their breeding career. We studied how the fluctuations in food supply interacted with Ural owl's age at first breeding, lifetime reproductive success (LRS) and fitness. 2. During the period 1977-95, 126 Ural owl females started and ended their breeding career in a study area in southern Finland. Voles, the owls' main food source, showed a 3-year cycle of low, increase and peak population numbers. We recorded when the females started to breed and how many fledglings they produced. For 57 females the age at first breeding was known. 3. LRS of female Ural owls varied from 0 to 33 fledglings (mean 6.7±0.52 SE). The variance in LRS was explained by variation in the components: breeding lifespan (97%); nest success (23%); and average clutch size (15%). 4. Survival of breeding females was low (62%) after a peak year, when the vole population crashed. In other phases the survival was 85-95%. Females that started breeding in a peak year had half the LRS of females that started in an increase year. 5. There was a strong interaction between the vole cycle and age at first breeding. 1-year-olds started in a peak and 2-year-olds in an increase year. 6. There was no effect of age at first breeding on LRS for females that started breeding in the same phase of the vole cycle. 7. Females that started breeding at age 1-3 years had equal fitness, whereas females that started at age ≤4 had a lower fitness. Females that postponed first breeding as a two-year-old in an increase year had a lower fitness than females that did not do so. Females that postponed first breeding as a 1-year-old in a peak year had equal fitness to females that did not do so. 8.

We studied the relative role of local habitat variables and landscape pattern on vole-plant interactions in a system with grey-sided voles (Clethrionomys rufocanus (Sund.)) and their favourite winter food plant, bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.). The study was conducted during a vole peak year (1992-93) in a tundra area in northern Norway. 2. Using Mantel statistics we were able to separate the direct effects of the spatial patterning of habitats and the indirect effects due to spatial aggregations of similar habitats. 3. Results indicate that knowledge about the explicit spatial patterning of patches does not improve our understanding of the system. Instead, two local factors, vegetation height and bilberry biomass, explained more than 50% of the variation in cutting intensity in winter (defined as the proportion of above-ground shoots cut). Increasing vegetation height increased, and increasing bilberry biomass decreased, the cutting intensity. 4. The conclusion that grey-sided voles are able to distribute themselves relative to habitat quality was also partially supported by our estimated over-winter persistence by voles in the various habitats. Vole persistence was uncorrelated with vegetation height, the important predictor of autumn vole density, but tended to correlate with the deviation from the relation between vegetation height and autumn vole density. This conforms to the expectations from the theory of ideal-free habitat distribution. 5.

Significant fluctuating asymmetry was detected in four bristle counts and two wing measurements made on forewings. There was no evidence for directional asymmetry in any of the traits. An estimate of field fitness was obtained in grapevines by collecting released wasps arriving at oviposition sites consisting of egg rafts of the tortricid Epiphyas postvittana. 3. Comparisons of ovipositing and emergence samples indicated that wasps at oviposition sites were relatively larger and more variable in their size distribution. A non-parametric analysis of the relationship between fitness and size indicated that extremely large wasps had the highest fitness and suggested that small as well as large wasps may have had a fitness advantage. 4. For asymmetry, the only trait showing an association with field fitness was wing length. Wasps with a low length asymmetry were more likely to be collected at oviposition sites, although fitness curves indicated that wasps had a similar fitness once an intermediate length asymmetry was exceeded. 5.

Dispersal is of critical ecological and evolutionary importance for several issues of population biology, particularly population synchrony, colonization and range expansion, metapopulation and source sink dynamics, and population genetic structure, but it has not previously been possible to compare dispersal patterns across a wide range of species or to study movement outside the confines of local study areas. 2. Using resampling methods, we verified that statistically unbiased estimates of average dispersal distance and of intraspecific variance in dispersal distance could be extracted from the bird ringing data of the British Trust for Ornithology. 3. Using data on 75 terrestrial bird species, we tested whether natal and breeding dispersal were influenced by a species' habitat requirements, diet, geographical range, abundance, morphology, social system, life history or migratory status. We used allometric techniques to ascertain whether these relationships were independent of body size, and used the method of phylogenetically independent contrasts to ascertain whether they were independent of phylogeny. 4. Both natal and breeding dispersal distances were lower among abundant species and among species with large geographical ranges. Dispersal distances and life-history variables were correlated independent of phylogeny, but these relationships did not persist after controlling for body size. All morphometrical variables (wing length, tarsus length and bill length) were not significantly correlated with dispersal distances after correcting for body size or phylogenetic relatedness. 5. Migrant species disperse further than resident ones, this relation was independent of body size but not of phylogeny. A significant positive relation was observed between breeding dispersal distance and long-term population decline among migrants, but not among residents. 6. The species living in wet habitats disperse further than those living in dry habitats, which could be explained by the greater patchiness of wet habitats in space and/or time.

Most predictions of species distribution and abundance changes in response to global warming relate the individual requirements of a single isolated species to climate variables through some form of climate mapping. This method fails to account for the effects of species dispersal and species interactions, both of which may strongly affect distribution and abundance. 2. We therefore examined the effects of dispersal and species interactions on the distribution and abundance of three Drosophila species in a laboratory system that mimicked a latitudinal cline of 15°C. We then investigated how species distribution and abundance in this system responded to simulated global warming. 3. Dispersal allowed populations to persist at non-optimum temperatures, overriding physiologically imposed range limits. 4. Temperature determined the outcome of competition. In pairwise interactions, Drosophila subobscura eliminated D. melanogaster or D. simulans at low temperatures but was itself eliminated at high temperatures. 5. Competitive interactions changed abundance and range sizes thus shifting the position of species optima. These changes depended on both the number and the identity of the competing species. 6. Enemy-victim interactions altered range and abundance. Adding the parasitoid Leptopilina boulardi affected the host assemblage directly at high temperatures where the parasitoid was present, and indirectly (mediated by dispersal) at low temperatures where it was scarce or absent. Host species coexisted for longer at low temperatures in clines when parasitoids were present than when they were absent. 7. Simulated global warming produced complex, counter-intuitive effects on distribution and abundance, including the reversal of species' relative abundance at some temperatures. 8. Because dispersal and species interactions strongly influenced both range and abundance (sometimes in unexpected ways) current species distributions are no guide to what they might be under global climate change. Furthermore, since both these factors are missing from climate envelope models of range and abundance change, their predictions are, at best, incomplete.",239,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Abundance | Climate change | Cline | Range | Temperature,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,61,NA,NA

(ii) From how many initial states are each of these persistent communities obtained? (iii) What are the impacts of individual species on community collapse? (iv) Can the behaviour of the system be characterized by a simple set of rules? (v) To what extent does knowledge of the results from the pairwise species combinations allow prediction of the outcomes of the more species-rich sets? 2. Replicated microcosms were set up with each of the 63 possible combinations of species from a pool of six protist species (three bacterivores, two predators and one omnivore) along with a mixed bacterial flora. Microcosms were maintained, with nutrient replenishment, for over 100 days until a constant species composition was reached. 3. Forty-seven of the 63 starting combinations showed a repeatable collapse to one of eight communities (including the 'empty' community - containing just bacteria). The number of starting combinations leading to each of these persistent communities varied from 17 down to one. Extinction rates were higher in more species-rich systems. 4. The effects of each species in determining the composition of the persistent community were characterized as to whether they were present in the final set or not, and whether their occurrence in the starting combination had any effect on the eventual presence or absence of others. Under this classification the larger species seem to be more influential in shaping the final community. 5. The collapse from the initial species composition to that at the end could be stated in terms of four simple rules in 34 of the 47 starting combinations for which a persistent community could be defined. 6.

Two main explanations can be advanced. First, the local abundance of species in the communities studied could be determined through differential responses to unpredictable environmental changes, rather than through biological interactions. Second, as a result of historical events, the communities studied are reduced in congeneric species which can limit, in turn, the influence of interspecific competition in structuring these communities. 7.

These models neglect spatial arrangement. 3. Cellular automata were developed to test the effect of population size on competitive coexistence of two species, given that the inferior competitor is a better colonizer. The cellular automata in the present study were stochastic in that they were based upon colonization and extinction probabilities rather than deterministic rules. 4. The effect of population size on competitive exclusion at the local scale was found to have little consequence for the coexistence of competitors at the metapopulation (or landscape) scale. In contrast, population size effects on extinction at the local scale led to much reduced landscape scale coexistence compared to simulations not including localized population size effects on extinction, especially in the cellular automata models. Spatially explicit dynamics of the cellular automata vs. deterministic rates of the numerical model resulted in decreased survival of both species. One important finding is that superior competitors that are widespread can become extinct before less common inferior competitors because of limited colonization. 5.

When faced with increased brood demand, parent birds provisioning young in the nest can make a variety of adjustments to their foraging and food allocation strategies. Logical extensions of classic optimal foraging theory predict increased provisioning effort to larger broods to be accompanied by changes in load size, foraging distance from the nest, as well as possible changes in the type and size of prey delivered. 2. We assessed such behavioural adjustments and their consequences in pairs of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) responding to a range of experimental brood sizes. Parents feeding larger broods increased their visit rates by spending less time in the nestbox and less time around the nestbox colony. High visit rates to larger broods were also associated with larger loads per visit and changes in the type of prey delivered to the nest. As a consequence, chicks in large and small broods received similar rates of food intake, but experienced differences in the nutritional quality of their food. Parents feeding larger brood sizes were able to increase their provisioning effort despite feeding in the same foraging sites, travelling at comparable flight speeds and maintaining similar body masses to parents feeding smaller broods. 3. Parental energetic expenditure, measured through doubly labelled water analyses, showed no effect of the brood size treatment. The greater proportion of indigestible material per gram of food delivered to the larger experimental brood sizes (i.e. soil from the guts of earthworms) was probably responsible for the fact that these chicks grew at slower rates and fledged at lower body masses, although we cannot rule out the possibility of lower growth rates due to higher energetic costs of sibling competition within larger broods. Lighter fledglings from large broods disappeared from the local area earlier in the summer, probably as a result of differential mortality rather than premature natal dispersal. 4.

The Australian continent provides an important test of macroecological patterns given its unique biota and long-term geographical isolation. However, macroecological contributions from the Australian continent are rare. We explored the relationship between abundance and geographical range for Australian frogs (Order Anura) across complete geographical ranges, and investigated how adult body size relates to both abundance and the size of geographical ranges. 2. Our analyses followed two complementary paths. First, we employed cross-species correlations at a number of taxonomic levels to analyse present-day ecological associations among the macroecological variables. Secondly, we tested whether there were correlated evolutionary divergences among the variables by use of the phylogenetic regression. In the event, cross-species patterns and correlated divergence patterns proved quite similar for this dataset. 3. For Australian frogs there is a strong, significant positive correlation between abundance and geographical range, that is not mediated through body size, and that is found for both cross-species correlations and as correlated evolutionary divergences. Among biological mechanisms that have been proposed, some can be rejected. Feasible explanations would invoke resource use or intrinsic rates of increase or both. 4. There is also a significant positive correlation between adult body size and geographical range. We were able to discard four of the five proposed mechanisms describing this relationship. The remaining mechanism relates to homeostasis and environmental variability. 5. Previous studies of the relationship between adult body size and abundance have revealed a strong negative correlation when studies are performed over areas that encompass most or all of the geographical ranges of the species in question. Contrary to these studies, a negative relationship was not found for Australian frogs. None of the eight explanations postulated from other studies can account for this discrepancy, leading to the conclusion that Australian frogs provide a contrast to macroecological patterns prevailing elsewhere. 6. Body size could not explain directly the relationship between abundance and geographical range. While there was a significant positive correlation between body size and geographical range, there was no relationship between body size and abundance.

Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain density-dependent patterns in reproduction. The habitat heterogeneity hypothesis (HHH) explains density-dependent reproduction at the population level from poorer quality territories in heterogeneous environments only being occupied at high densities. No effect of population density is expected on reproduction within a given territory. If reproduction and territory quality are correlated, there will be a negative correlation between reproduction and density. Alternatively, density-dependent responses could be caused by variation in reproduction with population density. This will be referred to as the individual adjustment hypothesis (IAH). 2. The HHH predicts that individuals breeding on the same territory in years with different densities would show no response in reproduction to changes in population density. The response in reproduction of the population to changes in density would therefore be stronger than the within territory response. Under the IAH, the response of individuals on specific territories would be similar to the average response in the whole population. 3. This paper attempts to discriminate between these two hypotheses using data on clutch sizes of great tits Parus major L. from six different populations. In all populations the mean clutch size was negatively correlated with the population density. In four out of the six study populations individual females breeding on the same territory showed a negative correlation between the change in clutch size between years and the change in density. In none of the populations it was found that the response within territories was significantly smaller than the average response for the population. 4. These data suggest that density dependence of clutch size in great tits is not due to poorer quality territories being occupied more frequently at higher population densities. Within territories, individual females adjusted their clutch size to changes in density, and this was sufficient to explain the density dependence of clutch size in five of the six populations.

Freshwater mussels (Order Unionoida) are the most imperiled faunal group in North America; 60% of described species are considered endangered or threatened, and 12% are presumed extinct. Widespread habitat degradation (including pollution, siltation, river channelization and impoundment) has been the primary cause of extinction during this century, but a new stress was added in the last decade by the introduction of the Eurasian zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, a biofouling organism that smothers the shells of other molluscs and competes with other suspension feeders for food. Since the early 1990s, it has been spreading throughout the Mississippi River basin, which contains the largest number of endemic freshwater mussels in the world. In this report, we use an exponential decay model based on data from other invaded habitats to predict the long-term impact of D. polymorpha on mussel species richness in the basin. 2. In North American lakes and rivers that support high densities (> 3000 m-2) of D. polymorpha, native mussel populations are extirpated within 4-8 years following invasion. Significant local declines in native mussel populations in the Illinois and Ohio rivers, concomitant with the establishment of dense populations of D. polymorpha, suggest that induced mortality is occurring in the Mississippi River basin. 3. A comparison of species loss at various sites before and after invasion indicates that D. polymorpha has accelerated regional extinction rates of North American freshwater mussels by 10-fold. If this trend persists, the regional extinction rate for Mississippi basin species will be 12% per decade. Over 60 endemic mussels in the Mississippi River basin are threatened with global extinction by the combined impacts of the D. polymorpha invasion and environmental degradation.",302,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Biodiversity | Biological invasion | Exotic species | Extinction rates | Unionidae,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,69,all,All Open Access

Diet overlap among age and sex classes of sympatric dasyurid carnivores (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae) at Cradle Mountain National Park in Tasmania, Australia, was determined to assess the likelihood of current interspecific competition, which could influence and explain the disparate population densities of the three species. 2. The carnivore guild divided into two groups based on body size and prey size, within which diet overlapped: Tasmanian devils (Sarcophilus laniarius) and male spotted-tailed quolls (Dasyurus maculatus), which consumed larger prey species, and female spotted-tailed quolls and eastern quolls (D. viverrinus), which consumed smaller prey species. Male spotted-tailed quolls overlapped in diet with adult devils in winter, but not in summer. However, in summer the small number of male spotted-tailed quolls overlapped in both body weight and diet with a large cohort of young devils. Too few data were obtained to repeat these analyses with female and young spotted-tailed quolls and eastern quolls, but results indicated that a similar pattern of overlap may occur. 3. Spotted-tailed quolls would experience the highest degree of dietary overlap with another species of carnivore, with all age and sex classes experiencing overlap for much of the year. Adult devils and young eastern quolls would both be free of overlap for more than half the year. 4. No indications of seasonal food limitation, when competition is most likely to occur, were found during this study, but this may occur over a longer time scale. 5. If the high degree of diet overlap experienced by spotted-tailed quolls means higher competitive pressure, this may explain the low density of this species at Cradle Mountain. 6. These results, high levels of interference experienced by spotted-tailed quolls, and the behavioural and numerical dominance of devils, the largest species in the guild, support Brown and Maurer's (1986) and Cotgreave's (1993) ideas that competitive dominance may be more important than energetic equivalence in determining relationships between body size and abundance in local assemblages of animals.",105,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Abundance | Carnivore | Competition | Dasyurid | Diet,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,70,all,All Open Access

Juvenile flying animals, including bats, often cease increasing, or even decrease in body mass after the onset of flight. The low body mass of juvenile bats may be a result of stresses associated with the initiation of flight, or may be an adaptation to reduce flight costs. 2. To test these hypotheses, the body masses of adults and unknown aged juvenile big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) were separately compared in August 1990 through to 1995. It was hypothesized that there should be little variation in the body mass of juveniles from year to year if low body mass is an adaptation to reduce flight costs. 3. The foraging behaviour and body masses of bats of known or estimated age were also compared in 1994 and 1995. Ambient temperature at sunset was greater in 1994 than in 1995. It was assumed that prey density and predictability increased with temperature, and hypothesized that if low body mass results from energetic stress, then this should be more apparent in 1995. Using radiotelemetry, the foraging behaviour of juvenile, yearling and adult E. fuscus was compared in 1994 and 1995 to determine whether young bats attempt to compensate for energetic shortfalls by foraging for longer, or emerging earlier, than adults. 4. Unknown-aged juveniles did not differ significantly in body mass in August from 1990 through to 1995. Adults were significantly heavier in August in 1990 and 1994 than in 1991, 1993 and 1995. Known-aged juveniles had lower body mass than adults in 1994, and lower wing loading than adults in 1995. Known-aged juveniles did not differ in mass between 1994 and 1995, while adults were heavier in 1994. 5. The foraging times for juvenile and adult bats were both significantly related to ambient temperature. However, the slope of this relationship was steeper for weaned juveniles than for adults. The foraging times of yearling and adults bats were not significantly different. 6. The emergence times of juvenile and adult bats did not differ, nor did the emergence times of yearlings and adults. Emergence time did not differ significantly between 1994 and 1995. 7. The results of the study suggest that juvenile bats maintain a low body mass even under conditions that permit adults to accumulate greater fat deposits. Juveniles do not forage earlier or for longer to compensate for poor foraging ability and increased energy expenditures resulting from the onset of flight. This suggests that, by maintaining a low body mass, juveniles reduce flight costs and the risk of predation at a time when flight and foraging are still developing.",19,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Cost of flight | Fat deposition | Foraging | Juveniles | Timing of emergence,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,71,all,All Open Access

Fitness correlates of spur development were studied in a free-living population of wild turkeys and it was found that heavier males and males with longer beards had longer spurs. Males that had longer spurs spent more time on display areas during the breeding season and less time moving among these areas compared to males with shorter spurs, independently of their body mass. 3. Otherwise ideally symmetrical spurs showed fluctuating asymmetry between left and right tarsi, the degree of absolute asymmetry decreased with spur length in adults, but not in subadults, and males that survived at least one winter had more symmetrical spurs compared to males that did not. 4.

The aim of this study was to test whether experimentally induced destruction and fragmentation of habitat and varying degrees of patch isolation applied to 11 experimental populations of root voles affected space use and fitness parameters in radio-tracked females. It was predicted that the habitat destruction would disrupt the spatiosocial relations between breeding individuals, which, in turn, would cause lowered survival and reproductive success. Different degrees of patch isolation were expected to affect the rate of risky and energetically costly interpatch movements. 2. The experimental habitat destruction comprised the removal of more than half of the habitat area (meadow vegetation) in each of seven populations that had been established in a large continuous habitat block. This treatment yielded six small, habitat patches arranged in two clusters with long and short interfragment distances, respectively. Measures of individual space use, survival rates (predation and unknown causes) and litter production were contrasted with equivalent measures obtained from four control populations. The control populations had been established in permanently fragmented plots with the same fragment configuration as the post-destruction treatment populations. The effect of different interpatch distance was tested by comparing movement rates, space use and demographic parameters between the two types of patch cluster. 3. Home ranges were larger in the continuous predestruction populations compared to the permanently fragmented control populations. There was a large decrease in home range area of individual females as a result of habitat destruction, and they became temporally smaller than in the control plots. The degree of overlap only increased on home range core areas. The degree of space sharing between matrilineal related females, a main characteristic of Microtus social organization, was higher in the permanently fragmented populations (controls) than in the treatment populations. This difference was also maintained after habitat destruction. Thus, the basic spatiosocial organization of reproductive females when first established, seems to be very resistant to habitat destruction. There were no effects of habitat destruction on female fitness parameters when tested for either at the cluster or the population level. 4. There were less between-patch movements when interpatch distances were large than when they were small, irrespective of the fragmentation history of the population. Predation by avian predators, the main mortality cause, was highest in fragment clusters with long interpatch distances, probably because long distance movements between fragments increased the predation risk. 5. There was a large intrapopulation variation with respect to how severely individuals were affected by the habitat destruction. The farther a female had to relocate her home range because of habitat destruction, the higher was the predation risk. Thus, this study predicts that the most influential aspect of habitat fragmentation on demography may be that causing long interpatch movements.",53,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Habitat destruction | Habitat fragmentation | Home range | Matrilineal structure | Microtus oeconomus | Movements | Predation rate | Reproductive success,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,74,all,All Open Access

Age-specific variation in the reproductive performance of great skuas in Shetland, U.K., was investigated during a period of fluctuating sandeel availability between 1988 and 1993. 2. Increased sandeel abundance was associated with earlier laying dates, increased clutch volumes and improved fledging success. Sandeel abundance had no effects on clutch size and hatching success. 3. Parental age improved laying date and clutch size in a nonlinear manner. Laying date became earlier in the youngest age classes, with the effect being negligible in older birds. Clutch size increased with age up to 18 and then declined in older birds. Clutch volume increased with age and the probability of nest predation declined with age. 4. There were no significant interactive effects of age and year on laying date nor clutch volume, indicating that birds of all ages benefited equally from increases in sandeel abundance. This suggests that lack of breeding experience rather than deficient foraging skills are responsible for young birds laying later. 5. There was a significant interactive effect of year and age on fledging success that was associated with changes in sandeel availability. Success was uniformly low for birds of all ages in 1988-90 when sandeel abundance was low. Success increased with age in 1991 and 1992 during which time food supply improved. During 1993 food supply was abundant and fledging success was high in all age classes. 6.

Intrinsic variation in the availability of food to animal populations reflects the influence of foraging by the animals themselves. Intrinsic variation in food availability provides a link between population density, subsequent food availability and variation in the rate of population increase (r), operating through density-dependent food shortage. In contrast, extrinsic variation in food availability is caused by environmental influences on food or animal abundance, which are independent of animal foraging. Extrinsic variation in food availability is random relative to that arising through intrinsic shortage. Intrinsic and extrinsic variation in food availability can influence animal populations simultaneously. Intrinsic variation will impart a tendency towards an equilibrium between animal and food abundance, which will be progressively obscured by density-independent variation as the influence of extrinsic factors increases. 2. This study used a large-scale field experiment, in which the density of food-limited fetal pig (Sus scrofa L.) populations was manipulated on six sites, to assess the relative influence of intrinsic and extrinsic variation in food availability. The experiment evaluated the influence of pig population density on r and the abundance of food resources measured as pasture biomass. It was predicted that if intrinsic shortages dominated variation in food availability, pasture biomass and r would decline with increasing pig density. If extrinsic factors dominated variation in food availability, pig density would have no systematic effect on either pasture biomass or r. If intrinsic and extrinsic sources simultaneously affected variation in food availability, higher pig densities would have no systematic effect on r, but would reduce pasture biomass. The simultaneous model predicts reduced pasture biomass because, in the absence of compensatory changes in other sources of variation, the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors will be additive. 3. To examine further the degree of interdependence in pig and pasture abundance, a series of stochastic models of the grazing system were estimated and the feedback loop comprising the functional and numerical responses of feral pigs to variation in pasture biomass was manipulated. 4. In the large-scale experiment, neither pasture biomass nor r declined with increasing pig density, suggesting that food availability was dominated by extrinsic factors. However, limitations of the experiment meant that a minor decline in pasture biomass may have gone undetected. Comparison of simulation models, which included and omitted pasture offtake by pigs, indicated that because they were less efficient grazers and persisted at lower average densities relative to other large herbivores, pigs had little influence on variation in pasture biomass. 5. The minor influence pigs appear to exert on pasture biomass suggests that trophic processes, typically invoked to explain herbivore population persistence, have, at best, limited consequences for pig populations. Despite this, simulation models indicate that pigs are able to persist indefinitely under rangelands conditions, because their high intrinsic capacity for increase (r(m) = 0.69) means that they are able to exploit periods when pasture is plentiful more effectively than other large herbivores. 6. The study concludes that intrinsic and extrinsic sources of variation in food availability represent two extremes of a continuum in the strength of interaction between herbivores and their food resources. The position of a grazing system along this hypothetical continuum depends on the relative influence of stochastic, density-independent environmental processes (extrinsic variation) and the efficiency of its vegetation herbivore feedback loop (intrinsic variation). Feral pig populations in the rangelands appear to occupy a position towards the extrinsic extreme of this continuum, where their dynamics are more influenced by extrinsic than intrinsic sources of variation in pasture availability.",56,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Density dependence | Food-limitation | Population regulation | Simulation modelling | Sus scrofa,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,78,all,All Open Access

Many hypotheses for hatching asynchrony within avian clutches centre around food supply during the laying or nestling periods, but food is measured in few studies. 2. Patterns of clutch size and hatching asynchrony were analysed in the Eurasian kestrel [Falco tinnunculus (Linnaeus)] breeding in Finland, where small mammal populations show dramatic 3-year cycles. 3. Data collected over 12 years showed that clutches were larger when food was more abundant in spring. 4. While controlling for clutch size, hatching was more synchronous in the low phase of the vole cycle compared to the increase phase, contrary to conventional interpretation of the brood reduction hypothesis. The age of the female, but not the age of the male was associated with the degree of asynchrony. 5. Paradoxically, numbers of voles were most stable in the 'low' phase, which may lead to a unique situation, where food is more predictable when scarce. Kestrels have small, synchronous clutches in the 'low' phase and large asynchronous clutches in the 'increase' phase. 6. Based on results of this study, it is suggested that it is important to consider the predictability of food, and not only the mean abundance of food when evaluating-hypotheses for hatching asynchrony. Patterns of clutch size and hatching asynchrony at the population level can be used to evaluate current energy-related hypotheses for asynchrony.",23,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Energetic constraint | Falco tinnunculus | Food supply | Hatching asynchrony | Incubation | Vole cycle,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,82,all,All Open Access

Pre-breeding survival, i.e. survival from fledging up to the third winter, of barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) was analysed by using more than 45 000 resightings of 1302 individually marked birds. Since observations from the wintering areas only were used, the survival estimates obtained were not confounded by natal dispersal. 2. Post-fledging survival, i.e. survival from fledging to the start of the first winter, differed significantly among the 10 cohorts analysed. These differences were related to the mean body weight and mean tarsus length of cohorts just before fledging. In further analyses, when data from all cohorts were combined, body weight and tarsus length of individuals just before fledging were found to be positively related to Post-fledging survival. 3. Post-fledging survival rates were, on average, lower than survival rates after the first winter. This age effect was largest in cohorts with low mean body weight at capture and was absent in cohorts with high mean body weight at capture. 4. The age effect on survival could only partly be explained by individuals with low body weight having lower survival and successively disappearing from the cohort. It was therefore concluded that other factors must have contributed to the age effect as well. 5. It is hypothesized that lightweight birds are more vulnerable to, for example, diseases, parasites and predation during the first months of their life. Once they have survived this critical period, the effects of characters related to low body weight at capture seem to disappear. 6. Body size of juveniles just before fledging has previously been found to be greatly affected by weather factors and the availability of high quality food during the growth period. Hence, a considerable part of the observed variation in Pre-breeding survival appears to be outside the individual's control.",83,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Barnacle goose | Body size | Branta leucopsis | Cohorts | Survival,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,83,all,All Open Access

The effects of human-caused fragmentation of boreal forest on the abundance of red fox Vulpes vulpes L. and pine marten Mattes martes L. were studied by combining the Finnish wildlife-triangle snow-track data (1990-94) with land-use and forest resources data employing the GIS. Two study areas (each 45 000 km2) located in northern and southern Finland were selected for the investigation. 2. The extent of landscape that best explained predator abundance (tracks per 10 km 24 h-1) was the same (about 100 km2) in both species and study areas. 3. The decreasing proportion of older forest and the increasing proportions of young forest and agricultural land in the landscape positively affected track density of red fox. The relationship between agricultural land and fox abundance, however, was characterized by a convex curve peaking at 20-30% of agricultural land. With the habitat classification used, landscape composition explained 26% and 11% of the spatial variation in fox abundance in the northern and southern study area, respectively. 4. The relationship between landscape composition and pine marten abundance was not as clear as in that of red fox. Landscape composition explained 10% and 6% of spatial variation in pine marten abundance in the northern and southern study area, respectively. In both areas a positive impact occurred with the increasing proportion of young forest in the landscape, but in the northern area the negative effect of increasing proportion of agricultural land was dominant. 5. The abundances of red fox and pine marten were not negatively correlated, indicating that competition or intraguild predation by red fox do not determine abundance of pine marten on a landscape scale. 6. A general increase in predation pressure by generalist predators in fragmented forest landscapes has been an intensively discussed conservation problem during recent years. We conclude that the red fox is a species potentially able to cause elevated predation pressure in boreal landscapes fragmented by human activities, but that the evidence against the pine marten is weaker.",153,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Finland | Forest fragmentation | Geographical information systems | Landscape ecology | Predation,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,84,all,All Open Access

Using long-term data sets from two lowland floodplain forest bank vole populations in central Europe, we tested two predictions that with increasing densities: (i) proportions of nonparous females in winter populations would increase; and (ii) age of both nonparous and parous females would increase. These two predictions follow from the assumption that changes in age structure are driven by density-dependent shifts in age at first reproduction. Both populations were sampled by snap trapping between 1956 and 1976. 2. For each year, we examined samples of animals collected between November and April for proportions of females with and without breeding experience and analysed their variation in age relative to the population density. The presence or absence of placental scars was used to discriminate between the parous and nonparous animals. Age was determined by measuring the length of the first mandibular molar (M1) roots. 3. Both populations exhibited multi-annual fluctuations in numbers closely resembling those in northern Fennoscandia. The proportion of nonparous females in our total sample was 0.73, suggesting that it is uncommon for parous female bank voles to breed in two successive years and that their life histories are largely designed for breeding in one season only as a major reproductive strategy. 4. Using a logistic-binomial regression model, we found that the probability of females being nonparous or parous at capture varied significantly with time, space and population density. The final model producing the best fit to data predicted that the proportion of nonparous females would be slightly larger over winter and substantially larger after high-density breeding seasons, which is consistent with the tested prediction. 5. With increasing densities during the breeding seasons, both the nonparous and parous females became older at the onset of winter. Again, the field evidence was consistent with the predicted pattern. The age of parous females in the autumn at high densities was older, mainly because of an increased proportion of females entering their second winter. 6. We propose a new intrinsic mechanism by which a delayed density dependence in age-specific fitness components can arise in microtines. This mechanism, based on an increased bimodality in age at first reproduction towards northern latitudes, has a potential to explain the south-north gradient in cyclicity observed in microtine populations in Fennoscandia.",43,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Age at first reproduction | Age structure | Population dynamics | Seasonality | Senescence,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,85,NA,NA

We used path analysis to investigate the causal relationships between Iberian lynx and Egyptian mongoose track numbers, and to estimate the direct effect of the former on the latter in the Donana area (2750 km2), south-western Spain. Relative abundance of rabbits, shrub cover and protection level were also considered in the path analysis. 2. An observational study consisting of a repeated track survey with a split-plot design was also carried out between 1990 and 1996 to independently test the results obtained by path analysis. 3. Maximum likelihood ratio tests of the goodness-of-fit of the model to the data and other indices used all indicated that the proposed theoretical model depicting the relationships among variables was adequate. Egyptian mongooses suffered a significant direct negative effect from lynx, and rabbits and protection level positively, and significantly affected lynx track abundance; rabbits were also significantly affected by shrub cover (all these standardized partial correlation coefficients ranged from 0.34 to 0.41). Shrub cover did not directly affect either lynx or mongoose tracks. 4. Relatively important indirect effects were found between shrubs and lynx (0.12), and between rabbits and mongooses (- 0-14), and protection and mongooses (- 0.17). The two latter non-intuitive indirect effects were through the lynx path, as a consequence of the negative direct influence of lynx on mongooses. 5. The repeated track censuses confirmed that lynx presence significantly affects number of mongoose tracks. In areas without lynx, mean number of mongoose tracks were 3-6 times higher than in areas with lynx. 6. It remains an interesting question which of several proposed hypotheses explains co-existence of both species in south-western Spain.",38,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Herpestes ichneumon | Lynx pardinus | Path analysis | Regional scale | Spatial relationships,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,86,NA,NA
