Allometricians, after much debate and error, derived satisfactory interpretations for the parameters of this function. The coefficient proved difficult because it is not invariant under change of scale and often makes no biological sense as the value of y (number of species) when x equals 1 unit. Coefficients of power functions should not be neglected or ignored by ecologists.-from Author",59,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Differentiation rates account for 95% of the variance in the length of the larval period, while growth rates account for less than 50% of the variance. The probability of completing metamorphosis at a given time is a function of current developmental stage and of differentiation rate. Growth parameters are poor predictors of metamorphosis, because the relationship between growth and differentiation varies as a function of the abiotic and biotic environment. Differentia- tion rate, growth rate, and stage-specific growth can be expressed as functions of environmental parameters such as temperature and density. Data presented support the hypothesis that temperature is a major proximal factor determining larval growth and differentiation patterns. Temperature effects on developmental rates during metamorphosis can be expressed by a modification of Belehraidek's equation, previously applied only to embryonic development.",282,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,BMS 74-19664,0,FALSE,2,NSF,National Science Foundation
