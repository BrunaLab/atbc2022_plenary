We examined these predictions by measuring fine root biomass (<2 mm diam.) and the timing of root growth and disappearance in an old growth tropical moist forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Republic of anama, in the fifth year of a dry season irrigation experiment. Irrigated soil had greater available P concentrations; however, a more pronounced effect was less stable soil aggregates causing higher bulk density. Irrigation did not affect fine root biomass. Mean (± SE) biomass between 0 and 30 cm was 372 ± 63 g/m2 within control versus 286 ± 39 g/m2 within irrigated plots. Mean biomass between 45 and 75 cm was 74 ± 7 g/m2 within control versus 62 ± 7 g/m2 within irrigated plots. Dead roots were less than eight percent of the total. We characterized root growth using in-growth screens (1.7 mm mesh) installed between 0 and 15 cm. Root density in the screens peaked soon after the rains began in the control plots but during the dry season in the irrigated plots. Very few dead roots accumulated in the screens, with no differences seasonally or among treatments. We developed a model to estimate birth and death rates of fine roots using root densities in the in-growth screens and the disappearance of roots laced into screens and incubated in situ. Inferred root birth rates were greatest in the early part of the wet season in control plots and in the dry season in irrigated plots. Inferred mortality rates of fine roots less than four months old were reduced by irrigation, but this was offset by much greater disappearance of six- to eight-month-old roots in the irrigated plots. Although irrigation altered the timing of root growth and mortality, roots did not grow year-round in the always-wet soil. Therefore, soil water availability was an important cue for root growth, but an inherent seasonal cycle remained. Fine roots died continuously throughout the year and disappeared quickly.",NA,NA

We resurveyed the vegetation in permanent plots at 7 and 18 months after the hurricane to document structural damage of the forest and evaluate early recovery patterns. The intensity of damage was patchy across the landscape. Mortality (≥5 cm DBH) ranged from 14 to 100 percent (by density) among the 23 different plots and averaged 47.7 percent across all plots. Reductions in total basal area ranged from 9 to 100 percent, averaging 42.4 percent. Mortality increased by 9 percent between surveys at 7 and 18 months post-hurricane. Interspecific differences in susceptibility to wind damage appeared to be a primary factor contributing to spatial patterns in mortality. Laguncularia racemosa experienced much less mortality (26%) than either Rhizophora mangle (50%) or Avicennia germinans (64%), and plot-level mortality was strongly associated with differences in species composition. There were no clear relationships between canopy height and tree damage at this site. Over 80 percent of the of the surviving R. mangle trees exhibited less than 50 percent crown damage, whereas ca 60 percent of the L. racemosa survivors suffered almost complete (75-100%) crown loss. By 18 months after the hurricane, the percentage of L. racemosa trees in the 75 to 100 percent damage class was reduced to 20 percent; in contrast, the health of many R. mangle individuals appeared to be declining, as the percentage of trees in the 50 to 100 percent damage class increased from 16 to 36 percent. Understory light levels, as measured by the gap light index, increased from an average value of 3 percent in the pre-hurricane forest to 51 percent at 7 months after the hurricane and decreased slightly to 47 percent at 18 months. Few saplings (>1 m tall and <5 cm DBH) survived the hurricane; 72 percent of the tagged individuals in transect-based plots and 66 percent of saplings in pre-hurricane canopy gaps were killed. Seedling and sapling populations of all three species appear to be recovering rapidly although their densities still are lower than in the pre-hurricane forest. It is too early to predict the trajectory of forest recovery, and continued monitoring of the spatial and temporal patterns of forest development is needed to improve our understanding of the role that large-scale disturbance events play on the dynamics of mangrove forest ecosystems.",NA,NA

Assemblage composition was most similar at logged and unlogged sites. The logged forest herpetofauna had higher species richness and abundance than the unlogged forest, but diversity was greater in the unlogged forest due to greater evenness. In contrast, the pine plantation site had the highest richness, abundance, and evenness of the three study sites, but species composition was distinct from the other areas. Herpetofaunal densities were significantly lower in all three areas during the dry season than in the wet season. During the dry season, soil moisture, litter mass, topography, shrub cover, and number of fallen logs were significant positive predictors of herpetofaunal presence in litter plots, but only soil moisture was significant in the wet season. The interaction of moisture and topography appears to be important in determining seasonal patterns of litter herpetofaunal distribution. Comparison of litter herpetofaunal studies across the tropics have shown that mid-elevation faunas generally support fewer species than lowland faunas.

The mistletoe Psittacanthus schiedeanus (Loranthaceae) was studied for a five-month period in cloud forest remnants in central Veracruz, Mexico, to determine its seed dispersal ecology. We hypothesized that dispersal ecology of this mistletoe species is directly affected by the fruit-eating bird abundance, and asked if this species is following the high-investment strategy as suggested by Godschalk (1983). To evaluate this, we determined the morphological and nutritional characteristics of mistletoe fruit, the availability of ripe fruits along the mistletoe fruiting phenology, and the abundance of fruit-eating birds. Because P. schiedeanus is dispersed by generalist rather than specialist birds, we asked if this mistletoe species is ripening fruits during the fruit scarcity time (with highest possibilities of being consumed and dispersed by birds). We compared P. schiedeanus ripe fruit production to the cloud forest tree leaf fall and fruit production. Psittacanthus schiedeanus matures its nutritious fruits from November to April, with a peak of abundance in January and February. We found a synchrony between the abundance of P. schiedeanus ripe fruits and the abundance of Gray Silky-flycatchers (Ptilogonys cinereus) and Social Flycatchers (Myiozetetes similis); however, this was not the case with Cedar Waxwings (Bombycilla cedrorum), although these birds play an important role in the mistletoe dispersal.

Bats usually began foraging during dusk, sometimes before sunset, and also foraged during twilight in the morning. Mean use of available twilight by four radio-tagged bats was 75 percent. Twilight foraging made up, on average, 47 percent of the total foraging time of these bats (range = 25-96%), although twilight consisted of only 12 percent of the available time between sunset and sunrise the next morning. Eight species of potential predators (7 birds and 1 mammal) were observed within a 1 km radius of the colony, of which 5 species are predicted to regularly capture bats. Bats took a wide diversity of prey (11 insect orders, including at least 27 families, and spiders) that ranged in wing length from 2.0 to 54.0 mm. Major orders in the diet were Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera. Prey of secondary importance included Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Isoptera, and Neuroptera. Bats captured large numbers of insects that were only available or had marked peaks in abundance during twilight. These groups induded small, swarming insects (especially flies) that have peaks in flight activity at dusk and dawn, large diurnal species (especially dragonflies) that have crepuscular activity, and winged termites that emerge in swarms at dusk.

We asked the following questions: (1) To what degree do arboreal seed dispersers influence the species richness and abundance of the seed rain? and (2) Based on the plant species and strata of the forest for which they provide dispersal services, do arboreal seed dispersers represent similar or distinct functional groups? To answer these questions, seed rain was sampled for 12 months in the Dja Reserve, Cameroon. Seed traps representing five percent of the crown area were erected below the canopies of 90 trees belonging to nine focal tree species: 3 dispersed by monkeys, 3 dispersed by large frugivorous birds, and 3 wind-dispersed species. Seeds disseminated by arboreal seed dispersers accounted for ca 12 percent of the seeds and 68 percent of the seed species identified in seed traps. Monkeys dispersed more than twice the number of seed species than large frugivorous birds, but birds dispersed more individual seeds. We identified two distinct functional dispersal groups, one composed of large frugivorous birds and one composed of monkeys, drop dispersers, and seed predators. These groups dispersed plants found in different canopy strata and exhibited low overlap in the seed species they disseminated.

Flowering in this palm is continuous throughout the year, both at the individual and population level. This long and continuous flowering pattern may represent an adaptation to increase the chances of reproduction in a environment of high and unpredictable rainfall. The species is self-compatible, but self-pollination is possible only when there is overlap of male and female inflorescences (38% of the cases). Only 28 percent of the stigmas of 1020 flowers received pollen grains and 20 percent developed pollen tubes in the styles. Of all the flowers produced by an inflorescence, 14 percent initiated fruit development but only 3 percent develop into mature fruits. Seventy-six percent of the initiated fruits were aborted.",NA,NA

The large, stony endocarps of Attalea butyraceae decay slowly and bear distinctive scars when opened by rodents or beetles. We determined the final distance between endocarps and reproductive trees (which we call an ecologically effective dispersal distance), the predation status of each endocarp, and the distance between seedlings and reproductive trees. The 68 focal trees were divided among 14 sites and four levels of anthropogenic disturbance. Levels of disturbance included full protection from poachers, light and heavy pressure from poachers, and small island habitat fragments. Ecologically effective seed dispersal distances were greatest for protected sites, intermediate for lightly poached sites, and shortest for heavily poached sites and habitat fragments. Seed predation by rodents increased with distance to the nearest reproductive Attalea and was greatest for fully protected sites, intermediate for lightly poached sites, and least for heavily poached sites and habitat fragments. Seed predation by beetles reversed the patterns described for seed predation by rodents. Total seed predation by beetles and rodents combined was independent of distance, greatest for fully protected sites, and lower for poached sites and habitat fragments. Seedling densities were always greatest close to reproductive trees; however, the increase in seedling densities close to reproductive trees was minimal for fully protected sites, clearly evident for poached sites, and pronounced for habitat fragments. Increased seedling recruitment near conspecific trees may in time reduce tree diversity where humans disrupt mammal communities.",NA,NA

Specifically, it examines the influence of decreasing latitude and variations in elevation on the character, richness, and abundance of the arboreal rain forest ant fauna, and also the relative contribution of ants to the total arthropod community. The sites that were examined included: cool temperate Nothofagus cunninghamii forest from a range of locations in Victoria; cool temperate N. moorei forest at both Werrikimbe and Styx River, New South Wales; notophyll vine forest in Lamington National Park, southeast Queensland; high elevation notophyll vine forest in Eungella National Park, central Queensland; complex notophyll vine forest at Robson Creek, Atherton Tablelands, north Queensland; complex mesophyll vine forest at Cape Tribulation, north Queensland; and mixed dipterocarp forest in Brunei. Although these sites represent a gradient increasingly tropical in character, botanically speaking, Eungella is less tropical than Lamington because of its high elevation. All samples were obtained by fogging the canopy with a rapid-knockdown pyrethrin pesticide. In all cases, circular funnels were suspended beneath the foliage of individual trees or small plots of mixed canopy. Arthropods were collected four hours after fogging. Following ordinal sorting, ants were identified and counted to morphospecies level. The resulting catch were then standardized across sites as numbers caught per 0.5 m2 sampling funnel. Generic and species richness were higher at the lowland tropical Cape Tribulation sites than at the sites to the south and was comparable with values in the Brunei site. Species richness was negatively correlated with latitude and elevation. Within the Australian rain forest, the lowland/highland break appears to be the strongest predictor of ant relative abundance, with a weaker latitudinal relationship superimposed.",NA,NA

In the early 1990s, this plant was found to have invaded an unexpected site, an undisturbed continental tropical forest at Pasoh, Peninsular Malaysia. In 1997, a study was conducted of the C. hirta population at the Pasoh Forest Reserve. A demographic survey of the 50-ha long-term research plot at Pasoh located 1002 C. hirta individuals, 69 of which were reproductive at the time of the study. All but 8 individuals were located in high light gaps or gap edges. Relative growth rates were significantly higher in gaps and gap edges than in the understory, and no reproductive individuals were found in the understory. Mean plant size and dry biomass density increased steadily over the course of the study, while the observed mortality rate was 0 percent over two months. The biomass density of Clidemia at Pasoh was <500 g/ha at the conclusion of this study, but because the population is confined almost exclusively to high light environments, its density in these sites is much higher. The location of C. hirta plants in gaps was significantly correlated with past disturbance by wild pigs, suggesting that soil disturbance and light availability are essential for their establishment. The implication of this study is that by competing with native species in gaps, C. hirta invasion has the potential to alter forest regeneration at Pasoh. Changing land use practices near the reserve have increased the number of wild pigs, and thus the level of disturbance, which may explain the recent success of C. hirta at Pasoh.",NA,NA

To establish the food preferences of this species, we: (1) conducted cafeteria trials in the laboratory whereby individual mice were offered seeds and a selection of herbaceous vegetation from the habitat; (2) surveyed the habitat for piles of vegetation dipped by these mice and identified these clippings to species; and (3) estimated the abundance of plant species in the habitat to determine if the mice were dipping species in proportion to their availability. Our results indicated that S. mearnsi prefers green vegetation to seeds, at least during wet seasons, and that it has a strong preference for forbs. In cafeteria trials, S. mearnsi chose 93 percent green vegetation and only 7 percent seeds. The forb Commelina africana was highly preferred over other food items offered. In the habitat, two forbs, C. africana and Monsonia angustifolia, constituted > 40 percent of the piles of clippings, although these two species together made up < 4 percent of the available vegetation.

To determine potential effects of this habitat loss on the region's avifauna, we examined the relative use of different forest stages by resident and migrant birds during the nonbreeding season. We used the fixed-width transect method to compare the distribution, abundance, and diversity of forest birds in early (five to ten years old), mid (15-25 years), and late (>50 years) successional forests in the state of Campeche, Mexico, in the south-central part of the peninsula. All stages of successional forest had highly similar bird assemblages and did not differ in bird abundance or diversity. Both migrant and resident birds occurred across the successional gradient. The majority of habitat specialists, however, were resident birds restricted to late-successional forest, indicating that early secondary growth may not be suitable for all species. Furthermore, resident birds that typically participate in mixed-species flocks attained their greatest densities in the oldest forest habitat. Rapid recovery of pre-disturbance physiognomic features, in addition to high levels of habitat connectivity in the region, may contribute to similar bird communities across a range of successional stages. The high degree of edge characterizing much of the forest mosaic also may allow birds access to different seral stages. Loss of late-successional forest, however, is likely to adversely affect the subset of resident avifauna that depends on unique features of mature habitat such as snags, large trees, and climatic buffering. Conservation efforts in Campeche should focus on the specialized requirements of the most habitat-restricted species while preserving the current landscape mosaic characteristic of the small-scale shifting cultivation system.",NA,NA

Mean tree density at the study site (564 trees/ha, SE = 23.7) was similar to other tropical sites, but mean liana density was much higher (2471 lianas/ha, SE = 104.3). Basal area of trees ≥10 cm DBH was low in Oquiriquia (19.2 m2/ha) in comparison to other tropical forests.

Four tree species (Astrocaryum aculeatum, Euterpe precatoria, Xylopia sericea, and Astronium fraxinifolium) had a lower proportion of liana-infested individuals than expected based on the mean percent of liana infestation in this forest. Forest plots with similar tree species composition did not have similar liana composition or liana loads per tree, which suggests that lianas and trees have no specific associations with each other. Lianas showed an aggregated distribution on trees, suggesting a facilitation process in which new lianas use already established ones to climb trees. Lianas of four different climbing mechanisms climbed a similar number of trees. Plots in the forest with high palm density also had high liana density, suggesting that palms and lianas respond positively to common forest conditions in the study site (perhaps related to successional forest status). Larger-diameter trees carried more lianas than slender trees, but this relationship was affected by the density of trees 10-30 cm DBH surrounding each tree, which suggests again that the successional stage of the forest in which a tree grows affects the number of lianas a tree carries. We found little evidence to support the idea that lianas were more likely to climb some tree species than others. Instead, larger trees and trees growing in the vicinity of trees 10-30 cm DBH, tended to have more lianas, perhaps as result of longer exposure to liana infestation.",NA,NA

The relationship between microclimate and distance from the forest edge was examined using piecewise linear regression. All microclimatic gradients were classified into one of nine shapes based on the sign and the size of the two estimated slopes. The relative frequency in the shapes of 65 percent of air temperature gradients, 52 percent of vapor pressure deficit gradients, and 62 percent of light intensity gradients along forest edge transects exceeded the relative frequency of these same shapes along forest interior transects, indicating that a majority of the forest edge microclimatic gradients measured were influenced by edge effects. Yet this result also indicated that approximately one-third of all air temperature and light intensity gradients and nearly one-half of all vapor pressure deficit gradients recorded during this study were affected by factors independent of edge effects per se, and that forest edge microclimatic gradients were temporally nonconstant. For air temperature and vapor pressure deficit gradients, low spatial but high temporal variation existed in estimated edge width and the relative change in microclimate between the forest edge and interior. For light intensity gradients, both high spatial and temporal variability characterized estimated edge width and relative change in microdimate between the forest edge and interior. The pooled mean edge width and relative change in microclimate between the forest edge and interior across the four forest edge transects for air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, and light intensity gradients were 94.1 m and 2.00°C, 82.6 m and 0.29 kPa, and 60.5 m and 10.6 joules/sec/m2, respectively.

During a three-year study of tadpole assemblage composition, we found that the anuran community used a variety of bodies of water for reproduction; these ranged from streams and streamside ponds to isolated forest ponds. The distribution of several tadpole species was negatively related to fish density, while other species coexisted with high densities of fish. Tadpole size did not ensure survival against fish, and few tadpoles avoided fish by hiding in the leaf litter. Controlled predation experiments using a single tadpole species in a no-choice situation were conducted over 24- to 48-hour periods. Nearly all species of tadpoles that occurred in habitats with high fish densities were unpalatable to fish (except Centrolenella oyampiensis), indicating that unpalatability is a major adaptation allowing tadpoles and fish to coexist in this system. Unpalatability (to fish), however, was not an effective antipredator defense against odonate larvae, the other major tadpole predator in this system. The combination of predation pressure and the anti-predator traits exhibited by individual species largely determined the composition of tadpole assemblages in individual bodies of water (α diversity). The heterogeneous distribution of predators among bodies water and the diversity of antipredator defenses exhibited by larval amphibians facilitated high diversity in this community (β diversity).",NA,NA

Heterophragma quadriloculare is a self-incompatible hermaphroditic tree solely pollinated at night by the carpenter bee Xylocopa (Mesotrichia) tenuiscapa Westwood, whose pollinating flights were lunar insensitive and unaffected by low nighttime temperatures (2-14°C). The number of carpenter bees visiting a tree per minute and the number of flowers visited per foraging bout were positively related to the size of the floral display. We found that floral display size was negatively related to fruit set but positively related to absolute fruit numbers. In pollen carryover experiments, cross-pollen did not travel far in sequences of non-emasculated flowers (up to the 4th flower), but traveled farther in emasculated flower sequences (up to the 15th flower) as evidenced by fruit set in these sequences. The relatively poor fruit set on trees with many open flowers may have resulted from deposition of self-pollen on touch-sensitive stigmas, which close on first contact. Because large-girth trees tend to have large floral displays, trees may increasingly realize a higher percentage of fitness through male rather than female function as they age.

Although numerous phenological responses (i.e., leaf flushing, flowering, and fruit maturation) have been shown to be associated with seasonality in the tropics, little is known about the relationship between seasonality and levels of clonal reproduction. I examined the temporal and spatial variation in clonal reproduction and its potential trade-off with growth and survival for a tropical understory herb, Aechmea magdalenae (André) André ex Baker, Handb. Bromel (Bromeliaceae). I addressed the following questions: (1) how do vegetative growth, survival, and clonal reproduction (i.e., rhizome and ramet production) vary between seasons and between years?; (2) how do these factors differ among populations?; and (3) do simulated dry and wet season light levels cause similar variation in rosette survival and vegetative and clonal reproduction, as found in natural populations? Rhizome and ramet production in A. magdalenae was found to be highly influenced by seasonality. During the transition from dry to wet season, there was a significant decrease in survival and a significant increase in clonal reproduction, and rosettes tended to grow at a slower rate. Rosettes in the location with the longest dry season had significantly lower survival, higher clonal reproduction, and a slower growth rate. Clonal reproduction also started at smaller rosette sizes in the most seasonal forest. When light levels were manipulated, rhizome and ramet production were significantly greater under the high light conditions, and rosette growth (change in longest leaf length) was significantly lower. Results from this study suggest that A. magdalenae responds to higher light levels by shifting investment from vegetative growth to clonal reproduction.

To assess resident hummingbird use of forest fragments near the Las Cruces Biological Station in southwestern Costa Rica, we mist-netted birds in five fragments (0.3-20 ha; ca 1300 m elev.) and the station's 226-ha forest preserve (ca 900-1280 m elev.). From January 1994 through mid-March 1999, we recorded 1069 captures of 21 hummingbird species during 49,900 net hours. Species richness, diversity indices, and capture rates increased asymptotically with patch size, as expected. We captured 16 hummingbird species in both the largest fragment (20 ha) and in the nearby forest preserve. Non-forest hummingbirds did not occur more frequently in the fragments than in the preserve, and all fragments supported a mixture of forest-interior and canopy-dwelling hummingbird species, along with a diverse group of hummingbird-pollinated plants. Phaethornis guy was common at all sites and visited ≥13 plant species in the fragments during the 1998 dry season (based on analyses of pollen collected from the birds' heads). In contrast, Eutoxeres aquila was found at only the largest three sites (10, 20, and 226 ha) and carried pollen from only one plant species during the 1998 dry season. Lampornis castaneoventris, a high-elevation hummingbird species, was far more common in the fragments than in the preserve, while three species typically found at lower elevations were rare in the fragments and common in the preserve. These distribution patterns could be influenced by local climatic differences because the fragments are higher and receive more cloud mist and annual precipitation than the preserve. Our data show that pollen loads on hummingbird species vary, and this has implications for gene flow among hummingbird-pollinated plants. Although our results are consistent with previous reports that hummingbird species may be less affected by deforestation than insectivorous avian species such as army ant followers, it is important to note that from the perspective of the genetics and demographics of hummingbird-pollinated plants, the important issue is whether appropriate pollinator species are able to move plant propagules among subpopulations of plants in fragmented landscapes. We conclude that the biodiversity of tropical forest fragments as small as 10 to 20 ha is high enough to warrant long-term preservation of these areas, especially if they are located near larger tracts of forest.",NA,NA

Contrary to the assumption of resource limitation, B. succulenta showed unusually prolific flowering after Hurricane Lili stripped leaves from most of the plants in October 1996. I predicted that the abundant flowering would saturate pollinators and that fruit set would be pollination-limited. Fruit set was strongly pollination-limited by 71 percent. Butterflies are probably the major pollinators and were present at the site, but they rarely visited B. succulenta flowers even though flowers were brimming with nectar. Nectarivorous birds (Bananaquits and Bahama Woodstars) visit B. succulenta flowers, but their populations were decimated by Hurricane Lili and they rarely visited flowers during this time. Fruit set was also severely predation-limited; a moth caterpillar (Gelechiidae) was extremely abundant and ate buds, flowers, and fruits, causing a further 68 percent reduction in fruit set. Together, pollination limitation and predation limitation reduced fruit set to only 7 percent or less. Predation was also intense in 1999 after Hurricane Floyd and resulted in 11 percent fruit set or less. Whether or not hurricanes were the cause of limited pollinators or abundant predators, the resulting low fruit set could have population effects because hurricanes can provide opportunities for the recruitment of new plants.

Guavas and mangos accounted for 85 percent of the fruit biomass entering the stream and 92 percent of the fruit exported from the stream. Mean daily export rates of guava were 7 percent of input, and export rates of mango were 5 percent of input. These measurements suggested that most of the fruit entering the stream is retained and comprises a substantial food resource for detritivores. Comparisons of the biomass-specific rates at which M. lar and T. granifera processed mangos and guavas with the rates at which mangos and guavas entered Kaiwiki Stream suggested that these invertebrates can process most of the detrital fruit in the stream.",NA,NA

In this study, we estimated the cost of cutting lianas in 12 plots of 0.25 ha each in a densely liana-infested forest of lowland Bolivia, and evaluated the efficiency of this silvicultural treatment in terms of the proportion of lianas missed, the density of resprouting liana stumps, and the number of liana-infested trees after two years of an experimental liana treatment. The cost of cutting lianas in this forest by locally hired laborers was 23.6 (SE = 2.48) person-hours/ha. Considering local cost of labor and the U.S.-Bolivian currency exchange rate at the time of the study, this figure translates to ca $15/ha. Liana density decreased from 2471 (SE = 104.3) to 130 (SE = 24.2) liana stems ≥2 cm/ha immediately after cutting, because 5.5 percent of lianas were left uncut (missed). Slender lianas were missed more often than lianas with large-diameter stems. Liana species that grow 2-3 m before they start to twine were also frequently missed. Twenty-two percent of liana stumps ≥2 cm sprouted after cutting. Liana stumps with larger diameters sprouted more than stumps with smaller diameters. Most liana stumps produced only two sprouts. Two years after cutting, 78 percent of trees had no living lianas in their crowns, in contrast to only 13 percent liana-free trees in the control plots. Sixtyfour percent of trees still had hanging dead lianas two years after cutting, but only 23 percent of trees were reinvaded by lianas using dead liana stems as trellises. Liana cutting can efficiently reduce the number of lianas in liana-infested forests, and the effects of cutting lianas last for at least two years; however, the treatment is expensive. Thus, we recommend that it is better to view liana cutting as a preventive activity to avoid liana infestation, rather than as a corrective measure after poor management. Liana cutting can be easily conducted along with other reduced-impact logging practices.",NA,NA

Research in the quality of organic inputs, a key factor controlling rates of decomposition and nutrient release, continues to guide selection and use of organic materials as nutrient sources. The relationship between decomposition patterns and the quality parameters of the fresh leaves of six agroforestry species: Sesbania sesban, Croton megalocarpus, Calliandra calothyrsus, Tithonia diversifolia, Lantana camara, and Senna spectabilis, was investigated in a litterbag study over a period of 77 days in the highlands of western Kenya. The litterbags were buried 1 cm below the soil surface and covered with soil of ca 1 cm thickness. Percent leaf mass and total N and P that remained with time strongly correlated with total P and C/P ratio (R2 = 0.60-0.90) during the first 35 days of study; but afterwards, correlation was stronger with the initial soluble polyphenolics (Pp)/P ratio (R2 = 0.69-0.92) than with total P and C/P ratio. Loss of leaf mass and release of N and P followed the exponential function, yt = y0* e-kt, from which the specific decay rate constants (k) were calculated for loss of leaf mass (kB) and release of N (kN) and P (kP). Among the plant species, the k values were lowest in Calliandra with kB = 0.012/d, kN = 0.017/d and kP = 0.044/d. Lantana had the highest k values with kB = 0.067/d and kP = 0.119/d, but the highest kN value of 0.109/d occurred in Tithonia. The kB values for all organic materials were lower than their corresponding kN and kP values, suggesting that leaching of N and P from litters may have augmented the microbial mineralization of N and P. There was a strong correlation between the kB, kN, and kP, values and total P (r = 0.82-0.96; P < 0.01), but not total N, lignin (LIG), or Pp. Rates of N and P release followed the general trend: Tithonia > Senna > Lantana > Sesbania > Croton > Calliandra.

C. caniceps was larger than C. nigrovittatus and C. notatus while L. insignis was extremely small. For females, home range size was smaller in L. insignis than Callosciurus spp., which may support the body weight hypothesis: larger species have larger home ranges. Among the three Callosciurus species, female C. caniceps had the smallest home range. These differences were accounted for by habitat characteristics rather than by density or body weight; C. caniceps was dominant in bushy areas and used crowded small trees while C. notatus and C. nigrovittatus used large trees in the forest. In this study, home range size did not change seasonally; this differs from studies in temperate regions, possibly because food availability is much less variable among seasons in tropical rain forest. Home range overlap among heterospecific individuals was common but different species seemed to partition space by using different vertical levels of the forest. Consequently, the home range size and spatial overlap of sympatric squirrel species may be affected by habitat diversity in tropical rain forest.",NA,NA

The highest values of daily net CO2 uptake in both localities reflected prolonged daily periods of net CO2 uptake that included both daytime and nighttime assimilation accompanied by high rates of nocturnal net CO2 uptake due to moderate nighttime air temperatures. High temperatures in the summer reduced daily net CO2 uptake at both localities but in late summer, the nighttime temperatures at Arandas were moderate, which lead to high daily net CO2 uptake. Leaf succulence allowed substantial daily net CO2 uptake when the soil water content was relatively low during the winter and the spring (January-March). Indeed, appreciable daily net CO2 uptake occurred throughout the year for A. tequilana at both localities, indicating that this CAM plant species can sequester carbon even during prolonged dry periods.",NA,NA

Among shadehouse-grown seedlings, VAM colonization increased with increasing light intensity, from a mean of 20 percent (21.5 cm colonized root) at a light level approximating forest understory environments to 47 percent (233.1 cm) at a light level found in centers of treefall gap environments. In contrast, VAM colonization levels were similar between gap and understory habitats among field-collected sapling roots; however, the anatomy of the symbiosis differed between light environments. Roots of light gap saplings had significantly more intracellular fungal coils than understory sapling roots. At subsaturating levels for photosynthesis, light availability appeared to be a limiting resource for this symbiosis, restricting the extent of VAM fungal colonization and development of symbiotic structures. Despite this light-mediated limitation, woody seedlings showed evidence of VAM fungi in 20 to 30 percent of their roots at light levels typical of the tropical wet forest ecosystem in general. I consider these results in the context of forest dynamics, and I suggest that, for woody seedlings, maintaining moderate levels of VAM in understory environments is of long-term benefit because it enables them to respond rapidly to the increased nutrient demand imposed by their increased growth rate when canopy openings occur.",NA,NA

One of each pair was unmanaged and the other was managed by removal of nonnative plants, predominantly vines. Within these areas, we sampled vegetation in 5 × 5 m plots for stems 2 cm DBH (diameter at breast height) or greater and in 2 × 0.5 m plots for stems of all sizes. For five years, at annual censuses, we tagged and measured stems of vines, trees, shrubs and herbs in these plots. For each 5 × 5 m plot, we estimated percent coverage by individual vine species, using native and nonnative vines as classes. We investigated the hypotheses that: (1) plot coverage, occurrence and recruitment of nonnative vines were greater than that of native vines in unmanaged plots; (2) the management program was effective at reducing cover by nonnative vines; and (3) reduction of cover by nonnative vines improved recruitment of seedlings and saplings of native trees, shrubs, and herbs. In unmanaged plots, nonnative vines recruited more seedlings and had a significantly higher plot-cover index, but not a higher frequency of occurrence. Management significantly reduced cover by nonnative vines and had a significant overall positive effect on recruitment of seedlings and saplings of native trees, shrubs and herbs. Management also affected the seedling community (which included vines, trees, shrubs, and herbs) in some unanticipated ways, favoring early successional species for a longer period of time. The vine species with the greatest potential to ""strangle"" gaps were those that rapidly formed dense cover, had shade tolerant seedling recruitment, and were animal-dispersed. This suite of traits was more common in the nonnative vines than in the native vines.
