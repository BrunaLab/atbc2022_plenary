The earlier diversification was associated with a great burst of morphological invention producing many phyla, classes, and orders and displaying high per taxon rates of family origination. The later diversification lacked novel morphologies recognized as phyla and classes, produced fewer orders, and displayed lower per taxon rates of family appearances. The chief difference between the diversifications appears to be that the earlier one proceeded from relatively narrow portions of adaptive space, whereas the latter proceeded from species widely scattered among adaptive zones and representing a variety of body plans.

The evolution of species with enlarged male pedipalps appears to be associated with a change from nonpairing to pairing sperm-transfer behavior and with aggressive mate acquisition by males. Experiments with Dinocheirus arizonensis demonstrate a strong correlation between male combat ability and chela size. Superior combat ability of large males results in increased mating success only under high-density conditions. The greater success in spermatophore transfer among large males can be attributed to increased opportunity at high density for large males to interrupt matings and aggressively displace smaller males. -from Author",44,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,4

In the 1st model, it is assumed that all members of the population produce the same sex ratio under all conditions (monomorphic strategy), while in the 2nd model the sex ratio can be adjusted according to stage in the colony growth cycle (conditional strategy). Results are consistent with the typically observed effects of within-sex competition among relatives; the sex ratio is biased toward the sex with less intense competition. A number of interesting interactions are also revealed among relatedness, demography, and constraints of the sex-determining mechanism, eg when survivorship or fecundity increases as the colony grows larger, the predicted sex ratio becomes more female-biased.

Ages at sexual maturity showed similar differences. Heritability analysis was performed on body weight, growth rate, and age and weight at sexual maturity. Virtually all these traits showed significant dam effects, but small or nonexistant sire effects.

That narrow-apertured species are less affected by the barrier between the continental islands and Palau than are other rock-dwelling gastropods is consistent with the interpretation that this group has been unusually resistant to extinction and highly susceptible to founder speciation when oceanic circulation is altered.

Male-cone production was significantly correlated with tree size; highest outcrossing rates are expected on trees that are medium to large in size. While there is some temporal variation, patterns of male cone production and spatial distribution of individuals are the most important factors influencing outcrossing levels in these wind-pollinated forest trees. -from Author",54,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,46

Since its introduction c100 yr ago, P. lanceolata has been incorporated in the diet of E. editha in one of the study populations. The populations differed in oviposition preference; only the population that uses P. lanceolata contains some individuals that prefer P. lanceolata. Larvae from 2 populations, one using both P. lanceolata and C. parviflora, the other using only C. parviflora, did not differ in relative abilities to grow or survive on P. lanceolata. The potential for E. editha to use P. lanceolata appears in populations that have had no prior exposure to this plant, while oviposition preference for this plant has evolved in the population in which the plant now grows. -from Authors",104,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,47

The traditional motivation for this distinction is that the rate of evolution under natural selection depends on the (relative) magnitudes of certain genetic components of variance. Phenotypic variation may be selectively maintained in a population according to its components: selection may favor maintenance of only the environmental components, only the genetic components, or be indifferent to the composition of the variance. Even when selection is shown to favor phenotypic variation regardless of its components, the possibility exists that environmental variance will evolve to displace the genetic components or vice versa. Environmental and genetic factors may thus compete to produce a given selected level of phenotypic variance. A test of some of these models is provided from the example of seed dormancy: the prediction that variation in seed germination time should be purely environmental is supported by the demonstration of low heritability of germination time. -from Author",161,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,48

The mesial-distal and the buccal-lingual dimensions of mandibular and maxillary teeth were undergoing the same rate of reduction. From the beginning of the Post-Pleistocene until the present, the overall rate of dental reduction doubled. Buccal-lingual dimensions are now reducing twice as fast as mesial-distal dimensions, and maxillary teeth are reducing more so than mandibular teeth. Late Pleistocene rates are comparable in Europe and the Middle East. The Post-Pleistocene rates are also the same for Europe, the Middle East, China, Japan, and SE Asia. It is suggested that the cookery at the beginning of the Late Pleistocene allowed the earlier changes to occur. The use of pottery within the last 10 000yr further reduced the amount of selection that had previously maintained usable tooth substance. Reduction then occurred as a consequence of the Probable Mutation Effect.- from Authors",126,NA,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,49
