Interspecific differences in egg development in Leuctra spp are related to their habitats and flight periods (months in which adults were present).

Mean annual adult survival was 0.69+ or -0.44 for fortis and 0.82+ or -0.21 for scandens. Adult mortality in both species was negatively correlated with the abundance of small seeds per bird.

Female fortis suffered higher mortality than males in 2 out of 3 dry years. In at least 1yr, differential survival could be attributed to selection against small size.

Females maximize their lifetime egg production by minimizing the interval between clutches, rather than by maximizing the size of each clutch. Since females only engage in reproductive activity on warm, sunny days, weather has a marked effect on female egg production; bad weather means increased inter-clutch intervals and lower egg production. Clutch size is inversely related to body size. However, because large females survive for longer than small females, selection should favour large size in females.

About 11% of each cohort returned to breed in their natal colony. Immatures did not suffer the same variations in mortality as did adults; this finding is consistent with the premise that increased adult mortality associated with the decline in numbers in the late 1960s occurred prior to the breeding season. Age of first breeding fell from 5 to 4 yr in response to high adult mortality in the early 1970s; body weights and wing-lengths of male and female recruits diminished, but the body weights of male and female prospectors fluctuated little. A model of colony growth is based on the relationship between colony size and rate of increase in expanding colonies of British kittiwakes. Small colonies grow faster than large ones, and are more attractive to recruits. Small colonies cannot produce enough young during the first 70 yr and are sustained by immigration.

Juvenile survival was high in spring and autumn but low in summer, due to increased activity by predatory ants in the summer. Natural enemies were also responsible for high spatial variability in survival, there were large differences in the impact of predators, virus disease, and braconid parasites. When survival rates of whole cohorts were compared, there was little evidence of density-dependent effects, but within patches where average mortality rates were high, survival was better on those plants in the patch carrying fewer larvae. Density-dependent mortality (due mainly to predation) was thus spatially and temporally patchy, making it invisible to normal life-table analysis of whole cohorts.

Frequency of strikes and the energy intake per unit time showed similar increases, but strike frequency decreased at high fish densities. No indications of increased selectivity in prey sizes taken with increasing fish density were found. Intensity of fishing (number of orientations per unit time) and energy spend during hunting (number of steps per unit time) increased with prey density, but decreased sharply at high densities. Handling times did not constrain rate of capture at high prey densities. Rate of aggressive encounters increased significantly with number of steps taken per hunting bout, but aggression did not seem to interfere with rate of prey capture. Grey herons seemed to adjust their foraging efforts to the rate of success they were expecting to get. First-year grey herons were less successful at foraging than were adults when prey density was low, due to lower encouter rates with potential prey, but this difference decreased with increasing fish density. At very high densities both age classes performed similarly. Fishing success increases with prey density through increased encounter rates and the application of more intensive hunting strategies. Levelling-off in response at high prey densities is probably a consequence of birds becoming partly satiated within a short time. -from Author",44,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,47,NA,NA
