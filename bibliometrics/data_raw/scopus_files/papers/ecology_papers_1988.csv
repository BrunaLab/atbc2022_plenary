Seedfall was highest near the source, but if the tail of the seed shadow crossed the edge of a treefall gap, there was usually another, smaller seedfall peak, producing a bimodal pattern. Among fruiting species, small seeds were dispersed farther and were much more likely to be dispersed into adjacent treefall gaps than large seeds. Seeds dispersed out of a treefall gap had a higher probability of falling into an adjacent treefall gap than would be expected if seeds fell uniformly around a source. Natural seedfall around a treefall gap was highest at the edge of the gap, lower in the center of the gap, and lowest in the undisturbed forest. About 50% of the seeds of bird-dispersed plants in the study area had fallen into treefall gaps (16.8% of area). If seedling survival is higher in treefall gaps than in undisturbed forest for bird-dispersed plants, patterns of seedfall indicate that frugivorous birds benefit the plants by 1) dispersing most seeds into treefall gaps, 2) by increasing the diameter of the seed shadow over that produced by gravity, and 3) increasing the probability that a plant's seeds will be located at the site of a future treefall gap. -Author",95,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,4,NA,NA

During 1981 and 1982, flowering in P. arieianum was a mixture of 1) highly synchronized peaks in which most plants flowered and most of their inflorescences flowered; and 2) more extended flowering during which few plants flowered and few of their inflorescences flowered. Probability of fruit set was greater for large plants and for plants that flowered in synchrony with other plants than for small plants and plants that did not flower in synchrony with the rest of the population. The species is mostly self-incompatible, a possible explanation for the decrease in fruit set when fewer plants were flowering, but synchronization per se did not necessarily lead to high fruit set, suggesting that certain times of the year are better for flowering than others. In general, flowering was more prevalent in February and from September-October, when rainfall is predictably the lowest and pollinator services are more reliable. The primary flowering peak (February) accounted for 64% of total inflorescence and 62% of total infructescence production in 1981, and 50% of total inflorescence and 76% of total infructescence production in 1982. Fruits of individual plants from a single flowering period were dispersed over 2-4 mo. Time from flowering to final infructescence maturation was 5-9 mo. Large fruit crops and fruit set more than once per year resulted in a longer time period over which infructescences were presented to dispersers than did small fruit crops and fruit set only once per year.

Larvae can disperse >10 m/d, allowing them to transfer between microclimates. Pupae on warmer slopes also developed faster than those on cooler slopes. Microclimate also affects the phenology of host plants of larvae and nectar sources of adults. Larval and pupal development and host-plant phenology determine the phase relationship between adult butterfly flight and host-plant senescence, which in turn determines mortality rates of prediapause larvae.

Two mechanisms operate in the stream subtidal to give rise to the greater fish abundance at marsh surface sites adjacent to depositional areas. At low tide, when small fishes are confined to creek channels, they select shallow depositional habitats where 1) the availability of benthic invertebrate prey is greatest and 2) predator pressure is less.

No evidence existed for an increase in reproductive effort with age. During incubation, adult mass, relative to body size, was negatively correlated with age, but the reduced mass of older birds is not evidence of increased reproductive effort since 1) birds provided with supplemental food did not gain mass during incubation; 2) older birds were as likely as young birds to lay a 4th egg if the first was removed; and 3) birds were not limited in foraging time during incubation and the end of the nestling period.

Demographic transition rates, and predictions of long-term population growth, differed markedly between transition periods and among locations, with the biggest differences being attributable to location. Elasticity analysis indicates that, in all cases studied, a large proportion of long-term population growth can be ascribed to demographic processes associated with individuals in the largest size classes. However, this aspect of the demography does not differ appreciably among locations or between years and, consequently, does not explain the observed demographic variability. Some of the variability arises from differences in the rate of recruitment of smaller invididuals into the larger size classes.

Repeated alternations of regeneration cycles of Sphagnum cushions and black spruce Picea mariana over the last 5050 14C yr of peatland development suggest climate, self-building mechanisms, and cyclic-autogenic succession as dominant factors operating in the absence of external disturbance such as fire. During the last several thousand years, self-perpetuating vegetation cycles, occurring at variable periodicity, have been controlled primarily by local ecological conditions. Water supply for peat production, in the absence of a water table in most sites, was controlled by snow availability, precipitation, and atmospheric humidity from the large lake. Allogenic succession, illustrated by community shifts from Sphagnum girgensohnii-Picea to S. russowii-Picea, S. fuscum-Picea, and lichen-heath, has been initiated by climate, and more particularly by continuous peat accumulation enhancing the ecological gradient from moist, snow-protected conditions to snowless, exposed conditions. Absence of such changes at some sites characterized by a uniform, self-regenerated S. fuscum-Picea assemblage suggests that autogenic succession has been an active driving mechanism in community persistence over several thousand years. Long-term trends in peatland development toward topographic equilibrium and Late Holocene cooling best explain the gradual phasing-out of the vegetation cycles.

The larger species of insectivore dug extensively in the topsoil and subsurface litter to obtain prey; the smaller species foraged on the litter surface or in trees. The larger species also exploited denser and structurally more complex microhabitats. These differences in foraging behaviour allowed the larger insectivores in each community to exploit prey 7-19% longer than those encountered by the smaller species. Controlled removal of the larger species of insectivore produced marked changes in the microhabitat use and prey size selection of the remaining species.

Rates of height growth, lateral growth and production of new shoots in even the low gap light levels created by small canopy gaps (15-75m2) were as much as an order of magnitude greater than growth rates of saplings beneath closed canopies, but saplings showed little response to further increases in gap light levels. The strong response of maple saplings to low gap light levels was correlated with an increase in sapling leaf area index and the efficiency of leaf display (leaf area per unit length or surface area of branches). In beech, the more modest response to low light levels in small gaps and the higher growth rates than maple beneath a closed canopy were paralleled by a lack of significant increase in beech leaf area indices in small gaps and a higher efficiency of leaf display beneath a closed canopy than in small gaps. Thus, the magnitude of the response of these 2 species to small canopy gaps is correlated with their degree of plasticity in patterns of branching and leaf display.

Within each class, 2 associations were recognized, differing in the degree to which one species managed to dominate the vegetation. Ordination showed that these vegetation types were arranged along 2 major axes: a standing crop and litter gradient, and a water depth gradient. Species richness was greatest just above the late August waterline in E. smallii vegetation that had low fertility, intermediate total biomass (250 g/m2) and low littermass (30 g/m2). Very high biomass (>400 g/m2) was observed where indices of high fertility and low disturbance coincided. Low species richness in this Typha-dominated vegetation is probably a result of competitive exclusion. Exposure to waves, ice and flowing water produced a fertility gradient. The least fertile sites had small evergreen species such as Eriocaulon septangulare and Ranunculus flammula. These species possessed traits associated with Grime's ""stress tolerator' strategy. The main factors controlling vegetation composition were water depth, effects of spring flooding in removing litter, and the fertility gradient produced by waves and flowing water.

Intake rate is thus a direct function of processing constraints (chewing) imposed by plant tissues on the herbivore.

The overall decay rate constant (k) for snags and logs in the Cascade Range, calculated directly from the chronosequence, was 0.029 yr-1. Volume and biomass of CWD differed significantly in old-growth stands (>200 yr old) among site moisture classes. Dry sites averaged 72 Mg/ha, moderate sites 137 Mg/ha, and moist sites 174 Mg/ha. The dynamics of CWD were modeled for 3 fire histories, each beginning with an initial fire in an old-growth stand but differing in number and severity of subsequent fires. All models exhibited low values of CWD between 80-200 yr. The lowest and most prolonged minimum in CWD during succession occurred when additional fires burned early in succession, which probably happened preceding many stands in the southern Coast Range. A steady-state condition in CWD may not be reached for >1000 yr. The nature and timing of disturbance play a key role in the dynamics of CWD in the region. -from Authors",450,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,154,NA,NA

Two sawfly exclosure-enclosure experiments on plants that had been established from cuttings from clones showed reduced reproductive bud production on plants with galls at both the whole-plant and individual-shoot levels; whole-plant losses of 34-56% and per shoot losses of 17-55% of reproductive buds on different clones were coupled with densities that varied from 0.56-2.70 galls per shoot. Most plants suffered relatively small reproductive losses because of low sawfly densities, but 20% of all plants suffered losses of 10%, while 7.5% experienced losses of 20% or more of their reproductive potential. A small willow clone attacked over the range of 0.5-2.0 galls per shoot would lose 381 000-1 500 000 seeds of a potential 3 760 000 seeds in the year of attack. Genetic variation among plants in susceptibility to sawfly attack and subsequent herbivore-related reproductive loss was suggested; some clones has 12 times as many galls as others.

Species utilized more habitats and subdivided them less in Corsica than on the mainland. The Corsican forest bird community was composed of a few small-sized resident species with very high populations. Thus insular faunas are very different in early and late stages of succession. Differences in species allocation to habitats between the island and the mainland are better explained by two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses than by a release in interspecific competition. The 1st is the ""habitat appropriateness' hypothesis, which predicts that the more closely a habitat resembles that which is optimal for a species on the mainland, the more species will compensate for the population densities of absent competitors. This is the case for the bird communities of the Corsican forests, which exhibit the main features of an insular syndrome, ie species impoverishment, high population densities, and intraspecific spillover. Given an equitable climate and a stable level of resources, survival on the island is higher than on the mainland, dispersal is restricted, and populations expand into shrubby habitats as a result of spillover from optimal habitats. This explanation is supported by the 2nd hypothesis, the ""defence hypothesis' which stipulates that a stable allocation of resources all the year round in the benign insular environment results in a decrease in the vigor of territorial defense, a decrease in territory size, and an increase in territory overlap, which in turn allows for more individuals to coexist in the same amount of space. Studies on the population biology of tits of the genus Parus show that, compared to their mainland counterparts, Corsican populations of tits exhibit social structures supporating this hypothesis. -from Authors",83,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,178,NA,NA

AGs tended by polydomous but probably monogynous Azteca cf. traili occurred on average in smaller isolates. All 3 ant species enriched nest gardens with vertebrate feces, but frequencies of occurrence of most AG epiphytes were lower on the less organic carton of Azteca AGs. Interspecific differences in epiphyte abundance and distribution were related to light requirements of plants and to colonizing abilities. AG aggregations occupied 16-39% of five forest habitat types present and were especially common in frequently flooded habitats and areas of high light intensity. Patchy distribution was explained partly by overrepresentation on resource trees, such as Inga and Calyptranthes (parabiotic ants) and Cordia nodosa (Azteca). Other arboreal ants, but not terrestrial ants, were markedly lower in AG aggregations, perhaps due to competition from aggressive and dominant AG ants. AGs formed principally by directed dispersal of epiphyte seeds to ant nests, where larvae fed on seed attachments without damaging seeds. AG ants also recognized and retrieved seeds of at least one AG epiphyte from feces of vertebrate fruit dispersers. Seed attractiveness may depend in part on nonnutritional cues. Preadapations of plants and ants appear to have been very important to the origin of AGs.

The applicability of Tilman's model to mammals was evaluated by regressing rodent and carnivore species diversity on estimates of net aboveground primary productivity. Rodent diversity was highest at low productivity levels and declined as productivity increased. Data did not confirm the upslope and peak phases of Tilman's model, but this may be because areas of extremely low productivity were not sampled. In very dry desert habitats, rodent diversity increases rapidly across a narrow gradient of very low productivity and peaks at moderately low levels. This suggests that rodents, which are largely herbivorous, exhibit an asymmetric productivity-diversity curve similar to that predicted by Tilman. Rodent data are also consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, which predicts diversity as a peaked function of a disturbance gradient, eg of rainfall predictability, which is inversely related to the plant productivity gradient. The regression curve for carnivores helps to distinguish between these hypotheses. At a given locality carnivores and rodents should be exposed to about the same disturbance levels and according to the intermediate disturbance model should peak at about the same place. Since carnivores are about one trophic level above rodents, if plant productivity controls diversify, the peak for carnivores should (and does) occur at an order of magnitude of productivity higher than the peak for rodents.

Aerial roots in contact with the substrate (ground roots) are free from encrusting barnacles primarily because of the foraging activity of a benthic predator, the hermit crab Clibanarius panamensis, which climbs these roots during high tide to forage on newly settled barnacles. Isopod absence from lateral roots that originate from ground roots (lateral-G roots) is explained best by predation rather than dispersal barriers.

Summer annuals, however, dominated enriched plots throughout the study. Species richness was significantly higher in enriched plots than in control plots during the 1st yr, but was significantly lower than control plots thereafter. Annual aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) was significantly greater in enriched plots than in controls in the 1st yr, but the converse occurred in the 3rd yr. The type of nutrient enrichment affected ANPP; sludge plots had significantly lower ANPP than fertilizer plots in the 1st and 3rd yr. In the older (4-yr-old) community, 2 summer annuals and a biennial displaced dominant perennial grasses in enriched plots. ANPP was consistently greater in nutrient-enriched plots than in controls; nutrient enrichment did not alter species richness.

Sphagnum bog evolution in south-central Wisconsin appears to have been directly related to the regional climatic changes during the past 6000 yr. Although the 2 sites had different origins and different early histories, both were deep lakes until 6300 BP when they became shallow ponds dominated by the aquatic macrophyte Brasenia. These wetland changes were concurrent with a regional upland vegetational change from mesophytic forest to Quercus savanna and were caused by a regional decrease in annual precipitation and by an increase in temperature. At c3000 BP, in response to a cooler, wetter climate, both wetlands became Sphagnum-Ericaceae bogs, and the upland vegetation changed to a closed Quercus forest. -from Author",40,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,198,NA,NA

Diatom turfs also develop on bare substrata that are incubated in sites in the stream inaccessible to grazers. Diatom turfs exposed to grazing minnows Campostoma anomalum and C. oligolepis are stripped off in 3-5 min, and when left exposed to grazers, are replaced by cyanobacterial felts within 11 d.

Sparrows consume seeds that are c1 order of magnitude smaller in size than those consumed by finches of similar body mass. Because sparrows consume such small seeds and because finches are much more efficient at handling large seeds, sparrows need to encounter seeds at rates that are 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than that required by finches. Sparrows thus have to spend much more time foraging for new food patches as are finches. Consequently, sparrows are relatively sedentary and restricted to areas of dense seed concentrations; finches are extremely vagile and move over very large geographic areas in search of new patches of food. Resource partitioning is more pronounced among finches. Small and large finch species eat very different seed sizes, whereas the diets of small and large sparrows overlap greatly. -from Authors",32,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,201,NA,NA

Significant morphological responses to and recovery from shade were evident within 10 d, including: elongation of stems, thinning of lower leaves, and canopy formation at the water surface. Both photosynthetic and morphological acclimations to shade conferred substantial improvements in P. perfoliatus production at experimentally reduced irradiance compared to pretreatment conditions. Significant decreases in plant stem density, biomass and reproduction, as well as increases in mortality, were observed for plants at low growth irradiance. The inability of populations treated at low irradiance to exhibit any recovery (posttreatment increases) in these variables after 16 d of full ambient light suggests that 11% of ambient irradiance was below the minimum level needed for survival of this plant. Although stem elongation is a beneficial response to shade for P. perfoliatus in turbid lakes, it may be nonadaptive in turbulent tidal waters because of increased susceptibility to fragmentation. -from Authors",87,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,202,NA,NA
