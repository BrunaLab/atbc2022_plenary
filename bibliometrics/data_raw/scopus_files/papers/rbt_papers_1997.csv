The author visited the study area for 143 days. The study area of 748 m2 was divided into squares of 4 m2 in order to report the spacial distribution of the frogs. All adult frogs were toeclipped for identification. Each hour of observation all males were located and activity (calling and mating) was recorded. Temperature was controlled every hour of observation and precipitation was measured daily. Furthermore, during 4 days the author followed one male and recorded the temporal distribution of its behaviors: 1. calling, 2. displacement (movement), 3. feeding, 4. mating, 5. parental care. A total of 20 males and 29 females was found, of which 14 males defended a territory for more than 10 days. Calling activity (calling territorial males in proportion to all territorial males) was highest in the morning with a peak activity between 8.00 and 10.00 hours and mating activity was highest between 9.00 and 10.00 hours. At 7.00 and 8.00 hours the calling activity showed a slight correlation with the temperature. Optimal temperature for calling was between 23.5°C and 25.0°C. Precipitation had a positive influence on calling and mating activity. Dendrobates pumilio showed continous reproduction during the investigation period, however, mating activity was highest in September and October, with a daily average of 0.58 and 0.56 matings. Activity declined considerably towards the end of the year. The observations of one males' behaviour matched the general activity patterns. Feeding took place during and after calling and territory control, but was not consistent with mating. Displacement was related to calling, mating and feeding activity. As in some other dendrobatids, D. pumilio's reproductive activity is uncyclical and dependent on rainfall. Mating activity reached its peak before months of highest precipitation (November, December), which could be an adaptation to provide water containing plant axils for tadpole development. Physiological constraints should prevent activity during hot and dry periods in most frogs. Apparently, the optimal temperature range for reproductive activity in D. pumilio is around 24°C and narrow. Consequently, if global climatic changes cause increasing temperatures and alter precipitations, shifts in activity patterns and geografical distribution could be expected.",16,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Climatic factors | Costa Rica | Dendrobates pumilio | Hitoy Cerere | Poison frogs | Reproduction activity | Vocalization,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Among the commonest grass species, the order of halotolerance from the least to the most halotolerant species was Bothriochloa pertusa, Dicanthium caricosum, C. plectostachyon and C. nlemfuensis, Cynodon dactylon and Sporobolus pyramidatus. As a result of the limited number of plant species occurring, the strong abiotic stress caused by salinity, and the occasional waterlogging, the vegetation predicts the soil salinity status with acceptable precision. Both in discriminant analysis and through the use of arbitrary vegetation categories, the salinity category (<4, 4-8 or >8 mS/cm) of the soil was predicted with a precision of about 75%. The lowest salinity category (<4 mS/cm) coincided with the dominance of Bothriochloa pertusa, Dicanthium caricosum, Cynodon nlemfuensis and C. plectostachyon. The high cover of halotolerant species such as Sporobolus pyramidatus, Sesuvium portulacastrum and other halophytes coincided mostly with the highest salinity category (>8 mS/cm). Because of the ease of distinguishing the vegetation categories and the straightforwardness of the technique, which does not require any specific statistical preconditions, authors suggest the use of the occurrence of halotolerant plant species to judge the salinity status of the pasture.",5,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Discriminant analysis | Electrical conductivity | Halotolerance | Plant indication | Soil salinity,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,18,NA,NA

The families depending on the income obtained through commercialization of these animals have a low education and economic status. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop and evaluate simple methods of depuration that could be easily used by these families to make these mollusks safe for consumption. Bottles containing 11 of saline solution (25g/l) were prepared in duplicates to test the bactericidal effect of acetic acid. The solution in each bottle was adjusted to ph 4.5, 5.0 or 5.5 or held at ph of 7.0 or 8.0 for the controls. The solution in each bottle was then inoculated with approximately 1 X 104 cfu/ml of coliforms. Counts of coliforms were determined for each bottle 0, 1, 2, 4 and 8 hours after inoculation. For the depuration studies, specimens with diameters ranging fron 4.0 to 4.5 cm were collected form a harvester at the estuary of Puntarenas, Gulf of Nicoya. Fifty specimens each were depurated in separate tanks containing 25 1 of oxigenated saline solution adjusted with acetic acid to an initial ph of 4.5 (treatment) or non adjusted ph of 8.0 (control). Counts of Enterobacteriaceae were determined, in duplicates, every 12 hr for 48 hr. An additional fifty animals were depurated using the defined method and tested to determine if they met international standards of microbiological quality for aerobic plate count, Enterobacteriaceae count, Escherichia coli count and presence of Salmonella. A sensory evaluation using a triangle test was performed to compare a typical dish prepared with depurated or non-depurated animals. A significant coliform reduction was determined in a saline solution (25 g/l) at a pH range of 4.5 to 5.5 . This reduction, during 8 hr, was higher in the acid treatments compared to the controls. During depuration, the elimination of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria was faster when acetic acid was used (initial ph=4.5) than when it was not. This elimination was more important the first 24 hr, time defined as adequate for the application of the method. The method has the advantage of transforming the bivalve in a product that is safe for human consumption, since it guaranties that the international standards of microbiological quality, for raw and depurated mullusks, are reached.

Ten plants per patch, and five flowers per plant were randomly chosen for the following pollination tests: self-pollination; control; bee control; high load of cross-pollen and high load of self-pollen. Fruits were collected to study seeds. Results for role of pollinators and pollen limitation in seed production were different between patches, probably because of differences in patch ""quality"" (nutrient availability, number of flowers per plant and per patch, pollinator abundance). Seeds initiation was independent of pollinators, but seed initiation and seed set were increased by pollinators. Seed production was limited by pollen, as seed initiation and seed set were increased by high load of cross-pollen, only in one patch. Nevertheless, nutrients may also be limiting seed production, because a high load of cross-pollen did not maximize seed production, in either patch. Fruit abortion was higher in self-pollination and high load of self-pollen treatments, possibly because of selective abortion of self-progeny and fruits with less seeds. As expected for a weed species, T. semitriloba has a breeding system where seed production is guaranteed by self-pollination, but the presence of bee pollinators increases seed set, and probably improves seed quality by cross-pollination.

These ways of carrying pollen may be intermediate between pollen transport in the intersegmental membranes, and in pockets or corbiculae. The evolution of such mechanisms may preserve pollen from desiccation. These structures may have similar functions to the pollinium of some plants that are also pollinated by specific insects.

Over 24 species had a frequency greater than 60%. Diversity was higher in Puerto Angel (H′=3.05, J=0.89), and abundance was higher in Cacaluta (292 organisms), followed by La Entrega (265 organisms). Species richness was similar for all localities except for El Maguey. The southern distribution range of Polycirrus mexicanus and Pseudopotamilla debilis, previously set at the Sea of Cortez, is here extended to the Gulf of Tehuantepec. A cluster analysis showed that Puerto Angel and Tangolunda had the highest similarity (0.42). Both places share rock-coral facies, 16 species, and human environmental impacts. Caculata and El Maguey had the lowest similarity (0.04) and the highest evenness, sharing only one species. When compared to the mollusk communities at the same sites, the polychaetes studied were less diverse but presented a higher evenness. Compared to Cabo Pulmo, Sea of Cortez, a similar environment dominated by Pocillopora, the present polychaete community has a more diverse but less abundant. However, two shared species, T. taeniaformis and Eunice lucei, had a similar abundance in these two areas.",13,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Coral community | East Tropical Pacific | México | Polychaeta | Rocky shores,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,34,NA,NA

The new species is distinguishable from its congeners on the basis of color, setal pattern and elytral sculpturing. A sympatric, undescribed Colyphus species resembles C. hansoni in details of shape and sculpturing, and may prove to be its sister species. Colyphus hansoni has the elyra tricolorous (red, ivory and black) and thus is easily separated from the undescribed species which has the elytra strictly bicolorous (stramineous and black). The generic status of the latter is discussed in relation to Colyphus. The presence of sexually dimorphic tarsal claws in Colyphus is noted for the first time. Enoclerus (E.) puravida is characterized as part of a complex of several similar and possibly related species distributed in Panama and Costa Rica.

Introductions of tilapia in Quintana Roo began in 1974; these were mainly extensive cultures (direct releases) until 1982, when floating cages began to be used. The fish were collected with throw, seine, and hand nets, plastic bags or hook and line, as the local conditions allowed; each fishing gear provided a separate abundance estimate for a given site. Water body area was calculated from maps (1:50 000) by clipping the lake area in homogeneously thick paper and weighing it to the nearest 0.1 mg. Temperature, conductivity and dissolved oxygen, as well as the number of native fish species, were recorded, but these variables showed no relationship to tilapia abundance or distribution; however, tilapia was not found in the wild at water conductivities above 5500 mmho/cm. Escape from floating cages, perhaps caused by crocodiles or water level elevations, was found in 50% of the intensive culture sites visited. Moreover, tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus and hybrids, probably with O. niloticus) was captured in four sites where it had not been officially introduced; two of these may be natural invasions from nearby lakes during wetter cycles, the others (lakes Cobá and Makanxoc) probably are unofficial introductions. Tilapia was not frequent throughout Quintana Roo (4.2% of 237 water bodies visited), but it was dominant (>20% of the total number of individuals) in most localities where it appeared, including lake Chichancanab, habitat of an endemic Cyprinodon species flock.

The virtue of the phylogenetic approach is that it gives an evolutionary perspective of the bacterial lineage; however the methods used possess low resolution for defining species located at the terminal branches of the phylogenetic trees. The merit of the taxonomic approach is that species are defined on the basis of multiple characteristics allowing high resolution at the terminal branches of dendograms; its disadvantage is the inaccuracy in the earlier nodes. On an individual level, the qualitative biological characteristics used for the definition of species frequently reveal shortcomings because many of these properties are the result of coevolution, parallel evolution or the horizontal transfer of genes. Nevertheless, when considered together with the phylogenetic and taxonomic approaches, important uncertainties are discovered: these must be weighed if a practical definition of bacterial species is conceived. The microbiologists' perception is the criterion expressed by a group of sponsors who, based on scientific and practical grounds, propose a new bacterial species. The success of this new proposal is measured by its widespread acceptance and its permanence. A difficult problem concerned with defining bacterial species is how to distinguish if they are independent evolutionary units or if they are reticulate evolutionary units. In the first case the inherence is vertically transmitted as a result of binary fission and clonal expansion. This may be the case of some animal cell associated bacteria in which recombination appears to be precluded or exceptional. In the second case adaptive changes occurring within an individual can be horizontally transferred to many or all group members. This seems to be the condition of many intestinal and plant associated bacteria. Genetic drift and speciation in clonal bacteria will depend almost exclusively on mutation and internal genetic rearrangement processes, whereas speciation in reticulate bacteria will depend not only on these processes but in their genetic interactions with other bacterial strains.

At the time of the study (January/February 1989) the boundary between the oxic and anoxic layer was at 10m, i.e. 33 % of the lake's volume was anoxic. Relatively low concentrations of H2S (up to 4.1 μmol 1-1) were present in the hypolimnion simultaneously with large amounts of Fe and Mn (114 and 21.5 μmol 1-1 resp.). The thermocline was very weakly developed (total temperature difference between surface and bottom water layer amounted to only 1.3°C). This small difference, the relatively high concentrations of ammonia and iron in the epilimnion and the low O2 saturation (81 %) of the surface layer indicate that, during or shortly before the study time, a partial circulation of the lake had occurred causing a substantial entrainment of hypolimnetical water into the epilimnion. The mixing process did not produce a total circulation but was probably the reason for the intrusion of small amounts of O2 into layers below the chemocline, which enabled the production of nitrite by nitrifying bacteria within the hypolimnion.

Parasites disappeared completely from the circulation after 20-25 days. However in the immunosuppressed group, parasites were found in blood up to 45 days post infection. The humoral immune response was monitored using an ELISA test and low levels of specific IgG and IgM immunoglobulins were found. However the IgG titers were lower than the IgM. One could conclude that IgM was the predominant immunoglobulin isotype induced in a T. rangeli experimental infection because the highest titers were observed in the reinoculated group. IgM antibodies also showed the most prominent crossreactivities with T. cruzi antigens.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,NA,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,162,9404516,NA
