The former exponent (0.42) is considerably lower than the exponent for respiration (0.66). Consequently, the difference between energy intake and metabolism should decrease with increasing body size at low food concentrations. Rotifer swimming speeds are rather uniform for a wide range of body sizes and species. Consequently, length-specific swimming speeds (body lengths moved per unit time) and, particularly, mass-specific swimming speeds (distance moved per unit time per unit mass) decrease rapidly with increasing body size.

(Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae) sawflies are attacked by 2 ectoparasitoids (Bracon angelesius and Pteromalus sp.), which pierce the gall wall and lay an egg on the host Pontania sp. larva when it has reached the penultimate or ultimate instar. The ectoparasitoid paralyzes the sawfly larva before depositing the egg, so it is not possible for parasitoid attack to increase herbivore size, longevity, or development rate in this system; herbivore feeding and development cease when it is paralyzed.-from Authors",260,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,47,NA,NA,NA,NA

The preference of A. planci for certain prey (eg Montipora, Acropora) shifted the species composition to one in which nonpreferred prey predominated (eg Porites, Leptastrea). The predominance of nonpreferred prey was short-lived, and by 1980, preferred prey were the primary colonists of 2 zones. The 3 biological zones (reef front, submarine terrace, and seaward slope) had their own characteristic species assemblages soon after the disturbance. Nonrandom recruitment or survival of juvenile corals (diameter = or <4cm) established these zones. Although the percentage of juvenile corals fell throughout the survey, their highest density was reached after adult colonies were established. As the result of recruitment, species diversity rose from 84 species in 1970 to 154 species in 1981. As surviving corals and new recruits developed, the distribution of coral growth forms became more diversified. There was a drastic increase in coral cover, which corresponded to an increase in size and number of the coral colonies.

Results imply that severe browsing of winter-dormant willow growing on floodplains of interior Alaskan rivers, such as occurs at some points during Lepus americanus cycles, may result in reduced height growth of willow. Such a reduction in height growth may result in shading of floodplain willow by alder Alnus incana and in a shade-caused incrase in the palatability of willow stump sprouts. This increase in the palatability of shaded willow may be a partial control over the shift from willow dominance to alder dominance that occurs in the late shrub stage of primary succession on these floodplains.-from Author",118,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,137,NA,NA,NA,NA

Cost (eg risk of being preyed upon) and benefits (eg fasting capacity) of fat associated with an intermediate mass combine to maximize the probability of overwinter survivorship. The model predicts that when benefits but not costs of extensive fattening are eliminated by predictable resources, the optimal solution will be for bird species to avoid costs by remaining leaner than species utilizing unpredictable resources. In the latter environment, benefits of fattening are important to surviving suddenly imposed fasting spells. Thus size of the fat reserve should vary inversely with resource predictability. This study compares visible subcutaneous fat among 3 avian foraging guilds that occupy a gradient of winter resource predictability. In separate data sets involving small birds from S Michigan, C Tennessee, N Michigan, and S Indiana, visible fat class varied inversely with resource predictability, as predicted.

Certain Larrea shrubs were occupied by territorial males each year; others remained consistently vacant. Males that matured earliest in the season usually defended shrubs that had been most heavily occupied in previous years. Such males located preferred territories, rather than simply maturing on and occupying sites that the parental generation had utilized. Occupancy was highest in large shrubs surrounded by small neighbors. The number of long-term resident males and duration of their residence periods, however, were highest in shrubs that contained low amounts of methanol- or hexane-extractable compounds. Female L. coquilletti preferred foliage selected from bushes that harbored territorial males and contained low amounts of nordihydroguaiaretic acid, a powerful anti-oxidant constituting a large precentage of the compounds coating Larrea foliage. Larrea shrubs thus differ in quality as assessed by female L. coquilletti; these differences reflect variation in foliage chemistry; and males establish their territories on preferred shrubs to maximize their encounter rate with females. Because the number of high-quality shrubs is limited, males in a local population often congregate on only 50-60% of the available shrubs. This leads to a complex mating system in which males may alternatively defend a territory solitarily; defend a high-quality territory in the company of other males while at the same time behaving aggressively toward them; or adopt subordiante behaviour on an occupied, high-quality territory.-from Authors",26,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,161,NA,NA,NA,NA

Five pollen assemblage zones are recognized: a Pinus-Populus zone >12 000 BP, a Picea-Alnus sinuata zone from >12 000-11 030 BP, an A. rubra-Pteridium zone from 11 030-6830 BP, a Cupressaceae zone beginning at 6830 BP, and a late Holocene Pinus-A. rubra zone from 2400-900 BP. The first forests were an open mixture of conifers and deciduous trees, chiefly Tsuga mertensiana, Abies, Pinus contorta and Populus on a landscape subject to erosion. Just before 12 000 BP, the pioneer species Picea sitchensis, Alnus rubra and A. sinuata became important constituents. Although pollen accumulation rates were high, abundance of A. sinuata indicates open-canopy forest. Beginning approx 11 200 BP, climatic warming initiated major changes in forest composition and the fire regime. Tsuga heterophylla migrated into the region, rapidly expanded, then declined shortly thereafter, while Pseudotsuga menziesii, A. rubra and Pteridium expanded, and Pinus contorta, Picea sitchensis, Populus and A. sinuata declined. Abundance of Pseudotsuga, A. rubra, and Pteridium between 11 030 and 6830 BP corresponds with increased influxes of charcoal into the sediment; this zone is interpreted as a closed forest with a relatively high fire frequency and composed of a mosaic of postfire successional communities in which fire-adapted Pseudotsuga and A. rubra predominated. Pinus monticola became locally important approx 8000 BP. Between 6800-6400 BP Thuja plicata arrived, Tsuga heterophylla expanded, and A. rubra, Pseudotsuga and Pteridium declined. These changes are accompanied by a reduced fire frequency, inferred from lower charcoal accumulation rates, and they indicate a shift to wet-temperate climate similar to today's.

The smallest finches are unable to crack the large seeds, while among those that crack large seeds, there are positive associations of seed handling ability and beak size. Generalization on all 3 seed types at the population level and some specialization of individuals on large or small seeds help to explain the high level of morphological variability observed in the population. Within the large-seed category some individuals specialized on Opuntia or Tribulus seeds; others consumed both. Energy rewards from foraging on either seed appeared to be similar. Specialization is attributable to the patchy distribution of seeds on the island, and to a host of constraints on foraging, including microclimate and territorial behavior.

In 1983, the woody vegetation (stems = or >1 cm dbh) of 273 of these gaps was resampled, rates of gap closure by canopy tree branch growth and sapling height growth were estimated, and incidences of disturbances occurring since 1976-1977 were noted. Average yearly crown extension growth rate was 18 cm/yr in height, again with much variation among species and individuals. Saplings grew an average of 30 cm/yr in height, again with much variation. Overall, taller saplings grew somewhat faster than smaller ones and saplings in large gaps grew faster than those in small gaps. Most saplings will thus require = or >2 gap episodes to reach the forest canopy. For woody vegetation, basal area per unit gap area was originally highest in small gaps, though it increased between sampling dates most in large gaps. Stem density had been highest in small old gaps, but decreased the most in old gaps. Tsuga canadensis, Fagus grandifolia, Acer saccharum and Halesia carolina were the most important species in the gaps. Overall, Tsuga and Fagus decreased and A. saccharum increased in importance.
