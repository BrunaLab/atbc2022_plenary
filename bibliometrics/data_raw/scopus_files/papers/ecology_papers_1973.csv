Its central feature is that it requires a detailed statement on the environmental impact of all proposed actions where federal activities or money are involved. In general, the authors believe that the intent of this requirement is laudable but, as presently worded, it is inadequate from both the public viewpoint as well as the private sector, and urgently in need of modification. The primary criticism is that the act does not require or encourage a regional viewpoint. When there are many proposed actions and projects in or contiguous to one area, a regional overview is essential. In order to illustrate the problem, the authors used as an example the wetland area surrounding and impinging upon New Orleans and Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana. In this paper, the limitations of this piecemeal approach for assessing environmental impact are demonstrated.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,1
