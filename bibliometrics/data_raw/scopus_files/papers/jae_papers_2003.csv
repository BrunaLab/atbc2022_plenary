Parasites can have dramatic effects on the ecology of their hosts. Such strong host-parasite interactions are the result of either parasites with generally high virulence, or generally benign parasites that nevertheless express context-dependent virulence. Theoretically, one indication that an apparently benign parasite nevertheless has a large impact on its host should be the existence of strong genotypic interactions between host and parasite. 2. Crithidia bombi (Trypanosomatidae) is a highly prevalent but generally benign gut parasite of the bumble-bee Bombus terrestris. The demonstration of strong genotypic interactions between C. bombi and B. terrestris, however, suggests that context-dependent virulence may have a large impact on the host population. We thus investigated the effects of C. bombi across the entire life cycle of its host, including the stressful times of hibernation and colony-founding. Owing to the high prevalence and rates of transmission of the parasite in field populations, we used a large-scale laboratory experiment. 3. Under stressful hibernation, infected queens lost more mass. Infection also significantly reduced colony-founding success, colony size, male production and overall fitness, by up to 40%. These findings show that strong genotypic host-parasite interactions may indeed be a reliable indicator that apparently benign and highly prevalent parasites are nevertheless exerting a dramatic impact on their host populations.",224,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Bombus terrestris | Crithidia bombi | Host-parasite interaction | Trypanosome,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,1

The persistence of parasites that are only seen in intermittent outbreaks has intrigued ecologists. Long the subject of speculation, there is now evidence that viral insect diseases can cause covert as well as overt infections. 2. Typically, infection leads to overtly diseased individuals that are infectious and die as a result of the disease, but it can also produce other individuals that show a covert, non-infectious pathology, which is typically asymptomatic. Covertly infected individuals do not die as a result of infection, although they may be affected sublethally such that their reproductive output falls, they may transmit the covert infection vertically and, crucially, they may convert at some rate to overt infectious individuals. In this way the parasites are able to persist in host populations and can be detected only by the use of molecular techniques. 3. Here, we apply novel analytical techniques to a general host-parasite modelling framework and examine the population dynamical consequences of such covert infections. 4. The interplay between various stabilizing and destabilizing forces leads to a highly complex pattern of host dynamics, including a theoretically intriguing pinch point. Covert infections may be stabilizing or destabilizing depending on the specific characteristics of the interaction, particularly in relation to the rate of conversion from covert to overt infection. 5. In general terms, intermediate rates of conversion are stabilizing, while high and low rates may each destabilize the host population. In contrast, there is no consistent pattern for the role of vertical transmission because, in some cases, high levels are stabilizing while in others they are destabilizing. 6. Thus, our results demonstrate that relatively subtle pathogen effects such as covert infections can have important and novel dynamical impacts on the host-pathogen interaction. It also suggests that the effects of covert infection are likely to be systemspecific and information may be required on a system-by-system basis in order to make predictions.",44,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Covert infection | Disease | Host-parasite | Insect | Model | Population dynamics | Stability | Sublethal,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,2

Recent experiments on cyclic red grouse populations discovered that aggressiveness, induced by testosterone implants, depressed population density for more than a year after the implants were exhausted. 2. This confirms the observation, also made in previous studies of this territorial species, that aggressiveness can determine population density. Additionally, it hints at a form of social memory that sustains the effect of episodes of high aggressiveness after their cause has ceased to exist. 3. We explore the logical consequences of this observation with a simple model of the interaction between population density and aggressiveness. A flexible function describes how aggressiveness changes from year to year as a function of population density. At low densities animals are tolerant to conspecifics and aggressiveness falls from one year to the next. Conversely, at high densities aggressiveness rises. 4. In the model, current aggressiveness is set by aggressiveness in the previous year, and modified by last year's population density (first version) or by current population density (second version). 5. We assume no particular behavioural mechanism underlying this process but derive conditions under which changes in aggressiveness, effected by density, can generate unstable dynamics. 6. The two versions of the model give fluctuations that differ in period and amplitude but have similar conditions for unstable dynamics. Specifically, the more abrupt the transition from tolerant to intolerant behaviour with increasing density, the more likely are cycles to occur. 7. We show how a previous model of the kinship hypothesis for red grouse cycles can be recast in the current terminology, and how the new models offer a more general way of examining red grouse population dynamics.",18,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Aggressiveness | Kinship hypothesis | Territorial behaviour | Unstable population dynamics,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,3

The habitat accommodation model for animal succession proposed that animal species enter a succession when changes in the vegetation succession reach a threshold of habitat suitable to that species. As the vegetation succession moves on, the habitat becomes less suited to that species and it is competitively excluded by species better suited to the habitat. 2. The main species in the mammalian succession following fire for wet heath in eastern Australia are rodents, with Pseudomys gracilicaudatus (eastern chestnut mouse) being followed by Rattus lutreolus (swamp rat) which becomes dominant with increasing time since fire. The abundance of both species has been shown to correlate with vegetation density, but in markedly different ways, and asymmetric interspecific competition has been demonstrated using controlled, replicated removal experiments in the field. 3. We used this system to examine if vegetation density is causal, manipulating the habitat by clipping to remove 60-70% of the vegetative cover from the 10 m x 10 m area surrounding each of six trapping stations on each grid. There were four experimental plots clipped, each with two abutting grids, one clipped and one unclipped, and a further four control plots each with two abutting grids that remained undisturbed. 4. We monitored the effects on each species with three censuses in January 1993 (summer) before clipping in early February, and on five further censuses, three in February (late summer) to assess immediate, short-term effects, one in August (winter) and one in December 1993 (early summer). 5. The abundance of Rattus lutreolus was significantly reduced by clipping the vegetation, while the abundance of Pseudomys gracilicaudatus remained relatively unchanged by the clipping. 6. Two species that are abundant on early succession stages in dry heath succession, but occurred at very low abundance on these wet heath habitats before clipping, P. novaehollandiae (New Holland mouse) and Mus domesticus (house mouse), showed marked increases in abundance on clipped and control plots soon after clipping. 7. An abundance index based on the standardized difference between clipped and control plots, was used to assess responses to habitat manipulation. Rattus lutreolus demonstrated significant negative index values, Pseudomys gracilicaudatus had index values close to zero until the winter census, P. novaehollandiae and Mus domesticus showed positive abundance indices soon after clipping. The order of significant responses to the habitat manipulation was revealed as: Mus domesticus → Pseudomys novaehollandiae → P. gracilicaudatus → Rattus lutreolus. 8. The impact of a habitat manipulation experiment on these four species of rodents produced a retrogression of the small-mammal succession. This demonstrated a causal role for vegetation density, which provided insight into the mechanisms that operate during the succession following fire, and supported the habitat accommodation model for animal succession.",65,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Disturbance | Interspecific competition | Pseudomys gracilicaudatus | Rattus lutreolus | Vegetation density,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,4

Air-breathing marine predators can modify their diving behaviour to accommodate different patterns of prey abundance and distribution and may do so at multiple temporal scales (individual dives, bouts of dives and foraging trips). 2. The grey seal, Halichoerus grypus, is a size-dimorphic, capital breeding species in which sex differences in foraging ecology have previously been found at the scale of individual dives. In this study, diving behaviour of male and female adult grey seals was examined at the temporal scales of dive bouts (41 males/46 females) and foraging trips (7 males/9 females) during the 8-month prebreeding foraging period between 1992 and 1999 to investigate whether sex differences were evident at longer temporal scales. 3. Foraging trip duration did not differ between males and females. However, females (the smaller sex) spent significantly more time diving and less time hauled-out on land between trips than males. This suggests that females are more selective than males when searching for prey. These differences are consistent with the effects of body-size dimorphism on diving behaviour. 4. Virtually all dives occurred in bouts. At this scale, males and females showed significantly different seasonal patterns of most bout characteristics, including bout duration, percentage of bout spent at depth and effort (hours spent in bouts day-1). 5. Grey seals used four different types of bouts, differing in duration, depth, percentage bout spent at depth and the shape of individual dives within the bout. Males and females differed in the proportion of each bout type used and in the seasonal and day-night distribution of bout types. 6. Few bout characteristics varied significantly among years, despite interannual variation in prey abundance. Where interannual differences did occur, both sexes behaved in a similar way. 7. Different seasonal patterns in bouts of diving by males and females could not be accounted for by body-size dimorphism or niche divergence, but were consistent with the hypothesis that females must recover condition earlier in the year than males to support the energetic costs of reproduction.",38,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Bouts | Foraging trips | Grey seals | Seasonal patterns,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,5

Ravens (Corvus corax, L.) feed on rich but ephemeral carcasses of large animals. Non-breeding juveniles forage socially and aggregate in communal winter roosts, which may function as 'information centres' regarding food locations. 2. In a large roost in North Wales, regurgitated pellets on the forest floor contained a variety of prey remains, which were more similar for ravens that had roosted close together the same night. 3. Sheep carcasses placed at varying distances from the roost were baited with colour-coded plastic beads. These were ingested and regurgitated in pellets back at the roost in aggregations, the spatial distribution of which consistently reflected the geographical location of bait sites. 4. Aggregations of beads at the roost grew daily with an increasing radius centred upon the first pellet per carcass. This mirrored the linear increase of six birds per day in the size of groups flying between roost and carcass each morning. Rates of recruitment were greater for carcasses closer to the roost. 5. Groups were led by a single bird roosting centrally within the aggregation. When individually identifiable (37. 5% of cases), these individuals were dominant at the carcass and were among the minority of birds involved in acrobatic display flights at preroost gatherings. 6. When contrasted with data on two alternative groups of ravens peripheral to the main roost which foraged and roosted collectively, these results provide strong circumstantial evidence for raven roosts as structured information centres.

Many species rely on resources that are discrete patches distributed across the landscape. Models of the coexistence of such taxa often require intraspecific aggregation of individuals on some patches, brought about by choices made during dispersal and patch location. Few studies have employed spatially explicit measures of dispersion to detect whether and how any aggregation of individuals is influenced by the dispersion of resource patches in natural landscapes. 2. For two species of caddisfly (Hydrobiosidae) in two stream stretches, we mapped the spatial distribution of potential and exploited patches (emergent rocks as oviposition sites) and enumerated egg masses on each rock. Point pattern analysis, based on Ripley's K-function, was used to describe the spatial pattern of potential and exploited oviposition sites, and to test hypotheses about how site selection behaviour of females influences dispersion. 3. Emergent rocks were clumped and equally abundant in both stretches. As documented previously, egg masses of Ulmerochorema and Apsilochorema were aggregated within oviposition sites. Both species showed velocity-specific preferences for oviposition sites: oviposition of Ulmerochorema occurred most often on rocks in fast flowing water (>0.30 m s-1); oviposition of Apsilochorema on rocks in slow water (<0.30 m s-1). 4. Our perception of how caddisflies deposit eggs into the stream landscape varied with the neutral landscape model. The most informative neutral landscape compared the spatial pattern of oviposition sites with the underlying pattern of emergent rocks, while constraining the random selection of rocks to reflect species' velocity preferences. Oviposition sites of Ulmerochorema were clumped, over and above the background pattern of emergent rocks. Oviposition sites of Apsilochorema were over-dispersed. 5. Hydrobiosid caddisflies appear to make decisions about egg-laying at different scales. We propose a mechanistic explanation, based on what we know about the oviposition behaviour of these species, to explain how the observed patterns might arise.

Despite numerous studies that have investigated the effects of physical disturbance on marine benthic communities, deducing the ecological significance of such events has been hampered by the specificity of individual studies. Less stable habitats (coarse, clean sands) are thought to recover more quickly than stable (muddy sands and mud) habitats but so far an empirical test of this paradigm has been lacking. 2. We describe a large-scale field experiment that investigated the response of marine benthic communities within a variety of sediment types (clean sand, silty sand, muddy sand and mud) to physical disturbance. Sites were sampled for macrofauna and habitat characteristics (sediment organic content and water content, depth of water within disturbed pits) following disturbance, in order to examine any relationship between the rate of physical and biological recovery. 3. There were no detectable changes to the measured physical parameters following the disturbance with the exception of the water depth within disturbed areas. It was not possible to derive a linear relationship between the measured habitat characteristics (percentage silt and clay content) and the recovery trajectory of the associated community. However, the rate of sediment infilling of disturbed plots was strongly correlated to the recovery rate of the numbers of individuals within disturbed areas. 4. Clean sand communities had the most rapid recovery rate following disturbance, whereas communities from muddy sand habitats had the slowest physical and biological recovery rates. These findings concur with the predictions of a meta analysis of fishing disturbances for similar habitats. 5. We suggest that physical and biological recovery rates are mediated by a combination of physical, chemical and biological factors that differ in their relative importance in different habitats. Monitoring the infilling rate of physically disturbed patches of sediment has the potential to become a useful tool to predict the recovery rate of associated communities.",72,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Bottom fishing | Granulometry | Marine invertebrates | Sediment parameters,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,8

According to the 'territorial behaviour' hypothesis, population cycles of red grouse are caused by delayed density-dependent changes in the aggressiveness of territorial cocks. We report here on a replicated population experiment testing assumptions of this hypothesis. 2. We used testosterone implants to increase aggressiveness of cocks for 3 months during autumn, when recruitment and territory establishment take place. On two moors located in northern England, and on two 1-km2 areas within each moor, we implanted adult cocks with testosterone on an experimental area and with sham implants on a control area. 3. During the first autumn, the testosterone treatment prevented recruitment of young cocks into the territorial populations. This reduced breeding density and altered the age ratio among territorial cocks, and possibly levels of kinship. If so, the 'kinship' hypothesis predicted that density and recruitment should continue to differ between testosterone-treated and control areas. 4. Grouse density remained significantly lower on the experimental than on the control areas for two consecutive breeding seasons. This confirmed a strong spatial structuring within grouse populations, which prevented immigration from neighbouring higher-density areas. In the second autumn, testosterone was not implanted but the recruitment rate remained significantly lower and cock density continued to decline more on the experimental than on the control areas. 5. The results suggest that cocks continued to be aggressive and to maintain large territories for at least a year after aggressiveness was increased experimentally, and therefore that autumn aggressiveness is influenced by previous territorial contests. 6. The experiment validates key assumptions of the 'territorial behaviour' hypothesis for red grouse cycles.

Spatial patterns of recruitment were compared between populations of the rocky shore barnacles (Crustacea: Cirripedia) Semibalanus balanoides, an obligate cross-fertilizer, and Chthamalus montagui, which can self-fertilize. We tested the hypothesis that recruitment depends on a behaviourally mediated interaction at settlement between the effects of adult background density and adult spacing, which limit free space for settlement and mating opportunities, respectively. Recruitment to patches of cleared rock (10- or 30-cm diameter) was compared between replicate shores with background densities of adult barnacles classed as low (≤20 per 25 cm2) and high (>4x low). Replicate patches were cleared of all barnacles surrounding a remnant cluster, comprising 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 32 adults. 2. For S. balanoides, settlement and subsequent recruitment over 5 months varied in direct proportion to remnant cluster size, except on the shore with the highest background density where recruitment was inversely proportional to cluster size. We interpret this inversion to indicate attraction to potential mates at low adult densities (positive density dependence, an Allee effect) switching to attraction to free space at high density (negative density dependence). The strengths and slopes of the regressions increased from shores with the lowest to the highest overall recruitment of barnacles, but retained significance over a five-fold range in recruitment. Positive effects of cluster size on recruitment were consistent between consecutive years, despite considerable variation in recruitment densities. In contrast, recruitment of C. montagui was generally more weakly proportional to cluster size, except for a strong positive correlation at the shore with the highest recruitment. 3. Dispersion of recruits within treatment patches was accurately modelled by a computer simulation that allowed each barnacle to settle at random between fixed minimum and maximum distances from the nearest other settled barnacle. The model estimated threshold distances by maximum likelihood fit to observed recruitment into concentric annuli around the central adult cluster. Upper thresholds of separation corresponded to penis length for 65% of S. balanoides and 42% of C. montagui patches. Lower thresholds were ∼2x cyprid length for 75% of S. balanoides patches, but were larger than this for C. montagui patches.",51,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Allee effect | Density dependence | Free space | Mating opportunity | Settlement,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,11

We used up to 34 years of capture-recapture data from about 22 100 new releases of day-old female ducklings and multistate modelling to test predictions about the influence of environmental, habitat and management factors on natal dispersal probability of three species of ducks within the Engure Marsh, Latvia. 2. The mean natal dispersal distances were very similar (c. 0.6-0.7 km) for all three species and were on average 2.7 times greater than breeding dispersal distances recorded within the same study system. 3. We were unable to confirm the kinship hypothesis and found no evidence that young first-nesting females nested closer to their relatives (either mother or sister) than to the natal nest. 4. Young female northern shovelers, like adults, moved from small islands to the large island when water level was high and vice versa when water level was low before the construction of elevated small islands. Movement probabilities between the two strata were much higher for young shovelers than adults, suggesting that young birds had not yet developed strong fidelity to the natal site. Movements of young female tufted ducks, unlike those of shovelers, were not dependent on water level fluctuations and reflected substantial flexibility in choice of first nesting sites. 5. Data for young birds supported our earlier conclusion that common pochard nesting habitats in black-headed gull colonies were saturated during the entire study period. Young females, like the two adult age groups, moved into and out of colonies with similar probability. Fidelity probability of female pochards to each stratum increased with age, being the lowest (0.62) for young (DK) females, intermediate (0.78) for yearlings (SY) and the highest (0.84) for adult (ASY) females. 6. Young female tufted ducks, like adults, showed higher probabilities of moving from islands to emergent marshes when water levels were higher both before and after habitat management.

We compared the partial-moult pattern of all 10 primary and the 10 outermost secondary feathers on the right vs. the left wing of 327 Ural owl females. We counted the number of asymmetrically moulted feather positions. The number of feathers moulted affects the potential asymmetry in partial moult. We used bootstrapping to correct for this dependency. 3. Females moulted especially their primary feathers, but also their secondary feathers, more symmetrically than expected by chance. Ural owls moulted fewer feathers after breeding than after not breeding, but the moult pattern was not more asymmetric than expected by chance. Partial-moult asymmetry did not correlate with current reproductive output (laying date), but the asymmetry in primaries was associated with a reduced probability to survive to the next breeding season. 4.

We propose the method of 'phase analysis' for studying the spatio-temporal fluctuations of animal populations, and use this method for helping identify remarkable synchronized population fluctuations that may sometimes be found over very large spatial domains. 2. The method requires decomposing the observed time series of population fluctuations into two components - one that quantifies the changing phase of the signal, and the other that quantifies the changing amplitude. 3. Two populations are considered to be 'phase synchronized' if there is locking or synchrony between their phase components, while their associated amplitudes may nevertheless remain largely uncorrelated. 4. Since environmental noise often masks population synchrony, a null hypothesis approach is used to detect whether the phase variables are locked more than would be expected by chance alone. 5. The technique is thus particularly appropriate for ecological analyses where it is often important to study evidence of weak interactions in irregular non-stationary and noisy time series. Because climatic patterns (and predicted climate changes) almost certainly influence population dynamics, the approach appears particularly relevant for analysing the potential links between climatic fluctuations and population abundance.",62,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Climatic influences | Cyclic phase difference | Moran effect | Phase synchronization | Population cycles | Population synchrony,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,15

The reintroduction of grey wolves Canis lupus (L.) to Yellowstone National Park provides a natural experiment in which to study the effects of a keystone predator on ecosystem function. 2. Grey wolves often provision scavengers with carrion by partially consuming their prey. 3. In order to examine how grey wolf foraging behaviour influences the availability of carrion to scavengers, we observed consumption of 57 wolf-killed elk Cervus elaphus (L.) and determined the percentage of edible biomass eaten by wolves from each carcass. 4. We found that the percentage of a carcass consumed by wolves increases as snow depth decreases and the ratio of wolf pack size to prey size and distance to the road increases. In addition, wolf packs of intermediate size provide the most carrion to scavengers. 5. Applying linear regression models to the years prior to reintroduction, we calculate carrion biomass availability had wolves been present, and contrast this to a previously published index of carrion availability. Our results demonstrate that wolves increase the time period over which carrion is available, and change the variability in scavenge from a late winter pulse dependent primarily on abiotic environmental conditions to one that is relatively constant across the winter and primarily dependent on wolf demographics. Wolves also decrease the year-to-year and month-to-month variation in carrion availability. 6. By transferring the availability of carrion from the highly productive late winter, to the less productive early winter and from highly productive years to less productive ones, wolves provide a temporal subsidy to scavengers.",212,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Canis lupus | Community stability | Keystone species | Optimal foraging | Trophic dynamics,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,17

Understanding the role endogenous vs. exogenous forces play in determining the dynamics and abundance of natural populations has important implications for their conservation. 2. Changes in environmental conditions often have different effects on closely related species. For instance, recent studies show that a physical shift in ocean conditions in the mid-1970s in the California current have reduced coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutsch) populations, but not chinook salmon (O. tshawytschd). 3. An important question is whether this pattern is due to differences in the ability of coho and chinook salmon to respond to changing ocean conditions or to differences in their life-history traits. 4. We analysed a series of population models to test whether observed abundance patterns of coho and chinook salmon could be explained by one of the major differences in their life history, the spawning age distribution; in the California current, female coho salmon are considered to be obligate semelparous, spawning at age 3, while chinook salmon are considered indeterminate semelparous, with populations spawning over a range of ages. 5. Results from a deterministic model indicate that the sensitivity of the population growth rate to changes in ocean survival depends little on the spawning age structure, especially when the growth rate is small (λ ≈ 1). 6. Analysis of linear and non-linear stochastic models indicate that the probability of persistence increases with the width of the spawning age distribution, as the fraction of adults spawning at age 3 decreases from 100% to 95%. Further increases in the spawning age distribution have negligible affects on persistence. 7. Because coho salmon are not absolutely obligate semelparous (e.g. as many as 25% of males can spawn precociously at age 2 and their effect on annual reproduction is unknown), this range of sensitivity does not provide a firm basis for assuming that the observed abundance patterns of coho and chinook is due to differences in their spawning age distribution. 8. While other life-history differences could play a role, we recommend that ongoing field studies focus on the different effects changing ocean conditions have on the survival of individual salmon species.",9,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Environmental variability | Ocean survival | Salmon conservation | Spawning age distribution | Stochastic models,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,18

In long-lived species, such as seabirds, the allocation of resources between self-maintenance and reproduction is of particular interest because only a small reduction in adult survival may have a large negative effect on lifetime reproductive success. There is much debate about whether seabirds have a fixed or flexible level of investment in their current reproduction, and it has been proposed that parents can regulate the risk of an increase in mortality under the control of a mass threshold. 2. Body mass change as response to experimental manipulations of parental effort was examined in blue-footed boobies (Sula nebouxii Mine-Edwards), a sexually size-dimorphic seabird, with females approximately 31% heavier than males. 3. First, paternal effort was manipulated by trimming the flight feathers and thereby handicapping males during the chick-rearing period. Mass remained stable in handicapped males, while there was a reduction of female body mass as response to the handicapped partner. The handicapping of males had a significant effect on chick mass. 4. Secondly, an experiment was made by enlarging and decreasing broods of two chicks to three and one during the first week after hatching. Body mass of females, but not males, was lower in enlarged broods, and body mass of males, but not females, was higher in the reduced broods when the chicks were 45 days old. Chick body masses were lower among enlarged broods than among reduced and control broods. 5. Overall, these and other results revealed that blue-footed boobies have a sex-specific body mass regulation. Males had a fixed body mass at the end of experiments; they were working at some physiological maximum or were unwilling to pay the cost in terms of future survival, when the effort demanded was increased. Females performed a flexible effort and were working with a buffer of nutritional reserves that they used when necessary.

The mechanisms underlying host choice strategies by parasites remain poorly understood. We address two main questions: (i) do parasites prefer vulnerable or well-fed hosts, and (ii) to what extent is a parasite species specialized towards a given host species? 2. To answer these questions, we investigated, both in the field and in the lab, a host- parasite system comprising one ectoparasitic mite (Spinturnix myoti) and its major hosts, two sibling species of bats (Myotis myotis and M. blythii), which coexist intimately in colonial nursery roosts. We exploited the close physical associations between host species in colonial roosts as well as naturally occurring annual variation in food abundance to investigate the relationships between parasite intensities and (i) host species and (ii) individual nutritional status. 3. Although horizontal transmission of parasites was facilitated by the intimate aggregation of bats within their colonial clusters, we found significant interspecific differences in degree of infestation throughout the 6 years of the study, with M. myotis always more heavily parasitized than M. blythii. This pattern was replicated in a laboratory experiment in which any species-specific resistance induced by exploitation of different trophic niches in nature was removed. 4. Within both host species, S. myoti showed a clear preference for individuals with higher nutritional status. In years with high resource abundance, both bat hosts harboured more parasites than in low-resource years, although the relative difference in parasite burden across species was maintained. This pattern of host choice was also replicated in the laboratory. When offered a choice, parasites always colonized better-fed individuals. 5.

Territory quality may affect individual fitness and contribute to density-dependent reproduction, with repercussions on population regulation. We investigated the probable causes and population consequences of spatio-temporal variations in territory quality, measured by occupancy, in eight black kite Milvus migrons Boddaert populations, one of them studied for 10 years (Lake Lugano) and the rest for 4-5 years. 2. Over a period of years, the occupation rate of territories varied from a random pattern. Some territories were preferred while others were avoided. On return from migration, males and females settled earlier on high-occupancy territories. 3. The positive association between territory occupancy and breeding performance held in all years of study at Lake Lugano, and in six of seven tested populations. As a result, high-occupancy territories contributed most of the young produced by each population. 4. The occupation rate of the overall 225 territories was related positively to food availability and negatively to mortality risk, measured as proximity to the nearest eagle owl Bubo bubo Linnaeus nest. 5. At the population level, spatial variation in mean occupancy was positively correlated with spatial variation in mean productivity, suggesting that mean occupancy could be used as a measure of overall habitat quality and population performance. 6. In the Lake Lugano area, a higher proportion of low quality territories was occupied in years of higher density and annual productivity was related negatively to its coefficient of variation. However, annual productivity was not related significantly to the proportion of low quality territories occupied, so support for the theory of site-dependent population regulation was only partial. 7. In a review of 22 studies of territory occupancy in 17 species, occupancy always deviated from a random pattern in species in which it was tested and was always correlated with productivity and/or with some other measure of territory quality. Our results confirm the importance of prioritizing conservation of high quality territories.

This scenario is novel in that it predicts the competitive coexistence of two nearly identical species on a single limiting resource and does so under circumstances of increased interspecific competition.

The relationship between diversity and stability is crucial in understanding the dynamics of multitrophic interactions. There are two basic hypotheses about the causal link between diversity and stability. The first is that fluctuations in resource abundance allow consumer coexistence, thus increasing diversity at the consumer trophic level (resource variability hypothesis). The second is that interactions between coexisting consumer species reduce consumer efficiency and dampen population fluctuations, thus increasing consumer-resource stability (consumer efficiency hypothesis). 2. The two hypotheses lead to three comparative predictions: (i) fluctuations should be greater (resource variability) or smaller (consumer efficiency) in resource populations with coexisting consumer species, compared to those invaded only by the consumer species superior at resource exploitation; (ii) average resource abundance should be greater (resource variability) or smaller (consumer efficiency) in resource populations with greater fluctuations; and (iii) removal of the consumer species inferior at resource exploitation should increase or not affect resource population fluctuations (resource variability), or always increase them (consumer efficiency). 3. I tested these predictions with data from a host-multiparasitoid community: the harlequin bug (Murgantia histrionica) and two specialist parasitoids (Trissolcus murgantiae and Ooencyrtus johnsonii) that attack the bug's eggs. 4. Local host populations with coexisting parasitoids exhibited smaller fluctuations and greater average abundance compared to those with just Trissolcus, the species superior at host exploitation. Local populations that lost Ooencyrtus, the species inferior at host exploitation, exhibited an increase in host population fluctuations compared to those that did not. 5. The results contradict the expectations of the resource variability hypothesis, suggesting that host population fluctuations are unlikely to be driving parasitoid coexistence. They are consistent with the consumer efficiency hypothesis, that interactions between coexisting parasitoid species dampens host population fluctuations.

Web-location cannot be designed simply to optimize foraging success, but must be a compromise between competing factors, including microhabitat parameters (physical structure, microclimate) and predator avoidance. 2. We tested the hypothesis that, despite these compromises, linyphiid spiders managed to locate their webs within microsites with enhanced prey resources. 3. We tested further the 'equilibrium' hypothesis that spiders, within a community of species, occupy different, relatively narrow niche axes and despite being generalists do not simply aggregate to the same resources. 4. In the first study of its kind, prey resources at web-sites were compared with those at matched non-web-sites with the same microhabitat properties. This was carried out for two subfamilies of Linyphiidae, one of which (Linyphiinae) is web-dependent and locates its web just above the ground, and the other (Erigoninae) is less web-dependent, locating its web on the ground and often hunting away from its web. We hypothesized that these subfamilies would locate their webs at microsites with enhanced densities of the prey most likely to be captured by their contrasting foraging strategies. We used spider weights as a surrogate for nutritional state, and compared spiders in webs with those without webs. 5. We found that even within a relatively uniform crop of wheat, spiders located their webs at microsites with greater prey resources. The most numerous prey, Collembola, were at significantly greater density at web-sites of both subfamilies of spider. However, there were significantly more Collembola at web-sites of the surface-hunting Erigoninae. By contrast, significantly more non-Collembola prey, especially aphids and Thysanoptera, were found at web-sites of the Linyphiinae, whose aerial webs might be expected to intercept such prey more efficiently. 6. These differences were also present at matched non-web-sites, suggesting that microsite selection by the spiders was determined by the spectra of prey present. Comparison of the weights of web-owning and non-web-owning Tenuiphantes tennis (Linyphiinae) demonstrated the nutritional benefits of web-owning. 7.

In birds, the potential maternal ability to adjust resource allocation to different eggs in the clutch might have a major effect on the survival expectancies of particular nestlings or entire broods. We assessed whether sexually size-dimorphic Eurasian kestrels Falco tinnunculus (Linnaeus) are able to adjust their reproductive effort by adopting different strategies of egg mass provisioning according to egg sex and laying order. 2. Initial eggs bearing male embryos were heavier than initial eggs bearing female embryos, but no differences in egg mass associated to sex were detected for eggs laid subsequently. Furthermore, in clutches started with a male egg, egg mass declined in subsequent eggs, while in clutches started by a female egg the opposite trend in within-clutch egg-mass variation was found. This suggests differential deposition of resources invested in initial eggs of different sex leading to saved or depleted resources for subsequent eggs. 3. Daughters from initial eggs hatched earlier than sons from initial eggs, which may enhance survival of smaller siblings hatched later. These contrasting strategies of egg provisioning and hatching patterns depending on the sex of the first-laid egg were associated, respectively, with marked mass hierarchies and a lack of mass hierarchies at fledgling in broods initiated with eggs bearing sons and daughters. 4. Parental kestrels may allocate reproductive effort by promoting favouritism towards early hatched chicks or by avoiding any favouritism by producing siblings of each sex with similar mass. This may be achieved depending on the female ability both to identify egg sex and to partially reabsorb or differentially allocate resources to eggs accordingly to adjust reproductive investment.

Specifically, we hypothesized that the influence of a marine organism with low mobility on terrestrial environments would be spatially restricted. 3. To address this hypothesis we analysed the distribution (both geographical and local scales) of Galapagos sea lion colonies, and quantified the spatial extent of their influence on terrestrial ecosystems (soil and plants). 4. Our results showed that the influence of Z. wollebaecki on Galapagos terrestrial habitats is restricted to shorelines with low elevations, but that it is it is geographically ubiquitous across the Archipelago. 5. Our study demonstrated that Z. wollebaecki is an effective vector for the transport of marine nutrients to terrestrial ecosystems. Transported nutrients occur in high concentrations in the soils and are used by shoreline plants. These effects are spatially restricted to the areas where seals occur and the most parsimonious explanatory variable for these patterns is the islands' topography (or elevation).",55,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Cryptocarpus | Isotopic enrichment | Sea lion | Sesuvium | Soil ammonia and nitrate | Topography,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,28

Modelling species abundance patterns, i.e. the distribution of relative abundance among species within the same community, has become a common framework in community ecology. To describe species abundance patterns several statistical models have been proposed, e.g. the log-normal distribution, but these do not provide an ecological explanation of the underlying processes. 2. Tokeshi introduced (1990) and developed (1993, 1996, 1999) a series of niche-orientated stochastic models to fit species abundance patterns. They suggest that abundance of species are proportional to the resources they apportion. Following this hypothesis, Tokeshi defined some processes in resource partitioning to explain species abundance patterns. 3. To study the rules which govern species assemblages, parasite communities present advantages because each host harbours a replicate community, the total niche is limited to the body of the host and demographic processes are usually similar for all parasite species in a community. Using five Tokeshi models, we searched for common rules structuring the parasite communities of six species of marine fish from the coast of Chile. The biovolume of each parasite species was preferred as a measure of its 'abundance' over actual numerical abundance, to account for the considerable variation in body size among parasite species. 4. The random assortment model, which suggests a lack of competition and interaction and independent apportionment of resources between species in the community, was fitted successfully to the parasite communities of three fish species for both means and variances of abundance ranks using a new Monte-Carlo method. 5. These results are in accordance with current knowledge on parasite coexistence rules, i.e. that most parasite communities appear non-saturated with species, with many empty niches and with interspecific competition not playing a major structuring role.",46,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Chile | Community structure | Marine fishes | Parasite biovolume | Tokeshi's models,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,30

Using data from a 20-year study of individually marked red-billed choughs, we examine how reproductive performance varies with age in male and female breeders, and investigate whether population-level trends result from changes in individual performance and/or the phenotypic composition of the breeding population. 2. Across the population, mean clutch size, the probability of breeding successfully and the number of offspring fledged during successful attempts increased and then declined with female age. Male age did not explain a significant proportion of the residual variation. 3. All three measures of reproductive performance improved and then declined with age within individual females. 4. Females that died young laid relatively small clutches and fledged few offspring before death. Thus mean performance improved across young age classes partly because some poor breeders were absent from older age classes. 5. Females that ultimately reached the greatest ages had laid small clutches and fledged few offspring during their first few breeding attempts. Females that were more productive when they were young had relatively shorter lives. These data indicate a trade-off between early reproduction and future survival in choughs, and suggest that individuals that reach old age are phenotypically distinct from an early stage in their breeding lives. 6.

Population stability (i.e. level of temporal variation in population abundance) is linked commonly to levels of environmental disturbances. However, populations may also differ in their propensity to dampen or amplify the effects of exogenous forces. Here time-series of population estimates were used to test for such differences among 104 populations of six salmon species. 2. At the species level, Atlantic (Salmo salar L.), chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha Walbaum) and coho salmon (O. kisutch W) were less variable than sockeye (O. nerka W) and pink salmon (O. gorbuscha W). Chum salmon (O. keta W) was more similar to sockeye and pink salmon. These differences may be related in part to differences in body size, and hence susceptibility to adverse environmental conditions, at the time when they migrate to the sea or lakes. 3. At the population level no effect of fecundity on variability was found, in contrast to findings for marine fishes, nor of egg size. Whereas substantial differences in the temporal stability of environmental factors among geographically close populations may override any effects of fecundity or egg size in fresh water, this is less likely in the marine environment where spatial autocorrelations of environmental variability are more pronounced. 4. Variation in population sizes was related positively to the duration of time-series when using standard deviations of ln-transformed population estimates, and also when using linearly detrended population variation, suggesting non-linear long-term abundance trends in salmon populations that extend beyond the 7-year period of the shortest time-series. 5. When controlling for differences among species, stability increased with increasing population size, and it is hypothesized that this is due to large populations having a more complex spatial and genetic structure than small populations due to wider spatial distribution. The effects of population size on stability, as well as differences in stability among species, suggest that population- and organism-specific characteristics may interact with exogenous forces to shape salmon population dynamics.",27,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Density fluctuations | Egg size | Fecundity | Phylogenetic comparisons | Population dynamics,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,32

Current models of adaptive fat regulation make opposing predictions concerning the effect of increased winter food supply on size of the avian winter fat reserve. To distinguish between models, food supply was varied experimentally in nature and two measures of size of the fat reserve were taken at food-supplemented sites and non-supplemented sites. 2. In two winters, most of the seven species sampled showed slightly higher visible subcutaneous fat class at supplemented than at non-supplemented sites; treatment and species factors were statistically significant. Body mass corrected for wing length showed a similar if non-significant trend. 3. A parallel dispersal study of birds colour-banded at non-supplemented sites showed that these birds did not move 0.8 or 1.5 km to use supplemental food at private feeding stations in the study areas. In addition, accipiter hawk attack rate did not differ between supplemented and non-supplemented sites. 4. These results are consistent with a model of adaptive fat regulation (based on between-day environmental variability caused by severe weather events) that predicts an increase in the winter fat reserve at increased food supply. Other published studies, all from the north temperate zone, showed the same pattern. 5. The present results are inconsistent with a second model (based on within-day foraging interruption) which predicts a decrease in the fat reserve under increased food supply. However, a set of published studies, all from tropical regions or regions with mild maritime climate, showed the decrease at higher food predicted by the second but not the first model. 6. Models of adaptive fat regulation in small birds are therefore limited in their predictive power, perhaps because they are developed for environments that differ in the time scale of environmental stochasticity. New studies are needed that explore further the complexities of environment-specific adaptive fat models, e.g. a winter feeding experiment in a tropical bird species.",12,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Adaptive fat regulation | Fitness surrogate | Food supply | Non-breeding ecology | Visible subcutaneous fat,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,33

Parasites can affect host fitness, provoke host responses, and thereby mediate host life history evolution. As life history strategies are often sex-specific, immunological or behavioural responses of the host aiming to reduce the impact of parasites may be sexually dimorphic, e.g. as a consequence of sex differences in the resource allocation trade-off between parasite defence, morphological traits and body functions. Parasites may therefore affect males and females differently leading to sex specific patterns of parasite susceptibility. 2. In an experimental field study, we manipulated the ectoparasite load of great tit nests (Parus major) and investigated its effects on male and female nestlings. As susceptibility to parasites may be linked to the ability of the nestlings to fight off parasites immunologically, we further investigated sex differences in cell-mediated immunity using a phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) assay. 3. Body mass, metatarsus length and overall body size, but not feather length, showed a sexual dimorphism at the end of the nestling period. A significant interaction between the effects of sex and parasite treatment on the sexually dimorphic traits indicates that the parasite effect is sex-specific. While no differences in morphological traits were found in females raised in infested and uninfested nests, parasitized males were significantly smaller and lighter than males raised in uninfested nests. Further, we found a pronounced sexual dimorphism in the response to the PHA assay with males showing a reduced cellular immunity. The parasite treatment had a non-significant effect on the PHA response and the PHA response of males and females were not influenced differently by parasites. 4. Our study shows that sexual dimorphism in susceptibility to parasites and immunocompetence develops early in life, and suggests sex-specific strategies in the allocation of limited resources. Possible mechanisms of sex differences in susceptibility to parasites and immunocompetence during postnatal growth and the consequences for optimal sex allocation strategies of the parents are discussed.",161,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Ceratophyllus gallinae | Immunocompetence | Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) | Resource allocation,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,34

One of the general characteristics of ecological communities is that the number of species accumulates with increasing area sampled. However, it is important to distinguish between the species-area relationship and species accumulation curves. The species-area relationship is concerned with the number of species in areas of different size irrespective of the identity of the species within the areas, whereas the species accumulation curve is concerned with accumulation rates of new species over the sampled area and depends on species identity. 2. We derive an exact analytical expression for the expectance and variance of the species- accumulation curve in all random subsets of samples from a given area. The analytical species accumulation curve may be approximated by a semilog curve. Both the exact accumulation curve and its semilog approximation are independent of the underlying species abundance distributions, but are influenced strongly by the distribution of species among the samples and the spatial relationship of the samples that are randomized. 3. To estimate species richness in larger areas than that sampled we take account of the spatial relationship between samples by dividing the sampled area into subareas. First a species-accumulation curve is obtained for randomized samples of all the single subareas. Then the species-accumulation curve for all combinations of two subareas is calculated and the procedure is repeated for all subareas. From these curves a new total species (T-S) curve is obtained from the terminal point of the subarea plots. The T-S curve can then be extrapolated to estimate the probable total number of species in the area studied. 4. Data from the Norwegian continental shelf show that extrapolation of the traditional species-accumulation curve gave a large underestimate of total species richness for the whole shelf compared with that predicted by the T-S curve. Application of non- parametric methods also gave large underestimates compared with actual data obtained from more extensive sampling than the data analysed here. Although marine soft sediments sampled in Hong Kong were not as variable as those from the Norwegian shelf, nevertheless here the new method also gave higher estimates of total richness than the traditional species-accumulation approaches. 5. Our data show that both the species-accumulation curve and the accompanying T-S curve apply to large heterogeneous areas varying in depth and sediment properties as well as a relatively small homogeneous area with small variation in depth and sediment properties.",381,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,Analytical expression | Species accumulation,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,35

The incubation-limitation hypothesis states that clutch size in shorebirds is constrained by the ability to incubate more than four eggs successfully. In order to test predictions from this hypothesis, clutches of northern lapwings (Vanellus vanellus) were here experimentally increased and reduced by one egg at the onset of incubation. Parental behaviour, incubation time, hatching synchrony, egg viability, hatching success and body condition of hatchlings was compared with unmanipulated clutches. 2. Nest desertion and egg breakage was not observed in any of the experimental nests, showing that clutch enlargement did not alter the parental behaviour adversely. 3. There were no differences among the experimental groups in male and female attentiveness, but the total nest attentiveness was lower in reduced clutches than in the other clutch sizes; nor did the parents' frequency of nest visits differ between clutch sizes. 4. Enlarged clutches were incubated longer than controls and reduced clutches. There were, however, no significant differences among clutch sizes in partial or total clutch predation rates. Hatchability of the eggs (proportion of eggs hatching of those present in nests at the end of incubation) was marginally lower in the enlarged clutches (92.5% vs. 100% in the two other groups). 5. Contrary to predicted, hatching success was highest in enlarged clutches. The numbers of hatched eggs calculated from Mayfield estimates of daily nest and egg survival rates were 0.93, 2.10 and 3.14 in three-, four- and five-egg clutches, respectively. 6. When controlling for egg volume, mean body mass of newly hatched chicks was lower in clutches with five eggs than in other nests. 7. We suggest that the lowered body condition of chicks could outweigh the benefits of laying five instead of four eggs in northern lapwings.

A major challenge for population ecology is to predict population responses to novel conditions, such as habitat loss. This frequently involves understanding dispersal decisions, in terms of their consequences for fitness. However, this approach requires detailed data, and is thus often inappropriate for urgent problems on poorly known species. This may be resolved by developing a predictive framework based on well-studied species, for applying to those that are less well understood. 2. Population size, group sizes and habitat occupancy of the Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis) can be predicted by determining the evolutionary stable dispersal strategy. For densities near to demographic equilibrium, regulation results from the combined effects of non-breeding and use of sink habitats. 3. In the Seychelles warbler, resident male non-breeders compete for breeding vacancies on neighbouring territories. The resulting kin competition is a key process for predicting the observed balance between regulation by non-breeding and regulation by sink use. Family groups, in which offspring delay dispersal, hoping to fill a vacancy on a local territory, are common among group-living species. This suggests that kin competition may frequently play a central role in the population regulation of socially complex species. 4. Although all the model variants considered are complex, predictions are shown to be insensitive to a range of simplifications, illustrating that, despite significant evolutionary import at the individual level, some behaviour can be unimportant when considering population level questions.

Although parasitoids are used widely as a biological models for understanding the evolution of animal behaviour, most studies have been constrained to the laboratory.

We estimated the dynamics of carbohydrates and lipids reserves of Venturia canescens (Gravenhorst) females by releasing individuals of known nutritional status in a natural environment and recapturing them using host-containing traps. The recapture rate was around 30%.

Wild animals were also sampled in order to estimate the resource levels of the local population. 3. The results show that: (i) wasps are able to maintain a nearly constant level of energy over an extended foraging period; (ii) V. canescens takes sugars in the field; and (iii) the lipid reserves accumulated during the larval life may be limiting as lipogenesis does not take place in adults even under conditions of high sugar availability. 4.

Ecological and population processes are affected by large-scale climatic fluctuations, and top predators such as seabirds can provide an integrative view on the consequences of environmental variability on ecosystems. Here, we examine the dynamics of a southern fulmar population in Antarctica over a 39-year period and evaluate the impact of environmental variability on the life history traits of this top predator species. 2. Between 1963 and 2002, the number of breeding pairs fluctuated between seven and 53 in relation to variations in sea ice concentration, and increased overall (annual growth rate: 1.0035). Breeding performance tended to be lower in years with low sea ice concentration. The proportion of birds attempting to breed varied strongly from one year to the next despite the birds were alive, indicating strong environmental forcing on the decision to breed. The number of new local recruits and immigrants was correlated highly with the number of local breeders, and capture probabilities were positively related to the breeding population size. Local recruitment, number of local breeders and proportion of birds attempting to breed were lower when sea ice concentration during summer was low. 3. Adult survival between 1964 and 2002 was on average 0.923 ± 0.006, and decreased during years with high sea surface temperature and low sea ice concentration. 4. Modelled population growth rate, estimated using matrix models, of the population was 0.9728, a difference of 3.6% compared to the observed rate of increase. This discrepancy is due probably to the immigration rate (3 ± 3%). 5. Demographic parameters were affected by sea ice concentration and sea surface temperature anomalies, probably through an impact on krill availability, the main prey of southern fulmars. During warm anomalies, birds skip breeding probably because the food availability was low and limiting for the highly energy demanding reproductive activities. 6. We also emphasize that demographic parameters were very low during the period 1975-80 and showed a higher variability after 1980, which could be interpreted in the context of a regime shift. Our study indicates that the southern fulmar population dynamics may be very susceptible to environmental variability.

Development plasticity is a common evolutionary and phenotypic response to poor growth condition, in particular in organisms with determinate growth such as most birds and mammals. Because various body structures can contribute differently to over-all fitness, natural selection will adjust the degree of plasticity of each structure to its proportionate contribution to fitness at a given life stage. 2. Two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms can account for plasticity in the growth of offspring to compensate for the effect of parasites. First, if parasite infestation levels fluctuate over the nestling period, parasitized young may show reduced growth until peak parasite infestation, and accelerated growth once the conditions improve (the accelerated growth hypothesis). Secondly, if the period of tissue maturation is not fixed in time, hosts may grow slower than parasite-free hosts but for a longer period of time (the delayed maturation hypothesis). 3. To test whether hosts compensate for the effects of parasites on their development, the load of the blood-sucking louse-fly Crataerina melbae Rondani in the nests of Alpine swifts, Apus melba Linnaeus, was increased or decreased experimentally. Parasite prevalence was 100% in both treatments, but intensity (no. of parasites per nestling) was significantly lower for deparasitized nestlings. In both treatments, parasite intensity increased up to halfway through the rearing period (i.e. 30 days of age) and decreased afterwards. 4. In line with the accelerated growth hypothesis, wings of parasitized nestlings grew at a lower rate than those of deparasitized ones before the peak of parasite infestation, but at a greater rate after the peak. Louse-flies had no significant effect on the growth of body mass. In agreement with the delayed-maturation hypothesis, wings of parasitized nestlings grew for 3 additional days and were of similar size at fledging as in deparasitized birds. 5. In summary, the present study shows in a wild bird population that nestling hosts can compensate for the effect of parasitism on their phenotype. It emphasizes the need to take the dynamics of parasite populations into account in studies of host-parasite relationships, and to investigate the effect of parasites on host development over the entire growing period rather than only at fledging, as employed traditionally.",62,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Apus melba | Compensatory growth | Crataerina melbae | Delayed maturation | Host-parasite interaction,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,41

A fundamental ecological question is what determines the abundance of animals? Answering this question is vital in the formulation of effective management plans for endangered or threatened species. However, there are few general hypotheses proposed to account for variation in animal abundance. Studies of folivorous primates are a notable exception. In this group, the protein to fibre ratio of mature leaves is a significant predictor of biomass. However, Dasilva (1992) suggested that the availability of energy may play a critical role in colobine behaviour and ecology. 2. Here we evaluate the importance of food energy content for the red colobus (Procolobus badius) and black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza) monkeys of Kibale National Park, Uganda. 3. Energy was found to be of little importance. None of the eight groups studied selected high-energy foods: there was no correlation between food energy content and foraging effort. For all groups, estimates of energy expenditure [daily energy expenditure (DEE) and average daily metabolic needs (ADMN)] were less than estimates of energy consumption. Finally, the average energy content of mature leaves from the 20 most abundant tree species at four sites was not related to colobine biomass. 4. In contrast, the protein and fibre content of foods was important to both colobine species. Seven of the eight groups selected foods with a high-protein, low-fibre content. The average protein to fibre ratio of mature leaves from the 20 most abundant tree species at four sites was correlated positively with colobine biomass. 5. This study provides further validation of the protein to fibre model, suggesting the importance of this model for conservation and management of colobus monkeys, with the potential application to other small mammalian herbivores.",90,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Calorimetry | Colobus | Diet choice | Kibale National Park | Nutritional ecology,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,42

Experiments investigating the population responses of aphids to CO2 enrichment have yielded results suggesting that aphid populations will be both larger under elevated CO2 and that they will be smaller under elevated CO2. Most studies have failed to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in population sizes due to atmospheric CO2 concentration. This diversity of results has led some investigators to conclude that aphid responses are not general, and that every aphid - plant interaction may be unique and unpredictable a priori. We use a single, general, mathematical model to consider the population responses of cereal aphids to grass grown under different CO2 concentrations. 2. The model shows that it is possible to explain any of the three observed results: larger populations, smaller populations, or no difference, and that which of these three outcomes arises may depend critically on the interaction between aphid nitrogen requirements and the nitrogen fertility of the soil. The model also shows that the qualitative results will depend on how sensitive the aphid species is to increases in its own density. Past studies have shown that aphids increase their production of winged offspring in response to increasing aphid density. The model predicts that, in general, aphid species that have lower nitrogen requirements and that are less sensitive to their own density will be more likely to have larger populations in elevated CO2 compared to ambient CO2. 3. Differences between aphid species (and clones) in their nitrogen requirements and the strength of their density-dependent response have not been widely reported in the literature. Also, the nitrogen fertility of the soil has rarely been manipulated in experiments on aphid responses to rising CO2 levels. The model suggests that the diversity of population responses of aphids may be both understandable and predictable in the context of such an interaction.",91,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Aphid | Carbon dioxide enrichment | Homoptera | Model | Plant - animal interaction,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,43

Three species of folivorous ringtail possums (Marsupialia: Pseudocheiridae) inhabit higher elevation rain forests on the Atherton Tablelands, north-east Queensland, Australia. Each possum is thought to specialize on a restricted suite of host plants. It has been hypothesized that the absence of the possums from lowland forests may reflect the absence or 'inappropriate combination' of their host plants in lowland forests. 2. We test this 'floristics hypothesis' using data from published dietary studies, herbarium records and field surveys. Studies of the possums' diets show that each possum eats a wide variety of plant species. However, the majority of each possum's diet comes from a few genera or families of plants and there is considerable dietary partitioning between the possums. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the possums are specialists on a restricted suite of plant taxa. 3. The altitudinal ranges of plants known to be important in the diets of the ringtail possums were compiled from herbarium records. Several plant species eaten by the possums are absent from lowland forests, but all genera and families of plants important in the possums' diets occur in lowland forests. 4. The relationship between the floristic composition of forests and the abundance of the ringtail possums was examined at 16 sites on the Atherton Tablelands. The floristic composition of forests varied primarily with geology and secondarily with altitude. This was true whether the entire plant assemblage was considered, or just those families known to be important in each possum's diet. Possum abundance varied primarily with altitude and secondarily, for two species, with geology. There was no correlation between the abundance of ringtail possums and the floristic composition of forests, whether the entire plant assemblage was considered, or just those families known to be important in each possum's diet. 5.

Terrestrial predators in coastal areas are often subsidized by marine foods. In order to determine the potential impact on terrestrial prey, the numerical response of predators to each food source must be determined. 2. In winter, arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) may forage on the frozen Arctic ocean and scavenge carcasses of seals killed by polar bears (Ursus maritimus), but the importance of this food source and its effect on the population cycles of arctic foxes and lemmings (their primary prey) are unclear. 3. I estimated the marine component of the late winter diet of arctic foxes near Churchill, Manitoba, using stable-carbon isotope analysis, and compared these estimates to abundance of arctic foxes and collared lemmings (Dicrostonyx richardsoni). 4. From 1994 to 1997, fox density varied with lemming abundance, but following a decline, fox abundance began increasing before lemmings. During this increase marine foods were consumed more than in other years, with over two-thirds of food intake from marine sources. 5. Arctic and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) harvests in the 1980s to 1990s were correlated with published estimates of polar bear body mass, which varies with seal productivity. However, this relationship disappeared during high lemming years. 6. Thus, variation in marine productivity affects arctic fox abundance, especially when their primary prey are scarce, and this numerical response of arctic foxes to marine resources and lemmings suggests that increased predation by arctic foxes subsidized by seal carrion may delay the recovery of low lemming populations.",107,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Allochthonous resources | Indirect effects | Numerical response | Scavenging | Stable isotope ratios,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,46

Prey size was generalized to the ratio between mussel width and major chela length (MW : MCL) and prey profitability standardized to the ratio between prey mass eaten per unit breaking time and predator mass (1/h Tb). 3. Crabs either crushed the mussel with their claws or opened the mussel using the more time-consuming cutter technique. The latter technique was employed above a critical MW: MCL ratio (0.24). This threshold appeared to coincide with the ratio where prey profitability is maximal. 4. When a range of prey sizes were offered simultaneously, an observed MW : MCL ratio (0.14-0.16) turned out to be lower than the predicted optimal MW : MCL ratio (0.16-0.22) and lower than the MW : MCL ratio where the first crab switched feeding techniques (0.16). Crabs preferred a MW : MCL ratio of 0.16 over the optimal ratio of 0.24 when given dichotomous choices between different MW : MCL ratios. 5. Although larger and more profitable mussels can be crushed, we suggest that crabs select small crushable mussels to prevent claw wear and tear.

Whereas the effects of density-dependent growth and survival on population dynamics are well-known, mechanisms that give rise to density dependence in animal populations are not well understood. We tested the hypothesis that the trade-off between growth and mortality rates is mediated by foraging activity and habitat use. Thus, if depletion of food by prey is density-dependent, and leads to greater foraging activity and risky habitat use, then visibility and encounter rates with predators must also increase. 2. We tested this hypothesis by experimentally manipulating the density of young rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) at risk of cannibalism, in a replicated single-factor experiment using eight small lakes, during an entire growing season. 3. We found no evidence for density-dependent depletion of daphnid food in the near-shore refuge where most age-0 trout resided. Nonetheless, the proportion of time spent moving by individual age-0 trout, the proportion of individuals continuously active, and use of deeper habitats was greater in high density populations than in low density populations. Differences in food abundance among lakes had no effect on measures of activity or habitat use. 4. Mortality of age-0 trout over the growing season was higher in high density populations, and in lakes with lower daphnid food abundance. Therefore, population-level mortality of age-0 trout is linked to greater activity and use of risky habitats by individuals at high densities. We suspect that food resources were depleted at small spatial and temporal scales not detected by our plankton sampling in the high density treatment, because food-dependent activity and habitat use by age-0 trout occurs in our lakes when food abundance is experimentally manipulated (Biro, Post & Parkinson, in press).",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Activity | Behaviour | Mortality | Population consequences | Trade-off,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,49

This work aims to illustrating how it is possible to measure different modalities of adult dispersal in two subdivided populations of the alpine newt (Triturus alpestris). Recent developments in capture-mark-recapture methods make it possible to estimate transience rates from individuals captured only once. In the context of subdivided newt populations, transience is assumed to express nomadic behaviour that contribute to breeding dispersal. Skeletochronology and recaptures within each pond system also made it possible to estimate emigration rates and local dispersal. 2. Two subdivided populations of alpine newts were monitored over 4 and 5 years, respectively. Whereas population A is suspected to have been established for more than 100 years, population B was monitored when colonizing a newly created archipelago of ponds. 3. Transience was detected in each population at similar rates (37% in population A and 35% in the population B). Annual apparent survival rates were estimated as 82% in population A vs. 33% in population B. Similarity of age structures between populations leads us to consider such low survival rates in population B as resulting from emigration. Emigration was thus negligible in population A and was estimated to reach 57.3% in population B. Conversely, high local dispersal (movements within a pond system) was detected in population A, but not in population B. 4.

Large herbivores have strongly age-structured populations. Because recruitment often decreases as population density increases, in unexploited populations the proportion of older adults may increase with density. Because survival senescence is typical of ungulates, ignoring density-dependent changes in age structure could lead to apparent density-dependence in adult survival. 2. To test for density dependence in adult survival, we used data from three populations that underwent considerable changes in density. Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) on Ram Mountain, Alberta, ranged from 94 to 232, mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus) on Caw Ridge, Alberta, varied from 81 to 147, and estimates of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) older than 1 year at Chizé, France, ranged from 157 to 569. 3.

When age class was taken into account, there were no significant effects of density on adult survival. Except for male mountain goats, the strength of density dependence was lower when age was taken into account. 5. In ungulate populations, age structure is an important determinant of adult survival.

These results suggested that both sexes in this species roam to mate, because the results could not be explained by a seasonal change in food availability nor by increased foraging movements of oestrous females to replenish body reserves after previous cub raising. 3. Females with cubs-of-the-year (cubs) restricted their range size in the mating season and increased their ranges in the post-mating season. This finding suggests that females with cubs restricted their ranges to avoid contact with infanticidal males, an important cause of cub mortality, because the proposed alternative explanation - limited mobility of small cubs - was unable to explain the small size of mating season ranges. 4.

Patterns of species richness along latitudinal, elevational and depth gradients often exhibit a mid-gradient peak. Similar patterns with a mid-domain peak in richness are produced, as a result of geometric constraints on species distributions, by models that randomize species range size and placement over a bounded gradient. 2. Proponents of these so-called mid-domain models argue that they provide an appropriate null hypothesis for examining species richness patterns along spatial gradients. Furthermore, some claim that because these models seem to explain a large proportion of the large-scale spatial variation in richness, geometric constraints on species distribution are in fact the cause of these patterns. 3. A critical examination of model assumptions reveals that some are unrealistic, conceptually flawed or internally inconsistent. Additionally, tests of mid-domain models have suffered from methodological deficiencies derived from arbitrariness and circularity in the definition of domain boundaries, collapsing two-dimensional (2-D) patterns into a single dimension (1-D), and the use of interpolated ranges, all of which can bias test results in favour of the models. Tests have also been statistically naive by using fairly insensitive measures of deviation between observed and predicted patterns and ignoring the increased probability of Type I error that can result in analyses of spatially autocorrelated data. 4. In spite of this, a review of the empirical evidence indicates that most studies do not show a high degree of concordance between observed and predicted species richness patterns, particularly in 2-D. Additionally, spatial patterns of variation in range size and species turnover do not unequivocally support mid-domain models. Thus, the models do not adequately describe observed species richness gradients and thus fail to explain them. 5. Although mid-domain models have served a useful purpose in drawing attention to the need to clarify the null expectation in the study of species richness gradients, their use appears to be severely limited by difficulties associated with the treatment of ranges, boundary definitions and a lack of clarity regarding the extent to which the observed data should be used to generate the null patterns.",119,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Geometric constraints | Mid-domain effect | Null models | Random range overlap | Species diversity patterns,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,54

This could reflect a genuine lack of simple gradients in beta diversity, or a lack of agreement as to just what constitutes beta diversity. Unfortunately, a large number of approaches have been applied to the investigation of variation in beta diversity, which potentially makes comparisons of the findings difficult. 2. We review 24 measures of beta diversity for presence/absence data (the most frequent form of data to which such measures are applied) that have been employed in the literature, express many of them for the first time in common terms, and compare some of their basic properties. 3. Four groups of measures are distinguished, with a fundamental distinction arising between 'broad sense' measures incorporating differences in composition attributable to species richness gradients, and 'narrow sense' measures that focus on compositional differences independent of such gradients. On a number of occasions on which the former have been employed in the literature the latter may have been more appropriate, and there are many situations in which consideration of both kinds of measures would be valuable. 4. We particularly recommend (i) considering beta diversity measures in terms of matching/mismatching components (usually denoted a, b and c) and thereby identifying the contribution of different sources of variation in species composition, and (ii) the use of ternary plots to express the relationship between the values of these measures and of the components, and as a way of understanding patterns in beta diversity.",1135,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Beta diversity | Biodiversity | Presence-absence | Similarity indices | Spatial turnover,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,56

Population dynamics are the result of variation in survival, recruitment, emigration and immigration rates. Covariation between these demographic rates critically affects the dynamics and magnitude of fluctuations in population size. Such covariation can arise by environmental factors affecting several rates in similar ways. Also demographic processes, such as the source-sink and the balanced dispersal process, are expected to lead to covariation between demographic rates. 2. Here, we study variation and covariation in survival, emigration, immigration, and the size of a Swiss barn owl (Tyto alba) population, and examine the factors associated with this variation. For practical reasons, survival and emigration are often confounded in studies of natural populations. We overcome this problem by jointly analysing live-recapture and dead-recovery data using recently developed statistical methods. 3. Mortality, emigration, the number of known immigrants, and population size were positively correlated over time. Neither the source-sink nor the balanced dispersal process is expected to lead to this pattern. 4. Survival was lower for juveniles than adults (mean 17% vs. 72%), and highly variable across years in both age classes. Snow cover, mean annual temperature and population density accounted for 32-47% of the variation in survival of juveniles and adults. Emigration was higher for juveniles than for adults, and adults emigrated more often when the population size was higher. 5. Our results showed that local population dynamics were affected by density dependence and the stochastic environmental factors snow cover and temperature. Rather than lending support to one of the two dispersal hypotheses, the patterns of correlation between survival, dispersal, and population size suggest strong fluctuations in environmental conditions that influence the dynamics of barn owl populations at a larger spatial scale.",74,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Breeding dispersal | Combined live-recapture and dead-recovery model | Environmental stochasticity | Natal dispersal | Program MARK,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,57

Multiscale determinants of diversity and the relationship between regional (RSR) and local richness (LSR) have recently attracted increased attention, yet such studies on stream organisms remain scarce. We studied the relationships among RSR, β-diversity, LSR and local environmental variables in 120 headwater streams in Finland. Approximately similar-sized areas of eight drainage systems were defined as regions, and 15 stream riffles (= locality) per region were sampled. 2. RSR showed a strong positive relationship with mean LSR (R2 = 0.686), and there was no sign of curvilinearity within the observed range of RSR. RSR was also positively, although non-significantly, related to β-diversity (r = 0.662). 3. In stepwise regression, RSR was the first variable to enter the model, and a model incorporating RSR and stream width explained 32.5% of variation in LSR. If RSR was omitted from the model, then stream width emerged as the most important variable, followed by water pH, which together accounted for 20.6% of variation in LSR. 4. At the within-region scale, different variables were important in accounting for variation in LSR. Factors correlated with LSR reflected either stream size, spatial heterogeneity, adverse water chemistry conditions (pH), or a limiting resource base for macroinvertebrates (nutrient concentrations). 5. The major role of RSR in setting the upper limit to LSR suggests that macroinvertebrate assemblages of boreal headwater streams are unsaturated. This finding is supported by evidence from experimental studies, where it has been shown that competitive interactions among stream macroinvertebrates are effective only at very small spatial scales, and competitive exclusion is prevented typically by frequent disturbances. However, although RSR was generally the most influential variable contributing to LSR, it is far from clear whether RSR consistently sets the limits to LSR, or vice versa. For instance, uniformly adverse water chemistry conditions across a region may lead to low levels of local richness and low species turnover among sites, leading eventually to an impoverished regional species pool. 6. These findings do not deny the importance of local factors, but emphasize that understanding the organization of stream benthic communities requires simultaneous examination of factors prevailing at multiple spatial scales.",185,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Local richness | Regional richness | Species diversity | Stream macroinvertebrates | Turnover diversity,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,58

In predators interference by two of the species on a smaller predator species seemed to affect predation rates negatively. 5.

The species-area relationship (SAR) is one of the major patterns in community ecology, but the mechanisms that contribute to its exact shape have remained obscure. In continuous mainland areas, the SAR has been attributed to sampling effects (large areas contain species that are too rare to be present in small areas), habitat heterogeneity (large areas contain more types of habitat allowing more species to coexist), and population and metapopulation processes causing spatial aggregation. We tested the contribution of these effects to SARs using data on breeding bird distributions in the Czech Republic, their total population sizes and spatial distributions of their preferred habitats. 2. The relationship between number of species and sampled area is more or less linear on a log-log scale within the Czech Republic, although it reveals saturation when the area is expanded to the whole of central Europe. 3. Neither sampling effect nor habitat heterogeneity alone explain the observed SAR shape: both models predict much higher species richness within any area and a SAR of much lower slope than observed. 4. A combined model based on random sampling constrained by the amount of suitable habitat within an area gives quite realistic predictions of species numbers within different sample areas. Nevertheless, the observed pattern reveals much higher variance of species richness amongst areas, species often being significantly more spatially aggregated than predicted by habitat distribution. 5. Moreover, the relationship between the amount of suitable habitat and the probability of quadrat occupancy is actually nonsignificant for about two-thirds of species, indicating that assumptions of the combined model are unrealistic. Therefore, the shape and slope of SARs are actually affected both by habitat heterogeneity that represents the major driver of distribution of some species, and by spatial aggregation that is not attributable to habitat heterogeneity in other species.",53,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Aggregation | Habitat heterogeneity | Metapopulation | Power law | Spatial distribution,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,60

Foraging determines the intake of resources that are expended on fitness related activities, and allocation links foraging and life-history traits, but the extent to which individuals are able to adjust energy expenditure according to allocation decisions is still poorly studied. 2. To examine this, we studied for the first time the efficiency of foraging trips (defined as the ratio of energy gained over energy spent while foraging) in a pelagic seabird provisioning its chick by measuring simultaneously the energy flow to the chick, changes in adult body mass and foraging cost using doubly labelled water. The study was performed over two seasons. 3. Blue petrels (Halobaena caerulea) alternate between short foraging trips (average 1.9 days, range 1-4 days) where they maximize food delivery to the chick but loose mass, and long foraging trips (7.3 days, 5-10 days) where they increase in mass. They expend 1.5-2.2 times more energy per unit of time during short trips (2561 kJ day-1 kg-1, i.e 3.2 times the resting metabolic rate) compared to long trips (1142-1676 kJ day-1 kg-1, i.e. 1.4-2.1 the resting metabolic rate). 4. The currency during long trips is therefore to maximize efficiency, whereas during short trips the currency is to maximize rate of energy delivery to the chick. Maximum efficiency peaks for 6-day trips, i.e. when adult mass gain is highest, foraging costs are lowest and efficiency was extremely low during short trips. A duration of 6 days is therefore the optimal duration of long foraging trips but trips of 7 days were more common. 5. Our study shows that self-feeding during long trips is crucial for the success of short trips because most of the energy used during short trips is probably derived from the energy stored during long trips. Self-feeding during short trips is probably negligible. 6. The study indicates that surprisingly long distance foraging may not always result in higher foraging costs compared to shorter movements. It highlights the predominant role of body store usage as a mechanism for this animal to adjust energy expenditure and energetic efficiency during foraging for allocation purposes.",79,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Blue petrel | Doubly labelled water | Energetic yield | Foraging decisions,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,61

The ubiquitous, positive abundance-occupancy relationship is of potential value to conservation and pest management because of the possibility of using it to predict species abundance from occupancy measures. 2. He & Gaston (2000a) developed a model, and a parameterization method, for the prediction of abundance from occupancy based on the negative binomial distribution. There are to date few empirical tests of either the estimation method or model. Here we conduct such a test in a field-based mesocosm experiment using a Drosophilidae assemblage associated with decaying fruit. 3. With individual (and groups of) fruit as minimum mapping units, abundance estimates derived using the parameterization method of the He-Gaston model differed significantly from measured values, and were least accurate for the most abundant species. 4. Substitution of k-values corrected for species density in the model did not improve abundance predictions significantly. However, substitution of k-values calculated directly from the negative binomial distribution yielded highly accurate abundance predictions. 5. Although the distribution of fly species did not deviate significantly from the negative binomial distribution, and the finest possible minimum mapping units were used (individual fruit), the parameterization method in the He-Gaston model consistently underestimated the abundance of species in the assemblage because individuals were very highly aggregated within fruit. 6. Because of its potential importance, this model and parameterization method require further exploration at fine scales, commonly represented by individual habitat units, for highly aggregated species.

Omnivorous arthropods are known to change their diet when host plant quality is low. Consequently, it has been suggested that decreased plant quality has a twofold negative effect on herbivore populations: (1) a decrease in growth rate of herbivores; (2) omnivores include more herbivores in their diet. We hypothesized that decreased host plant quality may also cause omnivores to feed on predators, including their own enemies. 2. We tested this hypothesis, using the omnivorous western flower thrips. This species is known to feed on many plant species, but also on the eggs of another herbivore, the two-spotted spider mite. Previous research has shown that a decrease in plant quality leads to increased feeding on spider mite eggs by western flower thrips. Western flower thrips also kill the eggs of various predatory mites, including those of the specialist predator of spider mites and those of a predatory mite that attacks western flower thrips itself. 3. In this paper we investigate whether thrips larvae kill predator eggs to feed on them and whether this predation depends on host plant quality. 4. Larval survival as well as developmental rate increased when plant tissue of low quality (sweet pepper) was supplemented with eggs of two predatory mite species or when it was supplemented with pollen, a high-quality food type. 5. Supplementing high quality leaf tissue (cucumber) with predator eggs did not lead to increased survival and developmental rate. Thrips larvae fed significantly less on predatory mite eggs when pollen was available. 6. Thus, thrips larvae indeed feed on predator eggs, including those of their predator, and they feed more on predator eggs when host plants are of low quality.",59,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Omnivore diet | Phytoseiidae | Plant quality | Thrips,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,63

Related plant species with different spatial and/or temporal life-history characteristics often possess differences in secondary chemistry and thus direct defensive capability. These differences are often attributed to a range of divergent selection pressures from herbivores and pathogens. Most studies of insect-plant interactions have examined the effects of plant defence on herbivore performance, with less attention being paid to higher trophic levels, such as parasitoid wasps. Moreover, to date it is not known whether secondary plant compounds may affect organisms in the fourth trophic level. 2. Here, we study interactions in a four-trophic-level system. The development of a solitary secondary hyperparasitoid, Lysibia nana, and its primary endoparasitoid host, Cotesia glomerata, are compared when reared from a primary herbivore host, Pieris brassicae, which was itself reared on two cruciferous plants with contrasting life histories. Whereas L. nana is known to attack the pupae of a number of primary parasitoids in the genus Cotesia, both C. glomerata and P. brassicae are intimately associated with plants in the family Brassicaceae. 3. Insects were reared from a feral population of the spring perennial, Brassica oleracea, and a naturally occurring population of a summer annual, B. nigra. Like other cruciferous plants, both species are known to produce glycoside toxins (= glucosinolates) after they are attacked by foliar herbivores. However, concentrations of glucosinolates were more than 3.5 times higher in young shoots of B. nigra than in corresponding shoots of B. oleracea. 4. Cocoon weight in C. glomerata was unaffected by the foodplant on which P. brassicae was reared, whereas in 24-h-old host cocoons emerging adult hyperparasitoid body mass increased significantly with cocoon size and wasps were significantly larger, and survived better on B. oleracea than on B. nigra. Moreover, body mass in L. nana was typically larger in young (c. 24 h), than in older (c. 72 h) cocoons of C. glomerata. Egg-to-adult development time in L. nana generally increased with host size and age, and wasps on younger hosts completed their development more rapidly on B. nigra. 5.

The long-term fitness consequences of conditions during development are receiving growing attention: they are at the interface between ecological and evolutionary processes. We addressed the influence of the length of the rearing period and 'rank' on fitness components in a long-lived seabird species with deferred breeding: the kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla). Rank, which depends on hatching order, was used as a surrogate for dominance status in the brood. Rank could be viewed as a random factor affecting individuals regardless of their possible 'intrinsic quality' at birth. The length of the rearing period was used as a surrogate for parental effort. It reflects the interaction between numerous factors such as environmental conditions, parental quality, reproductive decisions and effort, and also offspring decisions and intrinsic quality at birth. 2. There was evidence of an influence of the length of the rearing period on local survival before recruitment. Individuals with shorter rearing periods had lower local survival during the first winter (e.g. the relationship was positive). They may incur higher mortality. In rank 1 prebreeders, this relationship was negative in older age-classes. Longer rearing periods and better condition at independence may be associated with stronger migrating ability, and prebreeders that have not yet made settlement decisions may emigrate permanently to distant locations. Such a complex pattern may reflect age-related changes in the relative contribution of mortality and permanent emigration to local survival. 3. The length of the rearing period had long-term consequences on reproductive performance. The relationship was positive but the rate of increase decreased slightly at higher values of the covariate. 4. There was an unambiguously negative influence of rank on survival before recruitment and recruitment probability, but not on demographic parameters specific to the reproductive stage.

Factors governing dispersal rates have seldom been examined in spatially structured populations of vertebrates. We gathered information during 8 years on transfer rates between subpopulations in a spatially structured, growing population of colonial lesser kestrels Falco naumanni, and analysed the contribution of several variables related to spatial isolation and characteristics of both subpopulation of origin and destination on probabilities of dispersal. 2. Lesser kestrels were highly philopatric to their subpopulations, but first-breeders dispersed more often than adults (26% vs. 4%, n = 1706) because adults were reluctant to move from familiar areas. Frequency of subpopulation change was higher in females than in males (first-recruiters: 30% vs. 22%, n = 987; adults 5% vs. 1%, n = 719), according to their different breeding roles. However, all populational factors had an equal effect on individuals of different sex and dispersal status. 3. Movement rates decreased with inter-subpopulation distance - indicating that travelling to distant subpopulations may impose costs in terms of breeding prospects -and with the number of subpopulations, which increased during our study period. 4. Conspecific attraction strongly influenced the probability of dispersal: it was relatively higher in largely populated subpopulations, and individuals of large subpopulations were reluctant to change to others. These results were neither influenced by the size and breeding density of the subpopulations nor by habitat quality in terms of food availability or risk of predation, as indicated by breeding success of kestrels at each subpopulation. The number of conspecifics could be used by the kestrels as a cue of patch quality in terms of settlement options, and large subpopulations could be more easily detected by prospecting birds. 5. Our study highlights the fact that several assumptions of theoretical metapopulation modelling are often not fulfilled in nature.

Large limpets are superior competitors that may modulate the abundance of small limpets on the shore.

The model provides a robust working hypothesis, to which we apply a novel approach of quantifying the relative impact of local and regional factors on the species richness of individual pools. Using elasticity analysis of model parameters and invoking elasticity as a measure of parameter 'importance' we show, for example, that the impact of regional species richness on the richness of noninteractive communities should always exceed that of the probability of local extinction. 4. The analysis exposes potential difficulties in generalizing which factor - local or regional - has the greater relative importance, and to what extent, as the answer can depend on: (i) the specific factors being compared, and (ii) particular habitat characteristics of individual localities.",36,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Elasticity | Species richness | Temporary ponds,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,69

In the deserts of the south-western United States of America, as in many ecoregions around the world, invasion of non-native plants is modifying the structure and composition of riparian vegetation. 2. Restoration of native plant species frequently proves to be ecologically and economically difficult. In the Muddy River drainage in the Mojave Desert (Nevada, USA), eradication of one the most aggressive invasive plants, Tamarix ramosissima (salt-cedar), often reduces the structural and compositional diversity of the remaining vegetation. This can have negative effects on native animals, including birds. 3. The objectives of our work were (i) to examine relationships between avian diversity and measures of vegetational diversity (species richness, dominance of non-native plants and vegetation structure [total vegetation volume]), (ii) to explore the extent to which avian community composition was associated with vegetation composition (floristics) or vegetation structure (physiognomy), and (iii) to consider the potential effects of alternative land management and ecological restoration strategies on the biodiversity of birds and other native fauna in watersheds in the arid south-western USA. 4. Species richness of all birds and of breeding birds was best modelled by total vegetation volume alone. Neither species richness of plants nor dominance of non-native plants had a statistically significant effect on species richness, abundance or evenness of birds. 5. Species composition of birds between sites was more similar when floristics was more similar, and vice versa. Species composition of birds was not correlated with physiognomy. 6. Species richness of native birds in the Muddy River drainage appears not to suffer from invasion of non-native plants, provided that the vegetational community retains sufficient structural diversity. 7. The composition of the bird community is closely related to floristics, and other taxonomic groups may exhibit different responses to vegetation structure and composition. Therefore, explicit strategies for landscape-scale management, restoration and maximization of native faunal diversity should consider how removal of invasive plants may affect physiognomy and floristics of the vegetational community as a whole.",118,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Ecosystem function | Functional redundancy | Invasive species | Restoration ecology | Tamarix ramosissima (salt-cedar),29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,70

Sex differences in the timing and magnitude of energy expenditure for reproduction may result in sex-specific seasonal patterns of energy storage and utilization, particularly among capital-breeding species. We studied the seasonal patterns of energy storage in adult grey seals, Halichoerus grypus, a capital-breeding, marine carnivore, to test the prediction that males and females differ in their seasonal pattern of energy storage and expenditure. 2. We measured body mass and composition in 135 (67 males, 68 females) adult grey seals at five key points throughout the annual cycle. Longitudinal changes in body composition were also measured in 73 individuals (35 males, 38 females) to examine individual variability. 3. There were significant sex differences in seasonal patterns of total body energy, with females exhibiting greater energy content (after accounting for body mass) throughout the year. Females gained body energy following both the spring moult and the breeding season, whereas males only gained body energy following an extended period of loss that included both breeding and moulting, a period of some 6 months. 4. Mass loss of females during the breeding season was similar in magnitude and composition to that gained during the 7-month pre-breeding foraging period. In contrast, mass loss of males during the breeding season was more similar to that gained during the last three months of the pre-breeding foraging period. 5. Our results suggest that the balance of costs and benefits of storing body energy for reproduction differs between males and females. Females appear to be risk-averse, committing themselves to, and preparing for, reproduction at a much earlier stage in the annual cycle compared to males. As a result, females accumulate body energy stores earlier and carry a higher level of insurance against environmental uncertainty leading up to the breeding season relative to males.",98,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Body composition | Body mass | Fitness-maximizing strategy | Grey seals | Reproduction | Seasonal | Sex,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,71

Analyses based on observed dispersal distances of common pochards and tufted ducks provided no evidence that breeding success in year t influenced dispersal distance between t and t + 1. 3. Breeding dispersal distances (year t to t + 1) of pochards and tufted ducks were associated with a delay in relative nest initiation dates in year t + 1. The delay was greater for pochards (c. 4 days) than for tufted ducks (c. 2 days) when females dispersed > 0.8 km. 4. Northern shovelers and tufted ducks moved from a large island to small islands at low water levels and from small islands to the large island at high water levels before the construction of elevated small islands (1960-82). Following this habitat management (1983-94), breeding fidelity was extremely high and not influenced by water level in the marsh for either species. 5. Because pochard nesting habitats in black-headed gull colonies were saturated during the entire study period, nesting females moved into and out of colonies with similar probabilities. Local survival probabilities and incubation body masses were higher for both yearlings (SY) and adults (ASY) nesting within gull colonies, suggesting that these females were of better quality than females nesting outside of the colonies. 6. Tufted ducks showed higher probabilities of moving from islands to emergent marshes when water levels were higher both before and after habitat management. However, rates of movement for a given water level were higher during the period before management than after. 7.

Intraguild predation (IGP) has been studied extensively in predatory fish, amphibians and mammals, but less so in top avian predators. We studied the impact of IGP by large eagle owls Bubo bubo Linnaeus (body mass ∼1.5-4 kg) on diurnal black kites Milvus migrans Boddaert (∼0.5-1 kg) in eight populations located in the Italian Alps. Eagle owls preyed on both adult and nestling kites, especially when kites nested within 2 km of an owl nest. Food overlap was low as kites preyed mainly on fish and owls on mammals. Eagle owls were absent from two study areas, bred very close to another area and were present at medium-high densities in the other five. Within-population effects varied and were most severe in areas with high owl densities. Overall, kites responded to predation risk through predator spatial avoidance, being concentrated in interstitial predation-refugia bordering the core home range of owl pairs. 2. Kite productivity declined steeply with increasing predation risk; no nestling fledged within 1 km of an owl nest. Brood predation was higher in an area with medium owl density than in an area lacking eagle owls. 3. The abandonment of kite territories increased near owl nests, but close coexistence was maintained by new kite territories being established occasionally in areas of high predation risk and high food abundance, which probably functioned as ecological traps. Compared to a random nest dispersion, colonial nesting was avoided within 1 km of an owl pair and peaked in conditions of medium predation risk. 4. At the population level, kite density and productivity were related to a complex interaction of IGP risk and food abundance, and were probably shaped by a mixture of top-down and bottom-up effects. These results may apply to many other vertebrate mesopredators, whose individual decisions and population responses are probably the result of a trade-off between predator avoidance and food acquisition. 5. At the community level, the density of different diurnal avian predators responded differently to IGP risk, some of them even increasing with this risk. The diversity of the assemblage peaked at medium-high eagle owl density. Future studies of top vertebrate predators need to take more account of IGP effects.

Cooperatively breeding green woodhoopoes, Phoeniculus purpureus, forage mainly as close-knit groups, creating opportunities for intrasexual and intersexual foraging competition. 2. Adult males foraged on wider branches than adult females, probably as a consequence of their larger body size (5-8%). Moreover, adult males spent more time scaling bark and probing the ends of broken branches, while adult females preferred pecking. There was no intersexual difference in the use of hole probing or surface gleaning. 3. Intersexual differences in foraging technique probably resulted from morphological differences: adult male bills were 36% longer than those of females, with no overlap between the sexes. In support of the specialization hypothesis: (a) birds were more likely to forage in close proximity to a member of the opposite sex; (b) there was more intrasexual than intersexual aggression during foraging; (c) lone females did not change their foraging behaviour from when in close proximity to a male; (d) the niche breadth of both sexes was similar; and (e) juveniles foraged in ways predicted from their bill lengths. On fledging, bills of juvenile males and females were the same length as those of adult females, and all juveniles fed like adult females. After 4 months, the bills of juvenile males exceeded those of adult females, and they began to forage like adult males. 4. Adult males brought different invertebrate taxa and heavier prey to the nest than females. These differences were a consequence of the different foraging techniques used, because both sexes collected the same types of prey when using the same technique. 5. When all group members foraged together, dominant adults spent more time hole probing than subordinates of the same sex. This intrasexual difference probably resulted from interference competition, as dominants and subordinates did not differ in bill length, and dominants excluded subordinates from prime feeding areas. 6.

Breeding birds increase their fitness by synchronizing their production of chicks with a peak of food abundance. Synchronization is primarily achieved by varying first egg date, but yearly temperature variations may delay or accelerate the food peak after the first egg has been laid. We tested the extent to which great tits (Parus major L.) can strategically change their synchronization of hatch date with the food peak after the first egg has been laid by changing clutch size, laying interval and the amount of incubation. We also tested whether these possible synchronization change mechanisms resulted in changes in breeding success, because if the food peak is late relative to first egg date, we would predict more of the population to have larger clutches and/or a hatch date synchronous with the food peak date. 2. Great tits modified synchronization strategically by varying clutch size and the onset of incubation after clutch completion. When first egg date was early but then followed by cold weather so that the food peak was late, clutch sizes were larger, and when first egg date was late and temperatures were low, mean incubation periods were shorter if the food peak was early. 3. Over the 39-year period of the study, the period between the first egg date and food peak increased significantly by 1.7 days more than the period between the food peak and hatch date. Great tits have maintained synchronization by significantly increasing their incubation period. 4. Overall, the proportion of nests that had synchronous hatch dates depended on the yearly temperature pattern: the decline in variance between date of clutch completion and hatch was significantly greater in years where prelaying temperatures were higher (i.e. early first egg dates) and has therefore increased in recent years because of climate change. In warm early seasons (and more often in recent years) more of the great tits that laid relatively late had sufficient time to complete their clutches before having to start incubation in order to hatch in time for the food peak. 5. The increased proportion of synchronized nests in recent years probably resulted in increased chick output: a greater proportion of recent nests successfully fledged all of the chicks that hatched and the number of young fledged per successful nest also increased in recent years. These changes may have arisen because the proportion of nests with disadvantageous asynchronous hatching and/or smaller clutches has decreased. As the proportion of great tits that start nesting too late to synchronize has declined so selection for early laying has also declined in recent years.",159,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Climate change | Great tit | Timing of breeding,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,76

The functional response, i.e. the quantity of food consumed per unit of time as a function of food availability, is a central process in foraging ecology. The application of this concept to foraging by mammalian herbivores has led to major insights into the process of resource acquisition, but it has so far been little used to understand foraging in avian herbivores. 2. In this study, we describe the functional responses of three grazing Anatidae, the wigeon Anas penelope L. (mean body mass in this study 620 g), the barnacle goose Branta leucopsis B. (2000 g), and the greylag goose Anser anser L. (3500 g). We measured instantaneous intake rates on eight grass heights from 1 cm to 12 cm, as well as pecking rates and peck sizes, and used the Spalinger-Hobbs model developed for mammalian herbivores to explore the mechanisms limiting intake in these three species. 3. Greylag geese increased their intake rate with increasing food availability (a Type II response), wigeon showed a weak quadratic (Type IV) response, and intake rate by barnacle geese did not vary significantly across the range of variability we offered the birds. 4. Intake rates differed markedly between individuals, especially in greylag geese, where body mass explained much of the variation. For individuals in all three species, peck sizes strongly influenced instantaneous intake rates, and the size of the bill (width in particular) appeared to be an important determinant of peck size. 5. Peck sizes increased with sward height (although only very weakly in wigeon), but so did cropping time for wigeon and barnacle geese, which led to a significant decline of intake rates on the tallest grass, at least in the small wigeon. For these very selective small herbivores, the time to crop a mouthful was therefore a significant limiting factor for the birds' instantaneous intake rate (in addition to peck size and swallowing time). This differs markedly from the situation in mammalian herbivores where bite size (through chewing time) is the principal controlling process in food concentrated patches, a result that we found in greylag geese.

The population dynamics of bank voles and wood mice, and of cowpox virus infection in these two species, was studied over a 2-year period in a mainland population and in 14 nearby island populations of varying sizes. 2. For both species, there was no intrinsic variation in the pattern of host dynamics with island size: small island populations behaved as though they were small subsamples of a larger population, displaying no more than the expected random variation from the general pattern. 3. None the less, the relative numbers of bank voles to wood mice increased markedly with decreasing island size; and bank vole densities tended to be higher on smaller islands. 4. Only 22 animals were discovered to have moved either between islands or between the mainland and the islands, out of 1883 captured in all. None the less, it was apparent that males were more likely to move than females. 5. Overall patterns of cowpox virus dynamics were similar in all cases. However, on all islands there were extended periods when cowpox virus infection was apparently absent, and on the small islands the numbers of infected individuals were mostly very low and in many cases infection was never found. 6. For both host species, there was no evidence for a threshold population size for cowpox virus (critical community size) in terms of density, but clear evidence for one in terms of the numerical size of populations. This suggests little support for density-dependent transmission, despite this having been the usual default assumption for non-sexually transmitted infections. 7. There was also evidence for a separate invasion threshold (between ecological and epidemiological invasion) and persistence threshold (between epidemiological invasion and persistence). This is contrary to the output of the most-quoted (deterministic) models - persistence and invasion threshold one and the same - highlighting the fact that little attention has been paid in the past to the practical meaning of the theoretical concept of a threshold. 8.

We studied the effects of the rearing environment on the quality of juvenile bank voles, Clethrionomys glareolus, with different initial body sizes at birth in a 2 x 2 factorial experiment. The rearing environment was manipulated by enlarging both the litter size by two extra pups, and mean offspring body size at birth by replacing the original litter with heavier pups from smaller litters. Offspring quality was estimated from body size measurements, parasitic infection with Eimeria spp. and the level of immune response to a novel antigen. 3 The analyses revealed that large body size at birth was an advantage in 'normal' rearing environments, but a disadvantage in poor ones. The initially normal sized offspring grown in enlarged litters had a relatively good capacity for growth and high immune function confirming that a poor rearing environment alone does not reduce their quality. 4 Our findings that the benefits of large body size depend on the rearing environment suggest that offspring body size is adjusted in relation to litter size, and thus the evolution of these two traits is combined.",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Clethrionomys glareolus | Immune response | Life history trade-offs | Litter size manipulation | Maternal effects,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,79

Between 1988 and 2001, we studied social relationships in the superb fairy-wren Malurus cyaneus (Latham), a cooperative breeder with male helpers in which extra-group fertilizations are more common than within-pair fertilizations. 2. Unlike other fairy-wren species, females never bred on their natal territory. First-year females dispersed either directly from their natal territory to a breeding vacancy or to a foreign 'staging-post' territory where they spent their first winter as a subordinate. Females dispersing to a foreign territory settled in larger groups. Females on foreign territories inherited the territory if the dominant female died, and were sometimes able to split the territory into two by pairing with a helper male. However, most dispersed again to obtain a vacancy. 3. Females dispersing from a staging post usually gained a neighbouring vacancy, but females gaining a vacancy directly from their natal territory travelled further, perhaps to avoid pairing or mating with related males. 4. Females frequently divorced their partner, although the majority of relationships were terminated by the death of one of the pair. If death did not intervene, one-third of pairings were terminated by female-initiated divorce within 1000 days. 5. Three divorce syndromes were recognized. First, females that failed to obtain a preferred territory moved to territories with more helpers. Secondly, females that became paired to their sons when their partner died usually divorced away from them. Thirdly, females that have been in a long relationship divorce once a son has gained the senior helper position. 6. Dispersal to avoid pairing with sons is consistent with incest avoidance. However, there may be two additional benefits. Mothers do not mate with their sons, so dispersal by the mother liberates her sons to compete for within-group matings. Further, divorcing once their son has become a breeder or a senior helper allows the female to start sons in a queue for dominance on another territory. Females that do not take this option face constraints on their ability to recruit more sons into the local neighbourhood.",120,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Breeding dispersal | Cooperative breeding | Divorce | Incest avoidance | Malurus | Natal dispersal,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,81

Life-history theory assumes increased mortality at certain stages such as hibernation. However, seasonal variation of survival rates of hibernating mammals has rarely been estimated. In this study, apparent survival of pipistrelle bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) hibernating and performing summer swarming at a large hibernaculum (Marburg Castle, Hesse, Germany), was modelled using seasonal (summer/winter) capture-recapture data for the years 1996-2000. The spring survival interval includes the period of arousal at the end of hibernation and therefore validly measures survival associated with hibernation. 2. In five summers and four winters, 15 839 bats were captured and released (13 082 individuals) and 3403 recaptures recorded. Analysis was complicated by transience and trap-dependence. Recapture rates varied seasonally and by group. The autumnal survival estimates were negatively biased due to transience effects that could not be taken into account. 3. Survival could be modelled using two age-classes, with reduced first-year juvenile survival. The age effect persisted over the first autumn and spring. There was virtually no evidence for sex-specific survival rates; male and female survival were found to be almost equal. In the best-fitting models, survival rates varied over time and differed among sexes and age-classes by a constant amount. Between years, there was only a small variation in spring survival, which could not be explained by winter severity. 4. Adult spring survival was surprisingly high, averaging 0.892 (SE = 0.028). No evidence for increased mortality during hibernation could be found. This contradicted the expectation of reduced over-winter survival due to depleted fat reserves at the end of hibernation. Thus, hibernation does apparently not entail a survival cost for the pipistrelle bat. Rough estimates of annual adult survival averaged 0.799 (SE = 0.051), which considerably exceeds previous estimates; annual juvenile survival was estimated at 0.527 (SE = 0.095). Hence, previous studies have substantially underestimated pipistrelle bat survival.

Factors influencing post-fledging movements before the first breeding attempt were studied in individually marked greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber roseus) born in the Camargue, southern France, between their natal area and their principal wintering grounds (Spain, Sardinia, Tunisia and France) from 1995 to 1999. 2. We tested whether post-fledging dispersal was affected by sex, age, year, body condition, body mass and tarsus length using a multistate capture-recapture modelling approach. We focused particularly on the hypothesis that increased movement probabilities were associated with good and poor body condition. Because long-distance dispersal is energetically expensive and may involve a high risk of mortality, the acquisition of a robust physical condition prior to dispersal probably plays a critical role in determining the extent to which animals disperse. At the other extreme, birds in poor condition either leave their natal area or starve, which should result in relatively high dispersal rates. 3. Movement probabilities were not sex-dependent, but were age-dependent with high movement probabilities during the first year of life (above 0.6) and low probabilities after the first year (0.055). Movement probabilities also differed between years and localities. 4. Movement probability from the natal area was related to the body condition (and body mass) of the fledglings, with a high movement probability (0.873) when juveniles were in good body condition, and a relatively lower probability (from 0.629 to 0.724) when juveniles were in poorer condition. The proportion of variability in dispersal explained by body condition and body mass were 90.9% and 63.5%, respectively. 5.

The domestic feral cat (Felis catus L.) is a good model for studying intraspecific variability of dispersal patterns in mammals because cats live under a large diversity of socioecological conditions. We analysed both the natal and breeding dispersal patterns of domestic cats in a promiscuous urban population and tested whether or not it differed from the male-biased natal dispersal pattern observed for polygynous rural populations. 2. During an 8-year study we recorded the exact date of in situ death for 148 marked cats and the exact date of disappearance from the population for 99 other cats. Because undiscovered deaths might over-estimate dispersal probabilities when considering only disappearance probabilities, we made an novel application of multistrata capture-recapture methods in order to disentangle dispersal from true mortality. 3. We showed that mature females dispersed, both before and after their first reproduction, at 1 and 2 years old. Contrary to females, no dispersal seemed to occur in males. Before sexual maturity, females that disappeared at 1 and 2 years old were in worse body condition than females that stayed in the population area after 2 years old. However, they did not reproduce less successfully before their disappearance than females that died later in the population area. 4. The female-biased and low natal dispersal pattern in this population was atypical compared to other promiscuous/polygynous mammals and differed from that observed in rural polygynous populations of domestic cat.

Since parasite transmission is often density-dependent, group living is normally thought to lead to an increased exposure to parasitism. As a consequence, it is predicted that animals living in groups will invest more resources (energy, time, risk, etc.) in parasite defence than those living solitarily. 2. We tested this prediction by measuring basal immune parameters in the larvae of 12 species of Lepidoptera, grouped into six phylogenetically matched species-pairs, each comprising one solitary feeding and one gregariously feeding species. 3. Contrary to expectation, the solitary species in all six species-pairs had higher total haemocyte counts than the gregarious species, and in five out of six species-pairs the solitary species also exhibited higher phenoloxidase activity. Both measurements were positively correlated with each other and with the magnitude of the cellular encapsulation response. 4. The relationship between infection risk and group living was investigated with a dynamic, spatially explicit, host-pathogen model. This shows that when individuals aggregate in groups, the per capita risk of infection can be reduced if the lower between-group transmission more than compensates for the higher within-group transmission. 5.

The mean number of offspring fledging per breeding event varied among years, and was correlated with environmental conditions (temperature and rainfall) during the months preceding breeding. As the variance in breeding performance did not differ among years and choughs did not miss breeding seasons, variation in environmental conditions affected the whole breeding population. Thus the quality of the chough's breeding environment varied amongst years. 3. Juvenile survival, the probability of recruitment to the breeding population and breeding longevity varied amongst cohorts, and these were positively correlated with the quality of the cohort's natal environment. Offspring fledging under good conditions were more likely to survive to breeding age and recruit, and had longer breeding lives than offspring fledging under poor conditions. 4. Age at first breeding varied amongst cohorts, and increased with population size at maturity rather than natal conditions. 5. The total number of offspring that recruits ultimately fledged varied primarily with breeding longevity rather than recruitment age. Thus, the consistent positive covariation amongst life-history traits meant that the total number of offspring fledged by recruits during their breeding life varied amongst cohorts, and was correlated with the quality of a cohort's natal conditions. Choughs fledging under good conditions themselves ultimately fledged more offspring. 6.

Using field data published in the literature, we investigated pathogen dynamics and conditions of persistence in a mathematical model of the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) - Puumala hantavirus system. The host population is assumed to have a 3-year periodic cycle. The duration of very low host density is critical for virus transmission and survival. 2. Field epidemiological data strongly suggested a transmission of the hantavirus by the contaminated environment. We thus studied whether this 'indirect' transmission affected the virus persistence in the host population. 3. The model assumptions were derived from the following conditions found in the literature: (1) there is no additional mortality nor fecundity loss due to the virus in infected hosts, thus the cyclic demographical pattern is not due to the virus; (2) no remission has been observed, thus we did not consider the existence of recovered individuals; (3) adult females are territorial and juveniles disperse to find a new territory and reach sexual maturity. A fragmented landscape was assumed to occur: individuals can live in favourable or unfavourable patches. 4. The model was a compartmental model; the population was structured into susceptible or infectious individuals. We considered two age classes, juveniles and adults, and two sites (populations) connected by juvenile dispersal. 5. Model dynamics accurately predicted the cyclic trend in disease prevalence as observed in epidemiological studies. They also showed that indirect transmission significantly increased the probability for the virus to persist during the low-density period of the host population. More precisely, even a low survival rate of the virus outside the host was sufficient to decrease extinction risk of the infection by stochastic events. 6.

Elasticity and sensitivity analyses are used widely in evolutionary biology, ecology and population management. However, almost all applications ignore density dependence, despite the widespread assumption that density dependence is ubiquitous. We assess whether this matters by comparing density-dependent and density-independent elasticity analyses for the LPA model of Tribolium. 2. Density-independent elasticities of λ are a poor indicator of the effects of changes in demographic parameters on population size, even for populations at stable equilibrium. With non-equilibrium dynamics, the divergence can be particularly large. In the extreme, a change in a demographic parameter with a positive effect on individual fitness can reduce mean population size, so even the sign of a density-independent elasticity may be wrong. Elasticities of larval, pupal and adult numbers are not proportional to each other, neither are they proportional to elasticities of total population size. 3. A full density-dependent analysis is therefore vital when concerned with effects on population numbers, as in population management, pest control and prediction of population effects of toxins. 4. When examining the consequences for individual fitness of changes in demographic parameters, density-independent elasticities provide a more useful approximation to the density-dependent values. However, they fail to detect cases where non-equilibrium dynamics means that particular life histories gain an advantage by exploiting predictable periods when density dependence is relaxed. 5. This phenomenon can produce a marked change in the pattern of elasticities as a bifurcation is crossed. The corresponding changes in selection pressures may act to stabilize dynamics in some circumstances and destabilize them in others.

Such individual variation might arise in a constant environment from frequency-dependent effects, whereby the relative benefit of a given prey specialization depends on the number of other individuals utilizing that prey. Additionally, many of the sea otter's prey fluctuate substantially in abundance through time.

More than half of all Australian bandicoot species (family Peramelidae) are listed by the IUCN as extinct or threatened and changed fire regimes in arid and semi-arid Australia have been identified as an important agent in their decline.

All experimental fire treatments (including total fire exclusion) were associated with decline in survival rates over time, indicating that none of the tested approaches were appropriate for this species. Burning in the late dry season or progressively throughout the dry season produced substantially more severe declines in survival than did early dry season fires or fire exclusion. 4. Fire regime was found to be the most important determinant of bandicoot survival, far exceeding other factors such as gender, age, vegetation type, rainfall and season, all of which had comparatively little influence. The results demonstrate the importance of the frequency and seasonal timing of fires in determining the survival of bandicoots and suggest that spatially uniform and temporally invariant fire regimes are inappropriate for bandicoot conservation in the north Australian savannas.",82,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Akaike information criterion | Capture-mark-recapture analysis | Fire management | Marsupial | Savanna | Tropical,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,96

We examined the role of mountain hares in the louping-ill virus/Ixodes ricinus tick system to determine whether hares were reservoirs of these pathogens for red grouse. A field experiment, which involved reducing mountain hare densities was undertaken and changes in tick abundance, louping-ill virus seroprevalence and red grouse densities recorded. 2. Hares were found to be important hosts for all stages of ticks at two study sites and, where sheep were frequently treated with acaricide, hares fed the greatest proportion of adult ticks. Hare densities were reduced at the experimental site between 1993 and 2001 but remained relatively constant at a control site. Both nymph and larvae tick burdens on red grouse chicks declined over this period to very low levels at the treatment site, but not at the control site. The estimated size of the tick population at the treatment site decreased by more than 99% by 1999. 3. Louping-ill prevalence, as measured by antibody prevalence in shot young red grouse, also declined at the treatment site, lagging behind the tick decline by approximately 2 years. The number of young grouse produced per hen grouse at this treatment site increased in comparison to a second control area. However, no change was found in summer grouse densities and thus we cannot demonstrate parasite-mediated competition. 4. A deterministic SIR-type model describing the dynamics of this pathogen/vector/host system was constructed and used to examine the role of mountain hares in louping-ill virus and tick dynamics. The model predicted a decline in tick numbers and seroprevalence as hare densities reduced. The inclusion of hares as both tick hosts and vector-host-vector transmitters of louping-ill virus gave the best fit to the observed data.",72,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Disease reservoir | Ixodes ricinus | Louping-ill virus | Mountain hare | Red grouse | Tick,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,97

The effect that the proximity of habitats containing essential resources has on animal abundance at large spatial scales is called landscape complementation. Landscape complementation can influence interaction between large herbivores and their food resources where the proximity of habitats containing essential resources constrains their foraging or demographic efficiency. 2. We tested the effect that the proximity of a thermal refuge (riverine woodlands) had on interaction between wild pigs and their food resources (pasture). The numerical response of pigs (Sus scrofa L.) (estimated as r quarter-1) to pasture biomass was contrasted between four sites that were progressively more isolated from a major floodplain containing extensive areas of riverine woodland. To test whether proximity to riverine woodlands affected the numerical response of pigs through a constraint on foraging efficiency, we contrasted the numerical response of pigs between the four areas as pasture biomass declined. To test whether pigs exploited riverine woodlands primarily as a thermal refuge, we contrasted the numerical response of pigs between the four areas in different seasons. 3. We found that although pasture biomass was similar in the four areas, r was lower than expected for given pasture biomass on the two areas further away from riverine woodlands. We also found that while the effect that proximity to riverine woodlands had on the numerical response of pigs became more pronounced when pasture biomass was low, it was not significantly affected by season. 4. These results suggest that the need to access riverine woodlands compromises the foraging efficiency of wild pigs when the distance to this habitat is relatively high, but that the need to access this habitat may not be purely related to thermoregulation. 5. We developed a simple mechanistic model that allows the effects of landscape complementation on herbivore foraging and demographic efficiency to be estimated, and used the model to predict the effect that proximity to riverine woodlands would have on variation in pig density. The model suggests that wild pigs cannot persist in areas more then 10 km from extensive riverine woodlands, unless those areas are periodically recolonized. This suggests that at the margin of their range around inland river systems, given locations that can be occupied by wild pigs will vary temporally between being sources, pseudosinks and sinks.",58,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Food limitation | Foraging efficiency | Landscape complementation | Large herbivores | Source-sink dynamics | Spatial modelling | Vegetation-herbivore interaction | Wild pigs,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,98

The importance of host immunology vs. parasite life history,Roulin A.,Journal of Animal Ecology,00218790,72,1,75-81,2003-01-01,January 2003,10.1046/j.1365-2656.2003.00677.x,"1. The Tasty Chick Hypothesis (TCH) proposes that hatching asynchrony evolved as an antiparasite strategy. Hosts would benefit if ectoparasites aggregate more on the offspring that are of lowest reproductive value within a brood, i.e. on the last-hatched chicks, because offspring reproductive value generally decreases with hatching rank. The poor body condition of the later-hatched chicks would impair parasite resistance and render them especially attractive to ectoparasites. Thus, the TCH predicts a decline in chick parasite load with hatching order in avian broods. 2. We investigated the main assumption of the TCH that junior chicks are less immunocompetent than their senior siblings. We also examine the prediction of the TCH that junior chicks bear more ectoparasites than their senior siblings. 3. Conform to the assumption of the TCH for hosts, junior chicks in broods of the barn owl (Tyto alba L.) showed a lower humoral immune response than their senior siblings. In contrast, the cell-mediated immune response of senior chicks in broods of the great tit (Parus major L.) was not significantly greater than that of their junior siblings. 4. In line with the prediction of the TCH for the distribution of parasites among hosts, the fly Carnus haemapterus Nitzsch infested junior chicks in larger numbers than senior chicks in both barn owl and kestrel (Falco tinnunculus L.) broods. 5. In conflict with the TCH, ticks (Ixodes ricinus L.) were distributed randomly with respect to hatching rank in broods of the barn owl and the great tit. Moreover, louseflies Crataerina melbae Rondani infested mainly senior chicks instead of junior chicks in the Alpine swift (Apus melba L.). 6. Summarizing, the present descriptive study indicates that the distribution of ectoparasites within-broods is not generally governed by rank-related variation in host defence of chicks as initially suggested by the TCH. We argue that specific aspects of the morphology, life history and ecological requirements of various ectoparasite species need more consideration as to explain the dynamics and evolution of host-parasite interactions.",74,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,Age hierarchy | Ectoparasites | Hatching asynchrony | Host defence | Immunocompetence | Tasty Chick Hypothesis,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,99

To estimate concurrent age-specific survival for southern elephant seals at Macquarie and Marion islands, seals were marked from 1993 to 1997 in the first 3 weeks of life and resighted (recaptured) on return to their natal islands (1994-2001). These recaptures formed the basis for the survival analysis in the mark-recapture program MARK. Weaning masses were collected at each location. 2. Recapture probabilities were (χ62 = 376.480, P < 0.0001) higher at Marion Island than at Macquarie Island. There are two possible reasons: (1) the population at Marion Island is smaller and less dense than at Macquarie Island and (2) seals hauled out along a smaller section of the coast at Marion Island than at Macquarie Island, which: (1) facilitates the detection and individual identification of seals and (2) increases access to hauled out seals. 3. Age-specific survival estimates (corrected for preweaning mortality and tag loss) differed (χ52 = 22.264, P < 0.05) at the two islands and were consistently higher at Macquarie Island. The survival estimates for male and female seals were different at Macquarie Island (χ62 = 34.657, P < 0.0001) and Marion Island (χ62 = 20.373, P = 0.002). Female survival estimates were higher than male survival estimates. The combined survival estimates for juvenile seals (1-3 years) differed between islands but survival of older seals (4-6 years) did not. The inclusion of gender in the survival models did not improve model performance and hence male and female estimates were considered jointly. 4. The mean wean masses of male and female seals combined from 1993 to 1998 were not different between islands (T6837 = 1.169, P = 0.242). At Macquarie Island the mean annual wean mass was 118.8 kg (SD = 27.2, n = 6504) while at Marion Island it was 120.6 kg (SD = 24.7, n = 335). 5. The mean age at first breeding was different (P < 0.001) at the two island populations. At Macquarie Island the mean age of first breeding was 4.68 years, and at Marion Island it was 3.95 years. More (χ12 = 67.39, P < 0.0001) 3-year-old females breed at Marion Island (28.7%) than at Macquarie Island (1.2%) and the proportion of seals that had bred at least once by age 7 was greater at Marion Island than at Macquarie Island. 6. We conclude that the observed decreases in elephant seal numbers between the 1950s and 1990s in the Pacific and Indian Ocean sectors were driven principally by resource limitation in the Southern Ocean. A conglomerate of factors including local predation by killer whales and intraspecific resource competition is postulated as a cause for the inter-island (regional) differences in population trends. It appears that more resources are available per capita to the Marion Island population than are available to the Macquarie Island population.",102,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Environmental change | Mark-recapture | Sub-Antarctic | Survival | Wean mass,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,100

Competition between two species in a metapopulation involves each inhibiting the other's ability firstly to colonize an already occupied area and then to persist in it. Models for regional competition of this kind have 3-D dynamics, from which it has proved difficult to extract useful predictions except for special conditions. We introduce a 2-D general model for species that are equally vigorous at inhibiting the ability of others to remain in an occupied patch as to arrive there. The model covers the full spectrum of competitive interactions, from weak to strong and symmetrical to asymmetrical. Its Lotka-Volterra dynamics extend the general theory of competitive coexistence by generating clear predictions for community structure, amenable to cross-system comparisons and experimental manipulations. 2. Previous 2-D models of interactions between dominant and fugitive species are special cases of the 2-D general model. Moderately asymmetrical competition has two outcomes distinctly different from dominant-fugitive interactions, at both the scale of metapopulation and population: (i) slow growing and weak competitors coexist with faster growing superior competitors, albeit at reduced densities; and (b) habitat removal always yields relative gains in abundance for species with higher growth capacity, but the gains are absolute only for species subjected to competitive impacts that exceed within-species impacts. Extinctions of slow growing and weak competitors provide the most sensitive indication of habitat degradation, and their losses also have the least effect on community structure. 3. The 2-D general model further predicts that highly productive communities will tolerate differences between species in their capacity for population growth, whereas less productive communities will tolerate stronger competitive interactions between species. This prediction applies equally to a population of resource consumers as to a metapopulation of colonists. The model explicitly links local and regional population dynamics to r-K selection in community structure by predicting a prevalence of growth-orientated species in resource-poor habitats and competition-orientated species in resource-rich habitats.",15,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Competitive coexistence | Exploitation | Habitat loss | Predator-prey,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,101

In marine cleaning symbioses, small fish or shrimps remove ectoparasites and other material from cooperating 'client' fish. Until now, there has been conflicting evidence with respect to the importance of cleaning for client health and in particular with respect to the impact of cleaning organisms on local fish diversity. 2. Data are provided on the impact of the cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus on reef fish distribution at Ras Mohammed National Park, Egypt. During four field seasons, I regularly sampled fish species composition in 46 reef patches. Natural fluctuations in cleaner fish presence or absence at these reef patches allowed me to assess how this variable correlates with reef fish diversity. In addition, cleaner fish were removed experimentally from some reef patches and added at others to test whether the presence or absence of cleaner fish causes changes in fish diversity. 3. Both cleaner fish disappearance and cleaner fish removal had no immediate effects on fish abundance, i.e. within the first few weeks. A significant decline in fish diversity was only detectable after 4-20 months. 4. In contrast, cleaner immigration or experimental addition led to a significant increase in fish diversity within the first few weeks. 5. Generally, effects were most pronounced for client species that visit reef patches and soon move off again, and less pronounced (but still significant) for resident clients that do not move between reef patches. Surprisingly, the presence or absence of cleaner fish also affected the distribution of resident fish that hardly ever interact with them. 6.

When different size classes of predators use different habitats, the habitat-specific predation risk for prey may change as prey increase in size due to the size-dependency in predator-prey interactions. 2. To study the effects of predation risk on habitat shifts in growing prey, we used a combination of whole-lake manipulations and field data, covering 5 years from three lakes on (1) body sizes at habitat shifts in young-of-the-year perch (YOY) perch (Perca fluviatilis) and (2) habitat use and densities of two size classes of cannibals (1 year old and ≥ 2 years old). 3. YOY perch shifted habitat to the pelagic immediately after hatching and exhibited a second shift back to the littoral zone at a size range of 11-30 mm. Cannibalism from 1-year-old perch decreased over time, whereas cannibalism from perch ≥ 2 years old increased over time but did not include early larval stages. The habitat use of 1-year-old perch was restricted to the littoral habitat, whereas perch ≥ 2 years old used both the pelagic and the littoral habitats. 4. Habitat shifts in YOY perch were unrelated to differences in resource levels between the two habitats as YOY perch were either yolk sac feeding (first habitat shift) or had similar foraging gains in both habitats (second habitat shift). 5. The size when YOY perch shifted back to the littoral zone was related positively to the densities of 1-year-old perch, whereas no clear relationship was found between shift size and the density of perch 2 ≥ years old. The latter was suggested to be due to the higher density and the larger variation in densities of 1-year-old perch and that the predation risk from perch ≥ 2 years old was less habitat-specific. 6.

In a population of American coots (Fulica americana) breeding in central British Columbia, Canada, some females pursued a reproductive strategy that combined nesting with laying parasitic eggs in the nests of conspecifics. To understand why only one quarter of the nesting females laid parasitically, I examined social and ecological factors that could potentially constrain nesting females from engaging in brood parasitism. 2. Variation among females in each of three prerequisite conditions essential for adaptive parasitism to occur - host availability, access to host nests and a benefit to allocating eggs to parasitism - helps explain why not all females are parasitic. 3. Due to limited spatiotemporal patterns of parasitism, an estimated 23% to 39% of non-parasitic females completely lacked potential hosts to parasitize when they began breeding. In theory, females could avoid host limitation by delaying breeding to wait for hosts, but timing of breeding comparisons did not support this idea. Relative to the vegetation density on their territories, parasites and non-parasites began laying eggs on the same date but, due to the time taken to lay parasitic eggs, parasites initiated their own nests later. 4. Brood parasitism was less likely to occur between dyads of females where the potential host female was substantially larger than the potential parasitic female, which suggests that antagonistic social interactions between hosts and parasites may constrain some females from parasitism. 5. Comparisons of two classes of non-parasitic females, those with and without hosts, revealed smaller clutch sizes in the former, suggesting that limited fecundity may have constrained some of these females from laying parasitic eggs. Additionally, brood parasites were older and laid more total eggs than non-parasitic females and, among parasites, older females laid more parasitic eggs. Together, these patterns suggest that variation in egg-laying capacity may determine whether females benefit from allocating eggs to parasitism. 6. The large number of correlates of parasitism indicates that parasitism by nesting females is a conditional reproductive tactic, not part of a stochastic mixed evolutionary stable strategy.",28,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Clutch size | Conspecific brood parasitism | Host limitation | Host-parasite interaction | Timing of breeding,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,104
