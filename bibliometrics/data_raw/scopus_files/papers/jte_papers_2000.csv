Using data from 94 plots the family-level floristic patterns in wet tropical South America are described. To test diversity patterns, 268 plots are used in this large area. Contrary to a widely held belief, western Amazonian plots are not necessarily the most diverse. Several central Amazonian plots have equal or even higher tree diversity. Annual rainfall is not a good estimator for tree diversity in the Amazonia area and Guiana shield. Plots in the Guiana Shield area (and eastern Amazonia) usually have lower diversity than those in central or western Amazonia. It is argued that this is not because of low rainfall or low nutrient status of the soil but because of the small area of the relatively isolated rain forest area in eastern Amazonia and the Guiana Shield. The low diversity on nutrient-poor white sand soils in the Amazon basin is not necessarily due to their low nutrient status but is, at least partly, caused by their small extent and fragmented nature.",222,Journal,ar,Article,100,10,10,Amazonia | Floristic composition | Guiana Shield | Rainfall | Tree alpha diversity,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,1

The plots were established as part of a sequence first used to describe forest succession, five of which have been maintained and which were last measured in 1992-1993. One plot (plot 7) provides 53 y of data from old-growth pristine forest. Plot 15 was established in wooded grassland at the forest edge and is now closed high forest. Evaluation of the remaining three plots is complicated by silvicultural interventions carried out in the 1950s. Forty species have been added since the first evaluations and a total of 188 tree species (over 80% of Budongo's forest tree flora, and including two exotics) has now been recorded from within the plots. The pattern of shade-tolerance in the original plot series conforms to patterns expected for succession with an increasing proportion of shade-tolerant species with development, and large stems appearing to 'lag behind' smaller stems in this respect. The time series data are less consistent, and while plot 7 increased in the proportion of shade-tolerant stems through time, the proportion of shade-tolerant species actually declines. Stem-turnover (the mean of mortality and recruitment) slowed with implied successional stage. Most species have a higher recruitment than mortality rate and stem numbers have thus increased in all plots. This is most pronounced in the putatively 'early successional' plot. Stem size structure has changed within the plots, with an increased proportion of smaller stems. Species show different rates of turnover and these vary from plot to plot and period to period. In plot 7, the overall mortality rate decreased with initial stem size. Estimates imply that some tree species may easily live longer than 500 y after reaching 10 cm DBH, and that 1000 y is possible. The importance of large trees in determining forest dynamics is illustrated by the finding that death of only seven stems in plot 7 contributed over 60% of net basal area losses recorded over the 53-y observation period.

Before the cyclone, when nine sites were visited, canopy openness in old-growth and logged sites was similar, but significantly higher in regrowth forest. After the cyclone, all six revisited sites showed an increase in canopy openness, but the increase was very patchy amongst plots and sites and varied from insignificant to severe.

Although proneness to impact was apparently related to forest management history (old-growth being the most impacted), underlying local topography may have had an equally strong influence in this case.

In this paper a new aggregation of tree species of the dipterocarp rain forests in Sabah (Borneo), Malaysia, is developed. The aggregation is based on the two criteria successional status and potential maximum height. Three classes of successional status (early, mid and late successional species) and five classes of potential maximum heights (â¤ 5 m, 5-15, 15-25, 25-36, > 36 m) lead to a combination of 15 functional types. The criteria of the developed classification are chosen to suit for applications with process-based models, such as Formix3 and Formind, which are based on photo-synthesis production as the main process determining tree growth. The concept is universal and can easily be applied to other areas.

All flowering plants were recorded within the sites and specimens were identified to species level. Species were related to genera geographical affinity and growth form. Abundance, individual height and aerial crown cover were also recorded for all species. The composition for these sites was 121 vascular plant species grouped in 96 genera and 60 families. Results suggest that the advanced regeneration of shrub and tree species of the medium canopy, such as Eugenia capuli, Ternstroemia sylvatica, Turpinia occidentalis, Meliosma oaxacana, Myrsine coriacea and Podocarpus reichei, was favoured by the disturbance regime prevailing in this forest community. All of these woody species belong to tropical genera and are structurally dominant in the gap-building-phase sites. A differential response of the vegetation was obtained in these sites as a function of the severity of disturbance and gap size. This response was revealed by the dominance-diversity relationships. Small gaps (45-95 m2) or gaps created by two treefalls showed a higher diversity and density compared to larger gaps (95-150 m2) or those created by four fallen logs, which had a lower species diversity and significantly lower tree and vine densities.

The elevational gradient was coded in a form that accommodated different types of community response. Analyses were run for four subsets of the entire assemblage: (1) reptiles, (2) amphibians, (3) amphibians dependent on streams for reproduction, and (4) amphibians that do not use streams for reproduction. All subsets showed a significant relationship with the gradient, which suggested that most species respond to the physical continuum associated with the change in elevation. A response to ecotones was revealed for the amphibian subset only and associated with the presence or absence of watercourses. However, this response disappeared within subsets 3 and 4. A variation partitioning analysis was used to assess the individual and common contributions of gradient and ecotone descriptors to the elevational variation in the structure of subsets 1 and 2. The gradient descriptors explained more variation in the reptile subset than did ecotones, while the reverse was found in the amphibian subset. The dependence of most amphibians on aquatic breeding sites that were not available at all elevations reduced the relative importance of the gradient on the species distributions in subset 2 and accounted for the difference to the reptiles. In all, these findings add to the results of previous null model tests on the same four subsets, where competitive interactions were assigned a minor importance in limiting elevational distributions.

Total stand-level biomass was estimated as the weighted average of the stature classes. In 130 ha of surveyed forest, forest stature classes were found in the following proportions: gap phase 8%; low stature 31%; medium stature 44%; and high stature 17%. Total aboveground biomass was found to be three times higher in high stature forest than in low. Liana biomass, however, showed the opposite result, being three times higher in low stature forest.

Regeneration dynamics of C. lilloi was characterized by testing two hypotheses: (i) C. lilloi has a gap-phase regeneration mode, which implies a negative exponential size/age distribution at forest stand scale, growth releases due to canopy openings, and juvenile trees clumped at spatial scales of treefall gaps. (ii) There is a negative spatial association between adults and juveniles of C. lilloi which could be caused by density dependent mortality.

In this paper the concept of keystone plant resources is reviewed using potential candidates proposed in the literature for neotropical forest sites. A poorly known example of a potential keystone resource - the gums produced by mature pods of two emergent tree species (Parkia nitida and P. pendula, Leguminosae: Mimosoideae) - is described for primates and other arboreal vertebrates in Amazonian forests. In particular, the fruiting phenology, tree density, patterns of vertebrate consumption, and nutritional quality of Parkia gums in Amazonian terra firme forests are considered. Putative neotropical keystone resources are then divided into four intersecting ecological attributes defining their community-wide importance to vertebrate frugivores: (1) temporal redundancy, (2) degree of consumer specificity, (3) reliability, and (4) abundance. From a vertebrate perspective, keystone plants are here defined as those producing reliable, low-redundancy resources that are consumed by a large proportion of the bird and mammal assemblage with which they coexist. Plant populations proposed to date as keystone species range widely across two of these four variables, which may disqualify most putative taxa (including Parkia spp.) from a more formal definition of keystone resources. Other importance attributes, the context-dependent role, the taxonomic refinement, and removal effects of the keystone plant resource concept as applied to tropical forests are also discussed.",104,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Amazonia | Consumer specificity | Fruiting seasonality | Gums | Keystone resources | Keystone species | Parkia nitida | Parkia pendula | Redundancy,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,44

Despite its importance, few phenological and ecophysiological data are available for plants of this area. In this study the seasonal changes in the water potentials (Î¨) and the phenological behaviour of three woody legumes are related to environmental conditions, particularly air vapour pressure deficit (VPD). The values of Î¨ at predawn were greater than -0.75 MPa for all species even during the dry season (May-September). The minimal daily value of Î¨ was -3.8 MPa. The maximum daily amplitude of Î¨ (Î parameter) was correlated with the air vapour pressure deficit, showing high correlation coefficients in linear equations. A high recovery rate of Î¨ after rain (greater than 0.80) was registered for all species, suggesting a high hydraulic conductivity. The high values of Î¨ at predawn during the year and the strong relationship between the daily amplitude of Î¨ and VPD suggested that the changes in the canopy cover are related more to atmospheric drought than to soil water deficit.",25,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Atlantic forest | Phenology | Vapour pressure deficit | Water potential | Woody legumes,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,51

Lianas â¥ 0.5 cm diameter were sampled along transects in two replicated stands in secondary (20, 40, 70 and 100 y after abandonment) and old-growth (>500 y) forests. Ordination of stands based on relative abundance, but not presence-absence, showed a significant separation of stands by age. Lianas were significantly more abundant and diverse (Fisher's Î±) in younger forests (20 and 40 y) than in older forests (70 and 100 y, and old-growth). The decline in liana abundance with stand age was offset by increased mean basal area per individual, resulting in a relatively constant total basal area and estimated biomass across stand age. The proportions of tendril climbers decreased and stem twiners increased over stand age. Decline in liana abundance and changes in liana composition may be related to changes in support and light availability. Although lianas are recognized as playing an important role in the early secondary succession of many tropical forests, these results have shown that their important contribution to total basal area and biomass can continue as the forest matures, even as the number of established lianas declines.",254,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Barro Colorado Nature Monument | Climbing mechanisms | Lianas | Ordination | Panama | Species diversity | Succession,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,52

Elephants have a number of well-known influences on vegetation, both detrimental and beneficial to trees. They are dispersers of a large number of woody forest species, giving rise to concerns that without elephants the plant diversity of Upper Guinean forest plant communities will not be maintained. This prospect was examined with respect to four sources of inventory and research data from Ghana, covering nearly all (more than 2000) species of forest plant. Evidence supporting the hypothesis that plant populations are collapsing without elephants is conspicuously absent in these datasets, although Balanites wilsoniana is likely to suffer dramatically on a centennial scale in the absence of forest elephants. A few other species are likely to decline, although at an even slower rate. In the context of other processes current in these forests, loss of elephants is an insignificant concern for plant biodiversity. Elephant damage of forests can be very significant in Africa, but loss of this influence is more than compensated for by human disturbance. Elephants have played a significant part in the shaping of West African rain forest vegetation. However, it is the conservation of elephants that should be of primary concern. Tree populations should be managed to promote them, rather than vice versa.",40,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Africa | Dispersal | Disturbance | Elephant | Forest | Regeneration,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,53

A total of 40 species were present on the islands, 35 of which were angiosperms. Orchidaceae was the family with the highest diversity, but Bonnetiaceae, Poaceae and Rapateaceae achieved higher coverage. A positive correlation between island size and species richness was found. This relationship was not linear and the best fit model between island size and richness was exponential.

This study examines the relationship between seasonal variation in flock structure and the availability of fruits and arthropods over a 12-mo period at a coastal Atlantic forest within the Jureia-Itatins Ecological Station, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Fruit abundance was estimated by a phenological survey of both canopy and understorey trees, whereas arthropod abundance was quantified monthly on the basis of a nocturnal visual census technique. The seasonal variation in flock structure and composition was affected by both the breeding seasons of different core and attendant species, and the availability of food resources. The number of bird species attending flocks was greater during the dry season, declining thereafter during the breeding season. Understorey fruit availability exhibited a marked seasonal fluctuation with the lowest levels between the late dry and early wet season. Seasonal variation in canopy fruit availability, on the other hand, was far less demarcated than that of understorey plants. Arthropod abundance was greatest during the wettest months of the year, which apparently determined the timing of the main breeding season. Bird species richness attending flocks was, therefore, significantly correlated with the availability of understorey arthropods, but not with that of either understorey and canopy fruits. Arthropod abundance thus appears to affect profoundly the reproductive schedules of the understorey avifauna, which in turn influences the seasonal variation of flock size and composition.",119,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Arthropod abundance | Atlantic forest | Brazil | Breeding season | Fruit availability | Insect availability | Mixed species flocks | Plant phenology | Seasonality,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,55

The effects of nitrogen, phosphorus and nitrogen plus phosphorus fertilization on radial trunk growth were measured in three tree species. In the cloud forest soils, concentrations of ammonium were much higher than those of nitrate. Nitrate was higher in samples collected during the afternoon than during the morning, probably as a result of leaching during the night or nitrification during the day. When samples were incubated under different water and temperature treatments, rates of nitrogen mineralization and nitrification increased more with changes in soil water content than with changes in temperature. Nitrification was significantly increased in soils amended with ammonium or with ammonium plus phosphorus, suggesting that nitrification is substrate-limited.
