Decisions regarding the development or non-development of water resources must be based on sound investigation of both the long-and short-term effects of reservoir construction and operation. The environmental effects of water impoundment vary greatly with the characteristics of the region as well as the type of reservoir to be constructed (area and depth of reservoir, ratio of water inflow to storage). Of major concern are the reduction of reservoir capacity as sediments accumulate behind the dam and the loss of these sediments to downstream agriculture and fisheries. The potential impact of altered flow regimes, siltation, reduction in beach formation and nutrient enrichment at the mouths of rivers, and the possibility of saltwater encroachment should receive careful stdy. A thorough description of the plants and animals to be affected by inundation should be made to determine the possible loss of rare or key organisms as well as the potential development of ""nuisance species"". Included in this survey should be a detailed study of existing fish and the potential for commercial fishery development in the proposed reservoir. Consideration should be given to vegetation removal in the reservoir basin prior to inundation, since decaying vegetation can result in deoxygenation, formation of hydrogen sulfide, possible development of suitable habitats for undesirable species and snagging of fish nets. Sanitation and land use practices as well as erosion in the watershed surrounding the reservoir must be controlled to prevent accelerated eutrophication caused by increased nutrient loading. Inundation in tropical areas can have serious sociological and human health implications including the increase of diseases, e.g., malaria, schistosomiasis, onchocerciasis, and dysentery, and the probable resettlement and alteration of land use practices. Census information and surveys concerning land use, housing and health standards and the social and economic structure of the community to be affected must be evaluated in order to anticipate and avoid potential problems. The archaeologic, historic, scenic and recreational value of the site to be inundated must also be considered. Studies of the EL Cajón site on the Sula River in Honduras and the Purari River Project in Papua, New Guinea, are utilized as examples in this report.",9,948650,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,5

Deficient maternal education and infection of the child play a preponderant role in the etiology of calorie-protein malnutrition and anemia. Analyses presented here show the convenience to revise periodically the criteria used to characterize the nutritional status, in order to adequately plan health actions. Also, the necessity to carry out basic and applied research in the field is emphasized. The future of the nutritional situation is uncertain for the majority of the Central American countries.

In the past 15 years the area in planted pasture and the total numbers of beef cattle have nearly doubled in several Central American countries while the per capita consumption of beef has actually declined.

However, conservation and development of natural resources are basically human-oriented endeavors and all conservation and developmental efforts ought to start with a clear understanding of the varied needs of the people. In addition, cultural diversity is a natural resource that ought to be protected along with all the more commonly recognized resources of the ecosystems of which humans form an integral part. Cultural diversity in a large measure is an ecological phenomenon because such diversity includes variations in the ways different people perceive and utilize the environments in which they live. Thus, cultural diversity, in large measure, equates with ecological diversity. It has been well established that a high degree of ecological diversity (including taxonomic, niche, biogeochemical and other measures of diversity) is a necessary attribute of humid tropical ecosystems if such ecosystems are to remain viable over long periods of time. The current land-use trends in Central America and Panama are leading toward ever larger areas being devoted to monocultural use with sharply reduced ecological diversity that poses great dangers for the near and long terms. In addition, the resultant removal of people from rural areas results in growing social, economic and political problems, that are not being successfully met by developing nations. Not only is there a growing wastage of human resources, a weakening of the social structures, and an increasing and dangerous dependence upon monocultures oriented toward export markets, but the ecological diversity of the previous existing land-use systems are being lost. This kind of diversity is probably no less valuable to the ecological health of a nation's agriculture, forestry, and general resource utilization than is the genetic diversity of ""primitive"" crop plant varieties which biologists now recognize and increasingly seek to preserve as ""modern"" crop plant varieties become ever more simple genetically and hence ever more vulnerable to disease and other perturbations.",5,948646,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,14

Important agents of erosion in the tropics are heavy seasonal rains at high elevations, alternating with long dry seasons; wind erosion; and landslides after saturation of the soil during prolonged rains.
