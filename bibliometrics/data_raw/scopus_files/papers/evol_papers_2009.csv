The model is based on frequency-dependent interactions between host plants and their pathogens, which can generate disruptive selection and give rise to speciation if distant phenotypes become reproductively isolated. Based on recent experimental evidence from Arabidopsis, we assume that at the molecular level, incompatibility between host strains is caused by epistatic interactions between two proteins in the plant immune system - the guard and the guardee. Within each plant strain, immune reactions occur when the guardee protein is modified by a pathogen effector, and the guard subsequently binds to the guardee, thus precipitating an immune response. When guard and guardee proteins come from phenotypically distant parents, a hybrid's immune system can be triggered by erroneous interactions between these proteins even in the absence of pathogen attack, leading to severe autoimmune reactions in hybrids. This generates a Dobzhnasky-Muller incompatibility due to immune reactions. Our model shows how phenotypic variation generated by frequency-dependent host-pathogen interactions can lead to such postzygotic incompatibilities between extremal types, and hence to speciation. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",16,19674099,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Autoimmune reaction | Evolution of diversity | Hybrid necrosis | Hybrids | Immune system | Speciation,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,1,NA,NA

We hypothesized that high sperm production in passively mating systems may also be the result of selection to enhance the ability to fertilize distant ova. Consequently, we explored the effect of distance on male gain curves in a free-spawning colonial ascidian. The performance of focal males that varied in sperm production was assayed at three distances via microsatellite markers. An advection-diffusion model was used to estimate sperm concentration gradients, to predict male reproductive gain integrated across multiple downstream females, and explore effects of hydrodynamic conditions. As distance increased, male reproductive success decreased and empirical gain curves became increasingly linear. Our model predicted that the expected net gain curve is relatively insensitive to variation in flow regime and will saturate much more slowly than if only a single, nearby distance is considered. Thus, high levels of sperm production may enhance fitness both in competitive situations and with increasing fertilization distance, highlighting the need to consider distance effects when evaluating gain curves. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",6,19656184,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Botryllus schlosseri | Diffusion/advection model | Fertilization distance | Paternity | Sex allocation,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,2,NA,NA

In line with theory, pond fish tended to be larger than their marine or lake conspecifics, sometimes reaching giant sizes.

Interestingly, most sexually dichromatic orioles belong to migratory or temperate-breeding clades. Using character scoring and ancestral state reconstructions from two recent studies in Icterus, we tested a hypothesis of correlated evolution between migration and sexual dichromatism.

Additionally, the effects of known low levels of recombination within inversions on these models are uninvestigated. Here, simulations are used to compare the maintenance of genetic differences between populations following secondary contact and hybridization in different inversion models. We compare regions with no recombination within them to regions with low recombination and to collinear regions with free recombination. Our most general finding is that the low levels of recombination within an inversion often result in the loss of accentuated divergence in inverted regions compared to collinear ones. We conclude that inversions can facilitate the maintenance of species differences under some conditions, but that large or qualitative differences between inverted and collinear regions need not occur.

Males with orange throats and high antibody responses had enhanced survival, but the same trait combination reduced female fitness. This sexual antagonism persisted across the life cycle and was concordant between the juvenile and adult life stages. The opposing selective pressure on males and females is ameliorated by a negative intersexual genetic correlation (rm,f = -0.86) for immune defense. Throat coloration was also genetically correlated with immune defense, but the sign of this genetic correlation differed between the sexes. This resulted in sex-specific signaling of immunological condition. We also found evidence for a sex-specific maternal effect on sons with potential to additionally reduce the gender load.

First, we demonstrate that a hypothesized disproportionate increase in ant diversification during the angiosperm radiation is largely artifactual. Rather, current evidence points to a fairly constant rate of lineage growth during its history. Moreover, an analysis of diversification patterns across the ant phylogeny indicates considerable rate heterogeneity among lineages. Indeed, and contrary to the expectation if lineages had experienced a single rate of lineage increase, we found no correspondence between genus age and diversity. Finally, we demonstrate a statistically significant phylogenetic signal in ant diversification: closely related genera have diversities that are more similar to one another than one would expect by chance.

Both conflicts are capable of maintaining genetic variation in a population, but to different degrees. For weak sexual antagonism, the X chromosome has a higher opportunity for polymorphism than the autosomes. For parental antagonism, there is a very limited opportunity for polymorphism on the X chromosome relative to autosomes or to sexual antagonism. X-linkage introduces an asymmetry in the inheritance and expression of sexually and parentally antagonistic genes that leads to a biased fixation of alleles with certain effects. We find little support for the commonly held intuition that the X chromosome should be biased toward fixing female-beneficial alleles. Contrary to this intuition, we find that the X chromosome is biased toward fixation of male-beneficial alleles for much of the range of dominance.

Comparisons of life histories between two natural populations demonstrated a trade-off between the level of maternal investment into individual embryos and maternal fecundity.

Here we propose a simple model to test the hypothesis that the bimodal distribution relates to the optimum shape for shell balance on the substrates. This model calculates the theoretical shell balance by moment and obtains empirical distribution of shell shape by compiling published data and performing a new analysis. The solution of the model supports one part of the hypothesis, showing that a low-spired shell is the best balanced and is better suited for locomotion on horizontal surface. Additionally, the model shows that both high- and low-spired shells are well balanced and suited on vertical surfaces. The shell with a spire index (shell height divided by diameter) of 1.4 is the least well balanced as a whole. Thus, spire index is expected to show a bimodal distribution with a valley at 1.4. This expectation was supported by empirical distribution of a spire index, suggesting that the bimodality of shell shape in terrestrial gastropods is related to shell balance. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",18,19624723,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Land snail | Model | Moment of force | Shell balance | Spire index,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,33,NA,NA

One key assumption of this approach is that genetic values within a population are normally distributed. Gene flow, however, may generate distributions that are skewed toward the immigrant's mean value. If the response to selection from a skewed distribution is different from that expected under the assumption of normality, models may result in inaccurate predictions. We use individual-based computer simulations to explore this problem, comparing our results to a recent model developed by Hendry et al. (2001). We show that this model underestimates the equilibrium divergence between populations at migration-selection balance. The extent of this underestimation is correlated with the amount of genetic skew generated by migration and is partly explained by the fact that the analytical model ignores direct selection against hybrid phenotypes. We also show that all else being equal, response to selection in a population with a skewed distribution of genotypes is greater than in a population with normally distributed genotypes. The production of skew under migration-selection balance, however, is itself dependent upon the genetic architecture, with greater deviations from normality produced when alleles contributing to population differentiation have very different effect sizes. We find that both the skew and discrepancies between the models are greatest at intermediate migration rates and moderate to strong selection, which is exactly the region of parameter space that is most empirically relevant. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",36,19619220,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Continuum-of-allele model | Diallelic model | Divergent selection | Gaussian approximation | Genetic architecture | Quantitative trait,22104,121697,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,34,SNF,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur F&amp;#x00F6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung

Positive selection on low-armor alleles at the Ectodysplasin (Eda) locus in threespine stickleback has led to the repeated evolution of reduced armor in populations following freshwater colonization by fully armored marine sticklebacks. Here, we demonstrate that Eda has environmentally determined pleiotropic effects on armor and growth. When raised in freshwater, reduced armor sticklebacks carrying ""low"" alleles at Eda had increased growth rate relative to fully armored sticklebacks carrying ""complete"" alleles. In saltwater treatments this growth advantage was present during juvenile growth but lost during adult growth, suggesting that in this environment stickleback are able to develop full armor plates without sacrificing overall growth rate. The environment specific pleiotropic effects of Eda demonstrate that ecological factors can mediate the influence of genetic architecture in driving phenotypic evolution.

A female thus runs the risk of exhausting this limited supply of eggs before the end of her life. Given that the production of an egg is costly, what is the evolutionarily stable egg load at emergence? This question has attracted a lot of attention in the last decade. Here, we analyze a model that allows us to track both the evolution and the population dynamics of a solitary, proovigenic parasitoid. First, we show how host-parasitoid dynamics feedbacks on the evolution of parasitoid egg load. Second, we use this model to consider the situation in which the parasitoid can be infected by a virus that manipulates the oviposition behavior of the females. In particular, we model the effect of the LbFV virus in L. boulardi, a virus that is known to enhance its horizontal transmission by increasing superparasitism (i.e., the laying of eggs in a host already parasitized). Specifically, we model (1) the effect of the virus on parasitoid egg load strategies, and (2) the evolution of egg load manipulation by the virus. This analysis yields two alternative, yet not mutually exclusive, adaptive explanations for the observation that females infected by the virus harbor higher egg loads than uninfected females. Infected females could either respond plastically to the infection status, or be manipulated by the virus. Further experimental work is required to distinguish between these two hypotheses.

In this species, isolated individuals delay the onset of egg laying compared to individuals having access to mates. Longer delays (""waiting times"") indicate more intense selfing avoidance. We measured inbreeding depression and waiting time in a large quantitative-genetic experiment (281 outbred families derived from 26 natural populations). We observed large genetic variance for both traits and a strong positive genetic covariance between them, most of which resided within rather than among populations. It means that, within populations, individuals with higher mutation load avoided selfing more strongly on average. This genetic covariance may result from pleiotropy and/or linkage disequilibrium. Whatever its genetic architecture, the fact it emerges specifically when individuals are deprived of mates suggests it is not fortuitous and rather reflects the action of natural selection.

We found a general trend toward trade-offs during adaptation to succinate, but this was neither universal nor showed a quantitative relationship with the extent of adaptation. After 1500 generations, succinate-evolved strains had a remarkably bimodal distribution of fitness values on methanol: Either an improvement comparable to the strains adapted on methanol or the complete loss of the ability to grow on C1 compounds. In contrast, adaptation to methanol resulted in no such trade-offs.

A major challenge of G matrix comparison is determining the biological relevance of observed change. Here, we develop a ""selection skewers"" G matrix comparison statistic that uses the breeder's equation to compare the response to selection given two G matrices while holding selection intensity constant. We present a bootstrap algorithm that determines the significance of G matrix differences using the selection skewers method, random skewers, Mantel's and Bartlett's tests, and eigenanalysis. We then compare these methods by applying the bootstrap to a dataset of laboratory populations of Tribolium castaneum. We find that the results of matrix comparison statistics are inconsistent based on differing a priori goals of each test, and that the selection skewers method is useful for identifying biologically relevant G matrix differences.",34,19490079,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Breeder's equation | G matrix evolution | Matrix comparison | Selection skewers,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,48,NA,NA

The evolutionary changes associated with adaptation to the poor food were assayed by comparing the selected and control lines in a common environment for different traits after 29-64 generations of selection.

The quantitative genetics of reproductive and dispersal traits was studied in 23 lineages (genotypes) of the bird cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi, during both the sexual and asexual phases, which were induced experimentally under specific environmental conditions. We found large and significant heritabilities (broad-sense) for all traits and several negative genetic correlations between traits (trade-offs), which are related to reproduction (i.e., numbers of the various sexual or asexual morphs) or dispersal (i.e., numbers of winged or wingless morphs). These results suggest that R. padi exhibits lineage specialization both in reproductive and dispersal strategies. In addition, we found important differences in the structure of genetic variance-covariance matrices (G) between phases. These differences were due to two large, negative genetic correlations detected during the asexual phase only: (1) between fecundity and age at maturity and (2) between the production of wingless and winged parthenogenetic females. We propose that this differential expression in genetic architecture results from a reallocation scheme during the asexual phase, when sexual morphs are not produced. We also found significant G × E interaction and nonsignificant genetic correlations across phases, indicating that genotypes could respond independently to selection in each phase. Our results reveal a rather unique situation in which the same population and even the same genotypes express different genetic (co)variation under different environmental conditions, driven by optimal resource allocation criteria. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",20,19473379,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Adaptive landscape | Aphids | Cyclic parthenogenesis | G-matrix | Life histories,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,80,NA,NA

Here we show, using experimental design criteria that reduce the potential for such confounding, that bird species on larger landmasses have higher rates of molecular evolution. The study involves a global dataset of 48 independent contrasts for the cytochrome b gene encompassing all possible paired sister species comparisons (from seven orders and 17 families) that were available at the time of dataset assembly. A more rapid evolutionary tempo in larger areas has important ramifications for biodiversity conservation because it indicates a new imperative, beyond that of simply maintaining preexisting genetic diversity, for securing large areas for threatened species.

SI phenotypes depend on a complex network of dominance relationships between alleles at the self-incompatibility locus (S-locus). Empirical studies suggest that these relationships are not random, but the exact evolutionary processes shaping these relationships remain unclear. We investigate the expected patterns of dominance under the hypothesis that dominance is a direct target of natural selection. We follow the fate of a mutant allele at the S-locus whose dominance relationships are changed but whose specificity remains unaltered. We show that strict codominance is not evolutionarily stable in SSI, and that inbreeding depression due to deleterious mutations linked or unlinked to the S-locus exerts strong constraints on changes in relative levels of dominance in pollen and pistil.

However, habitat preferences can reduce dispersal between contrasting habitats, thereby alleviating migration load and facilitating adaptive divergence. We tested whether habitat preferences contribute to adaptive divergence in a classic example of migration-selection balance: parapatric lake and stream populations of three-spine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Using a mark-transplant-recapture experiment on morphologically divergent parapatric populations, we showed that 90% of lake and stream stickleback returned to their native habitat, reducing migration between habitats by 76%.

By increasing the taxonomic coverage and number of prechondrogenic events relative to previous studies, and combining traditional phylogenetic analyses of event sequences with novel analyses of relative developmental rates, this study demonstrates that the timing of limb development in marsupials is more complex than commonly thought. The marsupial phenotype was derived through two independent evolutionary changes in developmental rate: (1) an acceleration of the forelimb's first appearance and (2) a delay of hind limb development from the bud stage onward.

Females might evolve to prefer mates that provide good genes for daughters or might adjust offspring sex ratios in favor of the sex with the highest relative fitness. We test these possibilities in a laboratory-adapted population of Drosophila melanogaster, and find that females preferentially mate with males carrying genes that are deleterious for daughters. Preferred males produce equal numbers of sons and daughters, whereas unpreferred males produce female-biased sex ratios. As a consequence, mean offspring fitness of unpreferred males is higher than offspring fitness of preferred males.

We study the impact of extinction events on modularity of biological systems, a common architectural principle found on multiple scales in biology. As a model system, we use networks that evolve toward goals specified as desired input-output relationships. We use an extinction-recolonization model, in which metapopulations occupy and migrate between different localities. Each locality displays a different environmental condition (goal), but shares the same set of subgoals with other localities. We find that in the absence of extinction events, the evolved computational networks are typically highly optimal for their localities with a nonmodular structure. In contrast, when local populations go extinct from time to time, we find that the evolved networks are modular in structure. Modular circuitry is selected because of its ability to adapt rapidly to the conditions of the free niche following an extinction event. This rapid adaptation is mainly achieved through genetic recombination of modules between immigrants from neighboring local populations. This study suggests, therefore, that extinctions in heterogeneous environments promote the evolution of modular biological network structure, allowing local populations to effectively recombine their modules to recolonize niches. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",31,19473401,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Biological networks | Extinction-recolonization | Genetic recombinations | Metapopulation | Modularity,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,104,NA,NA

Here and in the companion paper by Llaurens and colleagues, the evolution of dominance in single-locus SSI is explored using numerical models and simulation. Particular attention is directed at factors that can cause S-allele dominance to differ in pollen versus stigma. The effect of recombination between the S-locus and modifier locus is also examined. The models predict that limitation in the number of compatible mates is required for the evolution of S-allele dominance in the stigma but not in the pollen.

A reciprocal transplant experiment between wave-exposed and protected sites tested whether these exposure-specific morphologies have adaptive value. Mating success was compared over a range of distances to compare the ability of barnacles to reach mates. Barnacles that grew in the wave-protected site and mated in the wave-protected site fertilized more broods at increasing distances than those transplanted to the wave-exposed site. For barnacles that developed in the wave-exposed site, there was no difference in the ability to fertilize neighbors between sites of differing exposure.

A number of recent papers have examined this hypothesis using models with haploid hosts. In these haploid models, sex and recombination are selectively equivalent. However, sex and recombination are not equivalent in diploids because selection on sex depends on the consequences of segregation as well as recombination. Here I compare how parasites select on modifiers of sexual reproduction and modifiers of recombination rate. Across a wide set of parameters, parasites tend to select against both sex and recombination, though recombination is favored more often than is sex. There is little correspondence between the conditions favoring sex and those favoring recombination, indicating that the direction of selection on sex is often determined by the effects of segregation, not recombination. Moreover, when sex was favored it is usually due to a long-term advantage whereas short-term effects are often responsible for selection favoring recombination. These results strongly indicate that Red Queen models focusing exclusively on the effects of recombination cannot be used to infer the type of selection on sex that is generated by parasites on diploid hosts. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",30,19453733,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Host-parasite coevolution | Modifier model | Recombination | Red Queen | Segregation | Sex,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,112,NA,NA

In this study, we examined how well the widely used proxy of postzygotic isolation (reproductive output of F 1 hybrids) reflects the long-term fitness consequences of hybridization between two closely related species of birds. Using 40 species-specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, we genotyped a mixed population of collared and pied flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis and F. hypoleuca) to identify grand- and great grand-offspring from interspecific crosses to derive an accurate, multigeneration estimate of postzygotic isolation. Two independent estimates of fitness show that hybridization results in 2.4% and 2.7% of the number of descendents typical of conspecific pairing. This postzygotic isolation was considerably stronger than estimates based on F 1 hybrids. Our results demonstrate that, in nature, combined selection against hybrids and backcrossed individuals may result in almost complete postzygotic isolation between two comparatively young species.

The optimal strategy (in terms of persistence) cannot invade, whereas suboptimal bet-hedgers are good invaders.

Given the strength of stabilizing selection, inbreeding depression then varies simply with the genetic variance for the trait under selection and the distance between the mean breeding value and the optimal phenotype. This allows us to relate the expected inbreeding depression to the degree of maladaptation of the population to its environment. We confront analytical predictions with simulations, in well-adapted populations at equilibrium, as well as in maladapted populations undergoing either a transient environmental shift, or gene swamping in heterogeneous habitats.

""Progress"" along this ecological speciation pathway can range from minimal divergence to full speciation. We examine this variation for threespine stickleback fish that evolved independently across eight lake-stream habitat transitions. By quantifying stickleback diets, we show that lake-stream transitions usually coincide with limnetic-benthic ecotones. By measuring genetically based phenotypes, we show that these ecotones often generate adaptive divergence in foraging morphology. By analyzing neutral genetic markers (microsatellites), we show that adaptive divergence is often associated with the presence of two populations maintaining at least partial reproductive isolation in parapatry. Coalescent-based simulations further suggest that these populations have diverged with gene flow within a few thousand generations, although we cannot rule out the possibility of phases of allopatric divergence. Finally, we find striking variation among the eight lake-stream transitions in progress toward ecological speciation. This variation allows us to hypothesize that progress is generally promoted by strong divergent selection and limited dispersal across the habitat transitions. Our study thus makes a case for ecological speciation in a parapatric context, while also highlighting variation in the outcome. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",169,19228184,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Adaptive divergence | Foraging morphology | Gasterosteus aculeatus | Gene flow | Genetic differentiation | Reproductive isolation,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,128,NA,NA

The mating differential is converted into a selection differential by the Bateman gradient, which is the least squares regression of relative reproductive success on relative mating success. Hence, a complete understanding of precopulatory sexual selection requires knowledge of two equally important aspects of mating patterns: the mating differential, which requires a focus on mechanisms generating covariance between trait values and mating success, and the Bateman gradient, which requires knowledge of the genetic mating system. An upper limit on the magnitude of the selection differential on any sexually selected trait is given by the product of the standard deviation in relative mating success and the Bateman gradient. This latter view of the maximum selection differential provides a clearer focus on the important aspects of precopulatory sexual selection than other methods and therefore should be an important part of future studies of sexual selection. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",157,19228185,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Mating differential | Mating success | Polyandry | Polygyny | Reproductive success | Selection differential,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,129,NA,NA

Although much attention has focused on fitness consequences associated with cooperating, relatively little is known about the second component of evolutionary change, the inheritance of cooperation or reciprocity. The genetics of behaviors that can only be expressed in the context of interactions are particularly difficult to describe because the relevant genes reside in multiple social partners. Indirect genetic effects (IGEs) describe the influence of genes carried in social partners on the phenotype of a focal individual and thus provide a novel approach to quantifying the genetics underlying interactions such as reciprocal cooperation. We used inbred lines of guppies and a novel application of IGE theory to describe the dual genetic control of predator inspection and social behavior, both classic models of reciprocity. We identified effects of focal strain, social group strain, and interactions between focal and group strains on variation in focal behavior. We measured ψ, the coefficient of the interaction, which describes the degree to which an individual's phenotype is influenced by the phenotype of its social partners. The genetic identity of social partners substantially influences inspection behavior, measures of threat assessment, and schooling and does so in positively reinforcing manner.

Major congenital abnormalities corresponded to severe, often-lethal developmental disorders disrupting normal development from early organogenesis onward, but only moderately increased FA. Lower FA with age also supported the hypothesis that more severe abnormalities, leading to an earlier death, increased DI. Although FA related significantly to measures of fitness or health, we anticipated stronger associations because fetal health problems were detrimental. Furthermore, elevated FA occurred in only 4 of 17 disorders (left-right patterning, limb defects, and problems of bronchopulmonary and urogenital system). Fetuses experiencing major abnormalities other than these four types did not show increased FA. This suggests that the functional importance of symmetry in limbs has resulted in strong selection for symmetry and reduced its sensitivity to stress.

At the local scale, we find that coexisting species from these clades are more similar in body size than expected under a null model in which species are randomly assembled into communities. These patterns are particularly surprising in that competition is known to be important in driving phenotypic diversification and limiting local coexistence of similar-sized species within these clades.

Also, we explore heritability of other pollinator-selected traits in this plant species, such as plant size, flower display, and corolla size.

Specifically, we test the intersexual coevolution hypothesis by defining gender-specific indices of genital complexity that summarize all relevant and phylogenetically informative traits. We then use independent contrasts to show that male and female genital complexity indices correlate significantly and positively across the phylogeny rather than among sympatric sister species, as predicted by reproductive character displacement. In effect, as females respond to selection for fecundity-driven fitness via giantism and polyandry (perhaps responding to male-biased effective sex ratios), male mechanisms evolve to monopolize females (male monogamy) via opportunistic mating, pre- and postcopulatory mate guarding, and/or plugging of female genitalia to exclude subsequent suitors. In males morphological symptoms of these phenomena range from self-mutilated genitalia to total castration. Although the results are compatible with both recently favored sexual selection hypotheses, sexually antagonistic coevolution, and cryptic female choice, the evidence of strong intersexual conflict and genitalic damage in both sexes is more easily explained as sexually antagonistic coevolution due to an evolutionary arms race. 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",87,19492993,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Cryptic female choice | Monogamy | Morphological complexity | Polyandry | Reproductive character displacement | Sexual conflict | Sexually antagonistic coevolution | Sperm competition,22104,0228699,0,FALSE,NA,NA,143,NSF,National Science Foundation

No correlation was found between CMS and restorer frequencies within populations, which has been previously interpreted as a result of stochasticity. However, neutral genetic variation did not indicate recent population bottlenecks in studied populations.

Parasitoid genotypes differed in infectivity and host clones exhibited huge variation for susceptibility. This variation occurred at two levels. Clones harboring Hamiltonella defensa, a bacterial endosymbiont known to protect pea aphids against parasitoids, enjoyed greatly reduced susceptibility, yet clones without H. defensa also exhibited significant variation. Although there was no evidence for genotype-specificity in the H. defensa-free clones' interaction with parasitoids, we found such evidence in clones containing the bacterium. This suggests that parasitoid genotypes differ in their ability to overcome H. defensa, resulting in an apparent host × parasitoid genotype interaction that may in fact be due to an underlying symbiont × parasitoid genotype interaction. Aphid susceptibility to parasitoids correlated negatively with fecundity and rate of increase, due to H. defensa-bearing clones being more fecund on average. Hence, possessing symbionts may also be favorable in the absence of parasitoids, which raises the question why H. defensa does not go to fixation and highlights the need to develop new models to understand the dynamics of endosymbiont-mediated coevolution. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",119,19228189,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Aphids | Aphis fabae fabae | Costs of resistance | Genetic correlations | Hamiltonella defensa | Lysiphlebus fabarum | Regiella insecticola | Symbiosis | Trade-offs,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,146,NA,NA

We test this hypothesis by asking how BMR of a particular species, the bank vole Myodes (= Clethrionomys) glareolus, would change under selection for high growth rate (measured as a postweaning body mass change; MDPW) and the ability to cope with a low-quality herbivorous diet (measured as body mass change during a four-day test; MDLQD).

Thus, both of the traits could change in response to a selection, and the selection would also result in a correlated evolution of the level of metabolism.

In contrast, many fundamental assumptions, such as the trade-off between male and female allocation, and numerous predictions, such as brooding limiting the returns from female allocation, are still poorly supported.

Homologous landmark coordinates are digitized on the FE model and on a target specimen into which the FE model is being transformed.

Autotomic ease varied substantially among the study populations, in a pattern that is best explained by the presence of vipers.

Final concentration of accumulated tail muscle lactate and duration of movement of a shed tail, two traits that were previously thought to relate to predation pressure, are in general not shaped by either predator diversity or insularity.

We compared rates of shed tails in the field against rates of laboratory autotomies conducted under standardized conditions and found very high correlation values (r > 0.96).

First, a modifier that strengthens prezygotic isolation can be favored everywhere. This fits with the traditional view of reinforcement as an adaptation to reduce deleterious hybridization by strengthening assortative mating. Second, selection can favor association between different incompatibilities, despite recombination. We generalize this ""two allele"" model to follow associations among any number of incompatibilities, which may include both assortment and hybrid inviability. Our key argument is that this process, of coupling between incompatibilities, may be quite different from the usual view of reinforcement: strong isolation can evolve through the coupling of any kind of incompatibility, whether prezygotic or postzygotic. Single locus incompatibilities become coupled because associations between them increase the variance in compatibility, which in turn increases mean fitness if there is positive epistasis. Multiple incompatibilities, each maintained by epistasis, can become coupled in the same way. In contrast, a single-locus incompatibility can become coupled with loci that reduce the viability of haploid hybrids because this reduces harmful recombination. We obtain simple approximations for the limits of tight linkage, and strong assortment, and show how assortment alleles can invade through associations with other components of reproductive isolation. © 2009 The Society for the Study of Evolution.",101,19154394,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Assortative mating | Linkage disequilibrium | Reinforcement | Reproductive isolation | Speciation,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,174,NA,NA

Because cytoplasmic factors are generally uniparentally inherited, the cytoplasmic genome is inherited along with only one of the nuclear haplotypes, and therefore, coadaptation is expected to evolve through the interaction of these coinherited (usually maternally inherited) genomes. Here I show that, as a result of this coinheritance of the two genomes, cytonuclear epistasis can favor the evolution of genomic imprinting such that, when the cytoplasmic factor is maternally inherited, selection favors maternal expression of the nuclear locus and when the factor is paternally inherited selection favors paternal expression.

Transoceanic dispersal has come into vogue for explaining many intercontinental distributions; however, it has been used mainly for organisms that can float or raft between the continents. Despite their name, the Sea Catfishes (Ariidae) have limited dispersal ability, and there are no examples of nearshore ariid genera with a transoceanic distribution except for Galeichthys where three species occur in southern Africa and one in the Peruvian coast. A previous study suggested that the group originated in Gondwana, and that the species arrived at their current range after the breakup of the supercontinent in the Early Cretaceous. To test this hypothesis, we infer molecular phylogenies (mitochondrial cytochrome b, ATP synthase 8/6, 12S, and 16S; nuclear rag2; total ∼4 kb) and estimate intercontinental divergence via molecular clocks (penalized-likelihood, Bayesian relaxed clock, and universal clock rates in fishes). Age ranges for cladogenesis of African and South American lineages are 15.4-2.5 my, far more recent than would be suggested by Gondwanan vicariance; thus, the distribution of galeichthyines must be explained by dispersal or more recent vicariant events. The nested position of the Peruvian species (Galeichthys peruvianus) within the African taxa is robust, suggesting that the direction of the dispersal was from Africa to South America. The progenitor of the Peruvian species likely arrived at its current distribution with the aid of ocean currents, and several scenarios are discussed. © No Claim to original U.S. government works.

Even modest levels of inbreeding allow such a response to selection when there are direct fitness effects of mitochondria on male fertility because inbreeding associates male fertility traits with mitochondrial matrilines. Male viability effects of mitochondria are also selectable whenever there are indirect fitness effects of males on the fitness of their sisters.

We propose a new likelihood method to fit multiple evolutionary rate matrices (also called evolutionary variance-covariance matrices) to species data for two or more continuous characters and a phylogeny. The evolutionary rate matrix is a matrix containing the evolutionary rates for individual characters on its diagonal, and the covariances between characters (of which the evolutionary correlations are a function) elsewhere.

If transgression is caused by complementary gene action or epistasis, hybrids between more distant species should be more likely to display transgressive phenotypes. To test this prediction we collected data on transgression frequency from the literature, estimated genetic distances between the hybridizing species from gene sequences, and calculated the relationship between the two using phylogenetically controlled methods. We also tested if parental phenotypic divergence affected the occurrence of transgression.

For this reason, no estimates currently exist for the genetic basis of life-history traits in natural populations of large marine vertebrates. And yet such estimates are likely to be important given the exposure of this taxon to changing selection pressures, and the relevance of life-history traits to population productivity. We report such estimates from a long-term (1995-2007) study of lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris) conducted at Bimini, Bahamas. We obtained these estimates by genetically reconstructing a population pedigree (117 dams, 487 sires, and 1351 offspring) and then using an ""animal model"" approach to estimate quantitative genetic parameters. We find significant additive genetic (co)variance, and hence moderate heritability, for juvenile length and mass. We also find substantial maternal effects for these traits at age-0, but not age-1, confirming that genotype-phenotype interactions between mother and offspring are strongest at birth; although these effects could not be parsed into their genetic and nongenetic components. Our results suggest that human-imposed selection pressures (e.g., size-selective harvesting) might impose noteworthy evolutionary change even in large marine vertebrates. We therefore use our findings to explain how maternal effects may sometimes promote maladaptive juvenile traits, and how lemon sharks at different nursery sites may show ""constrained local adaptation.""

In sympatry, S. multiplicata is forced by its competitor onto a less profitable resource. As a result, sympatric females mature in poorer condition and invest less into offspring. Consequently, their offspring produce a resource-use phenotype that minimizes competition with the other species and that also differs from the phenotype produced in allopatry. These differences in trait expression between allopatry and sympatry disappear once mothers are equilibrated in body condition in the laboratory. Thus, a condition-dependent maternal effect mediates population divergence and character displacement. Such effects potentially buffer populations from extinction (via competitive exclusion) while genetic changes accumulate, which produce divergent traits in the absence of the maternal effect. Maternal effects may therefore often be important in determining the initial direction and rate of evolution during the early stages of character displacement. © 2009 The Author(s).",43,19154374,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Ecological character displacement | Genetic accommodation | Inherited environmental effect | Phenotypic plasticity | Population divergence | Spea multiplicata,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,185,NA,NA

Previous craniometric studies recognized remarkable differences among populations from this region, usually resorting to random factors as the main explanation. In contrast, here we suggest, using tests based on quantitative genetic models, that: (1) the rate of craniofacial divergence among these populations is too high and (2) the patterns of variation within and between populations are too different to be explained by genetic drift alone. In addition, the among-sample craniofacial variation is correlated with climate and diet but not with mtDNA variation. We suggest that the influence of nonrandom factors (e.g., plasticity, selection) on human craniofacial diversification in regions with large ecological variation is more important than generally acknowledged and capable to generate large craniofacial divergence in a short period of time.

Mutualist workers discriminated against sucrose whereas exploiters and generalists with no affinity toward Acacia myrmecophytes preferred sucrose, because mutualist workers lacked the sucrose-cleaving enzyme invertase, which is present in workers of the other two groups. Sucrose uptake induced invertase activity in workers of parasites and generalists, but not mutualists, and in larvae of all species: the mutualists loose invertase during their ontogeny. This reduced metabolic capacity ties the mutualists to their plant hosts, but it does not completely prevent the mutualism from exploitation. We therefore investigated whether the exploiters studied here are cheaters (i.e., have evolved from former mutualists) or parasites (exploiters with no mutualistic ancestor). A molecular phylogeny demonstrates that the exploiter species did not evolve from former mutualists, and no evidence for cheaters was found.

These statistics appropriately distill allelic variation and provide an explicit population context for QTL mapping estimates. Within this framework, one can parse the G-matrix into a set of mutually exclusive genomic components and ask whether these parts are similar or dissimilar in their respective features, for example the magnitude of phenotypic effects and the extent and nature of pleiotropy.

The first argument is factually incorrect: the previously published validation analysis fully accounted for both type I and type II errors. The simulations that indicate a 75% type I error rate have serious flaws and only evaluate outdated versions of NCPA. These outdated type I error rates fall precipitously when the 2003 version of single-locus NCPA is used or when the 2002 multilocus version of NCPA is used.

We further investigated whether selection favors flexibility in the expression of aggression in relation to current social context. We found a significant genetic correlation between aggression and dispersal that is concordant with consistent selection for coexpression of these behaviors. To a limited extent, individuals modified their aggression to match their mate; however, we found no fitness consequences on such adjustments. These results introduce a novel way of viewing behavioral strategies, where flexibility of behavior, while often aiding an organism's fit in its current environment, may be limited and thereby enable integration with less flexible traits. © 2009 The Author(s).",81,19154391,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Dispersal polymorphism | Genetic covariance | Heritability | Temperament,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,204,NA,NA

Although predation-resistant FS morphs suffer a cost of resistance, the evolution of extreme resistance to predation by the SM morph was apparently unconstrained by other traits (carrying capacity, growth rate).

We used an individual-based genetic model to examine whether a directional preference for mates with higher genome-wide heterozygosity (H), and consequently greater ornamentation, could evolve and be maintained in the absence of direct fitness benefits of mate choice. We specifically considered finite populations of varying size and spatial genetic structure, in which parent-offspring resemblance in heterozygosity could provide an indirect benefit of mate choice. A directional preference for heterozygous mates evolved under broad conditions, even given a substantial direct cost of mate choice, low mutation rate, and stochastic variation in the link between individual heterozygosity and ornamentation. Furthermore, genetic variance was retained under directional sexual selection. Preference evolution was strongest in smaller populations, but weaker in populations with greater internal genetic structure in which restricted dispersal increased local inbreeding among offspring of neighboring females that all preferentially mated with the same male. These results suggest that directional preferences for heterozygous or outbred mates could evolve and be maintained in finite populations in the absence of direct fitness benefits, suggesting a novel resolution to the lek paradox. © 2009 The Author(s).",60,19220455,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Compatible genes | Genetic quality | Good genes | Inbreeding depression | Sexual selection,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,206,NA,NA

AMOVA and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that related Wolbachia commonly infect related hosts, revealing a pattern of host association that was strongest among strains from the ants.

Maximum-likelihood analyses of character evolution revealed three major patterns. First, consistent with the defense-escalation hypothesis, the diversification of the milkweeds was associated with a trend for increasing phenolic production; this pattern was reversed (a declining evolutionary trend) for cardenolides, toxins sequestered by specialist herbivores. Second, phylogenetically independent correlations existed among phenolic classes across species. For example, coumaric acid derivatives showed negatively correlated evolution with caffeic acid derivatives, and this was likely driven by the fact that the former are used as precursors for the latter. In contrast, coumaric acid derivatives were positively correlated with flavonoids, consistent with competition for the precursor p-coumaric acid. Finally, of the phenolic classes, only flavonoids showed correlated evolution (positive) with cardenolides, consistent with a physiological and evolutionary link between the two via malonate.

From this perspective, sexual selection is not limited to influencing those genes directly involved in exaggerated morphological traits but rather affects most, if not all, genes in the genome. If true, sexual selection can be an important force acting to reduce the frequency of deleterious mutations and, as a result, mutation load. We review the literature and find various forms of indirect evidence that sexual selection helps to eliminate deleterious mutations.

To examine how development shapes the phenotypic covariance structure, we ordinate the age-specific covariance matrices of shape coordinates for craniofacial growth in rats and humans. The metric that we use for this purpose is given by the square root of the summed squared log relative eigenvalues. This is the natural metric on the space of positive-definite symmetric matrices, which we introduce and justify in a biometric context.

Using three species of Mus with high, intermediate, and low levels of sperm competition, we examined fertilization rates in competitive and noncompetitive contexts. We found that the influence of sperm competition upon sperm competitiveness is as strong as it is upon ovum defensiveness, revealing an effect upon female gametes so far overlooked. As a result, fertilization success was strongly related to differences in sperm competition levels between species providing sperm and ova, thus generating major asymmetries in reciprocal crosses. When placed in competition, conspecific sperm maintained levels of fertilization success similar to those found in noncompetitive contexts, at the expense of the success of heterospecific sperm. When only heterospecific sperm competed, species with highest levels of sperm competition outcompeted others and asymmetries were exacerbated.

For strains of equal effective fecundity, if population density is regulated locally (i.e., ""soft selection""), variation among patches in infection frequencies may induce change in the relative frequencies of the strains. However, whether this change favors stronger incompatibility depends on initial frequencies. Demographic fluctuations maintain frequency variation that tends to favor stronger incompatibility. However, this effect is weak; even with small patches, minute increases in effective fecundity can offset substantial decreases in CI intensity.

A well-known model of BDM incompatibility due to Orr suggests that the fitness load on hybrids should initially accelerate, and continue to increase as the number of potentially incompatible substitutions increases (the ""snowball effect""). In the gene networks model, which violates a key assumption of Orr's model (independence of fixation probabilities), the snowball effect often does not occur. Instead, we describe three possible dynamics in a constant environment: (1) Stabilizing selection can constrain two allopatric populations to remain near-perfectly compatible. (2) Despite constancy of environment, punctuated evolution may obtain; populations may experience rare adaptations asynchronously, permitting incompatibility. (3) Despite stabilizing selection, developmental system drift may permit genetic change, allowing two populations to drift in and out of compatibility.

Testes size or architecture may determine the size of the sperm they produce, and selection for longer sperm may require concomitant adaptations in the testes. Relative testes size differs greatly between species and is often used as an index of sperm competition, but little is known about whether larger testes have more sperm-producing tissue or produce sperm at a faster rate. Using a comparative approach in New World Blackbirds (Icteridae), we found (1) a strong link between testis histology and sperm length, suggesting selection on testis architecture through selection on sperm size, and (2) that species under intense sperm competition had a greater proportion of sperm-producing tissue within their testes.

We derive invasion fitness of mutants introducing dominance or assortative mate choice in a randomly mating population with a genetic polymorphism for an ecological trait. Mutations with small effects as well as mutants introducing complete dominance or perfect assorting are considered. Using adaptive dynamics techniques, we are able to calculate the ratio of fitness gradients for the effects of a dominance modifier and a mate choice locus, near evolutionary branching points.

Dominance is more strongly selected than assortative mating when the resident (common) alleles have very unequal frequencies at equilibrium.

If all parasite mortality is purely random (time-independent), enhancement must increase predation by the next host sufficiently more (depending on manipulative costs) than it increases the average for all forms of host mortality; thus if host and parasite die only through random predation, manipulation must increase the ""right"" predation more than the ""wrong"" predation. But if almost all parasites die in their intermediate host through reaching the end of a fixed life span, enhancement can evolve if it increases the right predation, regardless of how much it attracts wrong predators. Although enhancement is always most favorable when it targets the right host, suppression aids survival to the time when establishment in the next host is possible: it is most favorable if it reduces all aspects of host (and hence parasite) mortality.

We assess to what extent these processes have contributed to divergence in female sexual traits in the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina clavipes in which some populations are infected with parthenogenesis-inducing Wolbachia bacteria. We find evidence consistent with both hypotheses. Both arrhenotokous males and males derived from thelytokous strains preferred to court females from their own population.

Thelytokous females did not store sperm efficiently and fertilized very few of their eggs. The nonfertility of thelytokous females was due to mutations in the wasp genome, which must be an effect of mutation accumulation under thelytoky.

However, the phylogenetic distribution of high Msum among birds and the impact of its evolution on current distributions are not well understood. Two potential adaptive hypotheses might explain the phylogenetic distribution of high M sum among birds. The cold adaptation hypothesis contends that species wintering in cold climates should have higher Msum than species wintering in warmer climates. The flight adaptation hypothesis suggests that volant birds might be capable of generating high Msum as a byproduct of their muscular capacity for flight; thus, variation in Msum should be associated with capacity for sustained flight, one indicator of which is migration. We collected Msum data from the literature for 44 bird species and conducted both conventional and phylogenetically informed statistical analyses to examine the predictors of Msum variation. Significant phylogenetic signal was present for log body mass, log mass-adjusted Msum, and average temperature in the winter range. In multiple regression models, log body mass, winter temperature, and clade were significant predictors of log Msum. These results are consistent with a role for climate in determining Msum in birds, but also indicate that phylogenetic signal remains even after accounting for associations indicative of adaptation to winter temperature. Migratory strategy was never a significant predictor of log Msum in multiple regressions, a result that is not consistent with the flight adaptation hypothesis. © 2008 The Author(s).",87,18803689,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Allometry | Comparative method | Energetics | Evolutionary physiology | Metabolic rate | Metabolic theory of ecology | Physiology,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,253,NA,NA

Two closely related species of house mice, Mus domesticus and M. musculus, form a narrow hybrid zone in Europe, suggesting that one or more isolating factors operate in the face of ongoing gene flow. Here, we test for differences in fertilization rate using laboratory matings as well as in vitro sperm competition assays. In noncompetitive matings, we show that fertilization occurs significantly faster in conspecific versus heterospecific matings and that this difference arises after mating and before zygotes form. To further explore the mechanisms underlying this conspecific advantage, we used competitive in vitro assays to isolate gamete interactions. Surprisingly, we discovered that M. musculus sperm consistently outcompeted M. domesticus sperm regardless of which species donated ova. These results suggest that in vivo fertilization rate is mediated by interactions between sperm, the internal female environment, and/or contributions from male seminal fluid.

The complete maintenance of heterozygosity between generations in the five parthenogens strongly suggests that eggs are produced by apomixis. Virgin females of the sexual species were also able to produce parthenogenetic offspring, but these females produced eggs by automixis. High heterozygosity levels stemming from conserved ancestral alleles in the parthenogens suggest, however, that automixis has not generated the current parthenogenetic Timema lineages but that apomixis appeared abruptly in several sexual species. A direct transition from sexual reproduction to (at least functional) apomixis results in a relatively high level of allelic diversity and high efficiency for parthenogenesis.

Sexual outcrossing combines genetic information from individuals with potentially different experiences, so it is conceivable that sex might reduce the contribution of individual luck to noise in inheritance. In a simple way, we derive expressions for noise in inheritance in terms of some sources of within-generation ecological noise. We demonstrate that interindividual reproduction can indeed dampen the effects of ecological noise better than lone-individual modes, but there are conditions under which it does not. Empirical and theoretical work on plants, modeled here, suggest noise dampening conditions. Ecological noise dampening operates alongside other features of sex such as recombination and segregation and, because noise in inheritance weakens the role of selection in genetic change, we speculate that noise dampening may offer a benefit to be deducted from the costs of sex.

Males may do so by copulating during situations when the female's ability to resist is decreased because of competing naturally selected demands. Males of the common bedbug, Cimex lectularius, an obligate blood feeder, mate at a rate, and in a manner that is harmful to females. Females have to feed regularly to produce eggs, and during feeding female body volume increases by 300%.

Here replicate lines of D. melanogaster were exposed to the microsporidian parasite Tubulinosema kingi over a period of 61 weeks, with overlapping generations. Compared to controls, exposed lines had higher early-life fecundity and increased longevity when infected suggesting successful selection for resistance or tolerance. In the absence of the pathogen, exposed lines had lower fecundity when reared under harsh environmental conditions, and were poorer larval competitors than controls. They also had relatively higher densities of haemocytes, a component of the cellular immune system. Defense against this pathogen resembles more that against macroparasites than microsparasites, and this is interpreted in the light of what is known about the mechanisms of resistance to microsporidians. © 2008 The Author(s).",52,18786186,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Drosophila | Experimental evoluation | Invertebrate immunity | Microsporidia | Parasite | Resistance,22104,cpb010001,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,268,NERC,Natural Environment Research Council

This trend contrasts with the allometry of other structures under sexual selection, which usually show steep allometric slopes. The trend to low allometric genital values is less consistent in mammals than in arthropods. Data not in accord with the previous the ""one-size-fits-all"" explanation for low allometric slopes in genitalia, which was based on sexual selection by female choice, suggest a more general version that includes both natural selection and sexual selection, and involves both mechanical fit and stimulation. Less-complete data on the female genitalia of arthropods suggest a trend to similar low allometric slopes, and may also be explained by mechanical fit and stimulatory one-size-fits-all arguments. © 2008 The Author(s).",134,18803683,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Biogenetic law | Black widows | Construction behavior | Ontogeny | Spider webs,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,269,NA,NA

Although (1) is well established, no direct experimental evidence exists for (2). I examined the phenotypic and genetic consequences of insect predation using F2 families from crosses between freshwater and marine stickleback populations. I measured selection on body size, and size-adjusted spine (dorsal and pelvic) and pelvic girdle length, by splitting juvenile F2 families between control and insect predation treatments, set in pond enclosures. I also examined the effect of insect predation on Ectodysplasin (Eda), a gene physically linked to quantitative trait loci for lateral plate number, spine length, and body shape. Insect predation resulted in: (1) significant selection for larger juvenile size, and shorter dorsal spine and pelvic girdle length, (2) higher mortality of individuals missing the pelvic girdle, and (3) selection in favor of the low armor Eda allele. Predatory insects favor less stickleback armor, likely contributing to the widespread reduction of armor in freshwater populations. Because size strongly influences mate choice, predator-driven divergent selection on size may play a substantial role in byproduct reproductive isolation and speciation in threespine stickleback. © 2008 The Author(s).",123,18803682,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Adaptation | Divergent selection | Diversification | Ectodysplasin | Speciation,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,270,NA,NA

We present an approach for detecting directional evolution in subclades of species when relatively few species are sampled, and apply it to studying the evolution of stockiness in Phrynosomatine lizards. Our approach is more sensitive to detecting the tempo of directional evolution than other available approaches. We use ancestral reconstruction and phylogenetic mapping of morphology to characterize the direction and magnitude of trait evolution. We demonstrate a directional trend toward stockiness in horned lizards, but not their sister groups, finding that stockier species tend to have relatively short and wide bodies, and relatively short heads, tails, and limbs. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models show that the directional trend in horned lizards is due to a shift in selective regime and stabilizing selection as opposed to directional selection. Bayesian evolutionary correlation analyses indicate that stockier species run more slowly and eat a larger proportion of ants. Furthermore, species with larger horns tend to be slower and more ant-specialized. Directional evolution toward a stocky body shape has evolved in conjunction with changes in a suite of traits, representing a complex example of directional macroevolution. © 2008 The Author(s).",24,18826447,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Bayesian methods | Defensive structures | Diet | Macroevolution | Phrynosomatinae | Sprint speed,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,271,NA,NA

In this essay I argue that to better deal with the large multilocus datasets brought on by phylogenomics, and to better align the fields of phylogeography and phylogenetics, we should embrace the primacy of species trees, not only as a new and useful practical tool for systematics, but also as a long-standing conceptual goal of systematics that, largely due to the lack of appropriate computational tools, has been eclipsed in the past few decades. I suggest that phylogenies as gene trees are a ""local optimum"" for systematics, and review recent advances that will bring us to the broader optimum inherent in species trees. In addition to adopting new methods of phylogenetic analysis (and ideally reserving the term ""phylogeny"" for species trees rather than gene trees), the new paradigm suggests shifts in a number of practices, such as sampling data to maximize not only the number of accumulated sites but also the number of independently segregating genes; routinely using coalescent or other models in computer simulations to allow gene tree heterogeneity; and understanding better the role of concatenation in influencing topologies and confidence in phylogenies. By building on the foundation laid by concepts of gene trees and coalescent theory, and by taking cues from recent trends in multilocus phylogeography, molecular systematics stands to be enriched. Many of the challenges and lessons learned for estimating gene trees will carry over to the challenge of estimating species trees, although adopting the species tree paradigm will clarify many issues (such as the nature of polytomies and the star tree paradox), raise conceptually new challenges, or provide new answers to old questions. © 2008 The Author(s).",720,19146594,Journal,no,Note,100,1,1,Fossil | Genome | Macroevolution | Neanderthal | Phylogeography | Polytomy,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,272,NA,NA

I paired females either with previous or novel mates, and recorded the latency to mating and the time after mating at which the female removed the male's spermatophore, terminating sperm transfer. Females that mated with familiar males removed their spermatophores sooner than females that mated with novel males. Females paired with novel males also mated more quickly than females paired with familiar males, but this difference was not statistically significant. A molecular-based paternity analysis was used to determine whether the postcopulatory preference of females for novel males influences a male's fertilization success. Females were assigned to either mate three times with the same male and then once with a novel male, or four times with four different males. The paternity of the last male was higher when the female previously had mated repeatedly with the same male than when she had mated previously with different males. These results suggest that female spermatophore removal behavior influences male paternity such that novel males receive a fertility benefit. © 2008 The Author(s).",15,18826449,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Genetic benefits | Gryllus vocalis | Multiple mating | Novel male | Polyandry,22104,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,273,NA,NA

One of the key features of Wolbachia biology is its ability to move within and between host species, which contributes to the impressive diversity and range of infected hosts. Using multiple Wolbachia genes, including five developed for Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST), the diversity and modes of movement of Wolbachia within the wasp genus Nasonia were investigated. Eleven different Wolbachia were found in the four species of Nasonia, including five newly identified infections. Five infections were acquired by horizontal transmission from other insect taxa, three have been acquired by hybridization between two Nasonia species, which resulted in a mitochondrial-Wolbachia sweep from one species to the other, and at least three have codiverged during speciation of their hosts. The results show that a variety of transfer mechanisms of Wolbachia are possible even within a single host genus. Codivergence of Wolbachia and their hosts is uncommon and provides a rare opportunity to investigate long-term Wolbachia evolution within a host lineage. Using synonymous divergence among codiverging infections and host nuclear genes, we estimate Wolbachia mutation rates to be approximately one-third that of the nuclear genome. © 2008 The Author(s).",180,18826448,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Coevolution | Divergence time | Hybridization | Multilocus | Sequence typing | Symbiosis,22104,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,274,NA,NA
