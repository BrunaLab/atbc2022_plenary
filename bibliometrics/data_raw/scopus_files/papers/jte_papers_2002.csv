Quartz sand with and without Fe and Al oxide coatings were treated with nutrient solution, then subjected to a leaching regime that simulated early wet-season conditions at a tropical location. Nutrient cations applied were rapidly lost in the initial leaches from quartz sand without oxide coatings, but showed a more gradual loss from oxide-coated sand, indicating temporary adsorption by the latter. In a second experiment, oxide-coated sand with and without seedlings of Grevillea robusta (a non-mycorrhizal tree species) were subjected to a similar treatment and leaching losses were compared. The presence of seedlings significantly reduced the losses of all nutrient cations, with the effect being minimal for Na and greatest for K, confirming that plants can gain access to temporarily adsorbed nutrients. More typical tropical soil-vegetation systems are likely to possess properties that magnify both the adsorptive and absorptive processes that have been documented in these experiments, justifying extrapolation of the experimental results to these natural systems.

We sought to identify traits of its life cycle that could contribute to its persistence and widespread dominance under such a disturbance regime. Leafing, flowering and fruiting were monitored on seven fallows differing in topographic location, age, shrub density and degradation state, during two rainy seasons and one dry season. Phenological spectra showed similar timing of the three phenophases of the seven populations. Differences were observed mainly in magnitude of the phases. However, there were both a high intra-fallow variability (64.6% of the whole variability) and a statistically significant inter-fallow variability, despite only 35.4% of the total variability being due to differences between fallows. A statistical classification of the fallows was proposed based on shrub phenological course over the two cycles monitored. This classification corresponds to a gradient of life-cycle achievement primarily linked to the topographic situation of the stations, and then to a combination of other factors.

Between the plants from bright and shaded parts of a canopy gap, both maximum photosynthetic rate (mean ≈ 6.5 μmol m-2 s-1) and stomatal conductance (148 vs. 131 mmol m-2 s-1) were not significantly different, but apparent quantum yield (0.021 vs. 0.025) and dark respiration rate (0.49 vs. 0.30 μmol m-2 s-1) were.

Photoinhibition accelerated with increase of incident irradiance and relaxed in the afternoon. Thermal dissipation as indicated by non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ) increased rapidly in the morning and continued at a high rate in the afternoon. Prevention of leaf rolling resulted in acceleration of photoinhibition. Artificial inhibition of the xanthophyll cycle led to acceleration of both photoinhibition and inactivation of PSII reaction centres, and decrease of NPQ.

In general, it is found that invasibility positively correlates with human disturbance, and that undisturbed tropical forests harbour few exotic species. To date, there is no evidence to attribute the low invasibility of undisturbed tropical forests to either their high species diversity or their high diversity of functional types. Instead, the low occurrence of exotic species in most tropical forests is most likely due to the fact that the great majority of exotic species that are transported to tropical countries lack specific life history traits, most importantly shade tolerance, necessary for successful invasion of undisturbed tropical forests.

This paper describes, examines and illustrates an 'extreme-value' approach to clump detection. Simulations demonstrate that the approach, though simple, is sensitive and well suited to identifying aggregation, even in small data sets. The test is complementary to the χ2 approach and significantly outperforms it when high-density clusters form a relatively small fraction of the total area. This difference holds true as density declines, though the power of both tests decreases and the χ2 test eventually fails. Though powerful, the extreme-value tests are slightly conservative. The approach is adaptable to other null distributions and applications. An illustration uses tree data from a Ugandan forest plot with records from 1939 to 1992. One plausible explanation for observed stem increases in this plot is an unusually high incidence of large tree-fall events. Evidence for this is sought through spatial localization of various stem populations. Chi-square tests detect non-random density patterns in the populations that comprise 'all stems ≥ 10 cm diameter recorded in the 1992 survey', and 'all recruits in 1976'. In the extreme-value test three populations are found to be clumped, these are 'pioneers ≥ 10 cm diameter recorded in the 1992 survey', 'all recruits in 1992' and again 'all recruits in 1976'. These patterns, particularly the pioneer trees and stem recruitment, signal a 'gap-dynamic process' of tree regeneration.

During the drought, a coleopteran (Scolytidae) root borer attacked dipterocarp seedlings, primarily of the genus Parashorea. Infestation was spatially heterogeneous on a large (c. 100 m) scale. Attack rate decreased with plant vigour within infested areas. Experiments showed that root damage was fatal under drought conditions, but not after rain. Defoliation and apical meristem removal did not increase mortality. The spatio-temporal heterogeneity of herbivore outbreaks and difficulties involved in experimenting with root herbivores limit the power of such short-term investigations. However, the study shows that herbivores can cause differential mortality between species, and can therefore influence dipterocarp regeneration dynamics. The effect of herbivory depends on the plant organ attacked and interactions with other stresses such as drought.

To evaluate if these forests truly represent ecological rehabilitation of degraded areas through the build-up of soil organic matter before harvest, relative abundances of C3 vs. C4 carbon in soils under a 25-y-old forest on Mt. Yegof have been studied based on changes in soil δ13C values due to vegetation cover changes by afforestation. At Yegof, shrub and tree leaves had δ13C value of -28.7 ± 0.4‰. The grasses showed a value of -30.7 ± 0.6‰ at 2700-3000 m asl (typical C3) and of -13.6 ± 0.3‰ at 2520 m asl (typical C4). Soil δ13C values were -21.7 ± 0.9‰ in soil at 0-5 cm and -20.7 ± 0.6‰ in soil at 30-50 cm indicating a long history of C4-dominated grass or cropland over the elevations sampled. The shifts towards lower δ13C values in soil at 0-5 cm coincide with 25 y of C3 vegetation. Carbon content in topsoil was 3.4-9.2% and in tree leaves was 45-56%. However, an estimate of new C3 carbon (54%) in 0-5 cm soil was low as compared with tropical rain-forest and savanna ecosystems suggesting a slow rate of carbon turnover at Yegof. The results suggest that degraded sites at Yegof may need further duration of forest cover longer than current rotation times of the forests to improve soil conditions and restore soil organic matter and carbon, which have been lost during the past land use. It is encouraging from the perspectives of ecological rehabilitation and soil conservation that a shift in the dominance from C4 vegetation types of agricultural and grassland ecosystems to C3 forest ecosystems could be established in less than 25 y on these highly degraded slopes of Mt.

At the country scale, only one species had a truly restricted geographical range, independent of habitat availability, but at a local scale, many species had uneven distributional gaps (36% present at < 50% of sites with suitable habitat). Among sites, abundance or incidence variability had no definite pattern. Frequency of occurrence in suitable patches decreased with increasing natural fragmentation of habitats.

The altitudinal differences between two data sets obtained in forests in temperate Denmark at sea level and in tropical Ecuador at 3000-3350 m above sea level provided a comparison suitable for examining whether high-altitude Andean forests are temperate or tropical from the standpoint of avian richness, abundance and trophic organization. Sampling methods at the two locations were similar. The Ecuadorian high-altitude sites were found to be significantly more species-rich than Danish temperate sites at all spatial scales studied (from point census to 10 km2). Additionally, species-area curves from the two countries displayed positive correlations, as expected, but with different rates of increase. The high-altitude Andean curve demonstrated a higher rate of increase causing the two curves to separate widely as more area was added. This means that when increasing areas are considered, proportionately more species squeeze into the Ecuadorian high-altitude forest landscape than do into the temperate Danish forest landscape. Corresponding to the data on richness, bird abundance was significantly higher at the Ecuadorian sites than at the Danish ones. The analysis of rank-abundance plots from Denmark and Ecuador throws light on the organization of bird species and abundance. The majority of communities in both countries fitted both the log-series and the log-normal models, making statistical distinction impossible. However, a visual inspection of the rank-ordered abundance distributions demonstrated that the Danish communities, in contrast to the Ecuadorian ones, had dominant species with relatively higher abundance, had more species with intermediate abundance, and had fewer species 'rare by abundance'. Some major food resources (especially fruit and nectar) exploited in high-altitude sites of Ecuador were not reliably available in temperate Denmark leading also to differences in the distribution of bird species within six major trophic categories.

Although all study plants were growing in close proximity on the same host tree species, there was remarkably little overlap in the species assemblages across epiphyte taxa. The inhabitant species also differed dramatically in their ecological functions, as feeding guild and hunting guild analyses indicated.

Ants foraging in the leaf litter of tropical wet forests experience unpredictably fluctuating food resources.

Of these colonies 16 were excavated to measure colony size, colony growth, and reproductive investment. These demographic variables were compared with two measures of home range quality: leaf litter dry weight and mass of arthropods. Home range areas of colonies were highly correlated with colony size, and moderately correlated with resource abundance. Colony growth was independent of colony size, as is found in other ants in unpredictable environments. The growth of colonies was closely associated with resource abundance. Production of the male reproductive caste was closely tied to the size of a colony rather than growth, but male production in slow-growing colonies was limited. Colonies foraging within high-quality environments grew at a faster rate, but reproduction was mainly correlated with colony size. Furthermore, it was found that the frequency of foragers in long-term treatment plots with supplemental food and reduced leaf-litter quality was not significantly different from the frequency of foragers in control plots.

From the known and hypothesized behaviour of vertebrate seed predators under various circumstances, we predicted that (1) overall seed loss should be higher under solitary trees, (2) peccaries should forage preferentially in groves, (3) the variance in the rate of seed removal should be higher in groves, (4) a greater fraction of the seeds removed from solitary palms should be scatterhoarded, and consequently, (5) greater numbers of seedlings should recruit near solitary palms than in groves. The first four of these predictions were confirmed and the last was rejected by the results. Peccaries preferred to forage in groves, and small rodents preferred to forage under solitary palms.

Its breeding biology is characterized by the production of functionally female, male and bisexual inflorescences. Staminate sterility is positively correlated with number of pistillate flowers. Staminate and pistillate flowers are receptive at anthesis. Bagging tests for apomixis were negative. Although geitonogamy can occasionally occur, outcrossing predominates. Pollen is relatively dry, but wind pollination is not a significant factor in cross pollination. Although inflorescences are visited by large numbers of insects, pollination is effected mainly by small sap beetles (Mystrops sp.) and weevils (Phyllotrox tatianae), which feed and breed in fertile staminate flowers. Pistillate flowers, which offer no reward to pollinators, appear to attract insect visitors by olfactory and visual imitation of staminate flowers, that is, via Bakerian mimicry. Flower production, fruit maturation, leaf production and leaf abscission occur continuously throughout the year. Flowering exhibits a distinct peak during the warmest months (Dec-Apr).

Kinabalu (Sabah, Malaysia) along two habitat gradients, ranging from primary rain forest to cultivated areas. During 135 nights' trapping in 1997, 4585 individuals representing 500 species were attracted by light. Primary forest samples and those from old-grown regenerated forest exhibited high diversity (Fisher's α = 75-128), while agricultural areas as well as most secondary forests had a significantly lower diversity (α = 34-61). One 15-y-old secondary forest with a rich undergrowth vegetation also housed a diverse geometrid community (α = 89). In three paired samples, diversity of geometrid moths in the canopy was equal to or lower than in the understorey. Of six habitat variables tested, only undergrowth plant species diversity emerged as a significant predictor of geometrid diversity. The NESS index, in combination with multi-dimensional scaling, was used to investigate patterns of between-habitat diversity. Of two dimensions extracted, one represented the degree of habitat disturbance, while the other separated the two study areas. Geometrid samples of strongly disturbed habitats did not converge between sites, indicating that apart from the degree of human interference the regional species pool was also important in determining similarity among local communities.",125,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Biodiversity | Canopy | Disturbance | Geometridae | Gradient | Herbivorous insects | Tropical rain forest | Understorey,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,55,NA,NA

In spite of the large proportion (93%) of seeds that are harvested, reasonable densities of recently emerged seedlings were found. Seeds of Bertholletia are contained in woody fruits that are primarily opened by agoutis. Most fruits are left untouched on the forest floor for 1-2 y before they are opened, possibly due to high energetic costs of fruit opening just after fruit fall. However, the proportion of viable seeds is strongly reduced in older fruits. Growth in diameter at breast height (dbh) was low for pole-sized trees (< 15 cm dbh) and adult trees (> 100 cm dbh) and peaked for intermediate-sized trees (30-60 cm). These trees often attained a growth rate of > 1.5 cm y-1, which is high compared with other non-pioneer tropical trees. This, and the strong growth response to increased light availability found for seedlings and saplings, suggest that Bertholletia excelsa can be classified as a gap-dependent species. Matrix population models were constructed for both study populations. Population growth rates (λ) were close to one, and were most sensitive to persistence in one size category. Age estimates revealed that age at first reproduction (at dbh > 60 cm) amounts to over 120 y, and age in the last category (dbh > 160 cm) to almost 300 y. Given the continuous rejuvenation of the population, the stable population size, the high age at maturity and the long reproductive period, it is concluded that current levels of Brazil nut extraction may be sustained at least for several decades and perhaps for even longer periods.",139,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Bertholletia excelsa | Bolivia | Brazil nuts | Demography | Matrix population model | Non-timber forest product | Seed extraction | Sustainable use | Tropical forest,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,56,all,All Open Access

In Costa Rica's Corcovado National Park, G. quadratus lives in fossorial populations with up to six crabs m-2 in coastal forest extending c. 600 m inland from the Pacific Ocean. A narrow transition zone (c. 30 m) separates the crab zone from the crabless zone that comprises the remainder of the 55 000-ha park. The composition of dicotyledonous plants from the adjacent zones were distinct: crabless zone transects (240 m2) contained 97 species representing 76 genera and 41 families; crab zone transects contained 46 species representing 38 genera and 25 families. Despite the narrow zonal separation, the crabless zone shared only 27.4, 29.9 and 52.8% of its species, genera and families, respectively, with the crab zone; in contrast, crab zone transects shared 56.5, 60.5 and 88% of their species, genera and families with the crabless zone. This abrupt diversity gradient suggests a powerful selection pressure in the crab zone preventing the establishment of certain dicotyledonous species. Two years of experimental crab exclusion suggested that G. quadratus reduces seedling density and diversity. Densities of seedlings (3-25 cm tall) within exclosures increased 144% over baseline values while control densities decreased. In contrast, seedlings at the cotyledon stage and taller (26-50 cm) were unaffected by crab exclusion. Preference tests conducted in the crab zone revealed a five-fold ratio of mortality rates for seedlings transplanted from the crabless zone and crab zone respectively. However, when protected from crabs, transplanted crabless and crab zone seedlings survived similarly well over 6 mo (83 and 70% respectively).

Host tree fruit type was correlated with the presence or absence of different liana types. Tendrillar and root-climbing lianas tended to occur most often on mid-sized, fleshy-fruited trees, and on smaller, non-fleshy-fruited trees. The presence of stem twining lianas tended to decrease with increasing tree diameter for both fleshy- and non-fleshy-fruited trees, although this effect was more pronounced for fleshy-fruited trees. In general, lianas were most prevalent on trees possessing intermediate levels of bark roughness and flakiness.

The timing of leaf fall in saplings was positively correlated with net radiation, and maximum and minimum temperature, but negatively correlated with relative humidity the preceding month, although these correlations were weak. The leaf production rate was larger under higher light, but the leaf fall rate was not related to the light regime of the saplings. Thus, leaf production was enhanced by the light availability for each individual, while leaf fall may have been enhanced by drought stress. Non-synchronous leaf production appears to be important for sapling growth, allowing saplings to occupy better-lit space quickly. On the other hand, tall trees showed a clear synchronous leaf-fall pattern, with an annual cycle, and no meteorological factors were correlated with the timing of leaf fall. Mature trees of this species produced flowers simultaneously with new leaves, after shedding their leaves.
