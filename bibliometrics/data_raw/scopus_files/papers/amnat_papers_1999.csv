Data from diverse taxa show that the age at metamorphosis becomes resource independent (i.e., fixed) at some point during the larval phase. Although existing models have been modified to incorporate a fixed rate of development, none predicts when phenotypic plasticity in metamorphic timing is lost. A graphical model is presented that extends knowledge of a genotype's optimal age and size at metamorphosis in different environments in which resources remain constant throughout the larval phase (i.e., the genotype's reaction norm) to predict when development rate becomes fixed in response to resource variability during the larval phase. Model predictions concur with data from food-switching experiments on anuran tadpoles and barnacle nauplii.

Changes in environmental conditions and relative number of foragers and receivers affect these delays as well as colony ergonomic efficiency. These delays are used in recruitment in both honeybees and Polybia wasps. This study investigates the distribution of queueing delays and the information content and quality of those delays using a stochastic-simulation model. Information quality increases with colony size. When the relative proportions of foragers and receivers are suboptimal, the group in excess has better information. Individuals can increase information quality of delays by two mechanisms: averaging over consecutive trips and averaging over multiple transfers within a trip where direct transfer occurs.

I used seed dispersal in Cakile edentula as a system in which to identify the mechanisms of environmentally mediated maternal effects and to determine how selection on maternal characters alters the adaptive value of dispersal. In C. edentula, maternal morphology responds to conspecific density experienced by the mother. Maternal morphology in turn affects offspring (seed) dispersal and density and thereby offspring morphology and fitness. I estimated the magnitude of density-mediated maternal effects on dispersal and identified their mechanism by characterizing the plasticity of maternal morphology to density. I also measured density-dependent selection on maternal characters that influence dispersal. Maternal plasticity to density was caused by both allometric and nonallometric variation in morphology, and this plasticity resulted in a negative correlation between maternal and progeny density. Such negative maternal effects are expected to retard responses to selection. Maternal morphology influenced maternal fitness, in part through the relationship of fitness to maternal plant size and in part through size-independent fitness effects. Maternal phenotypes that promote dispersal, and thereby increase progeny fitness, were associated with decreased maternal fitness.

Males actively defend sexually receptive females in many species in which females form dense aggregations during the breeding season. Across and within such species there is considerable variation in the mating tactics adopted by males, with males in some cases defending groups of females and in other cases sequentially consorting with individual females. Colonial blackbirds have been central to studying this mating system, and we develop a conceptual model for how courtship disruption may account for variation in male mating tactics in this group. Our model assumes that the frequency of disruptions increases with greater colony size. As a consequence, successful copulations are less likely to occur at large colonies than at small colonies, and males are expected to switch from defending multiple females at the colony to consorting individual females away from it. Results from two species of blackbird support the basic assumptions of this model. In one species, the Montezuma oropendola, disruptions occur rarely and males defend groups of females, whereas in the other species, the yellow-rumped cacique, disruptions are frequent and males defend single females. Moreover, consistent with a key prediction, within each species, males associated with small colonies remain at the colony and defend groups of females, whereas males spend little time defending groups of females at large colonies and rarely attempt copulations there.

At low productivity, strategy 1 is favored because the probability of growing to a size refuge is low compared to the probability of being eaten. Here, the system is consumer controlled, and predators have large effects on the food web. At high productivity, strategy 2 is favored because high food availability increases the probability of prey attaining size refuge before being eaten. Consequently, the system becomes less consumer controlled, and predators have weaker effects on food web dynamics.

Queueing delay decreases roughly exponentially with colony size because stochastic fluctuations in the arrival of individuals are lower in larger colonies. These results support empirical studies of Polybia occidentalis and other theoretical studies of honeybees. The effect of the relative number of individuals in the two subtask groups was also studied. There is a unique optimal ratio of the number of workers associated with each of the subtasks that simultaneously minimizes mean queueing delay and maximizes colony nectar-processing rate.

Assuming process error, we use four different models of population growth to generate snapshots of population dynamics via time series of the lengths commonly available to ecologists. We then ask to what extent we can identify which of several broad classes of population dynamics is evident in the time series snapshot. Along the way, we introduce the idea of 'variation thresholds', which are the maximum amount of process error that a population may withstand and still have a specified probability of surviving for a given length of time.

Analysis of the long-term data indicated that mortality, flowering, and growth were age and size dependent. Using mixed models, we estimated the variance about each of these relationships and also individual-specific effects. For the field populations, recruitment was the main density-dependent process, although there were weak effects of local density on growth and mortality. Using parameterized growth models, which assume plants grow along a deterministic trajectory, we predict plants should flower at sizes approximately 50% smaller than observed in the field. We then develop a simple criterion, termed the '1-yr look-ahead criterion,' based on equating seed production now with that of next year, allowing for mortality and growth, to determine at what size a plant should flower. This model allows the incorporation of variance about the growth function and individual-specific effects. The model predicts flowering at sizes approximately double that observed, indicating that variance about the growth curve selects for larger sizes at flowering. The 1-yr look-ahead approach is approximate because it ignores growth opportunities more than 1 yr ahead. To assess the accuracy of this approach, we develop a more complicated dynamic state variable model. Both models give similar results indicating the utility of the 1-yr look-ahead criterion. To allow for temporal variation in the model parameters, we used an individual-based model with a genetic algorithm. This gave very accurate prediction of the observed flowering strategies. Sensitivity analysis of the model suggested that temporal variation in the parameters of the growth equation made waiting to flower more risky, so selected for smaller sizes at flowering.

We used genetic correlations to test for the presence of three types of costs: a trade-off between tolerance and fitness in the absence of herbivore damage, a trade-off between tolerance and resistance, and genetic covariances among tolerance to different types of damage. We found no evidence that tolerance to apical meristem damage or tolerance to folivory was correlated with resistance, although these two types of tolerance were positively correlated with one another. Tolerance to both types of damage involved costs of lower fitness in the absence of herbivory. Selection acting on tolerance to either type of herbivory was not detected at natural levels of herbivory. Selection is expected to act against tolerance at reduced levels of herbivory and favor tolerance at elevated levels of herbivory.

Here, we first describe variation in the opportunity for selection in cohorts of Soay rams (Ovis aries) on the archipelago of St. Kilda, Scotland, that were born during years of varying population density. Variation in LBS is closely coupled with demography, as rams born in years of low density following population crashes enjoy greater LBS than do those born in high-density years. Paradoxically, the opportunity for selection was greatest in the largest cohorts, those born in years of high population density, owing to low juvenile breeding success and overwinter survival. Variation in longevity and the contribution of nonbreeders were the most important components of the total variance in LBS in cohorts born in years of high density, while variation in fecundity was more important in cohorts born in low-density years. The opportunity for sexual selection is thus stronger in cohorts born in low-density years, as many rams in these cohorts survive to compete for mates as adults in subsequent ruts. Variation in population density in the year of birth also influenced the intensity of selection. Individuals born in years of high population density underwent strong natural selection in favor of longer hindlimbs over their first winter. In contrast, in cohorts born in low-density years, there was no natural selection on hindlimb in the first year of life. Longer hindlimbs were associated with increased fecundity over the entire lifetime of individuals born in low-density years.

When several components of such a suite are beneficial, an important evolutionary question is whether all are adaptations or some are exaptations. The answer may depend on whether the traits arose in response to selection on variation in systemic levels of the hormone on variation in responsiveness of target tissues to invariant levels of the hormone. If the former, selection probably acted directly on fewer than all traits; beneficial traits arising indirectly would be exaptations. In contrast, multiple beneficial traits that arose out of independent changes in target-tissue sensitivity to invariant hormone levels could all be adaptations. Knowledge of specific hormonal mechanisms as well as of historical selective regimes will be necessary to draw such distinctions. Endocrine constraints on evolution can be studied experimentally by applying hormones systemically and measuring interdependent responses of beneficial and detrimental traits to selection (phenotypic engineering with hormones). Supposing that alteration of one trait in isolation would enhance fitness, cases in which the net effect of endocrine alteration of multiple traits is to depress fitness provide evidence for constraints.

Females should advance estrus when preferred males are available and delay estrus when only nonpreferred males are available. However, ovulation in some female mammals can be induced by the presence of males. Female estrus could then be either a result of a better stimulus provided by the preferred male or simply manipulation of estrus by the female to reflect her preference. Evidence is therefore required that female estrus coincides with the availability of preferred mating partners, that females actively choose among males, that avoidance of nonpreferred males results in a cost, and that nonpreferred males are in fact capable of reproduction. We observed two experimental groups of fallow deer, one with only socially mature males, and one with subadult but physiologically mature males. Females with mature males conceived earlier (13 of 15 gave birth) than females with subadult males. The former also conceived earlier than they did in the previous year, whereas the latter conceived later (13 of 14 gave birth) than in the previous year. Females avoided subadults more than mature males, and they lost more weight than females with mature males. Because subadult males are capable of reproduction, females not reproducing with them incur two costs: energetic loss and delayed reproduction. Given these costs, we suggest that females receive a benefit from not responding to the advances of young males that would outweigh these costs.

In particular, random fluctuations in the proportion of males and females and the way they pair for reproduction (i.e., the social mating system) are usually neglected. To assess the potential importance of demographic stochasticity to the extinction process, a two-sex model with an explicit mating system was built. Extinction probabilities computed via Monte Carlo simulation were compared to real data, the case of passerines introduced to New Zealand a century ago. This minimal model of extinction allowed assessment of the importance of the mating system in the colonization process. Monogamous mating led to a higher extinction risk than did polygynous mating.

For species in which females are the sole incubator, males can potentially affect this trade-off and increase nest attentiveness by feeding incubating females on the nest (incubation feeding). Increased nest attentiveness may be required when local microclimate conditions are harsh and thereby require greater incubation feeding (microclimate hypothesis). Alternatively, incubation feeding may be constrained by risk of attracting nest predators (nest predation hypothesis), which in turn may constrain female nest attentiveness because of energy limitation. We show that incubation feeding rates are much greater among cavity-nesting than among coexisting open-nesting birds. Under the microclimate hypothesis, the greater incubation feeding rates of cavity-nesting birds generate the prediction that microclimate should be harsher than for open-nesting birds. Our results reject this hypothesis because we found the opposite pattern; cavity-nesting birds experienced more moderate (less variable) microclimates that were less often below temperatures (i.e., 16°C) that can negatively impact eggs compared with open-nesting species. In contrast, incubation feeding rates were highly negatively correlated with nest predation both within and between the two nest types, supporting the nest predation hypothesis.

The second procedure is simpler and more frequently used in the literature and produces estimates of extinction rates that are similar to the first, more complex procedure. We then determined the relationship between extinction rates (calculated using both methods) and body mass, longevity, habitat specialization, and population abundance using two methods: first, by accounting for the phylogenetic relationships among species and, second, by ignoring them. Only population abundance and habitat specialization explained a significant amount of the observed variation in species extinction rates.

Similarly, Tamiasciurus alters the evolutionary trajectories of large-seeded pines, many of which rely on birds (Corvidae) for their seed dispersal. Populations therefore exhibit a selection mosaic with coevolutionary hot spots. In the coevolutionary hot spots, divergent selection on crossbills potentially leads to reproductive isolation and speciation. This results in a subsequent reduction in the geographic mosaic but diversifies the adaptive landscape on which crossbills have radiated. Thus, divergent selection is a double-edged sword.

Here we provide a critical review of the studies on MHC-dependent mating preferences in mice, sheep, and humans and the possible functions of this behavior. There are three adaptive hypotheses for MHC dependent mating preferences. First, MHC-disassortative mating preferences produce MHC-heterozygous offspring that may have enhanced immunocompetence. Although this hypothesis is not supported by tests of single parasites, MHC heterozygotes may be resistant to multiple parasites. Second, we propose that MHC dependent mating preferences enable hosts to provide a 'moving target' against rapidly evolving parasites that escape immune recognition (the Red Queen hypothesis). Such parasites are suspected to drive MHC diversity through rare-allele advantage. Thus, the two forms of parasite-mediated selection thought to drive MHC diversity, heterozygote and rare allele advantage, will also favor MHC-dependent mating preferences.

These behaviors are generated from simulation of biased diffusion that operates at multiple scales simultaneously, formalizing ideas of multiple-scale foraging behavior. It uses probabilistic bias to represent decisions, allowing multiple search goals to be combined (e.g., foraging and social goals) and the representation of suboptimal behavior. By allowing bias to arise at multiple scales within the environment, each weighted relative to the others, the model can represent different scales of simultaneous decision-making and scale-dependent behavior. The model also allows different constraints to be applied to the animal's ability (e.g., applying food-patch accessibility and information limits).

Part of the problem is the difficulty of formally including rare long-distance dispersal events in spread models. In this article, we explore the process of making predictions about plant migration rates. In particular, we examine the links between data, statistical models, and ecological predictions. We fit mixtures of Weibull distributions to several dispersal data sets and show that statistical and biological criteria for selecting the most appropriate statistical model conflict. Fitting a two-component mixture model to the same data increases the spread-rate prediction by an average factor of 4.5. Data limit our ability to fit more components. Using simulations, we show that a small proportion (0.001) of seeds moving long-distances (1-10 km) can lead to an order of magnitude increase in predicted spread rate. The analysis also suggests that most existing data sets on dispersal will not resolve the problem; more effort needs to be devoted to collecting data on long-distance dispersal. Although dispersal had the strongest effect on the predicted spread rate, we showed that dispersal interacts strongly with plant life history, disturbance, and habitat loss in influencing the predicted rate of spread.

One important factor affecting sperm competition in internally fertilizing organisms is the mating frequency of females, since it determines the extent of competition between ejaculates. In simultaneous hermaphrodites, energy spent on sperm has to be traded off against energy expended on ova production. By extending an existing model, we consider how the number of matings affects sperm competition and, thus, sex allocation in internally fertilizing simultaneous hermaphrodites. We then go on to explore the consequences of two common characteristics of hermaphroditic mating systems, namely, sperm digestion and reciprocal insemination. Since sperm digestion reduces the competitive ability of a given ejaculate, it selects for increased sperm investment. As a result, the amount of sperm digested and male allocation can enter a coevolutionary cycle in which both will increase up to the point of equal investment in male and female gametes and in high rates of digestion. Because of this high degree of sperm digestion, fitness through the male function becomes more dependent on the amount of resources invested in sperm than on the number of matings. As a result, sperm digestion reduces Bateman's principle. Hence, hermaphrodites with sperm digestion should be less likely to display traits that increase the number of matings. Once ejaculates are large and costly, animals insisting on reciprocal sperm transfer will be favored since they receive some compensation for their investment. Under reciprocity, an even higher investment in sperm is favored.

Testing a phylogeny for asymmetry requires a null model; the most accepted to date is the Markov (random branching) model, which assumes that speciation is instantaneous and that all species have an equal and independent chance of speciation. Such assumptions result in a high probability of asymmetric trees (which makes tests of asymmetry weak) and may be unrealistic. Subsequent modification of this model incorporated parameters conforming to diversification by peripheral-isolates speciation, producing trees that were more symmetric than those generated under the Markov model. Our reanalysis of these data, and remodeling with a greater number of replicates, shows that differences between the original Markov and modified models may have been exaggerated: different measures show that initial increases in tree symmetry under peripheral-isolates speciation are transient; symmetry on small scales actually decreases when the process of speciation requires a significant fraction of the average time between speciation events. The peripheral-isolates mode of speciation is compared with a vicariant mode, which shows steadily increasing symmetry on all scales.

First we show how to derive a fitness function in the context of a seasonal environment. Model parameters are estimated from field data in order to derive quantitative predictions. Since little is known about constraints on sex ratio control in birds, we analyze three scenarios, each corresponding to a different strategy set. We consider a model without constraints on sex ratio control, a model where the sex ratio trend is constrained to be linear, and a mechanistic model incorporating a plausible mechanism of sex ratio control in birds. One of the models yields an ESS sex ratio trend that closely resembles the trend observed in the field. However, the predictions are very sensitive to the choice of strategy set.

We develop an incentive-based evolutionary stable strategy model of reproductive skew in three-member groups, in which subordinates may vary in their opportunities for independent reproduction, their contribution to group productivity, and in their relatedness both to the dominant and to one another. Our model demonstrates that the conclusions of two-member models cannot all be generalized to larger groups. For example, relatedness among group members can influence whether or not the dominant does best to offer staying incentives to subordinates in a three-member, but not a two-member, group. Both the degree of skew and group stability depend on the relatedness between subordinates as well as on the relatedness of each to the dominant, and the incentives that each individual subordinate receives are influenced by the traits of the other.

Here we follow the movement of the copulating male's ejaculate through the female's reproductive tract using males labeled with different radioisotopes. We find that males ejaculate into the bursa copulatrix and that male-1 sperm are displaced from the spermathecae during copulation. The increase in male-2 ejaculate in the spermathecae matches the pattern of male-2 fertilization gain, indicating that only spermathecal sperm are utilized at fertilization. Previously we have analyzed this system with a direct model of sperm displacement in which the male displaces rival sperm from the spermathecae. The data, and morphology of the female, clearly preclude such a mechanism. Here we contrast this model with a new indirect model, in which the female facilitates displacement by exchange of sperm from the bursa copulatrix to the spermathecae. The two models give equivalent fits to the observed sperm utilization patterns because the rate of sperm transfer into the bursa copulatrix greatly exceeds the rate of sperm exchange with the spermathecae so that the concentration of the first male's sperm in the bursa remains considerably lower than that of the second male.

Performance limits were measured by noninvasively challenging birds with two strenuous forms of flight: hovering in low-density gas mixtures (a lift assay for the capacity to generate vertical force) and fast forward flight in a wind tunnel (a thrust assay for the capacity to generate horizontal force). Functional capacities during hovering were measured by simultaneously collecting metabolic data using respirometry and information on wing-beat kinematics for aerodynamic analysis. Intraspecific differences in flight capacity, presumably reflecting diverse selective forces because of sexual dimorphism, migration, and plumage renewal, were then compared. Birds with shorter wings (adult males) or with increased body weight displayed a reduced hovering capacity, although their maximum flight speed was unaffected by such morphological changes. Birds undergoing molt of their flight feathers exhibited a diminished performance during both hovering and forward flight. Hovering capacities in relation to variation in wing morphologY and body mass were congruent with aerodynamic predictions, whereas performance capacities in fast forward flight differed from theoretical models. Kinematically, hovering hummingbirds operate within a narrow range of wing-beat frequencies, and modulation of aerodynamic forces and mechanical power is achieved primarily through variation in wing-stroke amplitude. Although differing in hovering performance, both sexes of nonmolt birds demonstrate similar mechanical and metabolic capacities, whereas molting inflicts high energetic costs.

Because of this, social selection has been described as a process distinct from other forms of natural selection. Social selection has been predicted to result in different evolutionary dynamics for interacting phenotypes, including rapid or extreme evolution and evolution of altruism. Despite the critical role that social selection plays in theories of social evolution, few studies have measured the force of social selection or the conditions under which this force changes. Here we present a model of social selection acting on interacting phenotypes that can be evaluated independently from the genetics of interacting phenotypes. Our model of social selection is analogous to covariance models of other forms of selection. We observe that an opportunity for social selection exists whenever individual fitness varies as a result of interactions with conspecifics. Social selection occurs, therefore, when variation in fitness due to interactions covaries with traits, resulting in a net force of selection acting on the interacting phenotypes. Thus, there must be a covariance between the phenotypes of the interactants for social selection to exist. This interacting phenotype covariance is important because it measures the degree to which a particular trait covaries with the selective environment provided by conspecifics. A variety of factors, including nonrandom interactions, behavioral modification during interactions, relatedness, and indirect genetic effects may contribute to the covariance of interacting phenotypes, which promotes social selection. The independent force of social selection (measured as a social selection gradient) can be partitioned empirically from the force of natural selection (measured by the natural selection gradient) using partial regression.

Inequality is a ubiquitous property of economic interaction among responsive, metabolizing entities. The prevailing party tends to be larger, to have a higher productivity or metabolism, to engage in a larger number of interactions, and to perform more functions at a higher level. The crucial economic consequence of inequality is that prevailing entities and the conditions they create disproportionately influence the economy as a whole. This leads to a pervasive increase in energy flux, both globally and per capita, among economic dominants, observable in the history of life as well as in the development of the human economy. Unpredictable disturbances such as mass extinctions temporarily reverse this trend. Comparative studies of the biotas of islands and of large land masses point to limitations on the evolution of energy-intensive dominants. Because entities with a large economic domain typically restrict rather than eliminate subordinates, the trend toward increasing energy flux will rarely be expressed within individual clades.

As a result, the floras of China and the United States are different nonrandom samples of the floras of the North Temperate Zone and the world.

The two subclass-level groups that are more diverse in the United States have primarily temperate affinities and are relatively young phylogenetically. We conclude that the patterns of diversity of Chinese and U.S. vascular plants have been influenced by the longer and more open access of temperate eastern Asia to tropical regions, the presence in southern China of a larger area of subtropical climate with complex topography, and the reduced impact of late Tertiary climate cooling in eastern Asia compared to North America. The greatest differences in diversity occur among older groups having stronger tropical affinities and, perhaps, originating in eastern Asia. In the North American flora, these groups appear to be disproportionately small relicts of a formerly widespread 'boreotropical flora' that was relatively homogeneous at the genus level across the Bering Land Bridge between eastern Asia and North America. Groups that arose and diversified later, and that have fewer genera in common between Asian and North American floras, particularly the euasterids II, were better adapted to the cooler and drier climates of the Neogene temperate latitudes and evidently were relatively unaffected by late Neogene glaciations.

Greater longevity can impair the fitness of host organisms subject to pathogen attack, by reducing the mortality rate of infected hosts and thus creating a larger and more persistent reservoir of disease, from which infection can spread to the healthy population. Where longer-lived and shorter-lived hosts can infect one another (and thus all share the same risk of infection), selection will favor longer-lived individuals, to the detriment of the host population as a whole. But in metapopulations, selection can favor shorter-lived hosts that are otherwise identical to their longer-lived competitors, because the populations in which they occur will have lower incidence of disease. Under some conditions, shorter-lived hosts can even invade metapopulations of longer-lived hosts, displacing them and driving them to extinction. Our results support three general propositions. First, an organism's life-history traits, and not just its resistance genes, can affect its risk of pathogen attack. Second, pathogen-mediated selection may therefore influence the evolution of host life-history traits that are unrelated to resistance, per se.

Motivated by the problem of senescence, researchers have applied this approach to genes thought to affect survival through processes of somatic maintenance. Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase and catalase reduce the flux of reactive oxygen molecules that are thought to be a central cause of aging. EF1α is a component of the protein synthesis machine; deterioration of this housekeeping function is a potential contributor to senescence. Molecular chaperones such as the heat shock protein hsp70 are multifunctional molecules that affect a cell's response to acute stress. In some models, senescence results from the cumulative effects of stress, and heat shock proteins may regulate the progress of this deterioration. Transformations with the candidate genes of these proteins were used in independent studies to measure the effect of overexpression on longevity; positive results were reported. Here, I discuss the robustness of these results. I use the studies of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and EF1α to illustrate how the mutagenic effects of inserts confound our interpretations.

Lifetime reproductive success of experimentally size-altered progeny was studied to address the offspring number and offspring quality trade-off. Causes of natural selection on adult reproductive costs were assessed with three complementary manipulations of clutch size, egg size, and total clutch mass. Selective trade-offs between offspring size and number arose from two opposing episodes of directional selection. Fecundity selection favored female parents that laid large clutches of small offspring, but fecundity selection was balanced by survival selection that favored large offspring. Thus, the offspring number and quality tradeoff had a strong stabilizing effect on mean egg size across generations. However, strength and direction of selection arising from adult reproductive costs varied among years. Because reproductive traits were heritable (h2 = 0.61), selection on adult reproduction led to a large evolutionary response to natural selection.

Investigation of the thermal environment of Drosophila larvae in the wild and natural Hsp70 expression establishes an ecological context for the candidate gene.

To support the hypothesis, it is necessary to demonstrate that the phenotype induced in each relevant environment confers high fitness in that environment, relative to alternative phenotypes. Unfortunately, such tests are difficult to perform because plasticity prevents the expression of 'inappropriate' phenotypes within each environment. Genetic and physiological manipulation can be used very effectively to extend the range of phenotypes within environments and thus provide powerful tools for testing the adaptive plasticity hypothesis. The expression of specific genes involved in cue perception or signal transduction can be altered by mutation or the introduction of transgenes, thus altering the plastic response of an organism to environmental cues. It is also possible to alter the cue itself or to manipulate the developmental response physiologically so as to obtain alternative phenotypes. The relative fitness of these alternative phenotypes can then be measured in each relevant environment. However, these techniques will be most useful when combined with techniques such as phenotypic selection analysis to identify the specific traits under selection in natural populations. We illustrate these approaches using phytochrome-mediated 'shade avoidance' responses in plants as a model system.

A largely unappreciated aspect of such decision making, however, is that it may be fundamentally driven by the very thing that allows it to be so readily studied: temporal variation in risk. We show theoretically that temporal variability in risk leaves animals with the problem of allocating feeding and antipredator efforts across different risk situations. Our analysis suggests that an animal should exhibit its greatest antipredator behavior in high-risk situations that are brief and infrequent. An animal should also allocate more antipredator effort to high-risk situations and more feeding to low-risk situations, with an increase in the relative degree of risk in high-risk situations. However, the need to feed leaves an animal with little choice but to decrease its allocation of antipredator effort to high-risk situations as they become more frequent or lengthy; here, antipredator effort in low-risk situations may drop to low levels as an animal allocates as much feeding as possible to brief periods of low risk. These conclusions hold under various scenarios of interrupted feeding, state-dependent behavior, and stochastic variation in risk situations. Our analysis also suggests that a common experimental protocol, in which prey animals are maintained under low risk and then exposed to a brief 'pulse' of high risk, is likely to overestimate the intensity of antipredator behavior expected under field situations or chronic exposure to high risk.",1011,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Antipredator behavior | Decision making | Foraging behavior | Predation risk | Vigilance,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,100,NA,NA

Life-history theory predicts that trade-offs in reproductive effort should be influenced by adult survival. We used a dynamic programming approach to address how level of paternity, ability to assess paternity, and adult survival rate interact to affect male tolerance of reduced parentage in a given brood. Adult survival has the greatest influence on male decisions such that, for any given cost of reproduction and value of male care, tolerance of extrapair fertilizations (EPFs) decreases as adult survival increases. An unexpected result of these models is that an optimal response also depends on a male's ability to predict probability of parentage (i.e., uncertainty).

Nevertheless, when both predators and prey choose patches in an ideal free way, sufficiently aggregated distributions will only arise if patch quality (e.g., reflected in prey fecundity) is very heterogeneous. This requirement profoundly limits the possibilities for simultaneous population dynamical and evolutionary stability. However, stability is not necessary for coexistence. Under cyclic or chaotic dynamics, the rate at which species change their distributions becomes important. Here we consider two endpoints of a continuum of rates. The first is 'rigid' selection of patch types based on the expected long-term distribution of conditions. The second is 'flexible' selection based on current conditions. We carried out systematic surveys of the population-level consequences of coevolutionarily stable patch-selection strategies for different combinations of rigid and flexible strategies of predator and prey. First, if both prey and predators have rigid strategies, the evolutionary end result is either a stable population dynamical equilibrium or diverging cycles eventually leading to extinction. Second, for the case with rigid prey and flexible predators, the persistence boundary in parameter space is shifted from the boundaries obtained for rigid predators. The mechanism underlying persistence is different in that the flexible strategies of the predators destabilize the equilibrium, while the evolutionary response of the rigid prey leads to reduced cycles. Third, if both prey and predators are flexible, simulations lead either to chaotic fluctuations or to extinction (but not to stable equilibria, nor to limit cycles), and the conditions for coexistence are much wider than those under rigid patch selection. These simulations suggest that information constraints on adaptive patch choice have a major impact on predator-prey persistence under nonequilibrium conditions.

At such balanced polymorphisms, heterozygotes remain at appreciable frequencies over long periods of time, allowing extensive modification of dominance to occur. The strength of selection favoring a modifier of dominance is roughly proportional to the probability that a modifier allele is found in a heterozygote at the locus subject to balancing selection times the heterozygote fitness increase caused by the modifier. Using a two-locus model, we elucidate the interesting ways in which recombination and migration cause departures from this rough expectation. For example, with overdominance, a genetic association with the rarest allele favors a modifier that increases heterozygote fitness because the modifier occurs more often in heterozygotes. With migration-selection balance, dominance evolves more readily in patches experiencing the strongest selection. We also find that, while there are more heterozygotes in sink populations (which have higher rates of immigration than emigration), selection for dominance in sink and source populations is nearly equal because sink populations make a lower genetic contribution to future generations.

The model allows us to make a number of predictions concerning the egg types that should be rejected in different circumstances: egg rejection should increase as the parasitism rate increases and egg mimicry deteriorates; host females' erroneous ejection of their own eggs should be expected for intermediate levels of egg mimicry but not for very good or very poor mimicry; host females would benefit most from learning to recognize their own eggs when individual variability in egg characteristics is much lower than the population variability; and, when egg mimicry is poor or individual variability is very low, females should attempt to imprint on the first egg they lay, before they can be parasitized, but, when mimicry is good and individual variability is relatively high, females must use an extended learning phase.

The habitat breadth hypothesis postulates that species whose performance is less affected by substrate will use a greater variety of habitats than species whose performance varies to a greater extent on surfaces of different diameters. Field observations quantified the proportion of time that lizards spent on different perch diameters.

In two very different families of distributions, all indices except three give higher values for more unequal distributions of resources, although some of them are poor at distinguishing between similar inequality values. When applied correctly by testing against a null hypothesis of no inequality among individuals, most indices can therefore be used to detect deviations from randomness, but with varying ease as most lack statistical tables and rely on resampling techniques instead. As an example to test the performance of the 21 indices, we used each index to analyze 71 data sets of unequal mating success in leks. In pairwise comparisons, 24% of the indices fail to show a positive intercorrelation. This reflects differences in how indices incorporate variation in the number of competitors and mean acquisition of the resource. All indices are sensitive to these aspects if inequality is measured in data arising from different distributions. These results illustrate the general conclusion that a unique 'best' solution is not available; each measure presents its own definition of inequality. The choice of an inequality index requires specifying the null expectations and interpreting deviating values in relation to the biological question being addressed.

The model is built after classical metapopulation models but is applied to competition for space between individuals and includes immigration by a propagule rain and an extinction threshold for rare species. Our model shows that immigration can have a huge effect on local species diversity in competitive communities where competition for space would lead to the exclusion of all but one species if the community were closed. Local species richness is expected to increase strongly when immigration intensity increases beyond the threshold required for the successful establishment of one or a few individuals. Community structure and species relative abundances are also expected to change markedly with immigration intensity. Increasing immigration causes total space occupation by the community to increase but primary productivity on average to either decrease or stay constant with increasing diversity, depending on the relation between immigration and local reproduction rates.

In this article, we describe methods for overcoming the problem, illustrated by a field study of balsam fir. We used serial correlation and a permutation test to detect growth costs of reproduction and show how these translate into demographic costs when relative tree size (and therefore growth) is critical to survival. Using chronosequences, we reconstructed the age- and size-specific dynamics of a subalpine population of Abies balsamea. A matrix model describing these dynamics was then used to estimate age- and size-specific probabilities of future survival to maturity (Z(ix)). By using a regression model of the relationship between tree size, age, and Z(ix), we were able to estimate the maximum age-specific demographic cost of reproduction for trees of all ages.

We investigated the trade-off between egg size and fecundity in Drosophila melanogaster by examining both the phenotypic and genetic relationships between these traits after artificial selection for large and small eggs, relative to female body size. Egg size responded strongly to selection in both directions, increasing in the large-egg selected lines and decreasing in the small-egg selected lines. Phenotypic correlations between egg size and fecundity in the large-egg selected lines were negative, but no relationship between these traits occurred in either the control or small-egg selected lines. There was no negative genetic correlation between egg size and fecundity. Total reproductive allocation decreased in the small-egg selected lines but did not increase in the large-egg lines. Our results have three implications. First, our selection procedure may have forced females selected for large eggs into a physiological trade-off not reflected in a negative genetic correlation between these traits. Second, the lack of a negative genetic correlation between egg size and number suggests that the phenotypic trade-off frequently observed between egg size and number in other organisms may not evolve over the short term via a direct genetic trade-off whereby increases in egg size are automatically accompanied by decreased fecundity.

If such costs are sex independent, then two stable equilibria coexist (male or female philopatry), with symmetric domains of attraction. Which sex disperses is determined entirely by history, genetic drift, and gene flow. An asymmetry in costs makes one domain of attraction extend at the expense of the other. In such a case, the dispersing sex might also be, paradoxically, the one that incurs the higher dispersal costs. As asymmetry increases, one equilibrium eventually disappears, which may result in a sudden evolutionary shift in the identity of the dispersing sex. Our results underline the necessity to control for phylogenetic relationships (e.g., through the use of independent-comparisons methods) when investigating empirical trends in dispersal.

One possibility is that recombination increases the frequency of advantageous genotypes that are disproportionately rare because of fluctuating epistasis. However, for this mechanism to work, epistasis for fitness must fluctuate over a very narrow timescale: two to five generations. Alternatively, recombination may speed up the response to directional selection by breaking up linkage disequilibria that decrease additive genetic variance. Here we analyze the results of a numerical simulation of host-parasite coevolution to assess the importance of these two mechanisms. We find that linkage disequilibria may tend to increase, rather than decrease, additive genetic variance. In addition, the sign of epistasis changes every two to five generations under several of the parameter values investigated, and epistasis and linkage disequilibrium are frequently of opposite signs. These results are consistent with the idea that selection for recombination is mediated by fluctuating epistasis.

Consistent with our predictions, lutein plasma concentration was negatively correlated with gamma-globulin plasma levels and concentration of selected leukocyte types in peripheral blood, suggesting that, to exert immune function, carotenoids are taken up from plasma, thus becoming unavailable for epigamic signaling. The coloration of red feathers of the throat of adult males was positively related to plasma concentration of lutein, but not with immunologic variables, consistent with the idea that more brightly colored males do not pay a larger immunological cost for their coloration compared with less brightly colored males.

However, hypocotyl length per dry mass did increase, more so in smaller-seeded species. Thus, part of the hypocotyl elongation was because of increased water content, which would increase vulnerability to loss of turgor. There was also reallocation of dry matter from root to hypocotyl, again more so in smaller-seeded species, which would decrease anchorage strength and increase vulnerability to soil drying. Results were very similar when considered as correlated evolutionary divergences, compared to the cross-species patterns.

One view, the Archezoa hypothesis, proposes that the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria occurred relatively late in eukaryotic evolution and that several mitochondrion-lacking protist groups diverged before the establishment of the organelle. Phylogenies based on small subunit ribosomal RNA and several protein-coding genes supported this proposal, placing amitochondriate protists such as diplomonads, parabasalids, and Microsporidia as the earliest diverging eukaryotic lineages. However, trees of other molecules, such as tubulins, heat shock protein 70, TATA box-binding protein, and the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, indicate that Microsporidia are not deeply branching eukaryotes but instead are close relatives of the Fungi. Furthermore, recent discoveries of mitochondrion-derived genes in the nuclear genomes of entamoebae, Microsporidia, parabasalids, and diplomonads suggest that these organisms likely descend from mitochondrion-bearing ancestors. Although several protist lineages formally remain as candidates for Archezoa, most evidence suggests that the mitochondrial endosymbiosis took place prior to the divergence of all extant eukaryotes. In addition, discoveries of proteobacterial-like nuclear genes coding for cytoplasmic proteins indicate that the mitochondrial symbiont may have contributed more to the eukaryotic lineage than previously thought. As genome sequence data from parabasalids and diplomonads accumulate, it is becoming clear that the last common ancestor of these protist taxa and other extant eukaryotic groups already possessed many of the complex features found in most eukaryotes but lacking in prokaryotes. However, our confidence in the deeply branching position of diplomonads and parabasalids among eukaryotes is weakened by conflicting phylogenies and potential sources of artifact.

In addition, the presence of mitochondrial genes in the nucleus of several amitochondrial flagellates raises doubts about them being primordially amitochondrial. Consequently, the root of the eukaryote tree is still in question.
