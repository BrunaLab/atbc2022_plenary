Numerous unsuccessful attempts have been made to explain the adaptive value of this visually striking phenomenon. In the humid tropics, fungal attack is a potentially important source of mortality for expanding young leaves. We propose that the anthocyanins responsible for the red coloration of young leaves may play a protective role against invasions by leaf-attacking fungal pathogens. Fungus-growing leaf cutting ants (Atta columbica Guerin) were used in choice tests because they are known to select against leaves or chemicals containing fungicidal properties. In feeding trials with leaf discs from 20 common species, ant preference decreased significantly with increasing anthocyanin content. In feeding trials with pure anthocyanin (3,3',4',5,7-pentahydroxyflavylium chloride) presented on oat flakes, ants again showed a significant dosage dependent preference. This suggests that even low concentrations of anthocyanins may be harmful to the fungal colonies of ants. Additional work on the effects of anthocyanin on leaf-attacking fungi is encouraged. © 1989, Entomological Society of Canada. All rights reserved.",NSF,National Science Foundation

Males defended sunlit spots along the stream between 1030 h and 1400 h central standard time each day and females visiting these sunlit spots were soon mated. By individually marking all mature adults in the population we found that there was no significant difference between the sexes in daily survival rates (0.85 for males and 0.86 for females). Lifetime mating success was positively correlated with longevitiy in both males and females but the ability of males to obtain a mate appeared to be independent of age. Although the sex ratio at emergence was 1:1, that of mature adults at the stream was strongly male-biased (87% male), perhaps as a result of a longer or more risky prereproductive period in females related to the costs of egg formation. We argue that the strongly male-biased sex ratio has important effects on the mating system of this species in that the male contact-guards the female for the entire oviposition period each day. Although this limits each male to mating with one female per day, it probably ensures that the male will fertilize most of the eggs laid by the female that day. © 1989, Cambridge University Press.

Monocotyledons and dicotyledons predominated in the diet in the dry season, with seeds and insects increasing in the diet in the rainy season. The major differences between the ecology of Arvicanthis at Kano and on the East African savanna were that in East Africa the breeding season is longer and begins after the start of the rainy season.

Mean annual rainfall is 1500 mm, with a strong seasonality. Two cohorts of seedlings of Andropogon semiberbis were tagged and monitored for up to three years. Several variables such as survivorship, plant size, seedling density, fire damage and distance to the nearest adult were measured or estimated. Two burning experiments to measure survivorship before and after fire, and two seedling-growth experiments to assess competitive interference from adult plants of three grass species were performed. The highest mortality takes place during the dry season and is due to fire. This decreases as the plants get bigger due to increasing structural complexity of the clump by growth which gives added protection to the meristems. Other mortality factors such as desiccation, uprooting and shading seem to be important during the wet season, when mortality rate is relatively constant. Survivorship during the first year and after three years is strongly correlated to the size attained by the end of the first growing season. Seedling densities are rather low and do not seem to play any role in survivorship in this population. Adult interference with seedling growth decreases with distance and seems to be due to root competition, although there is a tendency toward increased foliage interference related to the canopy structure of adult plants. © 1989, Cambridge University Press.

Ammoniacal nitrogen, total nitrogen and sulphate-sulphur were determined during four weeks in May 1983. Concentrations of all elements rose dramatically during the exceptionally severe dry season of 1977 which may have caused accession rates for some nutrients to be overestimated (i.e. compared to a year with ‘normal’ rainfall) by about 10%. Results are explained in terms of prevailing wind directions and proximity to, or absence of, particular solute sources, such as the ocean, volcanoes or eroding lands. Most elements exhibited intermediate concentrations when compared with data for other humid tropical locations; sodium and perhaps nitrogen were on the low side and pH on the high side of the spectrum. Annual accession rates at the study site were considerable by pan-tropical standards, mainly as a result of high rainfall totals. Comparing accession rates with 25-year-average nutrient immobilization rates in stemwood of local plantations of Pinus merkusii Jungh. et de Vr. and Agathis dammara Warb. showed atmospheric inputs of magnesium and potassium to be high enough (theoretically) to account for losses of these elements in stemwood removal.

To describe the vegetational variations within a cerrado in southern Mato Grosso state (15° 21' S, 55° 49' W), a 1 ha transect was located to pass through an interfluvial cerrado and climb a steep talus slope. The vegetational and environmental variations are described by means of field classification, direct gradient analysis and reciprocal averaging ordination. The effects of differences in ground water regime in the interfluvial cerrado and differences in inclination with associated rockiness in the talus cerrado are related to the vegetational variations. As the soils are very similar in texture and in the majority of chemical properties, the role of the above environmental factors was more easily distinguished.

A total of 461 birds (37 species/12 families) were recorded at swarms of E. burchelli and 208 birds (34 species/10 families) were recorded at L praedator swarms. The mean number of bird species detected per swarm was 7.2 at E. burchelli raids and 5.6 at L. praedator raids. Red-throated ant-tanagers (Habia fuscicauda) were most frequently seen at the swarms of both army-ant species. Other important species were the golden-crowned warbler (Basileuterus culicivorus), the white-breasted wood wren (Henicorhina leucosticta) and the Kentucky warbler (Oporornis formosus). Swarms of both army-ant species were active year-round. Birds weighing between 20 and 40 g dominated perches closest to the ground and the central zone of the swarms, richest in animal prey.

Red crabs removed 30-50% of the leaf-fall at the experimental sites during the study. Differences in leaf-fall mass between crab-access and exclusion quadrats were positively correlated with the density of foraging red crabs. Red crabs also generated spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of litter on the forest floor by returning litter to their burrows. Leaves lined chambers of 64% of excavated burrows and litter biomass around the entrances was significantly greater than that on off-burrow locations. This was reflected in the significantly higher concentrations of organic matter and nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Na, and Mg) associated with soils near burrow entrances.

Fruit bats (Pteropodidae) reached their greatest local densities in agricultural areas, and were least abundant in montane mossy forest. The fruit bats found to be common in agricultural areas are widespread in Southeast Asia: In contrast, species that were most common in forested areas are Philippine endemics. Fruit bat abundance was greater on the oceanic island than on the land-bridge island. Trappable small mammals (families Soricidae and Muridae) showed no change in species richness with increasing elevation, but did show a gradual increase in overall abundance. Even though the oceanic island was depauperate of non-volant mammal species, it had the higher abundance of non-volant mammal individuals; however, this may have been due primarily to differences associated with the elevation of sampling sites. Murid rodents at the higher elevations on Leyte tend to be those that are members of the old endemic group of Philippine murids, and those at lower elevations tend to be members of more recently arrived groups.

The food niche width and niche evenness for both species were similar. The correlation between niche width and niche evenness was non-significant showing that evenness does not depend on niche width. In addition, there was no correlation between niche width and overlap, i.e. overlap varied independently of niche width. A high overlap of food sources utilized by the two species was observed in September, October and November. This may be explained in one of two ways: (a) if B. atratus and B. mono compete for resources, competition would be more intense during those three months; (b) the convergency of both species to the same plant species (Solanum paniculatum and Psidium guajava) would only result in more intensive competition if resources were limiting. However, at that period of the year resources are abundant, therefore although the values of overlap were high, competition need not have occurred. © 1989, Cambridge University Press.

Canopy volume declined with increasing herbivore pressure, but shrub density was not systematically affected, suggesting strong resilience against destruction by herbivores. However, shrubs became more aggregated with increasing herbivory, suggesting that clumps of individuals are more resilient to destruction than are isolated individuals. Grass production was three times greater under the canopy of S. pallida than in the open. Comparisons of physical-chemical properties among soils derived from four microsites revealed far higher nutrient levels in sub-canopy soil than in soil derived from open ground between canopies, and radically different properties compared to soil heavily enriched with livestock dung and urine. Higher nutrient levels beneath the canopy most likely resulted from litter decomposition. A pot experiment, designed to simulate shading and soil conditions in the field, showed that grass growth promotion was largely due to a substantial increase in soil fertility beneath the canopy of S. pallida, comparable to grass productivity in soil enriched with livestock excreta. However, this increase in sub-canopy grass production did not significantly increase regional grass layer production. © 1989, Cambridge University Press.

Flowers in large clumps at the peak of the blooming season were pollinated by two territorial humming-birds, but at the end of the season or in isolated plants the main avian pollinator was the non-territorial hermit Phaethornis superciliosus. Visits by avian nectar thieves were more frequent at high flower densities. The reproductive output of inflorescences was similar at different levels of flower aggregation. Aphelandra flowers in large clumps could exchange pollen with extraterritorial plants because territorial humming-birds did not completely exclude pollinating hermits. The commonest nectar thief at high flower aggregations was the passerine Vermivora peregrina, the second most common nectar thief was the hermit Phaethornis longuemareus. © 1989, Entomological Society of Canada.

The study area encompasses a diversity of vegetation types from dry thorn forest (250–400 m) through deciduous forest (400–1400 m) to stunted evergreen shola forest and grassland (1400–1800 m). Home range sizes of some identified elephants were between 105 and 320 km2. Based on the dry season distribution, five different elephant clans, each consisting of between 50 and 200 individuals and having overlapping home ranges, could be defined within the study area. Seasonal habitat preferences were related to the availability of water and the palatability of food plants. During the dry months (January-April) elephants congregated at high densities of up to five individuals km-2 in river valleys where browse plants had a much higher protein content than the coarse tall grasses on hill slopes. With the onset of rains of the first wet season (May-August) they dispersed over a wider area at lower densities, largely into the tall grass forests, to feed on the fresh grasses, which then had a high protein value. During the second wet season (September-December), when the tall grasses became fibrous, they moved into lower elevation short grass open forests. The normal movement pattern could be upset during years of adverse environmental conditions. However, the movement pattern of elephants in this region has not basically changed for over a century, as inferred from descriptions recorded during the nineteenth century. © 1989, Cambridge University Press.
