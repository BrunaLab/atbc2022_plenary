Transects from humid areas at the equator towards the deserts can be summarized as follows: High availability of nitrogen, low availability of phosphorus, low pH and aluminium toxicity probably restrict the competitiveness of nitrogen-fixing species in the forests on highly weathered and leached soils in humid west and central Africa. Ectomycorrhizal species attain dominance in species-poor forests on the soils poorest in phosphorus, while species with vesicular-arbuscular (VA) mycorrhiza form diverse forests on more fertile soils. Nitrogen-fixing species, which mostly are VA mycorrhizal, are more common in woodlands, where nitrogen is lost in grass fires, than in forests, which have a more closed nitrogen cycle. Low availability of phosphorus, however, limits the growth of nitrogen-fixing species in moist savannas. Ectomycorrhizal species are dominant, possibly because of a competitive advantage conferred by the large storage capacity of the fungal mantles under conditions of discontinuous nutrient supply. Nitrogen-fixing species become more abundant towards drier areas with an increase in soil phosphorus and a decline in soil nitrogen. These conditions culminate at the desert fringe, where nitrogen-fixing species reach their most conspicuous development. It is concluded that soil nutrient availability and root symbioses interact and strongly affect the composition of vegetation communities. © 1986, Cambridge University Press.

One of these habitats, a well-maintained plantation, had irregular and broken shade cover (Erythrina trees in particular) while in the other habitat, a ‘cocoa forest’, cocoa trees were heavily shaded by Huara crepitans (Euphorbiaceae). ‘Matina’ variety cocoa trees of about the same age (50–60 years) were censused in both habitats. Cocoa-pollinating midge (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae and Cecidomyiidae) availability was estimated by sampling immature stages in experimentally-distributed ground-cover breeding substrates, comparing overall abundances and species numbers between the two habitats over three census dates (dry, mid-rainy, and late-rainy seasons), along with examination of fungal-rotted (diseased) cocoa pods both on trees and the ground. Although total flower production was much greater in the plantation habitat, total production of new pods was similar between habitats. Flowering followed a cyclic temporal pattern in the forest but not in the plantation. Sudden leaf drop of forest shade trees in the dry season probably triggered a cyclic response in which flowering peaked in the first half of the rainy season. There was an inverse relation for frequencies of mature cocoa pods killed by squirrels and pathogenic fungi (Monilia roreri and Phytophthora) between the two habitats: squirrel-killed pods were far more abundant in the plantation than in the forest, and the opposite for fungus-killed pods. Fungus-killed but otherwise intact pods, and not squirrel-killed pods rotting on trees, were a major breeding site for midges, particularly during the late rainy season. Ceratopogonidae were most abundant in the dry season and frequently encountered in cocoa pod husks and banana tree trunk sections in both habitats, and much more so in the forest habitat. The abandoned cocoa plantation (cocoa forest) supported a more diverse assemblage of pollinating midges than the plantation. In the plantation but not in the forest, a negative correlation was discovered between distance from shade trees and the numbers of pods on trees, suggesting greater pollinating activity by midges in cocoa trees beneath shade trees than away from them. The uniform dense shade cover in the adjacent forest probably obliterated such a pattern. © 1986, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA,NA

They frequently rest and cool in the shade, and after each cooling period they remain on the sun-exposed surface until the heat influx from the environment has caused the body temperature to rise close to the lethal level. They have relatively low rates of transpiratory water loss, and appear unable to depress their body temperature by means of evaporative heat loss.

On fertile soils in Panama and Colombia soil concentrations of copper, manganese, cobalt and zinc were correlated with plant concentrations. Calcium, caesium, iron, lead, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium and strontium-concentrations were not correlated. Factor analysis of plant chemistry at nine sites showed very little commonality between sites, even of vegetation belonging to the same plant association. A copper, manganese, cobalt, zinc factor was not recognized except in one case. A similar study of plant soil correlation in Colombia supported the conclusions from Panama; for most elements there was little evidence for significant correlation between plant and soil concentrations. Analysis of plant-soil relationships on very infertile latosols with terra firme forest in the Amazon at San Carlos de Rio Negro, Venezuela and Manaus, Brazil revealed a soil effect on the statistical distributions of the elements in the plant biomass. This effect was strongest on the least fertile site at Manaus and was strongest for essential elements. The pattern of chemical distributions appears to be due to the fact that some species are capable of concentrating high levels of elements even under conditions of very low supply in the substrate. © 1986, Cambridge University Press.

The method has been evaluated in south central Kenya but could be applied to most terrestrial regions of tropical Africa. The essential feature is that the observers move anywhere within a sample site of about 1 km2, recording all of the species seen in a fixed time, e.g. 1 h. Counts are made in all seasons and at various times of day. Reasonable estimates of the total number of species in an area can be derived from a series of 15 counts, but such estimates tend to be low in non-forested habitats because ‘wanderers’ (non-resident species) continue to be recorded almost indefinitely. Open sites have far fewer species than well-wooded areas. The numbers of resident species in non-forested terrestrial habitats is related both to the amount of woody vegetation and to a measure of plant growth. However, total species numbers seem to depend solely on the amount of woody vegetation. Road counts, from a vehicle, were compared to those made on foot. They are less satisfactory, especially for cryptic species. © 1986, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA,NA

CO2 concentrations near the forest floor were consistently higher than in the atmosphere. CO2 gradient in the soil was very steep probably because of the poor aeration in this flood-prone forest. δ13C values of plant tissues showed a clear pattern with lower values in the ground herbaceous plants and under-canopy trees. Tree seedlings showed δ13C values similar to the upper-canopy trees indicating their dependence on reserves carried in the seed from the mother tree. Decomposing litter and soil organic matter also showed δ13C values similar to the upper-canopy trees. It is suggested that lower δ13C values of the shade flora result primarily from the assimilation of CO2 depleted in δ13C originating from soil respiration.

They have a clearly defined distribution particularly where they are associated with ground water. There is a distinctive woody vegetation on the discrete mounds contrasting with surrounding grass-covered depressions. After a reconnaissance ground and air-photograph survey of the nature and distribution of mounds within the Federal District, four one-hectare plots were chosen for detailed study within the ecological reserve of the University of Brasilia. Measurements were made of the size, shape and frequency of mounds. Numbers varied from 26 to 61 ha−1 with a uniform distribution occupying 10–50% of the plots. Heights ranged from 0.05 to over 2 m. The generally semi-elliptical shape in ground plan had an average size of 7 by 5.5 m with no evidence of preferred orientation although water scouring from runoff partly influences the morphology. Volumes varied from 0.01 m3 to 141.5 m3. The soils of the murundus differed from those of surrounding depressions by being better drained, with bright colours and strong cohesive structures; they were more argillic with lower base saturation and pH values. Such sites favour colonization both by cerrado plants and by termites. A classification of the murundus is postulated. Although this paper does not consider the origins of murundus, they appear to relate more closely to drainage and differential erosion than to termite activity. © 1986, Cambridge University Press.

This small tributary of the Rio Negro is of the blackwater type with a very low nutrient content. The sampling stations were towards the mouth of the tributary where it flowed through annually inundated forest and the work was carried out during the low water season. Previous studies concluded that these acid waters were of very low productivity and held impoverished faunas. However, this study showed that leaf litter banks held a diverse aquatic community of unexpectedly high biomass. This was because the banks supplied food and shelter and were available during the low water period when other habitats had dried out. The macrofauna was dominated by fish and shrimps. From an examination of gut contents a food web was produced. Primary consumers were found to take mainly detritus and fungi and it was concluded that allochthonous inputs were the main source of energy and nutrients. No feeding specialists were found and all the predators took prey from more than one trophic level. © 1986, Cambridge University Press.

Despite sharing most pollen resources and nectar of the same quality with 20 introduced colonies of the African honey bee (Apis mellifera), native stingless bees of 12 species were largely unaffected by its activity. Pollen and nectar harvested by the honey bees were 10–200 times that procured by 17 stingless bee colonies. This discrepancy in total harvest and general lack of competitive effect is explained by a honey bee foraging area over 10 times that of the native bees, and apparent foraging shifts to escape competition with honey bees, thus reduced potential overlap in foraging sites. Seven cases of direct resource competition for pollen or nectar were documented, out of 31 tests. Rare periods of intensive harvest were diminished by competing African honey bees. Such harvest peaks lasted for only a few hours in 13 days of observation. Despite average duration of 4% foraging time for each species, peaks included as much as 51% total harvest. Calculations based upon colony populations, food stores and flight range show that if African honey bees persist at a density of 1 colony per km2, colonies of some stingless bee species may disappear after 10 years. Their chances of escaping food competition by taxonomic specialization on flowers seem slight. © 1986, Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.",NA,NA,NA,NA

Gallery forest supported the highest species richness, most complex vertical distribution of species, highest level of trophic diversity, and highest macroniche diversity. Degree of habitat selection varied widely. All habitat types supported both rodents and marsupials, although marsupials tended to be much less common in the grasslands (campos) than in woodlands (cerrado) and forests (cerradão, gallery forest). Some species, such as Didelphis albiventris, occurred in all habitat types, while others were much more restricted. Oryzomys bicolor, for example, ocurred only in gallery forest. No habitat type had a completely distinct fauna: overlap in species composition always occurred with at least one other habitat type. Because of the great variability of habitats, and the fact that subsets of the mammal fauna were frequently habitat specific, the overall species richness of any portion of mixed cerrado vegetation is remarkably high. © 1986, Cambridge University Press.

This assemblage of tadpoles lives in torrents, riffles, shingle areas, open pools, leaf drifts, protected side pools, potholes in rocky banks, bank seepages, and pools of small intermittent streams. Positive associations of species in types of microhabitats and co-occurrence within sites lead to recognition of four taxonomically heterogeneous groups: one concentrated in leaf drifts; one using riffles, shingle areas, and open pools; one concentrated in potholes; and one using side pools and potholes. Most pairs of larval forms having strong negative association are characterized by differences in morphology and feeding behaviour; they show little evidence of competitive relations. Between-sites variation in species composition differs among the types of microhabitats, leaf drifts showing the least amount of variation. Species composition within a site shows less change over intervals of 1–5 days than over intervals of 13–18 days. Variation in species composition is greater between sites than within sites over intervals of 9–31 days.
