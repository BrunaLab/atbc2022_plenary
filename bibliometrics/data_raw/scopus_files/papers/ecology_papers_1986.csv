A 6th experiment indicated that birds were responsible for the absence of mussels from an area with smooth substrate lacking mussel beds. The long-term impact of avian predators is greatest in patches where invertebrate predators are uncommon and larval settlement, rather than adult encroachment, is the major form of recruitment. Avian predation increases the patchiness of a sedentary prey in heterogeneous habitats, but decreases patchiness where the habitat is sufficiently homogeneous that birds have access to all microhabitats.-from Author",66,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,49,NA,NA

Males were found to gain mass and energy more rapidly than females, due to higher costs of reproduction in females. Such costs include a trade-off between initial and future reproductive rate, and a decreasing growth rate in reproducing females. In male-female pairs confined together, the male eventually grew larger than the female, and both changed sex in the majority of cases. Larger body size may be more important for females since size is positively correlated with female fecundity. Furthermore, males did not incur larger behavioural costs than females due to intraspecific interactions. When single individuals were compared to groups of consexuals, average (per-individual) feeding rate, feces production rate, and growth rate were lower in groups. Time spent nursing eggs and variance in growth rate increased, and fecundity decreased, in females together with a consexual, compared to when alone, constituting evidence of additional female costs. After simultaneous sex reversal and some number of clutches, some pairs became simultaneous hermaphroditets, traded eggs, and, as a result, increased reproductive output.-from Author",49,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,50,NA,NA

Home range size scales linearly to body mass for carnivores as it does for herbivores. This scaling supports the hypothesis that animals select their home range areas to meet metabolic demands integrated over biologically critical periods. Confounding variables in the home range-body mass regression include habitat productivity and methods of location. Data on home ranges derived from telemetry studies of terrestrial carnivores are presented and used to derive allometric equations for home range area.

From the predation risk point of view, however, a bird should be as lean as possible to minimize its probability of being killed. Leaner birds incur a smaller cost of existence and thus spend less time feeding, potentially exposed to predators. Also, lean birds are likely to be more adept at escaping predators once attacked. If a bird is attempting to minimize its probability of death during winter, the fat reserves and thus the body mass it maintains will reflect a trade-off between starvation and predation risk. A simple stochastic simulation model developed to explore the nature of this trade-off indicates that body mass should: 1) increase with the frequency and/or harshness of periods of food unavailability; 2) decrease with increasing predation risk; 3) decrease with increasing temperature; and 4) increase with food abundance. -from Author",510,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,107,NA,NA

From nearly 30 to >60% of the variability in these community traits was attributable to an effect of similar habitat type. Significant variability in one trait (mean shape) was also attributable to geographic region, apparently an effect of differences between regions in the phylogenetic origin of finches present. Hence, historical factors appear to have constrained convergence, but only in 1 of the 5 finch community traits. Similarity of communities within habitat types was unrelated to the degree of convergence. For example, finch communities within habitats were significantly similar in only one convergent trait, mean size. Mean shape, also convergent, was significantly different between communities within habitats. Similarity, as defined here, indicates that sizes of individual species within communities are nonrandomly spaced.

Recent work shows that simple nonlinearities of the kind that can arise naturally in the regulation of many populations may lead to very complicated dynamics. When compounded with environmental unpredictability and/or heterogeneities in individual behavior or spatial distribution, such nonlinearities can cause problems in analyzing data and in predicting events. Part 2 surveys possible effects of competition, mutualism and predator-prey associations upon community structure. Part 3 discusses work on community-level patterns having to do with food web structure, the relative abundance of species, and the relative numbers of species or of individuals in different physical size classes. -from Author",192,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,166,NA,NA

Marked similarities in diet and spatial use between bison and prairie dogs on dog town edges and between pronghorn and prairie dogs on town centers create a high potential for interspecific interactions. Bison foraging groups were largest, nearest neighbor distances least, and foraging efficiency (bite:step ratios) highest among bison foraging in town edge control areas of the active towns, suggesting that these were the best areas for bison foraging. Prairie dogs showed smaller nearest neighbor distances and higher bite:step ratios when foraging in these areas than when foraging within adjacent exclosures, suggesting that bison foraging on town edges improved prairie dog foraging there. Results indicate a mutually positive relationship between bison and prairie dogs on town edges. Nearest neighbor distances and bite:step ratios of prairie dogs on town centers suggested that pronghorn foraging did not appreciably affect prairie dog foraging, but comparisons of pronghorn foraging between active and poisoned town centers showed nearest neighbor distances always smaller and bite:step ratios often higher on the poisoned town centers, ie presence of prairie dogs on town centers may slightly degrade pronghorn foraging. Significant enhancement of shoot N in plants growing on areas subject to heavy grazing pressure, such as active dog towns and control areas on dog towns, may partially explain improvements in prairie dog and bison foraging there. -from Author",73,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,170,NA,NA
