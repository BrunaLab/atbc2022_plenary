However, understanding of the process controlling formation, persistence and alternation between states is still poor. Moreover, knowledge of spatial and temporal variations of this key herbivore populations are scarce. Here an extensive study of D. aff. antillarum populations throughout the Canarian Archipelago were presented, with particular emphasis on two main themes: firstly the influence of sea urchin population on non-crustose macroalgal assemblages. Secondly, the spatial variation of adult sea urchin populations at different scales: both on a large scale (between islands and sites with different wave exposure) and on a medium-small scale (between depths and habitats with different characteristics), and including comments regarding human influence on the observed spatial pattern between the studied islands. The main results were: (1) densities of D. aff. antillarum higher than 4 ind.m-2 drastically reduce non-crustose macroalgal cover to under 30%; (2) Tenerife Island comprises the highest urchin densities while El Hierro has been found to have the lowest; (3) wave exposure is a factor determining sea urchin density: more highly exposed sites present lower urchin density and vice versa; (4) rocky grounds covered with crustose algae can be found at greater depth in more highly exposed sites and at shallower depths in lesser exposed sites; (5) when sand percentage over the rocky substrate exceeds 20%, urchin density is limited to under 1 ind.m-2 and (6) high relief rocky substrate present higher urchin densities and hence a lower non-crustose macroalgal cover.",23,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Canary Islands | Diadema aff. antillarum | Habitat complexity | Non-crustose macroalgae | Wave exposure,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,6,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, little is known on the abundance of the resource in natural populations in México, crucial information to determine total allowable catch. The objective of this study was to assess the abundance of I. fuscus in the National Park Bahia de Loreto, Gulf of California, during the fishing season 2005-2006. Abundance was estimated through belt transects (25 × 2 m). A total of 29 sites or ""banks"" were visited, mostly sites where the fishery occurs. Data were analyzed to determine homoscedasticity and normality using the Levene and Kolmogorov-Smirnoff tests, respectively. To detect differences between the islands we used a one way ANOVA (model II; α=0.05) considering the islands as factors. We used linear regressions to detect geographic clines between population density and geographic location. The average abundance of I. fuscus in the PNBL was 1.41 ± 0.02 individuals/transect, with an average density of 0.028 ± 0.0004 ind/m2. Density was slightly higher in the southern banks. The lowest value was found at isla Montserrat, which is close to the coastline of the Baja California Peninsula, where most of the fishery occurs.

Other important prey were the gastropod Pareuthria plumbea, the isopod Exosphaeroma lanceolatum and the mussels Aulacomya atra atra and Mytilus edulis platensis. The proportion of sea stars feeding on sessile prey increases with sea-star size. A significant positive correlation was found between the size of the sea star and the size of the most frequent prey.

Mean density of the sea urchins was relatively constant through time at all localities: lowest at San Agustín (0.26±0.13 ind.m-2) and highest at La Entrega (4.17±1.4 ind.m-2).

The lowest rate of bioerosion occurred at San Agustín (0. 25 kg.m-2.yr-1), and the highest at La Entrega (4 kg.m-2.yr-1).

Currently, the parthenogenetic lizard Aspidoscelis rodecki McCoy and Maslin 1962 is recognized as a single taxon that was derived from a single, parthenogenetically capable, hybrid. This lizard had been derived via hybridization between individuals of two gonochoristic species, Aspidoscelis angusticeps Cope 1878 and Aspidoscelis deppii Wiegmann 1834. The distribution of A. rodecki includes Isla Contoy and Isla Mujeres and the adjacent mainland of Quintana Roo, México. Previous studies have found post-formational divergence in genetic, chromatic and life-history characteristics among a continental population (Puerto Juárez) and an insular population (Isla Contoy). A meristic analysis was carried out to evaluate the morphological divergence among both populations of A. rodecki. We used 38 individuals from Puerto Juárez and 23 individuals from Isla Contoy. Nine meristic characters with discrimination value among species of the genus Aspidoscelis were used in both univariate (t-Student) and multivariate analyses (principal components and canonical variate analysis). According to both analyses, Puerto Juárez is meristically distinguishable from Isla Contoy. Both populations differ in five meristic characters and were a high correct classification in the canonical variate analysis: 97% of Puerto Juárez and 100% of Isla Contoy. A small sample from Isla Mujeres and a single specimen from Punta Sam (mainland) may represent different morphological groups. Due to the patterns of phenotypic variation, A. rodecki is considered as a single variable parthenogenetic species with high priority to conservation. The populations of A. rodecki have been extremely affected by the tourism developers. If the habitat of the parthenogenetic lizard (beach grasses) is allowed to stay, the expansion by the developers will not affect the survivorship of these populations. Nevertheless, the first sign of development is the total destruction of natural grasses that occurs on the beach, leaving only sand. There is a last chance to save the parthenogenetic lizard A. rodecki, but any effort will be useless without the support from the environmental authority of Mexico and cooperation from the developers. We suggest that Puerto Juárez and Isla Contoy receive separate management because they have unique portions of phenotypic variation of A. rodecki.

Anthropogenic disturbances on the structure and heterogeneity of a system can have an important effect on aquatic community stability. Ecological rapid assessments (1996, 2002, and 2007) were employed to determine the structure, composition and distribution of tropical fish communities in several rivers and smaller creeks from a gold mining area in Cerro Crucitas, Costa Rica. In addition, species composition and relative abundance were related with habitat structure. A total of 35 species were registered, among which sardine Astyanax aeneus (Characidae) and livebearer Alfaro cultratus (Poeciliidae) were the most abundant fish (71%). The highest species richness was observed in Caño Crucitas (s = 19) and Minas Creek (s = 18). Significant differences in fish communities structure and composition from Infiernillo river and Minas creek were observed (λ = 0.0, F132, 66 = 2.24, p < 0.001). Presence and/or absence of certain species such as Dormitor gobiomorus, Rhamdia nicaraguensis, Parachromis loiseillei and Atractosteus tropicus explained most of the spatial variation among sites. Habitat structure also contributed to explain differences among sites (λ = 0.004, F60, 183 = 5.52, p < 0.001). Substratum (soft and hard bottom types) and habitat attributes (elevation, width and depth) explained most of the variability observed in Infiernillo River, Caño Crucitas and Tamagá Creek. In addition, a significant association between fish species and habitat structure was observed. This study reveals a high complexity in tropical fish communities that inhabit a gold mine area. Furthermore,it highlights the importance of habitat heterogeneity in fish community dynamics. The loss and degradation of aquatic systems in Cerro Crucitas can have a strong negative effect on fish community structure and composition of local species. A better understanding of the use of specific habitats that serve as essential fish habitats can improve tropical fish conservation and management strategies, thus increasing local diversity, and thereby, the biological importance of the area.",7,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Anthropogenic disturbance | Costa Rica | Ecological rapid assessment | Gold mine | Species composition | Tropical fish communities,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,49,19419095,NA,NA,NA

We calculated the percentage of number (% N), weight (% W), and occurrence (% O) of each food item encountered in the stomachs; based on this information, the Index of Relative Importance (IR) was calculated. Moreover, we estimated diet overlap for three different size classes (<10.1, 10.1-15.0 and >15.1 cm TL). The results revealed exclusively two groups of benthic prey items: crustaceans (30%) and teleost fish (70%) in their diet. The most frequent preys were pandalid shrimps Plesionika trispinus (% O = 17) and the fathom mora Physiculus rastrelliger (% O = 12). The greatest diversity and frequency of abundance of food items was observed in intermediate-sized individuals (10.1-15.0 cm TL). Small-sized L. spilurus (< 10.1 cm TL) fed mainly on teleost fish, while larger (> 15.0 cm TL) preyed on large-sized stomatopods and teleost fish.

Four 5-year-old model plant associations composed of 2 tree species (Hyeronima alchorneoides and Cedrela odorata) having different architecture and phenology were studied. Average tree height was 8.9 and 7.6 m, respectively. Each tree species was grown in monoculture and in polyculture with 2 perennial monocotyledons (Euterpe oleracea and Heliconia imbricata). Maximum rooting depth at the time of δD determination was ~ 2 m for almost all species. Most roots of all species were concentrated in the upper soil layers. Stomatal conductance to water vapor (gS) was higher in the deciduous C. odorata than in the evergreen H. alchorneoides; within each species, gS did not differ when the trees were grown in mono or in polyculture. During the rainy season, gradients in soil water δD were not observed. Average rainy season xylem sap δD did not differ among members of the plant combinations tested (-30 ‰), and was more similar to δD values of shallow soil water. Under dry conditions, volumetric soil water content declined from 50 to ~ 35%, and modest gradients in soil water δD were observed. xylem sap δD obtained during dry conditions was significantly lower than rainy season values. xylem sap δD of plants growing in the four associations varied between -9 and -22‰, indicating that shallow water was predominantly absorbed during the dry period too. Differences in xylem sap δD of trees and monocots were also detected, but no significant patterns emerged. The results suggest that: a) the plant associations examined extracted water pre- dominantly from shallow soil layers (<1 m), b) the natural isotopic variation in soil and plant water at the study site was low, and c) the plant mixes obtain water from more than a single soil layer simultaneously. Temporal factors were important in determining the competition and complementary relations observed among the trees and the perennial monocots.

It was high at Isla Montosa (653.31 kg m-2 year-1) and Isla Cacaluta (450.09 kg m-2 year-1), intermediate at San Agustín, Jicaral-Chachacual and Dos Hermanas (155.18-92.53 kg m-2 year-1) and low at La Entrega (14.33 kg m-2 year-1). Sedimentation rate was homogeneous through time (F7,34 = 0.85, P > 0.5); nonetheless, during the dry season (November-March) sedimentation rate in the area oscillated between 6.8-73.5 mg cm-2 day-1, whereas during the rainy season (May-October) the values were 141-1088 % higher (74.5-147.6 mg cm-2 day-1, Mann-Whitney U = 137, n = 42, P = 0.03). There was a significant relationship between sedimentation rate and pluvial precipitation (Spearman R = 0.83, n = 8, P = 0.009), suggesting that the amount of sediment reaching coral communities is closely tied to regional precipitation. Sedimentation rates recorded at Isla Montosa (366.64 mg cm-2 day-1) and Isla Cacaluta (366.03 mg cm-2 day-1) during the rainy season can be considered lethal-sublethal considering sediment tolerance and rejection efficiency of stony corals. The absence of coral mortality during the rainy season may result from: a) high efficiency of active sediment removal, b) increased physiological tolerance to sediments, and c) a high degree of passive sediment removal via turbulence. Nonetheless, the combined effect of natural and anthropogenic induced sedimentation may cause a shift in coral community structure and eventually a loss of the reef areas in Bahías de Huatulco.",25,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Coral communities | Mexican pacific | Oaxaca | Sedimentation rate | Sediments,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,63,19419037,NA,NA,NA

The first pond (A) was covered an 80% by Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.), the second one (B) with bloom of Microcystis aeruginosa (Kurtzing) and the last one (C) with organic matter deposited in the bottom. The water was more acidic at pond A, and the water at pond B contained more dissolved oxygen concentration than the water at the other two ponds. The zoo-heleoplankton densities varied between 20-1728 ind.l-1 at pond A, 42-4082 ind.l-1 at pond B and 148-2447 ind.l-1 at pond C. The maximum zoo-heleoplankton abundance was found in the pond with cyanobacteria bloom during Autumn 1994 and the minimum abundance was found in the one with a predominance of E. crassipes. The rank of species richness was pond A > pond B > pond C. Rotifera was the most abundant group in pond A whereas the larval stages of Copepoda were abundant in the other two ponds. Anuraeopsis navicula Rousselt 1910 was the dominant population in the pond with macrophytes prevalence. Brachionus calyciflorus Pallas 1776 and larval stage of Copepoda had variable proportions in the pond with cyanobacteria bloom. Thermocyclops decipiens (Kiefer 1929) was present during the annual cycle only in the pond with organic matter deposited in the bottom. The succession of taxa was observed in the pond with coverage of aquatic macrophytes and with cyanobacteria bloom. Differences in species richness and low similarity in zoo-heleoplankton between ponds were determined by differences in the quality of the water in relation to the presence of macrophytes, cyanobacteria, organic matter deposited in the bottom and fish predation.

Here, we examined the impact of local extinction and recolonization on the genetic structure of wild populations of lima beans (Phaseolus lunatus) in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. We compared genetic diversity from the samples taken from the populations before and after extinction at 13 locations using microsatellite markers. Locations were classified according to the occurrence of extinction episodes during the previous five years into three groups: 1) populations that experienced extinction for more than one year, and were later recolonized (recolonized), 2) populations that did not experience local extinction (control), and 3) populations that did not experience local extinction during the study, but were cut to experimentally simulate extinction (experimental). Our data did not show a clear tendency in variation in allele frequencies, expected heterozygosity, and effective number of alleles within and between groups of populations. However, we found that the level of genetic differentiation between samples collected at different times at the same location was different in the three groups of populations. Recolonized locations showed the highest level of genetic differentiation (mean Fst = 0.2769), followed by control locations (mean Fst = 0.0576) and experimental locations (mean Fst = 0.0189). Similar findings were observed for Nei's genetic distance between samples (di,j = 0.1786, 0.0400, and 0.0037, respectively).

Foliar damage can be controlled through synchronous leaf production and specialized phytochemical strategies. In this study, the dynamics of foliar damage in different cohorts of seedlings were evaluated to determine if the High-Andean species, Clusia multiflora (Clusiaceae) and Drimys granadensis (Winteraceae) appeal to the synchronous leaf production for controlling the herbivory and pathogenical damage, and to establish the possible relations between the healthy state, growth and mortality of seedlings. Since a recently-emerged seedling could not supply the physiological costs of specialized strategies, we expected the highest synchronous leaf production in the youngest individuals, and differences between cohorts in foliar damage. Four variables were measured to evaluate the health state along time, in three cohorts of seedlings: Proportion of predated leaves (Pp), proportion of healthy leaves (Ps), proportion of leaves with symptoms of disease or punctual damage (Pe) and growing (% increment of height). Both species showed significant differences between periods in the proportion of healthy leaves, but there was not an effect of time-cohort interaction, therefore synchronic production of leaves was not a strategy more used for any particular cohort. Foliar damage oscillated along time, fact that can be explained by the pulses of leaf production. However, this strategy had little efficiency to control the pathogen attack. In general, the unified behavior of all variables was affected by cohort, time, species an all the different interactions. Association between growing and foliar damage were conditioned by climate. The highest mortality ocurred during the dry season, and one fourth of the D. granadensis deaths were caused by the joint action of herbivory and drought. Results suggest that in spite of the synchronous leaf production in all cohorts, this strategy quickly loses the efficiency for controlling foliar damage, because the means of Ps were below of 0.25 at the end of the monitoring period.

Analysis of phylloplane microorganisms, lead, zinc, copper, cadmium and sulphur was carried out from leaves. The bacterial population was higher at the unpolluted site. Bacterial population showed a significant negative correlation with lead, zinc, copper, cadmium and sulphur. Similarly, fungal population was higher at the unpolluted site.

Some fungal forms like Mortierella sp., Fusarium oxysporum and Aureobasidium pollulans were dominant in the polluted site. Numbers of phylloplane fungi and bacteria were significantly reduced in the polluted site. The correlation coefficient indicated a detrimental effect of metals like lead, zinc, copper, cadmium and sulphur on the microbial community of leaf surfaces.

Fish sampling was done using a combination of gears such as gill net, fine mesh net and visual observation. Thirty three species, 26 genera and 14 families were collected in four sampling sites along the river. The number and biomass captured during the entire study was 984 individuals and 147 410.9 g respectively.

Affiliative behaviors were less frequent but longer in Caricuao than in the other two groups, while agonistic behaviors were more frequent in El Pinar and Parque del Este. Differences between groups are explained by variation in captivity conditions. We suggest that confinement generates social tension and favors agonism, while affiliative encounters help reduce this tension. On the other hand, differences in agonism between captive and natural groups may result form prolonged association, restrictions to keep optimal spacing or leave the group. All groups had some social structure (e.g., dominance ranks, association and repulsion between individuals) but the social dynamic was partly disrupted. Dominance ranks were not clear throughout the group, the top male was not dominant over the top female, dominant individuals did not interact affiliatively more than other individuals, and females did not affiliate frequently with other females. All of these observations are contrary to which has been observed in nature. As a whole, C. olivaceus tolerates captivity well because its behavioral repertoire is similar to that in natural conditions, and abnormal or undesirable behaviors (e.g., self-mutilation, stereotyped actions), were not observed.

Knowing how these characteristics are related to a specific edge type and how they influence the regeneration process, is important for High Andean forest edges restoration. This study aimed to characterize three types of High Andean forest edge in Cogua Forest Reserve (Colombia): 1) edge of Chusquea scandens, 2) ""paramizado"", and 3) old edge, characterized for being in a later successional state. Two forest patches were chosen for each edge type and 13 criteria were analyzed; these were of topographic order, micro-environmental order, vegetation structure and species composition. In each patch the vegetation was evaluated by means of two 60 m transects perpendicular to the edge and along the matrix-edgeinterior of the forest gradient. All woody plant species were identified and counted to determine their abundance. Environmental variables (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and light radiation) were measured in one of the transects. Three of the 13 criteria were of little importance in shaping the type of edge habitat (slope, patch shape and area). The others were closely related with the micro-environmental conditions and in turn with the vegetation structure and composition; this relationship confers particular characteristics to each edge type. The microclimate and floristic edge limits coincided; edges extend between 10 and 20 m into the forest depending on the edge type. The paramizado edge has the smallest environmental self-regulation capacity and is more exposed to fluctuations of the studied variables, because of its greatest exposition to the wind action and loss of the tallest trees (between 10 and 15 m) which regulate the understorey microclimate. This low environmental buffer capacity prevents the establishing of mature forest species (for example, Schefflera sp. And Oreopanax bogotensis) although they are found in other areas within the same patch. All these results show that the paramizado edge needs the most intervention for its restoration. The Chusquea scandens edge forest is the most sheltered since this species acts as a protecting shield. However it still needs to be controlled to allow the adjacent matrix colonization by the forest species and natural regeneration, as it does in the old edge type forest, which moreover has an intermediate self-regulating capacity relative to the other two. The vegetation composition reveals that most of the edge species can also grow inside, beyond the forest edge.",10,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Chusquea scandens | Disturbance | Ecological restoration | Forest edge | Matrix | Microclimate,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,86,19419063,NA,NA,NA

The study site was Amacayacu National Park (Colombian Amazon), where we carried out a census of mammal species using line transect methods in two forests with different levels of hunting pressure.

Only three parent-offspring interactions were recorded during the four months around the time the range-shift occurred. The apparent peaceful nature of these encounters, along with the slow transition out of a portion of his natal home range, suggest the subadult was not evicted from his natal area by his parents. The timing of the shift, along with the subadult's increase in weight into the weight range of adult ocelots four months after establishing the new territory, suggests that predispersal home range shifts could act as a low risk and opportunistic strategy for reaching adult size, while minimizing competition with parents and siblings, in preparation for an eventual dispersal into a new breeding territory.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Automated radio telemetry | Home range shift | Leopardus pardalis | Ocelot | Predispersal | Subadult,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,111,19256443,NA,NA,NA

A second goal was to determine which species were the most successful in edge areas and their particular vital traits. The regeneration and growth of the forest patches to the adjacent matrix depends on the establishment of these species and their tolerance to both habitats. Three types of High Andean edge forest were studied. Two forest patches were chosen for each of the three edge types: Chusquea scandens edge, ""paramune"" and old-edge; the name of the latter was given because of its advanced successional state. In each patch, the vegetation was evaluated in two 60 m transects perpendicular to the edge and along the matrix-edge-interior gradient of the forest. All woody species were identified and counted to determine their abundance. A total of nine species were chosen as representative of High Andean forest edges in the reserve, because of their high abundance in this environment, their presence in both patches of each edge type and their ability to colonize the adjacent matrix. Each species was evaluated using 20 vital attributes of individual, leaf, and reproductive traits. Six species groups were found through a Correspondence Analysis. However, all nine species have high variation and plasticity levels for the attributes, even inside the groups. This trend suggests that while they are not clearly differentiated functional groups, they probably are representing different strategies within a single functional group of great plasticity. Tibouchina grossa and Pentacalia Pulchella are found in all edge and matrix types; the other species are found in all edge types, except by Gaiadendron punctatum and Weinmannia tomentosa, absent in the Chusquea scandens edge.

In this condition the surface area covered by water increased more than three times compared to prolonged hydrologic isolation condition. As river water entered the floodplain lakes, dissolved inorganic nitrogen increased to high values, especially NO3-, whereas the isolation condition was characterised by a decrease in NO3- concentrations to undetectable levels. Compared to plants growing in the more isolated lake, those growing in the more connected lake had a significantly lower leaf density, longer leaves, less root biomass and lower ratio between below-ground and above-ground biomasses. However, total and leaf biomasses were not significantly different between sites. In each lake, differences in leaf height, leaf biomass and root biomass between prolonged hydrologic connection and isolation, as well as the insignificant relationship between leaf size and leaf density, indicate that the morphological traits of E. crassipes respond to pluri-annual water level fluctuations. The highest nutrient concentration in mature leaves was registered at the end of the prolonged hydrologic connection in the more connected lake. During the prolonged isolation, leaves had more lignin and a higher L:N ratio than at high waters, at the same sites.

Distributions of Gastropoda and Bivalvia families, endemic, exotic, invasive as well as entities of sanitary importance are also studied and recommendations on their conservation are provided. Molluscs related to the Del Plata Basin have been thoroughly studied in comparison to others areas of the country. This fauna exhibits relatively the biggest specific richness and keeps its affinity with the fauna of other regions of the basin in areas of Paraguay and Brasil. The 4 500 records of molluscs considered in this paper arise from the study of the collections of Museo Argentino de Ciencias Naturales ""Bernardino Rivadavia"", Buenos Aires; Museo de La Plata, La Plata and Fundación ""Miguel Lillo"", Tucumán. These institutions keep very important collections of molluscs in southern South America. Field information has recently been obtained and localities cited by other authors are also included in the data base. Until today, 166 species have been described, 101 belonging to 10 families of Gastropoda and 65 to 7 of Bivalvia. Families with highest specific richness are Lithoglyphidae (22) and Sphaeriidae (25), respectively. The number of endemic species (those present only in Argentina) by family is: Gastropoda: Ampullariidae (1), Cochliopidae (10), Lithoglyphidae (11), Thiariidae (3), Chilinidae (11), Lymnaeidae (2) and Physidae (2?); Bivalvia: Hyriidae (1?); Etheriidae (1?) and Sphaeriidae (10). Families with a distribution that comprise almost the whole country are: the Sphaeriidae and the gastropods Cochliopidae, Chilinidae and Lymnaeidae. Families Erodonidae and Solecurtidae (Bivalvia) were registered in mixohaline environments from Buenos Aires province. Gastropod families Thiaridae and Glacidorbiidae show a very restricted distribution. The rest of the families are present mainly in the center and north of the country. Species of sanitary interest are the propagators of: schistosomiasis -Biomphalaria peregrina, B. straminea y B. tenagophila, Planorbidae-, fasciolasis -Lymnaea viatrix and L. columnella, Lymnaeidae- and dermatitis -Chilina gibbosa and C. fluminea, Chilinidae. Invasive species are: Corbicula fluminea (Corbiculidae) and Limnoperna fortunei (Mytilidae).

The goal of the present study was to determine the potential role of frugivorous birds as seed dispersers in a restinga habitat. Data were collected in Parque Nacional da Restinga de Jurubatiba, southeastern Brazil, where the main physiognomy (Open Clusia Formation) is characterized by the presence of patches of vegetation covering 20 to 48 % of the sandy soil and reaching a height of 5 m. Birds were captured with mist nets (12 x 2.5 m; 36 mm mesh; 1 680 net-hrs) and had their fecal and regurgitate samples inspected for seeds. Six plant species found in these bird samples were studied. The germination of seeds obtained from plants was compared to those from the birds. Both groups of seeds were set on Petri dishes at room temperature and washed when infected with fungi. In general, there was no effect on germination rate, and the effect on germination speed was negative. Germination of seeds from Pilosocereus arrabidae treated by the birds seemed to be influenced by storage of defecated seeds, while few Miconia cinnamomifolia seeds both from plants and from birds germinated. Ocotea notata presented a great variation in time to the onset of germination, perhaps an advantage against dissecation. Aechmea nudicaulis, Clusia hilariana and Erythroxylum subsessile probably take advantage of the arrival to favorable microhabitats, not by the gut effect on the seeds. All plant species studied are numerically important for the community and some of them are main actors in the succession of vegetation patches. Among the birds, Mimus gilvus is an important resident species, endemic to restingas in Brazil, while Turdus amaurochalinus is a visitor and may be important for plants that fructify during its passage by the study site. Although the effect of pulp removal was only tested for one species (Achmea nudicaulis) in the present study, we confirmed that the tested effect of restinga frugivorous birds on seed germination was generally null.

Leaves began expansion at the end of the wet season, and plants reached 70 % of their maximum leaf area at the beginning of the dry season, maintaining their foliage throughout the entire dry period. Leaf shedding occurred gradually during the first three months of the wet season. Leaf flushing and shedding showed high synchrony, with leaf numbers being related to light availability. Maximum leaf production coincided with peaks in radiation during the middle of the dry season.

The presence of a calcium pump in corals has been confirmed and its temperature related breakdown underlies coral bleaching. There is also mounting evidence from stable calcium isotope ratios in the skeleton for involvement of a calcium pump in coral calcification. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is known to be generated by zooxanthellae during photosynthesis and passes easily through cell membranes. H2O2 is known to cause lipid peroxidation of the plasma membrane and make it leaky to Ca2+. In this study lipid peroxidation was measured in the tissues of Agaricia agaricites. Lipid peroxides in the light doubled from 5.83 to 11.23 μMol.cm-2 (n=17) over the first 3-4 hours then slowly decreased over the next four hours. Glutathione, which in many organisms acts as a lipid peroxidation repair system, was also found at a mean level of 79 μg.cm-2 (n=14) and probably accounts for the observed reduction of lipid peroxide levels. It is suggested that the lipid peroxidation makes the plasma membrane leaky to Ca2+ and thus provides a route by which Ca2+ enters cells of the calicoblastic layer. A model of calcification, following Adkins et al. (2003), is presented in which calcification takes place from the extracellular calcifying fluid (ECF) between the calicoblastic layer and the skeleton. The Ca-ATPase calcium pump drives calcification by actively transporting Ca2+ into the ECF and setting up pH and carbon dioxide (CO2) gradients that enhance the passive diffusion of CO2 and the formation of calcium carbonate. It is suggested that, in light, H2O2 produced by zooxanthellae makes the membranes leaky to Ca2+. The calcium pump has to work harder to maintain low internal levels of calcium and thus more Ca2+ would be actively transported into the ECF to be deposited as calcium carbonate.",8,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Ca-ATPase calcium pump | Coral calcification | Hydrogen peroxide | Lipid peroxidation,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,179,NA,22152075,NA,NA

These data represent part of a collective SST record for 206 globally-distributed coral reef sites in the Global Coral Reef Alliance (GCRA) Coral Reef SST Database (www.globalcoral.org). The temperature series covers two full decades of active climate change and marine ecosystem responses, during which mass coral reef bleaching, emerging diseases, biodiversity losses, species mortalities, fisheries declines, and reef frame degradation have been reported. Reef ecosystem changes appear when the monthly SST anomaly exceeds 1.0ºC above warm season averages, defined as a Hot Spot. If the anomaly reaches 2ºC or more and/or if the duration of the anomaly is prolonged at the same site, the ecological responses are more severe. Linear trend lines and regression coefficients for the SST at each site document both the degree and rate of temperature change, allowing comparisons to be made among sites. Impacts from coastal upwelling that circulates deep, cool and nutrient-rich water to the surface and alters the productivity of reef fisheries are embedded within the SST record. Maximum and minimum temperature exposures, yearly variations in SST, and seasonal fluctuations may be analyzed from the database. These calibrated and comparative data serve to describe how SST trends at a site contrast or conform to neighboring upstream or downstream sites. Site-specific thermal records offer a basis for developing individualized management strategies and for formulating unique conservation policies for regional reefs. The differences among temperature trends in the database may account for the degradation of some reefs and the relative sparing of others.

This network aims at promoting discussions among scientists currently involved in marine microbial studies carried out at both the South American and the Caribbean regions, in order to evaluate the research capabilities and to identify complementary strengths and/or possibilities for enhanced collaboration, that would improve the knowledge on marine microbes and their biodiversity in both regions. We present an overview and discussion on some of the directions of current research on marine microbes in these regions. Concerning the marine phytoplankton studies, the best known taxonomic groups are diatoms and dinoflagellates. In Mexican marine waters, the number of taxa recorded to date is of about 1400. Studies dealing with bacterial, phytoplankton and/or cyanobacterial dynamics are carried out in the Caribbean coastal and oceanic marine systems, underscoring the importance of various environmental states, modulated by geographic and seasonal patterns as well as by the expression of large South American rivers. One of the main issues of this type of survey is the determination of wet and dry seasonal patterns of bacterial dynamics, in seascapes off Puerto Rico, with moderate to absent river inputs. Phytoplankton and bacterioplankton dynamics are also studied in F. Guiana coastal and shelf systems under direct Amazon influence, well known for their important fisheries resources, as well as in other South American marine systems influenced by important fresh water inputs or under upwelling conditions. Bacterial and/or picoeukaryotes diversity are assessed in particular marine systems such as coastal lagoons in Uruguay, the Rio de la Plata estuary and adjacent areas, as well as in sediments of the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) off South American Pacific coast, and in anoxic waters of the Cariaco Basin. Findings of a diverse range of pico-autotrophs (Patagonian shelf) and particular communities of big filamentous bacteria (OMZ zone off the South American Pacific) represent recent discoveries in those areas. In polluted coastal systems, bacteria with ability to degrade pesticides and hydrocarbons are currently monitored. In coastal areas of the Colombian Caribbean, 64 native marine bacterial strains were isolated from sediment samples. The oil-degrading bacteria are also studied in the Orinoco Delta, submitted to intensive oil exploitation. Furthermore, the Microbial Observatory of Rio de Janeiro (MoRio) established in Guanabara Bay (Brazil), constitutes a model for the study of threatened tropical coastal systems by exploring microbial biodiversity in different coastal systems (including unpolluted sites). The estimation of the activity and diversity of hydrocarbon and oil-degrading bacteria is assessed also in temperate waters and sediments of coastal systems of Argentina. Sharing knowledge and capabilities in common strategies would allow a better understanding of marine microbial diversity patterns in both regions.",5,Journal,ar,Article,100,31,31,Marine microbial biodiversity | Microbial bioremediation | Phytoplankton and bacterial dynamics | South America and Caribbean Sea,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,184,NA,22152075,NA,NA

During that time elevated sea surface temperatures were initiating the most severe bleaching episode so far recorded for the northeastern and eastern Caribbean. Nineteen of the 20 species of stony corals within the survey were affected. The occurrence of pale, partially bleached or completely bleached colonies exceeded 50% in 13 of these species, and 76% of all colonies (n = 1475) had some symptom of bleaching. In an effort to assess the impact of this event on Dominica’s stony corals, the sixteen sites studied in 2005 were revisited in 2006 (October 17 – November 25) and resurveyed using the same methods. Twenty of the 23 species within the survey were affected, yet the occurrence of pale, partially bleached or completely bleached colonies exceeded 50% in only four of these species. Twenty-six percent of all colonies (n = 1407) had some symptom of bleaching. However, live coral cover had decreased by 28%, recent mortality had increased by 10%, and the abundance of coral recruits had decreased by 65%. Agaricia agaricites was among the most affected species having been a common coral on Dominica’s reefs until 2005, yet absent in the 2006 survey. Deep sites (6-18m) were more affected by recent coral mortality than shallow sites, undermining the extent to which they may serve as refugia. The 2005 bleaching episode in Dominica followed those of 2003 and 2004. Given the increasingly chronic nature of such events, and the common disturbances of sediment runoff (quarries, coastal development), contamination (solid waste, sewage, pesticides), and fishing (spear fishing, traps, seine nets), Dominica’s marginal reef systems are being exposed to an unprecedented load of stressors. This scenario highlights the urgency of immediate action in reducing local disturbances if the island’s coral reef resources are to have a chance of being conserved. Rev. Biol.

Traditional reef assessment methods cover too little area to accurately characterize complex reef ecosystems, miss large-scale patterns, and high intrinsic spatial variability of reefs inhibits the ability to identify changes or causes. Spatially extensive surveys provide more information, over larger areas, in less time, than intensive ones, revealing large-scale gradients that intensive methods are inherently unable to identify. Extensive surveys were carried out in Providenciales, South Caicos, East Caicos, and Grand Turk. Live coral cover averaged 10-20%, maximum around 40%. Dead coral exceeded live coral at all sites. Several past mortality events from disease and high temperature were identified. Dead offshore elkhorn reefs, which protect the shoreline from erosion, are slowly crumbling from boring organisms. Stress from sedimentation was seen down-current from the Cruise Ship Port dredging site. Unexpectedly frequent and severe, but localized, coral disease was seen at many locations, often appearing in intense patches. A special focus of the survey was identifying algae distribution across environmental gradients. 26 ecological and environmental parameters were assessed at 47 coral reef sites across TCI. Transects were parallel and perpendicular to major environmental gradients and spanned their ranges. Correlations between all pairs of ecological and environmental variables were assessed by non-parametric statistics. The matrix of all correlations and significance provided improved insight into interactions between species and their relations to environmental gradients, revealing that many diseases correlate with certain species of algae, which might be reservoirs for pathogens. High algae abundance was seen at almost all sites, with zoned gradients pointing towards nutrient sources. Most dive sites had little algae in shallows, but algae increased dramatically at the drop off edge into deeper water to the thermocline. In many shallow reefs algae zonation indicated land-based nutrient sources from outflow of creeks, marinas, salinas, fish processing plants, hatcheries, or groundwater seepage. Surprisingly high levels of algae were also seen at many remote sites with no land-based nutrient sources. Spatial zonation of algae suggest nutrient inputs from persistent localized upwelling of cold, deep, nutrient-rich water offshore. Green chlorophyll-rich surface water was noted at all sites affected by land-based sources or by offshore upwelling, suggesting widespread high natural nutrient backgrounds. Extensive methods are more cost effective than intensive ones and could be much more widely used for management purposes.

Invoking a chemistry analogy, in 1994 Hughes termed the change a “phase shift” to describe the change from a coral dominated habitat to one dominated by macroalga on the north coast of Jamaica over a period of 17 years. The loss of live coral cover is exemplified by the demise of Acropora spp. in Discovery Bay, Jamaica. Dense, monospecific high relief thickets of Acropora palmata (elkhorn coral) and A. cervicornis (staghorn coral) were characteristic of shallow and intermediate depth coral communities in the Caribbean prior to the late 1970s. In the early 1980s, A. cervicornis live coral cover was >21% at several sites around Discovery Bay, by 1987 it had declined to less than 1%. No large population of Acropora reestablished in the vicinity of Discovery Bay for nearly two decades. In 1995, A. cervicornis cover at Dairy Bull Reef (DBR) was only 0.6%. By 2004, A. cervicornis cover had increased to about 10.5%. In 2005, A. cervicornis cover further increased to 44%. This increase in A. cervicornis cover was part of the important “phase shift reversal” reported by Idjadi et al. in 2006. An isolated population of A. cervicornis exhibited similar coral cover at East Rio Bueno (ERB). In 2005, both populations of A. cervicornis bleached; however, the two populations responded differently. The population at DBR was decimated by the bleaching event and the surviving remnants were attacked by Coralliophila. At DBR, cover declined to <0.5% by June 2006.

Previous work has shown that BBD cyanobacteria can perform sulfide-insensitive oxygenic photosynthesis during the day. We report here the results of laboratory studies of a culture of the BBD cyanobacterium Geitlerinema sp. aimed at investigating metabolism during darkness. This isolate exhibited enhancement of survival supported by exogenous organic carbon sources (both sugars and amino acids) during darkness under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, with the greatest effect seen under anaerobic conditions. Thus this BBD cyanobacterium is physiologically adapted to the anaerobic, organic rich environment of BBD at night as well as the sulfide-rich, illuminated band environment during the day. Rev. Biol.

Little is known however why certain species are more susceptible to disease. This study examines coral disease prevalence and species susceptibility to disease using data collected over a four year period at 25 sites in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Twelve species of scleractinian coral were found to be affected by disease. Yellow band disease (YBD) and dark spots disease (DSD) were the most common diseases found on USVI reefs. Four diseases, YBD, DSD, white syndrome, and black band disease (BBD) were observed in three species; Montastraea annularis, Montastraea franksi and Siderestrea siderea. Siderestrea siderea was most frequently affected by disease with a total prevalence of 23%, largely due to the high number of incidences of DSD. YBD was the second most common disease and had the highest prevalence in Montastraea annularis (5.1%). BBD was most common in Colpophyllia natans (1.2%) while white syndrome was most often seen in the Montastraea annularis complex (2.9%). Four of the 12 species affected by disease had above average susceptibility to disease, and included species in the Montastraea genus as well as Siderastrea siderea. Of the 12 species with signs of disease, Diploria strigosa was afflicted least, showing only slight susceptibility to YBD. Two species of scleractinian coral, Porites porites and Diploria labrynthiformis, and two species of hydrocoral, Millepora alcicornis and M. complanata, were healthy, suggesting low disease susceptibility.",17,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Coral reefs | Disease | Monitoring | Susceptibility | USVI,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,198,NA,22152075,NA,NA

Examples include ground-truthing aerial and satellite imagery, characterizing essential habitat, assessing changes, and monitoring the progress of restoration efforts. To address some of these needs, the U.S. Geological Survey developed the Along-Track Reef-Imaging System (ATRIS), a boat-based sensor package for mapping shallow-water benthic environments. ATRIS consists of a digital still camera, a video camera, and an acoustic depth sounder affixed to a moveable pole. This design, however, restricts its deployment to clear waters less than 10 m deep. To overcome this limitation, a towed version has been developed, referred to as Deep ATRIS. The system is based on a light-weight, computer-controlled, towed vehicle that is capable of following a programmed diving profile. The vehicle is 1.3 m long with a 63-cm wing span and can carry a wide variety of research instruments, including CTDs, fluorometers, transmissometers, and cameras. Deep ATRIS is currently equipped with a high-speed (20 frames · s-1) digital camera, custom-built light-emitting-diode lights, a compass, a 3-axis orientation sensor, and a nadir-looking altimeter. The vehicle dynamically adjusts its altitude to maintain a fixed height above the seafloor. The camera has a 29° x 22° field-of-view and captures color images that are 1360 x 1024 pixels in size. GPS coordinates are recorded for each image. A gigabit ethernet connection enables the images to be displayed and archived in real time on the surface computer. Deep ATRIS has a maximum tow speed of 2.6 m · s-1 and a theoretical operating tow-depth limit of 27 m. With an improved tow cable, the operating depth can be extended to 90 m. Here, we present results from the initial sea trials in the Gulf of Mexico and Biscayne National Park, Florida, USA, and discuss the utility of Deep ATRIS for mapping coral reef habitats. Several example mosaics illustrate the high-quality imagery that can be obtained with this system. The images also reveal the potential for unobtrusive animal observations; fish and sea turtles are unperturbed by the presence of Deep ATRIS.",14,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Benthic surveys | Digital imagery | Habitat mapping | Species abundance,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,199,NA,22152075,NA,NA
