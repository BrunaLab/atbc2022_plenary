While the effects of forest fragmentation on biodiversity have been intensively studied within the remaining forests, relatively little is known about the biodiversity in tropical farmland (Daily et al. 2001, Pimentel et al. 1992). Frugivorous birds are an important group of species in tropical farmland ecosystems. Frugivorous birds are significant seed dispersers and can play a prominent role in transporting seeds into disturbed areas and setting the stage for the regeneration of these systems. Isolated fleshy-fruited trees in agricultural landscapes have been shown to attract birds, leading to an increased seed rain and seedling establishment under their canopies (Carrìre et al. 2002, Duncan & Chapman 1999, Guevara et al. 1986, 2004; Slocum & Horvitz 2000).

In order to assess the importance of pastoral areas to wild ungulates, we studied density and habitat choice of wild ungulates and cattle in Lake Mburo National Park, Uganda, the adjacent exclusively pastoral Nshara Dairy Ranch and on private land consisting of a mixture of ranching and subsistence farms. Transects, in the three land-use zones, were walked during the wet season and the data were analysed by DISTANCE sampling technique. We found significantly higher total density of wild ungulates on the dairy ranch compared with the National Park and private land. There was no significant difference in total wild animal density between the National Park and private land. Impala (Aepyceros melampus), zebra (Equus quagga), bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) and waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus) had significantly higher densities on the dairy ranch compared to the National Park. Only eland (Taurotragus oryx) density was higher in the National Park compared to private land. Wild ungulates and cattle showed a high degree of habitat overlap, generally preferring open grassland. Our study shows that high densities of wild ungulates are not necessarily associated with protected areas.

One mechanism explaining the better survival of large-seeded species is the seedling size effect (SSE) (Westoby et al. 1996): because seeds with large reserves result in bigger seedlings, seedlings from large-seeded species would have better access to light and/or to reliable water supply than seedlings from small-seeded species.

Three of these were small-seeded pioneer (Albizia procera, Acacia nilotica and Phyllanthus emblica) and the other two were large-seeded non-pioneer (Terminalia arjuna and Terminalia chebula) species. Seedlings of all the species were subjected to three light levels (80-100%, 20-30% and 3-7% of full sunlight) comparable to sunlit gaps and shaded microsites in the dry forest. After 4 mo of shade treatment, height, basal area, biomass and other growth traits, viz. RGR (relative growth rate), NAR (net assimilation rate), and SLA (specific leaf area) were determined. Etiolation and plasticity indices were calculated. Reduction in seedling height, biomass and relative growth rates and enhancement in SLA due to shade was greater for small-seeded pioneer species. Seedlings from large-seeded non-pioneer species exhibited a stronger etiolation response to shade than seedlings from small-seeded species. Phenotypic plasticity indices for basal area, plant biomass and relative growth rate were greater for the three small-seeded early successional species (A. procera, A. nilotica and P. emblica), indicating their specialization in a more favourable light environment such as large gaps and forest peripheries. The non-pioneer and pioneer species differed only in the degree of shade tolerance, and we suggest that dry forest species cannot be strictly categorized into two distinct groups (shade tolerant vs. intolerant), rather shade preference and gap preference would be the more expressive terms. Marked environmental heterogeneity in terms of irradiance and the phenology of dry tropical trees permits coexistence of species of varying ecological traits, contributing to the maintenance of diversity in the dry forest.

Generally, long corollas exclude short-billed trochilids, whereas short corollas allow access for both long- and short-billed species. At La Mucuy, Sierra Nevada National Park, Mérida, Venezuela, we studied interactions between Aphelandra runcinata (Acanthaceae) and its avian pollinators. Of 13 trochilid species reported from this site, only two, Coeligena torquata and C. eos, have bills long enough to allow legitimate access to the nectar of A. runcinata flowers. However, we observed that hummingbirds with much shorter bills were also able to extract nectar and pollinate the flowers. This is due to a reversible compression mechanism in A. runcinata, caused by the pressure exerted by the bird in flight and the physical opposition of the inflorescence. The compression mechanism observed in A. runcinata flowers is a morphological characteristic that provides mutualistic advantages for both the plant and its avian visitors. The spectrum of potential pollinators is increased by giving access to nectar even to species with short or medium-long bills. Moreover, nectar-robbing, a foraging strategy that does not result in pollen transfer common among short-billed trochilids, seems to be reduced.

Reproductive success for both partners is thus largely dependent on the dispersal of these tiny wasps. Some are known to cover substantial distances (> 10 km) using wind above the canopy. However, fig ecology is extremely varied, and hence one might also expect a diversity of pollinator dispersal strategies. We studied fig pollinator dispersal in Sarawak (2001 and 2004) and Peninsular Malaysia (2003). The results indicate substantial differences in dispersal ecology between the pollinators of monoecious and dioecious figs. Monoecious-fig pollinators were common, and species composition and rank abundances were similar between years despite short sampling periods. Substantial temporal and spatial variation in their production is thus smoothed out by long-distance dispersal. Some species whose hosts do not occur at our Sarawak site and are rare throughout Borneo were caught, suggesting exceptionally long-distance dispersal in these species. Conversely, few dioecious-fig pollinators were caught and species overlap between years was low. Dispersal range in many dioecious-fig pollinators may be more restricted. At a finer scale, among genera pollinating monoecious figs we found marked differences in flight behaviour (height and time-of-dispersal). We relate these findings to the ecology of their hosts, and discuss the implications for fig-fig-pollinator coevolution.

In 11 secondary tropical rain-forest sites (1.5-19 y) in Chiapas, Mexico, one plot of 10 × 50 m was established. Diameter and height were measured for all trees ≥ 1 cm dbh, and their survival, growth and recruitment was monitored over a 2-y period. Changes in stand structure were especially fast in the first 5 y of succession, and decreased rapidly afterwards, which resulted from similar stand-level changes in relative mortality, growth and recruitment rates. Demographic processes were negatively related with initial stand basal area, but independent of initial tree density. Basal area was a better explanatory variable of the among-stand variability in these rates than fallow age. Results suggest that asymmetric competition and resulting patterns of tree-thinning are major driving forces determining secondary forest successional pathways. Fallow age per se is a compound variable reflecting community organization at a certain point along the successional axis, while community structure drives succession. Sudden mass mortality among dominant species in some stands showed that early secondary forest succession is not always a gradual and unidirectional process.

We studied the relationship between ant body size and food size in tropical leaf-litter ant ensembles at different levels. In three plots of primary rain forest in Sabah, Malaysia, we observed altogether 50 species of 18 genera of ants (e.g. Pheidole, Recurvidris, Lophomyrmex, Paratrechina, Odontoponera) that harvested seed particles from baits of milled rice of various particle size. At colony level 'size matching' of individual foragers with their load was found only in one of 12 tested species, viz. Pheidole lucioccipitalis. However, ant species differed considerably with respect to 'seed' size used: on average, foragers of larger species transported significantly larger 'seed' fragments. This was highly significant in a subset of ant species with at least 12 records of size choice per species. But when we investigated resource partitioning within each of the three ant ensembles with a null model, analysis proved that there was a significant overlap in seed size selection of species at two of the sites, thus indicating that food size choice of foragers had little influence on niche patterns and community structure of ants. Ant species with workers that were not matched with their seed resources (viz. Oligomyrmex or Pheidologeton) engaged in cooperative 'seed' transport, mass recruitment to and in situ mastication of rice fragments. Mean 'seed' transport distance was 38.4 cm.

There were higher inter-habitat food niche overlaps within-species than between-species. Permutation tests (assessed after 5000 iterations) revealed that, for both study systems, the P-values became significantly smaller with fewer resource states, thus showing the niche overlap between species really increases after habitat alteration.

We investigated the relationship between tree size and flowering (and subsequent dying) across 18 populations from the flowering event of 2003 in order to understand the role of possible size thresholds for flowering in the life history and regeneration ecology of this monocarpic species. There was a strong positive correlation between trunk diameter and the incidence of flowering when population data were combined. However, the relationship between size and flowering was complex in that flowering occurred across a wide range of tree sizes, with almost complete overlap in size between flowering (5-79 cm dbh) and non-flowering trees (5-64 cm dbh), and with large trees in both the flowering and non-flowering state in the same population. In about half the populations studied there was no significant difference in mean trunk diameter of flowering and non-flowering trees. Nonetheless, we suggest that tree size may play a fundamental role in the life history and regeneration ecology of this species. The seedlings appear to be relatively shade-intolerant and dependent on large canopy gaps for recruitment. A significant effect of mass flowering and subsequent death of multiple large trees is the potential to form large canopy gaps and enhance seedling survival, as the gap is temporally linked with seed germination. However, it is unclear why there is such a large size range of flowering trees, i.e. whether this is just a consequence of the proximate cue, or whether the optimal size for flowering does indeed vary among individuals.

These were sited both in gaps and understorey and on alluvial and sandstone soils. Half of all seedlings were provided with a complete fertilizer. Herbivore damage levels were recorded on over 25 000 individual leaves in four surveys over the course of 2 y. Rates of herbivory were lower on mature leaves (0.07-0.8% leaf area mo-1 among species) than new leaves (2.1-4.4% leaf area mo-1). There were no overall effects of light conditions, soil type, fertilizer treatment or time on rates of herbivory. The only consistent source of variation was that between species, with the three alluvial-specialist species suffering higher rates of damage than the two sandstone-specialists. Mature leaves of alluvial species received greater damage in sandstone soils, whereas sandstone species were damaged at equivalent rates on both soil types. New leaves were more damaged on their native soil type. Published herbivory rates vary in the timescales and methods of measurement. Nevertheless, the few comparable studies confirm that herbivory rates on seedlings in tropical rain forests are remarkably constant over time and across experimental treatments.

The soil of 30 plots along six transects was characterized. The appearance of the 'dry to the touch' character at a depth of less than 1.2 m was used to discriminate soils exhibiting vertical drainage from soils exhibiting superficial lateral drainage and along with colour and texture, to define five classes from well-drained to strongly hydromorphic soils. Spatial variation in soil respiration was closely related to topographic position and soil type. Increasing soil water content and bulk density and decreasing root biomass and soil carbon content explained most of the decrease in soil respiration from the plateaux (vertically drained hypoferralic acrisol) to the bottomlands (haplic gleysol). These results will help to stratify further field experiments and to identify the underlying determinants of spatial variation in soil respiration to develop mechanistic models of soil respiration.

To examine differential growth response to soil resources, we grew seedlings of nine tropical tree species at 6.0% of full sun for 12 mo in a factorial design of two soil types (clay and white sand), two phosphate fertilization treatments (control and addition of 100 mg P kg-1) and two watering treatments (field capacity and water limitation to one-third field capacity). Species differed markedly in biomass growth rate, but this hierarchy was almost completely conserved across all eight treatments. All species grew more slowly in sand than clay soils, and no species grew faster with phosphate additions. Only Eperua grandiflora and E. falcata showed significant growth increases in the absence of water limitation. Faster-growing species were characterized by high specific leaf area, high leaf allocation and high net assimilation rate but not lower root allocation. Slower-growing species exhibited greater plasticity in net assimilation rate, suggesting that tolerance of edaphic stress in these species is related more to stomatal control than to whole-plant carbon allocation. Although relative growth rate for biomass was correlated with both its physiological and morphological components, interspecific differences were best explained by differences in net assimilation rate across six of the eight treatments. A suite of traits including high assimilation and high specific leaf area maintains rapid growth rate of faster-growing species across a wide gradient of soil resources, but the lack of plasticity they exhibit may compromise their survival in the poorest soil environments.

Numbers of seedlings dying, and the heights and leaf numbers of survivors, were recorded on 30 occasions. Survivorship after 2.5 y was 30% for M. bisulcata and 59% for the similar Tetraberlinia spp. together. After 7 y the corresponding values were 4 and 21%. Growth of all species was slow for the first 4 y; but survivors of T. korupensis became 63% taller, as the other species stagnated, by 7 y. The poor recruitment of M. bisulcata was the result of its very low seedling survival. Within species, the tallest seedlings of M. bisulcata and T. bifoliolata, but medium-height ones of T. korupensis, survived longest. This was likely due to higher root allocation in T. korupensis. Seedling dynamics of M. bisulcata and T. korupensis over 7 y accorded well with relative abundances of adult trees; T. bifoliolata is predicted to recruit later.

Species composition, richness and total captures were not directly affected by forest size per se, although the frequency of one dominant forest species (Artibeus obscurus) was significantly lower in small fragments compared with larger ones. The high connectivity among forest patches in the study area and the ability of some species to use the surrounding matrix of secondary forests and shade cocoa plantations possibly precludes the insularization effect. Qualitative habitat changes induced by fragmentation, such as edge formation and forest regrowth affected bat community structure; both modified habitats comprised a limited subset of the species assemblage found in the interiors of mature forests. The results presented here provide evidence of impoverished bat assemblages in man-modified habitats linked with deforestation and overall disturbances related with forest fragmentation.

Although the annual rainfall is high, rainfall is relatively less in June and July. Stomatal density and diameter were greater in the open than in the understorey (229 versus 167 mm-2 for stomatal density and 33 versus 29 μm for stomatal diameter). The stable carbon isotope ratio (δ13C) of leaves, positively correlated with water use efficiency, was higher in the open than in the understorey (mean δ13C -30 versus -33‰). Therefore, it is considered that leaves have high gas-exchange capacities per leaf area in the open where water availability would be limited, compared with the understorey. In contrast, leaf mass per area (LMA) was lower and leaf life span was longer in the understorey than in the open (25 versus 34 g m -2 for LMA and 2.1 and 1.6 y for leaf life span). These thin leaves with a long life span in the understorey would contribute to efficient light capture and photosynthetic production per leaf mass. The number of leaves per stem decreased during the period with less rainfall in both the open and understorey conditions, which should reduce the water loss from plants, but increased again after the period with less rainfall. Stem growth rate was higher in the open than in the understorey, and the seasonal reduction in rainfall hardly affected stem growth rate in either open or understorey conditions. This study concludes that O. pistillaris responds to canopy cover and seasonal reduction in rainfall by adjusting leaf traits and leaf phenology, respectively.

Forest inventory data revealed a peculiar pattern of tree form and size class distribution in bamboo-dominated plots within the Tambopata River watershed, Madre de Dios, Peru. Bamboo disproportionately loaded trees 5-29 cm in diameter, and this size class had over seven times more canopy damage than trees in control plots without bamboo. These differences were accompanied by reduced tree basal area and tree density in the 5-29-cm-diameter size class in the presence of bamboo. Elevated tree canopy damage was not apparent for trees ≥30 cm dbh, which are beyond the reach of bamboo. Additional evidence for the impact of bamboo was revealed by an experiment using artificial metal trees. Artificial trees in bamboo-dominated forest plots had nine times higher frequency of physical damage and nine times more plant mass loading as compared with control plots. Our results support the hypothesis that bamboo loading causes elevated physical damage to trees and suppresses tree recruitment, particularly for trees 5-29 cm in diameter.

All five species showed evidence of major and moderate growth releases. As expected, Melia azederach, an extreme heliophile, had the fewest releases. However, among the other species the number of major releases was consistent across the range of shade tolerance. The most significant difference among the species was the number of moderate releases recorded. There was a general positive correlation between the number of moderate releases and shade tolerance; however, Chukrasia tabularis, a relatively shade-intolerant species, had an anomalously high number of moderate releases. The study species also showed considerable variation in canopy accession strategies. The least common canopy accession strategy was establishment in the understorey and growth into the canopy in the absence of any gaps. However, with the exception of Melia, all four study species had one or more individuals that successfully reached the canopy using each of the four canopy accession strategies.

We used multiple data sets to test the reported association of humus with oligotrophic but non-podzolic soils under non-heath dipterocarp forest at Lambir, Sarawak. We examined the distribution, morphology and nutrient dynamics of necromass on soils derived from sandstone and shale. Concentrations of the main mineral nutrients were lower in fresh litter on the very oligotrophic sandstone soils than on shale. The rates of litterfall were similar, so that annual litterfall fluxes of all nutrients were lower on sandstone. The lower nutrient concentrations and fluxes in the litter on sandstone resulted in slower decomposition, longer residence times and larger standing crops of forest-floor necromass, with lower concentrations of nutrients. The necromass on sandstone sequestered significantly more N, K and Mg but less Ca and Mn than on shale, with no significant difference for P. The variations in necromass nutrient dynamics were associated with morphological differences. There were mats of densely rooted humus under the litter on sandstone, whereas litter lay directly over the mineral topsoil on shale. Spatial associations with soil nutrients were weak for necromass thickness, but clear for humus. The proportions of nutrients in the litterfall and necromass reflected the stoichiometric profiles of the soils. We attribute the differences in necromass nutrient dynamics and their association with soil reserve nutrients to lower rates of nutrient replenishment from the weathering of sandstone than from shale.

Three habitat types were found along the various transects (mature rain forest (MF), secondary rain forest (SF), swamp forest (SW)). The detection probabilities for these vipers were modelled with a set of competing models, and the various models were ordered by Akaike Information Criterion procedures. Two classes of models were used: the single-season model, and the multi-species model. The best models (single-season model) suggested that: for the Gaboon viper, habitat types SF and SW were particularly important in detecting this species, especially during the rainy season at 08h00-16h00. For nose-horned vipers, the best models had SW and MF as site-covariates. Application of the multi-species model revealed that there were different detection functions if both species are present at a site, with a 'negative' interaction of occupancy between the species. Females and males were similarly detectable in a logistic regression model, but feeding status and pregnancy slightly increased detection probability in a logistic regression model. Viper density was modelled by a DISTANCE sampling procedure. The density of one species tended to be inversely correlated to the density of the other, suggesting that (1) the rain-forest environment does not support abundant populations of both vipers when sympatric, and (2) the two Bitis species subtly partition the habitat resources.

Frequency of crop raiding was quantified over 13 mo. Energy and protein concentration was within suggested levels, but concentrations of several minerals, particularly sodium, were low relative to requirements based on captive elephants and values reported for other wild populations. The very low sodium concentrations of Kibale elephant diets and low availability of alternative sodium sources, such as soil or water, suggest that sodium drive is very likely in this population. Crops consumed by Kibale elephants had higher Na concentrations and lower concentrations of fibre and secondary compounds than wild diets.

However, empirical evidence relating negative density-dependent mortality to herbivory and, in particular, attack by specialist herbivores, remains rare. We investigated density dependence in a natural population of Swietenia macrophylla in a south-eastern Amazon forest of Brazil. Across 24 adult trees, we found that initial juvenile densities were positively correlated with basal area of adult conspecifics whereas subsequent survivorship over 1 y for these juveniles declined strongly with increasing basal area of adult conspecifics. For 18 trees with > 5 juveniles surviving for 1 y, further evidence supporting the Janzen-Connell mechanism was obtained in that leaf herbivory and attack by a specialist microlepidopteran moth (Steniscadia poliophaea) increased, and overall foliar condition decreased, with conspecific basal area. Moreover, when differences in mean juvenile size (number of extant leaves) were accounted for, juvenile survival over 1 y decreased with increased specialist leaf herbivory. Collectively, these results indicate that herbivores, in particular S. poliophaea, may contribute to density dependence among S. macrophylla juveniles. We conclude that the survival of juveniles and their probability of recruitment into the canopy is decreased where conspecific adults are largest and/or most numerous and find support for the importance of host-specific pests in driving density dependence among tropical trees.

Specimens were collected systematically over an entire seasonal cycle and represented individuals of all sizes. Individual prey items were removed from stomachs of preserved specimens, measured and identified. Ontogenetic shifts in prey size were pervasive. Ontogenetic shifts in prey composition were limited to four species; these were not the species with greatest range in body size, nor the species with the broadest diets. Small prey types (ants, mites, collembolans) decreased in representation and large prey types (roaches, orthopterans, millipedes) increased in importance over ontogeny; this could be because prey selection is based primarily on prey size or because of different prey preferences among age classes. There is little evidence for size-structure in this assemblage. There is no evidence that total availability of arthropod prey varies among seasons, but some evidence that preferred prey are less common in the wet season. Diet was similar between lizards and frogs. Lizards were more likely to have empty stomachs, but also greater stomach volume, than frogs; this indicates a difference in food-gathering strategies. Our study indicates strong similarity between frogs and lizards in diet despite enormous differences in physiology and behaviour.

Mean stem density was significantly greater on the upper spurs than in the lower, less-steep gullies. Stem density was also higher on spurs than in gullies within each elevation category and in each upper-elevation habitat than in its corresponding lower-elevation habitat. Basal area varied less among habitats, but followed similar trends to stem density. Species richness and Fisher's alpha were lower in the upper-elevation habitats than in the lower-elevation habitats.

This hypothesis was tested in lowland Bornean rain forest by combining measurements of leaf traits, soil nutrients and the distribution of tree species in the Dipterocarpaceae across a nutrient gradient. Nine species were studied, comprising four related pairs in Shorea (phylogenetic independent contrasts; PICs) and one habitat generalist (Dipterocarpus sublamellatus). Lamina area, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) were measured for ∼10 saplings of each species; habitat associations were defined as a continuous function of soil nutrients and categorically in relation to substrate. Species distributions and traits varied significantly with soil nutrients. When all species were pooled, SLA and leaf P increased significantly with species' distribution across the nutrient gradient; leaf N showed the same trend. Trait shifts with habitat were stronger and more pervasive when habitat was defined categorically - in all four PICs, rich-soil specialists had larger leaves, higher SLA, leaf N and P, and lower N:P ratios. Trait shifts with habitat at least partly reflect intrinsic differences between species. Within Shorea, variation in lamina area and N:P ratio were more strongly related to phylogeny than habitat, whereas the reverse held for SLA and leaf P. Phylogeny also influenced the extent of trait divergence between related species on different soils, and patterns of trait correlation within lineages. Results support the hypothesis that niche processes influence the distribution of species and traits in lowland tropical tree communities, and highlight the value of phylogenetic information for increasing the power of comparative studies.

This study examines the role of aggregation in maintaining tropical dung beetle diversity and the effects of deforestation on aggregation patterns and diversity loss. Using clusters of pitfall traps, dung beetle aggregation was quantified in natural and disturbed habitat at nested temporal and spatial scales in central Peru. The results indicate that dung was colonized by a greater number of species, many of which were large, leading to a higher total beetle biomass in forest habitat than in deforested, farm habitat. Beetles were intraspecifically aggregated at each spatial scale examined. Habitat-type (forest/deforested) had no effect on the intensity of intra- or interspecific aggregation. Analyses of aggregation patterns revealed that dung beetle assemblages in forest habitat were generally saturated whereas in deforested habitat they were unsaturated. In general, interspecific aggregation was too weak relative to intraspecific aggregation to explain the high diversity of species in forest habitat. Other mechanisms, including resource partitioning are likely to play a greater role in maintaining the diversity of dung beetle assemblages in the region. These results also indicate that the loss of species from disturbed habitat has not been due to a breakdown in the aggregation mechanism.

Community phenological studies have been constrained in their consideration of these issues by the lack of concise quantitative measures of intraspecific synchrony. We propose a novel application of Colwell's predictability indices to overcome this deficiency. Its application is demonstrated by evaluating the leaf and reproductive phenologies of 8-16 individuals of each of 20 monsoon forest tree species from northern Australia monthly for 30 mo. The indices yielded substantial additional information over that provided by summaries averaged amongst conspecifics. Marked intraspecific asynchronies in leaf flush or flowering occurred in five evergreen species and two deciduous fig species, and were associated with prolonged individual commitments to these states. Five partly deciduous species exhibited marked intraspecific variation in the seasonal extent of leaf loss. We interpret the observed variation in intraspecific synchrony in terms of contrasting water-use and pollination strategies. The synchronicity indices are concise and robust to small and variable sample sizes, and may thus enhance studies of species-rich assemblages.

Unlike many resident species that use shaded-coffee agroecosystems seasonally, RCWAs do not move to other habitats when migrants are present. RCWA foraging was compared when migrant birds were present (dry season) and absent (wet season). It was hypothesized that RCWAs would exhibit a seasonal foraging niche shift because of resource competition with migrants. Observations from both the canopy and coffee understorey show that RCWAs foraged almost equally in both vegetative layers during the wet season although they were more successful foraging in the canopy. In the dry season, migrants foraged primarily in the canopy and RCWAs shifted so that 80% of RCWA foraging manoeuvres were in the understorey. At that time RCWAs foraged less successfully in both vegetative layers. Avian predation in the dry season was found to reduce densities of arthropods by 47-79% in the canopy, as opposed to 4-5% in the understorey. In the canopy, availability of large (>5 mm in length) arthropods decreased by 58% from the wet to dry season. Such resource reductions could have caused the RCWA foraging niche shift yet other alternative or additional hypotheses are discussed.

The temporal pattern of reproduction of the population studied was highly seasonal with rearing of the offspring occurring in the first half of the warm-wet season, when the abundance of food resources - primarily insects - in the cerrado is high. Shortly after reproduction, the density of adults decreased sharply, possibly because of high post-mating mortality, leading to a gradual replacement of adults by their offspring in the following months and little overlap of generations. Our data suggest that climatic and environmental factors affect the onset of reproduction and interact with endogenous factors that decrease post-mating survival to produce the observed pattern of seasonal variation in age structure and density.

Mean FRI of the entire study area was 31.5 y (± 24.9 y SD) and MFI for landscape-scale fires was 5.6 y (± 4.1 y SD). The fire regime varied significantly with elevation and aspect. Mean FRI was 42.1 y (± 27.6 y SD) and MFI was 9.8 y (± 16.7 y SD) on moister windward zones, and mean FRI was 16.7 y (± 7.8 y SD) and MFI 4.2 y (± 1.9 y SD) in drier leeward zones. On windward slopes, high-elevation mean FRI (26.4 y) was significantly shorter than at middle (44.5 y) and low elevations (58.4 y). On leeward slopes, mean FRI did not vary significantly with elevation. The strong windward elevational patterning of the fire regime is driven by the trade wind inversion which traps moist air below 2000-2300 m. Such elevational patterns may be characteristic of montane fire regimes throughout the tropical trade wind belt.

Spider monkeys (Ateles spp.) are amongst the most frugivorous primates known, and they incorporate a diverse array of fruit species in their diets. In a 1-y study in lowland Ecuador, 670 h of focal observations and data on 916 faecal depositions were collected, and these data are used to describe the seed dispersal patterns of one group of wild spider monkeys (Ateles belzebuth) in terms of both the quantity of seeds dispersed and the primary seed shadows generated. Spider monkeys fed on the fruits of at least 152 plant species and swallowed seeds from more than 98% of these. Collected faecal samples contained seeds from at least 133 different plant species, with an average of 1.9 species (range: 0-7) per defecation. Individual spider monkeys dispersed a minimum of ∼195 000 seeds >1 mm in diameter per year, ∼35 000 of which were >3 mm in diameter. Mean retention time for seeds was 4.5 h. Seed dispersal distances averaged 443 m, but some seeds were moved >1250 m away from parental sources. These results suggest that declines in populations of spider monkeys might have a direct effect on forest dynamics, especially if other disperser species cannot compensate for their lost ecological services.

We found that total seed removal and relative importance of granivorous groups varied widely among sites and dates. Rodents were the major seed predators in all the habitats, except for the savanna/forest border where birds dominated. Ants removed more seeds than birds, but since they preferred the smallest seeds, ants ranked last in mass removed. We found a temporally variable relationship between seed removal rates and seed rain or seed bank. We inferred monthly seed predation from seed-dish experiments as well as through the decline of the seed bank in the environment during the dry season, and compared both estimations to evaluate the suitability of the seed-dish technique for estimating granivory. We initially hypothesized that seed-dish experiments that emulate seed availability more closely may yield a better estimate of seed predation, but in fact, they may still overestimate granivory intensity.

Here the bait lamina method (slightly adapted to tropical conditions) was used for the comparison of four closely situated sites (a primary rain forest, a secondary rain forest and two mixed-species tree plantations) in the Brazilian Amazon (project SHIFT ENV-52). The total feeding activity (portion of empty apertures in a set of laminae) and the vertical distribution of the feeding activity were evaluated for differences between the sites. The feeding activities in the primary and secondary forest were at the same level and significantly lower than in the two plantations. Feeding activity in subplots where surface litter has been experimentally removed was significantly lower than in the controls with the litter layer intact, at all four sites. The abundance of soil macrofauna or Enchytraeidae was not correlated with the results of the bait lamina tests, while the abundance of mesofauna (probably mainly Oribatida) was consistent with the pattern of feeding activity. The feeding activities as determined with bait laminae did not correlate with the decomposition activities determined with litterbags. Due to the easy applicability in combination with its feasibility for statistical evaluation and its consistent responses to site differences in experimental treatments we consider the bait lamina method to be a promising approach for the biological assessment of tropical soils.

Bat species assemblages were studied for a 3.5-y period in a naturally fragmented landscape in the north-west Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Bats were systematically sampled using mist nets in a total of 16 forest islands of four categories (four sites each): large (> 20 ha), small (< 5 ha), far and near (sites located > 10 km or < 1 km away from the nearest forest island, respectively). We captured a total of 1134 bats representing 17 species. Bat diversity and species richness were similar among categories of forest island. Fruit-eating bats (78-93% of captures) were significantly more abundant in large and in small than in forest islands in the far or near categories. Differences in density of Manilkara zapota trees in the forest islands might underlie the observed variations in the abundance of frugivorous bats. Distances traversed by bats (0.65-38 km) between forest islands (typically 100-300 m away), facilitates the mobility of bats across the landscape. However, the moderately rich bat species assemblage detected, suggests that other species may not be able to persist in such naturally fragmented ecosystems.

We recorded 2346 liana individuals ≥ 2 cm and 2320 trees ≥ 10 cm dbh. Sixty-five per cent of the trees hosted at least one liana stem. Large and well-lit trees were more likely to support lianas and supported more liana abundance than small and shaded trees. Yet, when trees were standardized by their size (liana basal area/tree basal area ratio), lianas were more abundant in smaller and less-exposed trees. Foliar phenology and tree species identity showed no association with the frequency of liana colonization and their abundance. Overall, tree features played a minor or even neutral role in structuring the liana community within this forest. Instead, lianas showed a positive autocorrelation at spatial scales up to 40 m. This suggests that lianas might be mostly structured by light- and dispersal-related factors such as those involving canopy access or canopy disturbances, with a negligible effect of host species identity and foliar phenology.

Seven wood-feeding species were found. Fungus-growing termites dominated the assemblage in all plots, and four species (Macrotermes michaelseni, Odontotermes sp. A, Allodontermes sp. and Microtermes sp.) were found in most. Foraging by smaller-bodied Allodontermes sp. and Microtermes sp. was largely confined to the wet season. Foraging by M. michaelseni and Odontotermes sp. A was more constant, but showed a general peak in the early dry season (May and June), likely due to nutrient and energy demands associated with alate production. Despite extensive overlap in distributions of these species, co-occurrences on baits were significantly less frequent than expected by chance. In addition, incidence in a plot of Allodontermes sp. and Microtermes sp. was negatively correlated in the wet season, as was that of M. michaelseni and Odontotermes sp. A in the dry season. Differences in body size, life history, and nest structure produce temporal and spatial heterogeneity in the foraging and distribution patterns of termites, and therefore suggest that consideration of community composition can improve prediction of the influence of termite assemblages on decomposition.

Application of N or P did not improve plant growth and primary production, addition of NP had a noticeable effect, whereas NPKS fertilization led to a three-fold increase in plant production. The four most important grasses in the analysed ecosystem responded to nutrient application with increasing growth, indicating that they all are constrained by nutrient availability, but each species exhibited a different seasonal growth pattern suggesting a temporal division of nutrient resources. N accumulated in the harvested biomass during the growth season was 50% above that of control plants when NP was applied and showed a four-fold increase when NPKS was added. With NP addition, in 2 mo plants accumulated three times more P in the harvested biomass than the control plants. The maximum N accumulated during the growth season in the NPKS treatment represented half the fertilizer N, and probably all the N added (15 g m-2) may have been used if the whole biomass had been considered. With the rather small amounts of P added to the soil in the P treatment (2 g m-2), the maximum amount of P accumulated after 2 mo scarcely represented 13% of the added P, suggesting that most of the fertilizer P became rapidly immobilized or sorbed, not being available to plants in the short term. However, the increasing growth rates of grasses during the following 7 mo indicate that some P fluxed from these pools to the soil solution and to plants.

The mosaic structure of the forest was related to variation in soils within the non-inundated terrain. Significant matrix correlation between patterns in parasitoid wasp species composition and plant species composition was found. Most of the overall correlation was due to idiobiont parasitoids of weakly concealed hosts, which attack host larvae and pupae in exposed situations, with two of the four ecologically defined parasitoid groups showing no correlation at all. A positive correlation between the number of plant species and the number of Pimplinae and Rhyssinae species at a site was found when the latter was corrected for collecting effort. Consequently, the degree of floristic difference between sites may be indicative of the difference in species composition of ichneumonids, and the species richness of plants may serve as a predictor of the species richness of parasitoid wasps. Although these results were obtained in a mosaic including structurally and floristically clearly different types of rain forest, the correlation coefficients were relatively low, and the present results lend only weak support to the idea of using plant distributions as indicators of animal distributions.

Diversity and species richness of geometrid moths were investigated at 15 anthropogenically disturbed sites in a montane area in the Andes of southern Ecuador representing a successional gradient. These plots were compared with six closed-forest understorey sites. We collected a total of 23,720 individuals representing 868 morphospecies. Local diversity increased with forest recovery and decreased with increasing distance to the natural forest. 18.6% of all species were found as unique singletons. The mean proportions of local singletons differed significantly between three succession classes. Forest understorey showed a higher proportion of singletons than early and late successional stages. Ordination of the moth samples showed a clear separation of geometrid ensembles at successional sites vs. the forest understorey sites. Patterns of species turnover were influenced by the degree of habitat openness, and to a lesser extent by elevation. However, faunal differences were not related to geographical distances between the sampling sites. In conclusion, geometrid moth ensembles of regenerating Andean montane forest remain diverse, but change significantly in composition relative to adjacent natural forest, whereas the diversity and composition of the geometrid fauna are far more strongly affected in non-forested habitats and abandoned pastures.

Oribatid communities differed significantly in species composition and density between litter and root components and were evenly distributed horizontally throughout the plot. The density of oribatid mites in the litter decreased significantly with increasing height of the ferns, and the species composition and the numbers of individuals and species in the litter were affected by fern size.

By combining direct observations of fruit consumption in tree canopies (543 h) and the camera-trapping observations of fallen fruit consumption on the forest floor (175 camera-days), we identified the frugivore assemblage that foraged on the fruits of C. euphyllum and assessed their role in seed dispersal and seed predation. In the canopy, our results showed that seeds were dispersed by a limited set of frugivores, one pigeon and four hornbill species, and predated by two species of squirrel. On the forest floor, seven mammal species consumed fallen fruits. A combination of high rates of fruit removal and short visiting times of mountain imperial pigeons (Ducula badia) and hornbills (Buceros bicornis, Aceros undulatus, Anorrhinus austeni and Anthracoceros albirostris) led us to conclude that these large frugivorous birds provide effective seed dispersal for this tree species, in terms of quantity.

Nonetheless, generalizations about the effects of disturbance are elusive, and few studies consider long-term responses of a single population or community to multiple large-scale disturbance events.

Long-term population trends of 17 species of terrestrial gastropod were evaluated to determine whether gastropods respond to hurricane disturbances in a consistent fashion. Some species increased, some decreased, and some exhibited no simple trend in density or spatial variability following disturbance. In addition, some species responded differently to the two hurricanes with respect to population density, absolute spatial variability, or relative spatial variability. Population responses probably hinge on trade-offs between sensitivity to microclimatic changes and resource availability resulting from the relocation of biomass from the canopy to the forest floor.

Trees with lianas produced significantly fewer fruits and had reduced nut fresh weights than liana-free trees. Trees with the most extensive liana loads (> 75% crown coverage) were 10.2 times more likely to have crown forms categorized as less than half-crowns or few branches than trees with reduced liana loads.

In most cases (35 plant species), experiments confirmed that these phasmids fed on those plant species from which they were collected. Partitioning of phasmid species among food plant species was highly significant. Two common species had a largely restricted diet: Asceles margaritatus occurred mainly on Mallotus spp. (Euphorbiaceae) and Dinophasma ruficornis on Leea indica (Leeaceae). Other phasmids fed on a broad spectrum of plant families and can be considered polyphagous (e.g. Haaniella echinata, Lonchodes hosei herberti). Feeding experiments were performed on captive phasmids using leaves from eight plant species. Asceles margaritatus showed a significantly higher consumption rate for Mallotus miquelianus leaves than for other plants, while H. echinata showed the opposite trend and the lowest consumption for M. miquelianus. However, A. margaritatus readily accepted foliage from several plant families, particularly when Mallotus was not offered at the same time.

Creation of canopy gaps, especially large ones, increased first-year recruitment and density, as well as overall mortality of seedlings. Saplings experienced lower mortality and more prolonged gap-enhanced recruitment and density than seedlings. Removal of understorey vegetation had little or no effect on tree seedling and sapling dynamics. Recruitment and density of lianas responded only to large gaps, whereas understorey species responded to both gap treatments and to spatial heterogeneity within gaps. Tree species exhibited diverse regeneration requirements, whereas liana and understorey species were more specialized to the high and low ends of the light availability gradient, respectively.

Tropical butterflies feed as adults on a wide range of resources and we examined the diversity and ecology of species feeding on rotting fruit and carrion in a tropical lowland rain forest in Sabah, Borneo. We found that species richness and diversity were significantly higher on carrion than on fruit, and that this pattern was repeated at genus and family level. There was little similarity in species assemblages on the two substrates and β-diversity between carrion and fruit comprised 33% of the total diversity of butterflies feeding on decaying matter. β-diversity between canopy gap and shade microhabitats comprised 21% of total species diversity on carrion but only 7% of the total on fruit, indicating greater functional diversity on carrion in terms of light preferences. Captures were strongly male-biased on carrion but not on fruit, and recapture rates were much lower on carrion than on fruit. Species from two subfamilies (Nymphalinae and Charaxinae) exploited both substrates and for Charaxinae, there was evidence from adult flight morphology that species on carrion were capable of faster more-powerful flight. These results support the notion of a distinctive carrion-feeding fauna comprising more mobile species, which may use carrion to meet additional nitrogen requirements resulting from greater musculature. However there was no relationship between flight morphology and substrate choice in the Nymphalinae, and carrion-feeding may not have a unitary explanation.

However, comparisons have usually included deciduous species within the temperate group, which confounds the analysis since deciduous species are predicted to have a different strategy with respect to investment, nutrition and defence than evergreen species. In this study we examined levels of defence and nutrition in five evergreen species of Eucryphia occurring along a latitudinal gradient in eastern Australia, grown under common conditions in a glasshouse. From the resource-availability hypothesis we predicted the opposite gradient in defence investment, i.e. that lowest levels of defence will occur in tropical species with potentially high growth rates and annual productivity. However, we found an increase in cell wall content, total phenolics and tannin activity, and a decrease in protein availability, with decreasing latitude and/or increasing mean annual temperature. Hence, there was a trend of increasing defence (although not in leaf toughness) and declining nutritional quality towards the tropics. These latitudinal trends were recorded in both mature and expanding leaves. The same trends were observed in leaves of two species collected from the field, indicating that the results were not peculiar to the experimental growth regime. The latitudinal trend in defence did not support our prediction based on the resource availability hypothesis and may indicate that herbivore pressure is providing an overriding selection pressure, although there are alternative explanations.

The aim of our study was to test this hypothesis by investigating K, Mg, Ca, Na and N-forms in rainfall, throughfall, fine litter, litter percolate and soil solution of a montane rain forest at Mt.

Fluxes of NH4-N and NO3-N were within the range observed at other montane rain forests, with NO3-N being the only nutrient partly absorbed in the forest canopies (2.9 kg ha-1 y-1 in rainfall, 0.9 kg ha-1 y-1 in throughfall).

Nutrient concentrations in seepage water strongly declined with increasing soil depth. Thus, both inputs and losses of base cations from the forest by water pathways are assumed to be low.

Individual bats consumed about 61-84% of their body mass in arthropods per night. Diet analysis revealed a high percentage of herbivorous insects, constituting more than half (51%) of all prey and over 70% of prey biomass. Dominant prey were caterpillars (33% of prey biomass), and other herbivores including crickets, katydids, scarab beetles and phasmids. Furthermore, a novel feeding behaviour was observed as M. microtis selectively discarded parts of intestines of phytophagous insects before consumption, probably to avoid intake of plant material either for ballast reduction and/or for protection from secondary plant compounds. Combined with estimated feeding rates of insects in sympatric bat species, our data suggest that gleaning bats are important predators of herbivorous insects and might be underestimated reducers of herbivory in the tropics.

We related remotely sensed vegetation to impala habitat preferences, by first distinguishing three vegetation types through a multi-temporal classification, and dividing these into subclasses on the basis of their Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This indicator for abundance and greenness of biomass was assessed for wet and dry season separately. Similarly, habitat use was assessed for both seasons by allocating vegetation classes to bimonthly impala observations. Impala distribution patterns coincided with NDVI-based subclasses of the landscape, nested within broad vegetation types, to which impala did not show a marked seasonal response. We suggest that this methodology, using limited field data, offers a functional habitat classification for sedentary herbivores, which appears particularly valuable for application in extensive areas with high spatial variability, but with restricted access.
