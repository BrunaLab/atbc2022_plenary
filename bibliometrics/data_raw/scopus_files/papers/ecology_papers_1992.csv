Seed concentration and substrate bulk-density did not markedly affect DMR, but seed concentration did alter the rate of seed harvest. Species differences in seed harvest rate were correlated with mode of locomotion, supporting the hypothesis that bipedality is correlated with specialization of the forelimbs for seed handling. In heteromyids, resting metabolic rate (RMR) was elevated by a factor of 1.5 over basal metabolic rate (BMR); DMR was elevated by a factor of 3.4 over BMR and by a factor of 2.3 over RMR. DMR, seed harvest rate, and the energy cost of scratch-digging on a per seed basis scaled with body mass to the 0.65, 0.31, and 0.33 powers, respectively. Although large bipedal heteromyids harvested seeds at more than twice the rates of small quadrupedal heteromyids, the unequal scaling of DMR and harvest rate makes them less efficient at scratch-digging. In comparison with other heteromyids, kangaroo mouse Microdipodops megacephalus was exceptionally efficient at scratch-digging. Its higher efficiency may allow it to forage on sparsely distributed seeds in open areas where the energy return would be inadequate for larger bipeds. The pocket mouse Chaetodipus baileyi was exceptionally inefficient at scratch-digging. Its low efficiency in sand may be correlated with specialization for foraging in pebbly soils. For heteromyids of a given size, factors affecting pouching rate are most likely to determine foraging efficiency because DMR is essentially a fixed cost. -from Authors",30,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an ""observer' of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. The key to prediction and understanding lies in the elucidation of mechanisms underlying observed patterns. Typically, these mechanisms operate at different scales than those on which the patterns are observed; in some cases, the patterns must be understood as emerging from the collective behaviors of large ensembles of smaller scale units. In other cases, the pattern is imposed by larger scale constraints. Examination of such phenomena requires the study of how pattern and variability change with the scale of description, and the development of laws for simplification, aggregation, and scaling. -from Author",4816,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,1,TRUE,3,all,All Open Access

Patches are physically identical and differ only in the initial proportion of species that colonize the patches. The random variation is then magnified by deterministic interactions that cause patches to follow different trajectories based on initial conditions. After a period of interaction, individuals from all patches join a global pool of dispersers that colonise a new ""generation' of patches. Complex interactions can have at least two important effects on metacommunity dynamics. First, the number of species coexisting in the metacommunity can greatly exceed the number of species coexisting in any single patch, despite the fact that the patches are physically identical, the species do not differ in colonization ability, and stochastic effects are absent after the colonization stage. Second, comlpex interactions provide a new source of variation upon which natural selection can operate at the patch level, providing a mechanism for the evolution of functionally organized communities. -Author",368,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,5,NA,NA

Arthropod abundance followed the same general pattern with numbers highest in the wet season and lowest in the dry season. Birds of all feeding guilds predominantly bred and molted during the wet season, synchronously with the highest abundance of most food resources, but diet analysis revealed a higher occurrence of arthropods coupled with a sharp decrease in the intake of vegetable matter during the birds' breeding season. The authors suggest that arthropod abundance is a crucial factor governing the timing of breeding activities, even in species that normally include a high proportion of nectar and fruits in their diet. In tropical habitats receiving >1500 mm of rain per year, breeding in nectarivores and frugivores in the dry season may be related to the lower reduction in arthropod numbers over the less severe drought period. -from Authors",192,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,6,NA,NA

Naturally occurring Q. douglasii seedlings were relatively common (280 seedlings/ha) and were strongly associated with shrub canopies. In two experimental plantings, 30% and 55% of Q. douglasii seedlings that emerged under shrubs survived for >1 yr; no seedling in the open survived in either experiment. Survival of Q. douglasii where shrubs were removed was similar to survival in the open grassland, indicating that association between shrubs and oak seedlings was not due to shared microsite requirements. Q. douglasii seedling survival was not different between the two shrub species. Only three Q. lobata seedlings were found in 26 study plots, although reproductive adults were present. The seedlings were under shrub canopies. However, the survival of Q. lobata was not facilitated by shrub cover or shrub simulation and no other evidence was found for nurse-shrub interactions with this oak species. Artificial shade was critical to the survival of Q. douglasii seedlings in simulated shrub environments. When grown in artificial shade, photosynthetic capacities and root elongation rates of Q. douglasii seedlings were significantly higher than those of Q. lobata. These differences may partially explain why nurse-plant interactions exist between shrubs and Q. douglasii seedlings but not between the same shrubs and Q. lobata seedlings. Causes of acorn and seedling mortality differed between the shrub and open grassland habitats. Under shrubs, acorn predation was the primary cause of mortality, whereas mortality due to shoot herbivory was much more frequent in the open grassland. Thus, propagules under shrubs that avoided predation until shoot emergence benefited from canopy shade and protection from herbivores. -from Author",270,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,9,NA,NA

Fireweed suffers fairly little reduction in growth from low intensity attacks, even if these attacks are quite frequent, but high intensity attacks suppress growth even at very low frequencies. Damage greatly reduces seed production and also increases the inequality in seed output from different clumps. Because the patterns in which damage is meted out are crucial in determining herbivory's effects, knowing only average amounts of tissue loss will be insufficient to predict the impacts of herbivory. Short-term impacts of herbivory cannot simply be extrapolated to longer time spans; a quantitative, modeling approach is necessary to understand herbivory's complicated effects. -from Author",110,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,10,NA,NA

Winter predation of blue tits Parus caeruleus did not simply cause an additional mortality of midge larvae, but affected both midge and parasitoid species. Some 56% of galls were parasitized, so that the average of 70% gall predation resulted in only 30% additional midge mortality. Out of the eight frequent parasitoid species, two showed positive density-dependent responses, two showed negative density-dependent responses, and four showed density-independent responses. In aggregate, percent parasitism was density independent. Birds preferentially pecked open large gall clusters and thereby caused a particularly high mortality of parasitoid species concentrated in large clusters. Selection pressure by birds against parasitoids with density-dependent responses suppressed the parasitoids' presumed ability to regulate host populations and probably altered parasitoid coexistence. Host plant characteristics affected distribution and abundance of galls, and also the subsequent pattern of parasitization and the percentage of bird predation. Such four-trophic-level cascade effects can be complex: shoot damage by stem-boring caterpillars induced side shoots, thereby increasing gall abundance and facilitating the inverse density-dependent endoparasitoid Aprostocetus gratus, since 1) gall clusters of side shoots were very small (enhancing percent parasitism) and 2) these small gall clusters were little preyed upon by birds. -Author",60,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,11,NA,NA

Perch Perca fluviatilis were stocked at three densities (no fish, and low and high natural densities) into pond enclosures with dense submerged vegetation present or absent. Perch consumed both predatory and nonpredatory invertebrates except molluscs. In vegetation, perch consumed macroinvertebrates almost exclusively, whereas in the absence of vegetation, perch successively increased their consumption of microcrustaceans. The biomass of predatory invertebrates and the abundance of the dominant predatory invertebrate Sialis lutaria (Megaloptera) decreased with increasing perch density in both vegetation treatments. In contrast, perch density had no effect on the biomass of nonmolluscan herbivores and detritivores. Vegetation increased the biomass of all macroinvertebrates and tended to delay the negative effect of perch on predatory invertebrates. Perch density had a negative effect on the mean size of total nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates, but not of predatory invertebrates and nonmolluscan herbivores/detritivores considered separately. While perch density had an effect on the diversity of only nonmolluscan macroinvertebrates (potential prey), vegetation had a positive effect on species richness (but not on evenness) of all macroinvertebrates. Results suggest that perch disproportionally preyed on predatory invertebrates, but that characteristics other than size per se were responsible for their higher vulnerability to perch. The reduction in foraging efficiency of perch in submerged vegetation, and the observed diet shift of perch towards microcrustaceans when predatory invertebrates were still fairly abundant, suggest that relatively large predatory invertebrates can coexist with fish in the littoral of lakes to a higher extent than in the pelagic zone. Predatory invertebrates may thus play a more important role in food web dynamics of littoral than of pelagic communities. -from Author",372,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,13,NA,NA

The model uses a submodel of resources renewal and depletion, and the principle that individuals attempt to maximize individual fitness, to construct habitat isolines. The habitat isoline for a population of nectarivores is a line in an abundance phase-plane along which all individuals of the population, regardless of the habitat they are currently exploiting, have equal expected fitness. At equilibrium the habitat isoline determines the distribution of a population between two habitats given a fixed abundance of competitors. The habitat isolines for populations of two species exploiting two habitats can be used to predict the equilibrium distribution of both species.

Bracken can benefit when densities of ants are high, such as when fronds are ingested with honeydew-producing homopterans, as the lepidopteran larvae were more vulnerable to attack under these conditions.

Foraging selectivity is influenced by proboscis length; because the proboscis of P. sennae is c 1 cm longer than that of A. vanillae, it is able to forage at long-corolla flowers (three Ipomoea spp.) inaccessible to A. vanillae. Relative to other nectar sources exploited by the two species, these Ipomoea species are highly rewarding energetically. Phoebis sennae increases its energy intake relative to A. vanillae by exercising greater discrimination between high- and low-reward nectar sources, avoiding several species with small nectar volumes that are avidly visited by A. vanillae. Consequently, the average foraging profit of P. sennae is nearly four times that of A. vanillae. These differences in foraging selectivity and energy intake are closely related to energy storage and depletion rates, measured as age-related changes in gross lipid contents of adult butterflies. Adult activities in the less selective species, A. vanillae, are fueled to a greater degree with lipid reserves set aside at metamorphosis; A. vanillae emerge from pupae with 13-16% of dry mass allocated to lipids, and these lipid stores decline at a variable rate throughout adult life. In P. sennae lipid accumulated from adult feeding provides the larges proportion of energy stores. P. sennae emerge from the pupa with only 6% of the dry mass allocated to lipids, and accumulate lipid stores to levels as high as 40% of dry mass through most of adult life, depleting these lipid reserves only in late adulthood. Further, A. vanillae show significant sexual dimorphism in lipid content throughout life, with females containing greater quantities; P. sennae show no such dimorphism. -from Author",32,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,25,NA,NA

Mosaic diversity measures landscape complexity and is a function of two properties of species patterns: variation in species richness among communities and variation in commonness or rarity among species (evenness).

A demand-driven functional response model that has a physiological basis in mass (energy) dynamics is reviewed (ie the metabolic pool model), and its obvious links to the logistic model are outlined. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, a distributed maturation time age-structure model of the dynamics of Nicholson's classic laboratory population data on the sheep blowfly Lucilia cuprina is developed. The model provides sufficient information on the dynamics of the intermediate life stages to show that the blow fly oscillations were due to the effects of larval competition for food on size, fecundity, and pupation success. Results agree with Nicholson's conclusions. The advantage of this model is that the dynamics emerge by considering the processes of resource acquisition and allocation as they affect growth, reproduction, and survival. No explicit time delays, which automatically lead to oscillations, were included. Lastly, the notions of the metabolic pool model are found in Nicholson's original model for equilibrium population density. The metabolic pool paradigm in an age-structure setting is used to model the tri-trophic dynamics of Acyrthosiphon aphids in an alfalfa ecosystem.

However, northern shrike males use prey from their caches to augment freshly caught prey in providing food for their mates and nestlings. Growth rate of nestlings was indeed similar to that predicted for passerines in temperate areas. However, metabolizable energy available in the cache amounted to only 7.2% of the total energy requirements of the nestlings or 4.2% of the total energy requirements of parents and nestlings during the nestling period. This suggested that other factors in addition to the cache were important in determining growth rate, including 1) an extremely low maintenance energy requirement of the nestling; 30% of that predicted for a bird of its body mass when it weighed 10 g, which gradually increased to 70% at 50 g. This allowed for more of the energy intake to be used for growth and also reduced foraging costs of males; 2) the relatively low amount of body energy retained as a fraction of metabolizable energy intake, 0.15-0.16, indicating that more water per unit growth was incorporated than in other passerines. Energy expenditure of adult males was substantially lower than that predicted for a passerine of similar body mass. Males collected 4.83 times the energy that they consumed in order to provide their mates and offspring with food. Yet, their ratio of field metabolic rate to basal metabolic rate was only 2.33, the lowest reported value for adults feeding altricial young. -from Authors",14,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,40,NA,NA

Death from premature leaf abscission increased significantly with increasing levels of branch damage, while mortality from other causes, including death from bacterial and fungal attack, declined signeficantly with increasing levels of damage. However, neither of these changes in mortality was sufficient to cause changes in overall survival. Leaf damage did not influence attack by macroscopic natural enemies (hymenopteran parasitoids or vertebrate and invertebrate predators). By far, the most important factor affecting survival and causes of mortality within trees was the presence of co-occurring larvae on leaves (intraspecific competition).

Although both male and female G. politella visited the flowers and probed for nectar, thereby passively transferring to the stigma pollen adhering to the abdomen. Visitation to flowers by all pollinators averaged 0.3-1.9 visits/h during daylight hours. Consequently, most flowers were visited multiple times during the several days that stigmas were receptive and 77% of the flowers tagged during the four yr had some developing seeds. Pollination did not depend upon visitation by G. politella. Flowers receiving G. politella eggs had the same probability of producing some seed and the same mean number of developing seeds as flowers visited only by other insects. Most flowers received the eggs of only one G. politella female, and larvae ate 15-27% of the developing seeds. Overall, G. politella females have the potential to be mutualistic with L. parviflorum; they are effective pollinators, generally visit most plants and about half the flowers in the population, and impose a fairly small cost on seed output. Nonetheless, the abundant and effective co-pollinators, which do not eat the developing seeds, swamp Greya's mutualistic effects. Under the current conditions at Granite Point, Washington, the relationship between G. politella and L. parviflorum may be mostly commensalistic. -from Authors",179,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,43,NA,NA

Artificial nests, containing Coturnix quail eggs as bait, were placed on two island and two mainland plots for representative incubation periods (15 d).

BCI nest losses were higher than on the mainland in two of the three experiments. Peak losses occurred in April-May (late in the dry season), immediately before the onset of breeding in understory insectivorous birds, suggesting nest predation may influence timing of nesting activities. Two nest types designed to mimic the nests of species now extinct from BCI suffered lower predation on BCI and on the mainland that three nest types of species persisting on BCI. However, ratios of island to mainland predation rates were disproportionately higher for BCI-extinct nest types than for BCI-persistent nests in two of the three samples.

Thus, the differential inhibitory effect of A. affinis is not caused by mechanical interference with feeding. When offered Cryptomonas and A. affinis simultaneously, small cladocerans, rotifers, and the copepod fed more selectively than large cladocerans and avoided ingesting toxic filaments.

Predation by pumpkinseed sunfish reduced snail biomass on flagging, permitting periphyton biomass to increase, as compared to exclosures. Periphyton biomass in cageless controls in Mann Lake (HDP) mirrored periphyton biomass in enclosures, whereas cageless controls in Round Lake (LDP) differed from exclosures. The periphyton assemblage changed dramatically with increasing grazing pressure. In enclosures (low grazing), filamentous algae and large, stalked diatoms dominated the periphyton assemblage, whereas in exclosures (high grazing), assemblages were dominated by small, adnate diatoms and a colonial, filamentous bluegreen alga (Gloeotrichia). Snails preferentially fed on periphyton from enclosures. Predation reduced snail density, but indirectly increased periphyton biomass, dramatically modifying species composition of the assemblage.

Variation in fruit shape did not depart significantly from that predicted by the allometry-based, null hypothesis. Deviations of individual species from the predicted allometric relationship were unrelated to dispersal mode, and originated from genus- and species-specific variation in fruit shape. There exists a considerable influence of phylogeny on fruit shape variation, and nearly half of total variance is attributable to variation among genera within families.

Survivorship of lek males through the breeding season dropped from 90% in normal years to c60%, and the total lek population at the start of the 1974 breeding season was 1/3 lower than before the droughts in 1973; the cohort of yearling males was most strongly affected. Recovery of numbers and age structure of the lek male population to pre-1973 levels required 3-4 yr. A simple model of the reproductive output of female P. superciliosus, assuming no sexual differences in survivorship, suggests that a female breeding only in the prime breeding season (roughly February-July, when >80% of fledglings are normally produced) will no more than replace herself in the population; breeding throughout 8-9 mo will permit her to increase her reproductive output by up to 10%, which agrees well with the 3+ yr required by the (male) population to recover from the drought. -from Author",35,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,76,NA,NA

Similar increases in adult survival, although not significant, occurred between 1969-1979 at a second colony of snow geese at Cape Henrietta Maria, N Ontario. These increases coincided with a decline in the proportion of snow geese being shot each year on the flyways, suggesting that reduced mortality from hunting may be responsible for the increased survival. Survival rates of fledglings over their first year decreased significantly from a mean of 60% in 1970 to 30% in 1987. This indicates that young geese have been suffering increasing rates of nonhunting mortality, most likely prior to leaving the breeding grounds or on their first autumn migration. Their increased mortality appears to be related to slower growth rates and reduced body size induced by deteriorating feeding conditions on the breeding grounds. -from Authors",104,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,77,NA,NA

Grazers and detritivores substantially reduced the amount of sediments and associated detritus accumulated on stream bottom substrata. Insect abundance was compared between a treatment where resource depression and bioturbation were simulated by removing sediments manually to fish exclosure/enclosure treatments. Grazers and detritivors again significantly reduced the abundance of many common invertebrate taxa, as well as detrital and algal resources, but taxon-specfic differences in colonization of the sediment-removal treatment suggest that several factors are important in explaining responses to fishes by insects. Sediment-processing activities by epibenthic fishes are important in explaining patch colonization for many members of the invertebrate assemblage. However, sediment depletion is not sufficient to explain the response of the abundant invertebrate, Baetis sp.1, which showed substantial reductions in cages containing fishes (open and grazer enclosures), but high densities in both the fish-exclusion and the sediment-removal treatments.

Sexual selection favors large males because they win more territorial contests than do smaller males, and females mate only in the vicinity of defended tree holes (passive female choice). Small males behave as territory holders until displaced, and/or act as subordinate satellites at large territories. Females are more predictably found in forest light gaps, even though they oviposit in both gaps and understory tree holes. Males defended only 14% of sites used by ovipositing females. Large tree holes are relatively rare, but support a greater number of emerging adults per season and produce larger adults than three holes containing ≤1 L of water, which rarely produce more than one individual per season. By defending only large tree holes in gap areas, a male increases his chances of mating, and of producing multiple offpsring and reproductively successful sons. Both mate acquisition and procurement of superior larval habitats have apparently been selective pressures in the evolution of male territory choice. Because even large holes are inadequate to support a female's entire clutch, and the presence of conspecific and heterospecific odonate larvae makes offspring survival uncertain, selection favors a female that partitions her clutch among multiple tree holes. -from Author",69,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,80,NA,NA

There are a small number of verbal and mathematical models which can accommodate synthetic, flexible views of changing, context-dependent roles of top-down and bottom-up forces in food webs. One problem lies in testing predictions when dynamic feedbacks may make outcomes highly time-dependent. Issues are illustrated, with emphasis on river food webs, concerning: positioning food webs along productivity gradients; quantifying trophic level biomass - the problem of omnivory; when to evaluate communities - the problem of incomplete recovery from disturbance; spatial circumscription of communities; and inferences from trophic level biomass accrual across regional productivity gradients.

Analysis of chick meal size and adult foraging effort (time spent foraging) indicated that blue-footed booby parents could typically feed two, but not three, chicks; brood size thus matches feeding capacity in this species. Masked boobies, however, appear to have sufficient excess foraging capacity to raise an additional chick, yet do not. The different brood sizes of these species are frequently cited to support the idea that foraging biology determines brood size in seabirds. Masked and blue-footed boobies, however, have similar capacities to provision two-chick broods; some other factor limits masked boobies, to fledging single chicks. Obligate siblicide clearly limits brood size at the proximate level in masked, but not blue-footed boobies.

Safe sites for establishment were not in gaps, although gaps may be important for successful recruitment of saplings into the adult population. Recruitment did not occur every year; mortality was high but most populations had some saplings that survived beyond the first decade. For all postfire seeding taxa (Adenostoma, Arctostaphylos, Ceanothus) no significant seeding recruitment was observed in these ancient communities. Seedlings of woodland tree species had colonized several of these old chaparral communities: however, even in stands a century old, successional replacement of chaparral was not imminent. -from Author",118,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,93,NA,NA

According to this model, offspring size covaries positively with food quantity/maternal demand at very low food levels because of reproductive constraints, but it covaries negatively with food quantity/maternal demand at middle food levels as an adaptive response, and it remains constant at very high food levels because of a lower limit on viable offspring size. Effects of genotype (clone) and ration level on trade-offs between egg size and number and on the maternal size-dependence of egg mass, brood mass, and brood size are described. Strong genotype-environment interactions are evident for egg size and number. Trade-offs between egg size and number are seen at high and low ration levels, but only in second (or third) to sixth broods, and not in first broods, which had relatively high variation in total mass. At both ration levels both egg size and number were strongly positively correlated with brood mass, independently of maternal mass. Although, at low ration, variability of brood mass usually exceeded the variability of egg mass, as expected, the opposite was true at high ration. The interclonal difference in offspring size was not correlated with survival ability under starvation. That offspring size covaried positively with maternal size and age, partly independently of culture conditions, is explained as the result of selection in growing parthenogenetic populations for increased fecundity in young small females, which are constrained to produce relatively small eggs because of spatial limitations of the brood pouch. -from Author",187,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,106,NA,NA

In years of little or no rainfall breeding did not occur, in years of abundant rainfall as many as eight breeding attempts were made by individual pairs. Maximum ages were 15y for G. scandens and 14yr for G. fortis. Males of both species tended to live longer than females and to breed later; most females bred for the first time at ages 1-3yr, whereas most males bred for the first time at ages 2-6yr.

Harmonic mean breeding population sizes were 94 G. scandens and 197 G. fortis. Effective population sizes (Ne) were much lower, principally as a result of a large variance in the production of recruits per parent, especially by G. fortis. Average effective sizes were 38 G. scandens and 60 G. fortis by one method of calcualtion.

Some taxa, primarily alien species, were more abundant in the presence of ants. Invasion of Argentine ant has locally reduced the abundance of many endemic species in the shrubland ecosystem. Although the spread of this ant species is slow, I. humilis appears to have the potential to invade a much larger area of Haleakala National Park than it now occupies. Active management of Argentine ant populations will be necessary if the endemic fauna is to be preserved. -from Authors",249,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,133,NA,NA

Trait values often translate nonlinearly into fitness components such as offspring number or growth rate. A nonlinear relationship between phenotypic traits and fitness implies that the expected value of the fitness component will be a function of the arithmetic mean and variance in the traits influencing a given fitness component. The maximum expression of traits is often, however, a function of reproductive effort. Reproductive effort then influences the mean and variance in traits that affect fitness. Consequently, we can use these techniques to determine the optimal allocation of resources to current reproduction via their effects on the distribution of trait values. The optimal pattern of allocation is influenced by the quality and variability of the habitat and by the curvature of the trait-fitness relationship. The full range of adaptive responses, from semelparity to different degrees of iteroparity, can be predicted from the model. The model is extended to cases where reproductive effort can be partitioned into different offspring types, as offspring produced through chasmogamous and cleistogamous flowers. When more than one type of offspring is produced, then reproductive risks can be spread across offspring types and the conditions favoring semelparity are less restrictive. Semelparity is especially favored if the offspring types exhibit negative covariance in their contributions to growth rate. -from Authors",29,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,146,NA,NA

The population received few successful immigrants, even at low densities; its dynamics were thus driven by local events. Reproductive output was strongly depressed at high densities because of an increased rate of nest failure and a decline in mean clutch size. Greater nest failure at high density was due to increased predation on eggs and nestlings. Nest failure increased with the rate of nest parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds Molothrus ater and was lowest when cowbirds were absent from Mandarte, suggesting that cowbirds either cause or facilitate nest failure. Rate of juvenile recruitment was inversely related to density of adults, because of interference competition for breeding territories between adults and yearlings. Survival rate of adults was independent of population density.

Fine root production and mortality occurred simultaneously throughout the year, and production was slightly greater than mortality at both depths. Total root length peaked in the summer at both depths, and overwinter production and mortality was rather low. Roots near the soil surface were undergoing much more rapid rates of browning that deep roots. -from Authors",348,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,154,NA,NA

Population sex ratio was significantly male biased in only one stand but was male biased when data from all stands were combined. Stand sex ratio was not related to age structure, stand density, or local competition intensity (based on separation distance/size regressions). Male trees were significantly taller and had greater diameters in only three stands. In the combined data from all stands, however, there was a greater representation of male trees among the larger diameter trees and among the taller trees. Male trees were also significantly taller in the pooled data set. Results suggest that female trees pay a slightly but significantly greater cost for reproduction in terms of reduced vegetative growth, but the effects of close neighbor proximity did not depend on a neighbor's sex, and male and female trees were randomly distributed relative to each other. Hence, males and females appear to compete with similar intensities against each other and are not spatially segregated into separate ""niches'. The overall greater height for males may be interpreted as a consequence of sexual selection, as greater height in male trees would confer greater success as a pollen donor, especially in dense monospecific stands characteristic of this species. -from Authors",60,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,155,NA,NA

Comparing clipped-unshaded plants with unclipped-shaded plants revealed that, for both grasses, compensation for defoliation was complete in total yield, yield of live tissues, crown mass, root mass, and total number of leaves. Greater defoliation tolerance of the short-statured species was due to much greater tillering, significantly greater N accumulation, greater allocation to leaf blade and sheath, less allocation to crown and root, a greater foliage concentration per unit canopy volume, a lower rate of foliage death, and the ability to sustain a considerably higher leaf area per unit of plant mass. -from Author",50,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,161,NA,NA

Although M. sexta has three mechanisms for reducing the toxic effects of nicotine, nicotine has a dose-dependent growth-inhibiting effect on third-instar larvae at dietary concentrations ranging from 0.25-8.0%. Thus, herbivory by adapted species, as well as nonadapted species, can potentially select for higher levels of defensive chemicals in plants. At higher concentrations, where the effects of nicotine are most pronounced, growth reduction is associated with reduced consumption (which reduces the amount of food assimilated) and an increase in the duration of the instar (which increases the amount of the assimilate pool that must be allocated to maintenance metabolism), thus leaving less assimilate for allocation to growth. The processing of host plant allelochemicals does not impose a significant energy demand on M. sexta, and the energy costs of allelochemical processing are unlikely either to constrain the expansion or to drive the contraction of the host plant range. The concept of metabolic load is therefore not a useful one in understanding the effects of plant allelochemicals on the growth and efficiency of food utilization or in explaining the evolution of dietary specialization of lepidopteran herbivores. -from Authors",81,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,169,NA,NA

Offspring fitness was evaluated by exposing newly hatched larvae to interspecific tadpole predators and assessing the effect of ovum size on the probability of surviving predation. Embryos that developed in colder ponds took longer to hatch and hatched at a larger size. Larger size afforded larvae significant protection from predation. Larvae that developed from large eggs in cold ponds had a higher probability of surviving predation than larvae that developed from small eggs. A significant interaction between egg size and developmental temperature, however, resulted in larvae that developed from large eggs in warm ponds having a lower probability of surviving predation. Larger eggs resulted in larger snout-to-vent lengths at all temperatures. In warm ponds, however, tails of larvae from large and small eggs were of equal length. Thus, diminished locomotory ability due to larger amounts of inert yolk can be invoked to explain the increased susceptibility to predation of larvae that developed from large eggs in warm ponds. In cold ponds tail length was substantially greater than in warm ponds, and larvae from large eggs tended to have longer tails than those that developed from small eggs. This allowed larvae from large eggs to achieve the advantages of increased body size. Environmental uncertainty can result in the natural selection of developmental plasticity in egg size, even though the fitness ramifications are realized in subsequent stages. Thus, increased maternal investment in offspring is not necessarily associated with an increase in offspring fitness, and the evolution of developmental plasticity in egg size may be the result of environmental uncertainty during the larval stages of life. -from Author",141,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,172,NA,NA

Trees were the main component of the realized niche of ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycetes, but the fungal symbionts of a particular tree species followed that tree species for only a part of the abiotic gradients over which the host tree was found. This type of distribution predicts that beta diversity of fungi would be generally higher than beta diversity of ectomycorrhizae-forming trees. It also means that the ratio of fungus species richness to woody species richness would be high for most community gradients. Results agree with these predictions. -from Authors",80,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,174,all,All Open Access

When 10% of a plant's leaf area was removed from single reproductive branches 3 mo before the main flowering season, those damaged braches grew less and produced 80% fewer viable seeds than did similar branches on control plants and plants that lost 10% of their leaf area, but with the losses scattered throughout the plant. Plants with damage concentrated on one reproductive branch grew less overall and produced fewer seeds than plants of the other two treatments. Thus, restricted movement of resources in P. arieianum following leaf damage to single reproductive branches resulted in decreased whole plant fitness. When this same experiment was conducted at the time of flowering, there were no differences among treatments in seed production or growth, either at the branch or plant level. Resources necessary for fruit production are thus accumulated before flowering and not subsequent to it. In 32% of plants in which damage was concentrated, seed production was reduced due to either abortion of the damaged branch (17%) or abortion of its bud inflorescences (15%). In the remaining 68% of branch-defoliated plants, neither level nor timing of flowering was affected by the experimental folivory, suggesting that reduction in seed production was due to a decrease in resource availability and not to a lack of pollinator visitation. -from Author",145,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,175,NA,NA

In mixture, absolute reductions in biomass and flowering due to competition were greatest at high soil fertility and low disturbance, and the species of most extreme strategy became restricted to areas of the matrix broadly consistent with those predicted by strategy classification. In pure stands, the effect of competition remained relatively constant across the stress-disturbance matrix for all species except Poa annua, which was less restricted by competition at high intensities of stress.

Juvenile pumpkinseeds feed primarily on soft-bodied littoral invertebrates and compete with small L. macrochirus, while adult pumpkinseeds feed extensively on snails. Pumpkinseed and snail populations were compared in two Michigan lakes that contain bluegill (Three Lakes II and Three Lakes III) with populations inhabiting Wintergreen Lake, a lake lacking bluegill. In the absence of bluegill, pumpkinseeds were abundant and juveniles grew well; however, snail abundances were low and adult pumpkinseeds grew poorly. No ontogenetic diet shift to snails occurred in Wintergreen Lake, and the pharyngeal muscles and bones used to crush snails were smaller than in fish from Three Lakes II. Pumpkinseeds from Wintergreen Lake also required significantly more time to crush and handle thick-shelled snails, but not thin-shelled snails and nongastropod prey, than did fish from Three Lakes II. The changes in Wintergreen Lake occurred in response to the selective elimination of the pumpkinseed's juvenile-stage competitor, the bluegill, via a winterkill event in the late 1970s. Removal of bluegill released juvenile pumpkinseeds from competition and increased pumpkinseed recruitment into the adult stage, which resulted in the overexploitation of the adults' snail resource.
