Handling time for the large worms was manipulated so that small worms on average yielded 8-13 times more energy per unit time of handling. For the experimental design where prey were encountered in pairs the model predicts a switching from selective foraging on small prey to selective foraging on large prey and unselective foraging at the switching distance. Mealworms were presented at three distances from the nests where the model prescribed: 1) selective foraging on small prey; 2) selective foraging on large prey close to the switching distances; 3) selective foraging on large prey. Three of 4 birds selected small worms at the short travelling distances as the model predicts. All birds delivered prey from the intermediate distance presentation in a fashion not deviating from chance, although the model in this case predicted selective foraging on large prey.

The habitat distribution pattern may act to stabilize predation. In 1974, the number of breeding goshawk Accipiter gentilis pairs was 25. In 1976-77 the tetraonids had an exceptionally deep population low and in consequence the goshawk population crashed to the level of c.10 breeding pairs.

The proportion of tetranoids in the diet decreases strongly during summer, especially when the young of corvids fledge. The goshawk showed no clear numerical response to fluctuations in hazel grouse densities. There was a marked functional response, but the form of the response curve was atypically concave.

Removal of these established blackcaps shows that some of the area which they settle is acceptable to garden warblers and is occupied by the latter only in the absence of blackcaps. Some portions of available habitat are not settled by garden warblers when blackcaps previously established there are removed, and so are apparently suitable for blackcaps only. The 2 species are partially segregated by habitat but otherwise compete strongly for space, with the earlier-arriving blackcaps being able to exclude the later-arriving garden warblers from areas acceptable to both species.-from Author",45,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,20,NA,NA

Experimental removal of breeding pairs and erection of artificial nests late in the breeding season demonstrated that there were no-breeding birds capable of breeding when nests became available.

Metabolic rate increased throughout the post-larval interval. In spawning animals metabolic rate was c.4 times higher than in early metamorphosing lampreys. Metabolic compensation among lampreys from vastly different temperatures regimes was suggested, due to a remarkable similarity in lipid accumulation immediately prior to metamorphosis.-from Authors",12,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,39,NA,NA

Paradoxically they lack the ability to survive desiccation of this ephemeral habitat. A reduction in the duration of aquatic stages increases the chances of an individual emerging as a fly before the pool it inhabits dries, and periods from egg to adult may be as short as 12 days. In the laboratory, emergence occurs over a 40-day period and females vary from 100-500 mu g weight. Adult females size relates positively to number of ovules, and to flight duration in the laboratory, ie. to fecundity and dispersal ability. Since pools are ephemeral, dispersal is necessary to provide offspring with a chance of survival; hence, larger females are more fit than smaller ones. Because pools evaporate, population density changes conspicuously during development. At initial low densities, safe, early emergence produces small females; increased risk for larvae emerging late is compensated for by achieving larger and therefore fitter adults. At high density, when habitat extinction is imminent, females emerge earlier but are also larger. The adaptive value of the life style is compared with a species able to survive desiccation, Polypedilum vanderplanki, which has a long larval life, significantly less size variation, an inability to survive high larval population densities and a poor dispersal ability. -from Authors",50,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,40,NA,NA

From birds found breeding, the annual survival of a small sample of cocks aged 2-9 yr was estimated at 46% and for a large sample of hens aged 2- 9 yr at 64%. From the persistence of individual hens from year-to- year in the breeding population, annual survival was estimated at about 66%.

The territories provided a renewing food supply (insects) and an owner's feeding rate depended on time allowed for resource renewal between visits to a stretch. Territory owners often spent the day moving repeatedly back and forth between their territories and the flocks. A model is rejected which predicts the optimal time allocation between territory and flock to maximize an owner's daily feeding rate. Owners still spent time on territory even when, in the short term, they would have had a greater feeding rate by spending the whole day with the flock. Data provide some support for a model which assumes that the territories are defended as a long-term investment and that the periodic visits to the territory are to prevent intruders, which settle in the owner's absence, from feeding at a profitable rate and hence persisting in their trespass. Owners sometimes shared their territories with a satellite, which only spent time on a territory when the feeding rate was greater there than in the flock.-from Authors",58,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,42,NA,NA

Species feeding in the woody vegetation moved on by mid-January, presumably farther south, and then returned in smaller numbers during April. The arrival in November appeared to be largely the result of typical long- distance nocturnal migration. It is suggested that the migrants have adopted the strategy of always living in areas with an abundance of resources and moving on when these become reduced; and that the only real difference between the so-called Palaearctic migrants and those that migrate within Africa is that of distance moved.-from Author",22,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,43,NA,NA

Zacryptocerus varians and Camponotus (Colobopsis) sp., have a distinct major worker caste. Ergonomic theory suggests that species with more complicated caste structure will have reduced colonizing ability. Pseudomyrmex elongatus places its nests in the periphery of mangrove trees. Because this will reduce the frequency with which aggressive species are encountered, it has an advantage in colonizing ability.

Habitat and seasonal differences in diet are attributed to the local availability of preferred food types (in particular, grass). Time spent feeding increased with altitude due to a combination of increasing temperature-dependent energy requirements and declining habitat quality. Resting time was used as a reserve store from which additional feeding time could be drawn; social time was conserved. Day journey length increased as a linear function of band size because the increase in food requirement with altitude was exactly offset by a corresponding increase in food density. Although range size was also a linear function of band size, the amount of graze required to support one animal increased with declining ambient temperatures.-from Authors",116,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,46,NA,NA
