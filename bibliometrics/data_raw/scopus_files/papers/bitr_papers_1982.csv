The relationship between total litterfall (1.0-15.3 t/ha yr, excluding large wood) and T/P was significant; litterfall was highest in tropical moist forest life zones and lower in wetter or drier ones. The turnover time of biomass in mature tropical forests is similar for all life zones, and is of the order of 34 yr. The total tropical and subtropical basal and altitudinal forest area of 1838 million ha comprises 42% dry forest, 33% moist forest, and 25% wet and rain forest life zone groups. Data yielded a total storage of 787 billion t organic matter, with vegetation accounting for 58, soils 41, and litter 1%. About half of the total storage was located in the tropical basal wet, moist, and dry forest life zone groups. Litterfall data result in a total litter production in tropical forests of 12.3 billion t organic matter/yr. Most litter was produced in the tropical basal moist forest group (30%) and least in the tropical basal dry forest group (10%). Turnover time of litter in tropical forests was <1 yr. Lowest turnover times were in very wet (1 yr) and in dry (0.9-1.9 yr) life zone groups. -from Authors",577,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,23

The achlorophyllous seeds were in fruits with large seeds, fruits with many seeds packed in layers, or in fruits borne in locally shady habitats. The presence of a chlorophyllous developing embryo adds significant complexity to the already-complex parasite-host relationship of the embryos that are developing in the fruit, in that fruit and seed-coat traits are evolutionarily affected by transmission of light to the embryo and a photosynthetic embryo may be able to develop more independently of the parent than can an achlorophyllous embryo. -Author",13,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,24

In dense dry-season populations, mixed groups of males have been observed to court a single female. She becomes receptive through recognition of the pheromone produced by the conspecific majority males, but may be mated by a transpecific minority male in the courting group, leading to accidental interspecific hybridization. All 5 interspecific matings observed in Sumare, Sao Paulo, Brazil, were between a female of the more-abundant species, M. polymnia casabranca, and a male of the less abundant M. lysimnia lysimnia. The F1 hybrid can probably backcross to both parental types, as many recombinant phenotypes are represented in the 48 presumed hybrids known from 6 localities, among >36 500 parental types sampled or marked during 7 yr. The small interspecfic introgression may occasionally be important in the evolution of these mimetic butterflies. -Authors",5,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,25

This hypothesis is supported by demonstrating a positive correlation between howler feeding aggregate size and Trichilia DBH (diameter at breast height), since DBH, in turn, predicts accurately both the spatial sizes and crop sizes (numbers of ripe fruits) of Trichilia patches. Some observations support the explanation that howlers were sensitive to the densities and abundances of ripe fruits within patches and not to the spatial size of patches per se. Small feeding aggregates were underrepresented in large patches, indicating that feeding aggregate size is adjusted to and not merely limited by patch size. To account for this, a hypothesis is proposed that howler feeding aggregates are often part of larger foraging units (the group of animals maintaining contact while ranging) which travel between clumps of food patches; reaching a clump, the monkeys apportion themselves among the patches according to the sizes of the patches. That howlers were seen feeding more frequently in Trichilia that are near to Quararibea asterolepsis trees (the other major food source at this time) supports this explanation. Groups of animals can thus maintain cohesion while using patches too small for the entire foraging unit. -from Authors",118,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,29
