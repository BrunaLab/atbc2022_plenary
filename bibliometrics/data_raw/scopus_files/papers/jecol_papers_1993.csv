The four species coexisted by partitioning establishment site with respect to the amount of overhead cover and the type of forest floor microsite.

Five fires occurred at 100-200yr intevals in prehistoric time. Since settlement, fires have been rare and cedar dominates the pollen profile. During the past two centuries timber cutting has become a significant factor in the vegetation dynamics of this system. In the 19th century intensive cutting resulted in the establishment of cedar. During the first half of the 20th century, light timber thinnings favoured Acer rubrum (red maple) regeneration. In the past few decades, neither cedar not its principal associate, red maple, have regenerated beneath the undisturbed cedar overstorey. Vegetation composition and successional trends have largely been controlled by allogenic factors in both pre- and post-settlement times. Vegetation changes resulting from autogenic factors are not evident during the 1000-yr study period. Age-structure analyses of modern stands in combination with fine-resolution pollen analyses are useful in comparing current vegetation dynamics with those of earlier times. In the 600-800 yr before establishment of the current mature stand, cedar did not persist for more than 100-200 yr without stand-regenerating fires. Thus, the survival of the current stand much beyond its present age of 150 yr would be atypical compared to the centuries prior to settlement. The present lack of cedar regeneration suggests that a management policy exluding disturbance would evenutally lead to a decline in the importance of cedar. -from Authors",27,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,3,NA,NA

Although R. mangle and A. germinans are both flood tolerant, the species respond differently to flooding in terms of growth and biomass partitioning, particularly when the soil is strongly reducing and sulphide is present. Flooding under reducing soil conditions resulted in a 20-40% decrease in total biomass of A. germinans seedlings, whereas seedling biomass was increased 9-24% above drained controls in R. mangle. A significant decrease in root oxygen concentrations in response to reducing soil conditions and sulphide was observed in A. germinans, but not R. mangle.

Metapopulation growth was faster when the heterogeneity was at a larger-scale spatial pattern. Temporal heterogeneity had an adverse effect when added to the existing spatial heterogeneity; strongly dispersing metapopulations were affected only slightly, while those with only moderate or no dispersal became extinct. The more frequently the environment changed, the greater was the probability of extinction. Model simulations were repeated for more-severe density-dependence.

Matrix analysis was due to calculate the finite rate of increase λ for each population and to calculate the elasticities of each transition coefficient in the matrices. Elasticities were summed within each of the six regions of the matrix to give measures (E1-E6) of the importance of each component of the life cycle to λ and fitness.

The geographical groups summarize the range of ecological variation across upland Scotland and can be regarded as a biogeographical classification. Two major biogeographical contrasts were between: 1) the highest and marginally lower sites, and 2) E and W Scotland, with particularly low diversity in the Southern Uplands.

Shrub establishment in two areas of the Park coincided with anthrax epidemics that drastically reduced the impala Aepyceros melampus population.

Thus, germination rate had essentially no effect on population growth rate. Clonal development of already-established ramets was the most important pathway to population growth. Simulated harvesting rates of only 5-15% were sufficient to bring the population growth rates below the equilibrium value, predicting a population decline. -from Authors",114,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,38,NA,NA

These environmental variables account for much of the variation in assemblages of plant communities within nine major biogeographical groups of sites. The first PCA axis defines a gradient of increasing oceanicity from east to west (21.3% variance) and the second axis contrasts high sites forming extensive montane summits with somewhat warmer lower-altitude sites with little or no montane ground (17.5% variance). Precipitation has strong correlations with both axes. Grouse-moor management and small-patch burning are strongly correlated with the least oceanic areas. Site-community data were ordinated without an environmental variables using detrended correspondence analysis, and then with the environmental variables included using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The first two CCA axes explain 18% of the total variance in the vegetation with a clear pattern of geographical separation of sites separated on the axes. Axis 1 is strongly correlated with oceanicity and the number of wet days. Axis 2 is strongly correlated with maximum altitude. Axis 3 is correlated with latitude and summer temperature and gives a N-S division based on the extent of anthropogenic vegetation, showing that secondary changes have occurred regionally as well as locally. -from Authors",31,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,39,NA,NA

Irrespective of the difference in the degree of crowdedness, these three shoot populations converged to the same size structure in height and weight as they grew, suggesting a regulatory mechanism between shoots. Two types of shoot growth pattern were inferred for the uneven-aged dense shoot population which consisted of young small replacement and old established shoots: type 1 has a linear G(t,x) function (mean of absolute growth rates of shoots of size x at time t in the diffusion model) with respect to x together with the size-independent D(t,x) function (variance of absolute growth rates of shoots of size x at time t in the diffusion model) whereas type 2 has a concave G(t,x) function with respect to x and/or positive growth rate for the smallest shoot in the stand (in this case, the functional effects of D(t,x) are generally small). In both cases growth of small young shoots is guaranteed or supported but not suppressed by large old shoots either stochastically (type 1) or deterministically type 2), thus leading to little variability in shoot size, even in the uneven-aged crowded stand which can be regarded as an extreme situation of asymmetric competition. -from Authors",82,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,40,NA,NA

Plant response to P was slight: a small stimulus at very low addition rates and a depression at high rates. Arbuscular mycorrhizal infection was well controlled by benomyl addition, but fecundity in this annual grass was scarcely affected either by P or benomyl application. Only at one of the four sites did benomyl application alter fecundity: it increased both number of seeds per plant and mean seed mass. Percentage infection was a positive covariate of plant performance at two sites, unrelated at one, and a negative covariate at one, suggesting that infection can be beneficial, neutral or deleterious depending on conditions. Benefit may have been protection from pathogens: at one site where Fusarium oxysporum had been abundant, no effect of benomyl could be detected, as would be expected if both the mycorrhizal and the pathogen fungus were eliminated. -from Authors",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,41,NA,NA

Tree mortality results either from thinning due to local crowding or from gap formation. Trees surviving gap formation contribute to regeneration in a newborn gap. Using permanent plot data from a warm-temperate rain forest, simulation for a whole tree population converged to a unique equilibrium state with a stationary stand age distribution and a stationary size distribution in each stand. The dynamics of a multi-species system composed of representative canopy, subcanopy and understorey species was also simulated. Results showed convergence to a stable equilibrium coexistence within a limited range of species parameters. Although stable coexistence also resulted from the model without stand mosaic by means of the trade-off between potential maximum size and potential recruitment rate, inclusion of gap dynamics in the model widened the range of coexistence in this trade-off space and reduced the time for convergence to equilibrium. Gap dynamics provided further possibilities for coexistence by various trade-offs, eg between potential size growth rate and susceptibility to suppression of size growth rate. Results suggested the importance of vertical and horizontal structure of forest in maintaining tree species diversity. -from Author",255,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,42,NA,NA

Exclusion of roots of neighbours was accomplished using steel tubes sunk in the soil of openings. Adult neighbours affected emergence, survival and performance of seedlings in the whole observed range of opening sizes (10, 20 and 30cm in diameter). With neighbours present (no root exclusion), seedlings produced few tillers regardless of opening size, and had higher survival only in the 30cm-diameter openings. Number of adventitious roots of seedlings was reduced when growing in the presence of active roots of established conspecifics. Root density of established plants in undisturbed openings did not increase signifincantly due to the experimental watering, suggesting that the negative effect of neighbours was associated with extant roots. Root exclusions provided a favourable environment for seedling establishment. Results strongly suggest that below-ground competition by adult B. gracilis plants negatively influences establishment even after development of adventitious roots of seedlings. -from Authors",95,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,43,NA,NA
