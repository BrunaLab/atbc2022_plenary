We report age-specific survivorship of founding kings and queens and colony age of first production of fertile progeny (alates) of two cohorts, containing 52 and 42 complete colonies, respectively, in the primitive dampwood termite Zootermopsis nevadensis ssp. nevadensis. 2. Longevity of kings and queens was determined and compared in various experimental manipulations of reproductive structure of incipient colonies (removal of king or queen or both vs. unmanipulated pairs as controls) performed one year after pairing. Life span of reproductives was also evaluated in circumstances of interactions between young colonies, a treatment inspired by field observations of natural nest spacing and intraspecific competition between young dampwood termite colonies. 3. In our first experimental series, founding pairs survived 2-7 years (x̄ = 4.5 ± 0.3 SE) after pairing. Kings lived significantly longer (x̄ = 4.7 ± 0.3 years after pairing; range 2.2-7.3 years) in treatments initiated as pairs than when left as the remaining founder in the queen removal treatment (x̄ = 3.2 ± 0.6 years after pairing; range 1.5-5.3 years), even though one or more female replacement reproductives differentiated within several months after queen loss. Queen life span in the absence of kings averaged 4.9 ± 0.4 years (range 3.6-6.3 years) after pairing, not significantly different from the life span of queens living with kings. There was no significant difference between king and queen life spans in non-interaction treatments in our first experiment. Results from the second experimental series (35 colonies) are presented to date. 4. Survival of pairs until death of one mate was significantly shorter in interaction treatments compared with control colonies, suggesting that intraspecific competition between young colonies may create opportunities for replacement reproductives. 5. The first alates were produced between 1.8 and 6.5 years after pairing in our first experimental series, and between 2.4 and 5 years, to date, in the second experiment. 6.

Species-abundance patterns of larval chironomid assemblages in a large river were tested against seven niche-oriented models, using data on abundances measured monthly at four sites along a cross-section of the River Danube in Austria. 2. Expected abundance patterns generated by computer simulations were tested against two categories of assemblages: all species found and the dominant species only. Within each category, the whole river cross-section was compared with the four single sites, and three functional feeding groups were analysed separately. For all assemblages, species-and process-oriented approaches concerning the correspondence between species identity and abundance ranking were used. 3. When all 81 species found within the river section were included, none of the models agreed with the observed process-oriented patterns, whereas the distributions of collector-gatherers, filterers and (at a single site) grazers fitted the Random Fraction model. This model indicates that the species divide the niche space in a random fashion, with no hierarchy of dominance. None of the models fitted the species-rich assemblages using the species-oriented approach. 4. When only the most abundant species were considered, several of the models fitted the observed assemblages. The Random Assortment model provided best-fits most frequently, suggesting that relative abundances of the species are completely independent. However, the Random Fraction model agreed with observed patterns of abundance in about 50% of cases when the Random Assortment model provided a good fit. 5. Only 25% of all species-oriented patterns of the most dominant species were described by the seven models, mostly by the Random Assortment model. However, species classed as filterers showed a tendency towards more even distributions according to the MacArthur Fraction model and the Dominance Decay model. 6. Results suggest that the Random Fraction model corresponds best with species-rich assemblages whereas this model combined with the Random Assortment model may provide a good explanation for patterns formed by the (relatively few) most dominant species. The species-oriented approach might be a valuable additional form of analysis for uncovering tendencies in abundance patterns which could be overlooked when focusing solely on the process-oriented approach that is usually used.",26,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Functional feeding groups | Relative abundance distribution | Running waters | Stochastic models.,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,2

Body-size may be an important feature of the structure of food webs. Detailed food web data are however scarce, particularly those including ontogenetic dietary shifts within species. We examined the predator guild in a well characterized food web, that of Broadstone Stream (UK), to assess the importance of body-size within and among species in relation to intraguild predation and niche overlap. 2. In agreement with recent food web theory, mutual predation and cannibalism were frequent and occurred in many pairwise permutations. This intraguild predation was strongly asymmetric, being determined by relative body-size within and among species, and seasonal 'ontogenetic reversals' in trophic status arose when generations overlapped. 3. Predator size determined dietary overlap, with ontogenetic shifts often outweighing taxonomic differences. Small predators had the narrowest diets, regardless of species, and were limited to feeding on a restricted subset of the total prey size-spectrum. Niche overlap decreased as pairwise differences in body-size increased among and within species. Overlap in diet also tracked seasonal changes in resource availability, being highest in summer, when prey were abundant and small, and declining progressively over time, as prey became scarcer and/or larger. The small predators also became more detritivorous as prey abundance declined and the larger prey species attained size-refugia. 4. The body-size constraints driving feeding relationships within the predator guild, in terms of both resource partitioning and intraguild predation, lend support to recent niche models of food web structure (Warren 1996; Williams & Martinez 2000). The highly interconnected food web of Broadstone Stream appeared to be structured by relatively simple rules, with seasonal and ontogenetic shifts in the size-spectrum accounting for most of the changes in predator diet and trophic position. Encounter rate in time (prey and predator mobility) and space (microhabitat use) and foraging mode also influenced prey vulnerability and niche overlap, but were secondary to the effect of body-size.",318,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Cannibalism | Coexistence | Feeding cycles | Food webs | Mutual predation | Omnivory | Polyphagy | Size-spectra | Trophic status,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,3

Long-lived species play a paramount role in the structure and functioning of terrestrial and marine ecosystems. The dramatic increase of human-induced disturbances may be irremediably affecting populations of long-lived species. Data on life-history traits on these species taking into account relevant temporal and spatial scales are very scarce for marine ecosystems, though these data are key to guarantee the conservation of these species and the communities that they shape. 2. This study examined long-term data on life-history traits of the precious red coral (Corallium rubrum L., 1758) in the NW Mediterranean. This was performed by surveying the fate of 67 red coral colonies during 21 years in a shallow-water habitat (27 m depth). 3. Photographic monitoring provided data on survivorship, whole and partial mortality, recruitment and growth of colonies allowing about 1000 observations on life-history traits. 4. Red coral showed a high survivorship, 60% of colonies reaching 22 years of age. Whole mortality was significantly higher in juvenile colonies while partial mortality displayed the inverse pattern. Recruitment showed a pulse mode with a single peak at the beginning of the study and low rates thereafter. Average growth rates over the study period were extremely low: 0.24 ± 0.05 mm year-1 for the basal diameter, 1.78 ± 0.7 mm year-1 for colony height and 3.40 ± 0.31 branches in 22 years. 5. This study also examined size-related effects of harvesting on red coral populations since shallow-water populations (between 10 and 40 m depth) have long been submitted to intensive harvesting. 6. Measurements (basal diameter and height) of 400 colonies corresponding to the largest ones dwelling in 10 currently harvested and two non-harvested populations were compared to analyse the effects on the population's recovery and potential colonies' maximum sizes. Harvested populations showed values that were about twice as low on average and up to four times lower for maximum values in colony size than in the non-harvested populations. 7. Our study provides indisputable data on the longevity of colonies and the parsimonious population dynamics of C. rubrum. Current populations have shown a dramatic shift in their size structures characterized by the absence of large colonies. Taking into account results obtained in this study full recovery time of shallow-water harvested populations may be measured by several decades or even centuries.",144,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Benthos | Corallium rubrum | Growth | Long-term study | Red coral | Sublittoral habitats,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,4

Many coexisting parasitoids interact via intraguild predation (IGP); however, in IGP theory without stage structure the intraguild predator and intraguild prey coexist via this mechanism over only a relatively narrow region of parameter space. A recent formulation of IGP theory with a stage of the intraguild prey species that is invulnerable to attack by the intraguild predator shows that coexistence between guild members can occur across a much broader range of resource productivity than is predicted by IGP theory without stage structure. These general theoretical predictions are used to explore the implications for coexistence of Aphytis melinus (DeBach) and Encarsia perniciosi (Tower), a pair of parasitoids that coexist on California red scale. 2. Reanalysis of a published laboratory competition experiment between two parasitoid species suggests that Aphytis, an ectoparasitoid, survives at a lower rate when the reparasitized host contains a more developed juvenile endoparasitoid (Encarsia). This pattern is contrary to a common assumption that ectoparasitoids always consume endoparasitoids in a shared host, and may affect coexistence. The experiment covered only the first 30% of the Encarsia development period and did not describe the outcome for Encarsia, so the dynamic effects of this interaction in the context of IGP remain unclear. In addition, Encarsia is capable of parasitizing much younger hosts than is Aphytis, which the experiment did not examine. 3. The experiment was repeated, and extended to cover the full developmental duration of Encarsia. An additional experiment was performed to explore whether Encarsia could pre-empt Aphytis by attacking younger hosts. Aphytis juvenile survival was found to decrease as a function of the age of the juvenile Encarsia onto which it was laid. When Encarsia parasitized very young hosts, it was increasingly invulnerable to attack by Aphytis and increasingly more likely to survive to emergence. However, until the formation of an invulnerable pseudomoult, Encarsia was always killed in larger hosts, regardless of its age at the time of Aphytis attack. 4. According to stage-structured IGP theory, the decline in Aphytis success combined with an invulnerable Encarsia stage may promote coexistence in this system.",29,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Aphytis | Biological control | Ectoparasitoid | Encarsia | Endoparasitoid,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,5

Local population studies have shown that sex allocation among many birds and mammals seems to be partly non-random and in connection to surrounding factors, such as environmental or parental quality. In this scenario, if environmental quality varies in space and time, it is feasible that environmental quality also comes to influence offspring sex ratio on larger geographical scales. 2. Investigating this idea - using nation-wide data sets on size-dimorphic Finnish northern goshawks Accipiter gentilis from 1989 to 1998 - we found that offspring sex ratio is related to spatial and temporal variation in availability of their main prey, woodland grouse species. 3. In a majority of locations (n = 73), broods are large and male-biased when grouse density is high, while small and female-biased broods are found in areas and times with low grouse density. When adjusted for grouse density, the correlation between brood size and sex ratio disappears, but the correlation between grouse density and sex ratio remains. 4. We also found evidence indicating a mechanism balancing local offspring sex ratios towards the previously rarer sex with a time lag of 1 year. That is, local sex ratios in subsequent years are negatively correlated. 5. Our study highlights the importance of inclusion of both time and space in sex ratio studies. Ignorance of these dimensions could explain a great deal of the inconsistency in many earlier local sex ratio studies. 6. Irrespective of whether the observed pattern is the result of facultative manipulation, sex biased mortality, or both, it is suggested that the male-biased sex ratio during periods of high grouse availability maximizes goshawk reproductive success.",46,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Environmental quality | Food availability | Northern goshawk | Sex ratio dynamics | Spatial and temporal variation,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,6

Adding a single additional parameter for each individual enabled the model to explain over 96% of length and weight variability. 4.

Compared with most previously published food webs, these stream communities (containing between 22 and 212 species) had more feeding links per species, a higher fraction of intermediate species (0.78-0.88) and lower fractions of top (0.04-0.09) and 'basal' species (0.07-0.15). 3. The exponent of the log link-log species relationship (S1.3) differed significantly (ANCOVA: P < 0.001) from the link-species 'law' (S1) and the constant connectance hypothesis (S2). Based on these results, the link scaling law and the constant connectance hypothesis must be rejected for food webs in stream systems. 4. Connectance was markedly lower than previously reported and decreased with web size. We attribute this to the body-size disparity of organisms at the top and the bottom of the web, flow disturbance and to the high physical heterogeneity and complexity of the sedimentary habitat.

Areas of environmental transition (i.e. ecotones) have recently been shown to play an important role in the maintenance of genetic diversity, divergence and in speciation processes. We test the hypothesis that ecotone populations maintain high phenotypic diversity compared to other populations across the distribution range. 2. Focusing on the chukar partridge (Alectoris chukar Gray), we study trends in morphological diversity across a steep ecotone within the species native range in Israel and Sinai. Using 35 traits and 23 ratios between traits, we apply a novel weighted average statistic that we term 'Estimator in a Dependent Sample' (EDS). This estimator enables us to compare levels of diversity across populations using multiple-correlated traits and is especially useful when sample sizes are small. 3. We provide a program for calculating the EDS and a bootstrapping procedure to describe its confidence interval and standard deviation. This estimator can be applied widely in a range of studies using multiple-correlated traits in evolutionary biology, ecology, morphology, behaviour, palaeontology, developmental biology and genetics. 4. Our results indicate that within-population diversity peaks in chukar populations located in the Mediterranean-desert ecotone in Israel. However, had we not included the ecotone region in our study, we would have drawn different conclusions regarding patterns of morphological diversity across the range.

The delayed density-dependent predation of specialists such as weasels (Mustela nivalis L.) may result in cycles in the abundance of their prey. We estimated the demographic impact of weasel predation on field-vole (Microtus agrestis L.) survival using capture-recapture data from a large-scale, replicated predator-manipulation experiment conducted in six unfenced populations in Kielder Forest, northern England. The density of weasels was experimentally reduced through continuous live-trapping in the three removal populations. Field-vole survival was compared between paired removal and control populations during the increase, peak and decline phases of a vole population cycle. Apparent survival and recapture probabilities were estimated using open population Cormack-Jolly Seber models. 2. Field-vole survival varied extensively both spatially between populations and temporally, being highest in the late autumn and over winter and lowest each year in spring and early summer. Patterns of variation in male and female survival were similar between populations over time, but there was independent spatial and temporal variation between adults and juveniles. Variation in weasel abundance explained 18% of this independent spatial and temporal variation between adult and juvenile field-vole survival. 3. The average increase in annual vole survival resulting from weasel removal over the 2-year period was 27% and 25% for adult male and female field voles, respectively. Decreased weasel abundance increased adult field-vole survival. Adult-vole survival in the absence of weasels was predicted to be approximately 8% higher than in the presence of one weasel per 4-5 ha. Surprisingly, weasel removal resulted in lowered juvenile field-vole survival, possibly reflecting increased emigration or mortality due to infanticide. A simple two age-class demographic model indicated that the decrease in juvenile survival in response to reduced weasel predation pressure did not fully compensate for the increase in adult survival. 4. As weasel numbers fluctuated seasonally, with highest weasel densities occurring in late summer and autumn and little spring to spring variation, the impact of weasel removal on field-vole survival was greatest during the breeding season. However, vole population-growth rates were unrelated to adult survival at that time and correspondingly no divergence was observed between the trajectories of control and removal vole populations even when weasel numbers were greatest in control sites. In contrast, vole population-growth rates were closely correlated with survival during the non-breeding season. Nevertheless all control and removal populations experienced a cyclic decline in winter 1999-2000 in spite of the increased adult survival in experimental treatments. 5. We conclude that the impact of weasel predation on field-vole survival was neither sufficient nor necessary to initiate and drive the cyclic decline of field-vole populations in Kielder Forest.",97,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Capture-recapture | Compensation | Field voles | MARK | Mustela nivalis | Population cycles | Specialist predators,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,10

It is well known that gastrointestinal nematodes can have a significant impact on the growth of farmed ruminants. The clinical signs of these parasites are often subtle, with production losses mainly due to reductions in host appetite and gut function. However, little is known about the impact of this widespread group of parasites on wild ruminants. We use experiments and cross-sectional data to investigate the effects of gastrointestinal nematodes on a wild host, the Svalbard reindeer. 2. Individually marked reindeer were treated for parasites. Their body mass, back fat depth and fecundity were compared with the control group one year later. The effect of treatment on worm burdens was investigated in a subsample of animals that were culled 3 and 6 months after treatment. Also, the relationship between the intensity of infection and body mass, back fat depth and host pregnancy rates was investigated in cross-sectional data from culled reindeer. 3. The anthelmintic treatment caused an increase in the body mass, back fat depth and fecundity of the reindeer. Treatment depressed the abundance of adult parasites of Ostertagia gruehneri for at least 6 months, but had no significant effect on the abundance of adults of the other dominant parasite species, Marshallagi marshalli, or the abundance of larval stages of either species. 4. In the cross-sectional study, the probability of a reindeer being pregnant in late winter was negatively related to the abundance of adult O. gruehneri when controlling for host body mass. However, no clear evidence were found for an effect of parasitism on host condition in the cross-sectional study. 5. Our experimental results show for the first time in a natural ruminant host population that gastrointestinal nematodes can have a significant effect on host condition and fecundity. However, effects of infection on host condition was not detectable in the cross-sectional study. Also, we show that the experimental effects on host condition and fecundity is most likely to be due to a negative effect of O. gruehneri, while the experimental design did not allow detection of potential negative effects of M. marshalli.",135,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Body condition | Host-parasite interaction | Ostertagia | Parasite | Ruminants,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,11

In a system where depletion drives a habitat shift, the hypothesis was tested that animals switch habitat as soon as the average daily net energy intake (or gain) drops below that attainable in the alternative habitat. 2. The study was performed in the Lauwersmeer area. Upon arrival during the autumn migration, Bewick's swans first feed on below-ground tubers of fennel pondweed on the lake, but subsequently switched to feeding on harvest remains in sugar beet fields. 3. The daily energy intake was estimated by multiplying the average time spent foraging per day with the instantaneous energy intake rate while foraging. In the case of pondweed feeding, the latter was estimated from the functional response and the depletion of tuber biomass. In the case of beet feeding, it was estimated from dropping production rate. Gross energy intake was converted to metabolizable energy intake using the assimilation as determined in digestion trials. The daily energy expenditure was estimated by the time-energy budget method. Energetic costs were determined using heart rate. 4. The daily gain of pondweed feeding at the median date of the habitat switch (i.e. when 50% of the swans had switched) was compared with that of beet feeding. The daily gain of beet feeding was calculated for two strategies depending on the night activity on the lake: additional pondweed feeding (mixed feeding) or sleeping (pure beet feeding). 5. The majority of the swans switched when the daily gain they could achieve by staying on the pondweed bed fell just below the average daily gain of pure beet feeders. However, mixed feeders would attain an average daily gain considerably above that of pondweed feeders. A sensitivity analysis showed that this result was robust. 6. We therefore reject the hypothesis that the habitat switch by swans can be explained by simple long-term energy rate maximization.

The timing of migration is associated with survival and reproductive risks of migrating species. Hence, variation in factors influencing this timing, such as climate, may have significant life history consequences for migrating species. 2. Using an autoregressive phenological model, we analysed and contrasted the effects of climate (the North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO) and temporal dependence on the long-term (1928-77) dynamics of springtime arrival in three long-distance (83 populations) and three short-distance (52 populations) migratory bird species breeding throughout Norway. 3. Following high NAO winters both long- and short-distance migrants arrived earlier than after low NAO winters. For long-distance migrants, the effect of high NAO winters was probably indirect through improved forage conditions in winter quarters, whereas the effect on short-distance migrants may be related both to improved forage and weather conditions during their northward spring migration. The NAO explained on average 13% (0-46%) and 18% (0-43%) of the interannual variation in arrival dates of long- and short-distance migrants, respectively. 4. For both migrant types, long-term variability in springtime arrival increased with increasing strength of the influence of the NAO on timing of migration. In contrast, the strength of temporal dependence was unrelated to variability in long-term springtime arrival.",150,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Climate change | Long- and short-distance migrating birds | North Atlantic Oscillation | Temporal dependence | Timing of migration,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,14

In this review, we focus on how males can affect the population dynamics of ungulates (i) by being a component of population density (and thereby affecting interpretation of log-linear models), and (ii) by considering the mechanisms by which males can actively affect the demographic rates of females. 2. We argue that the choice of measure of density is important, and that the inclusion or exclusion of males into models can influence results. For example, we demonstrate that if the dynamics of a population can be described with a first-order auto-regressive process in a log-linear framework, the asymmetry between the effects of females on the male dynamics and vice versa can introduce a second order process, much in the same way that the interaction between disease and host or predator and prey can. It would be useful for researchers with sufficient data to explore the affects of using different density measures. 3. In general, even in harvested populations with highly skewed sex ratios, males are usually able to fertilize all females, though detailed studies document a lower proportion of younger females breeding when sex ratios are heavily female biased. It is well documented that the presence of males can induce oestrus in females, and that male age may also be a factor. In populations with both a skewed sex ratio and a young male age structure, calving is delayed and less synchronous. We identify several mechanisms that may be responsible for this. 4. Delayed calving may lower summer survival and autumn masses, which may lead to higher winter mortality. If females are born light, they may require another year of growth before they start reproducing. Delayed calving can reduce future fertility of the mother. As the proportion of calves predated during the first few weeks of life is often very high, calving synchrony may also be an important strategy to lower predation rates. 5. We argue that the effects of males on population dynamics of ungulates are likely to be non-trivial, and that their potential effects should not be ignored.

Dispersal from the natal area, or between breeding sites, marks a critical transition for individual animals, and a fundamental demographic and genetic process. Limitations on dispersal in natural populations are important in predicting population dynamics and structure. Tropical habitats that can be naturally patchy are also being fragmented rapidly, and these habitats harbour many social species. 2. We studied dispersal in cooperatively breeding stripe-backed wrens (Campylorhynchus nuchalis) in the Venezuelan savanna, using 20 years of data from marked populations over 40 km2. We test the hypotheses that dispersal is limited by competition for social position and that such limitation is sex-specific. 3. Dispersal is strongly female-biased, and results mainly in attainment of breeding status in neighbouring groups. Reproductive success is determined by the structure of the breeding group, and is concentrated in a small minority of individuals. 4. Natal dispersal is delayed, and represents a dramatic shift from indirect contribution to kin production (helping) to the direct approach of breeding. Monogamy limits breeding opportunities, compared to other social species, and both natal and breeding dispersal are constrained to short distances, particularly when compared to noncooperative breeders. 5. Males are more philopatric compared to females, for which more frequent and distant dispersal leads to greater reproductive success. Competition for breeding status in an established social order impedes dispersal, in part because experience and previous familiarity are important, particularly in males that rarely disperse to productive large groups. 6. Diverse patterns of sex bias in dispersal among cooperatively breeding birds can be explained by the comparative diversity of reproductive alternatives available to males and females. A 'breeding diversity' hypothesis is illustrated by comparison with male-biased dispersal in brown jays. 7.

Herbivores that forage on resources that change over time may be strongly affected by environmental factors that alter their temporal overlap with host plants. The magnitude of these effects may be mediated by the availability of alternative hosts and by behavioural adaptations for foraging on temporal food resources. 2. This study examines the temporal interaction of a butterfly species and its two host plants to determine how larvae utilize their host resources and are affected by conditions of accelerated host senescence. By changing host use over time, this butterfly may track temporal declines in host quality and buffer the impacts of environmental variation and change. At the same time, it is hypothesized that host declines and changes in the host environment affect larval survivorship and hence butterfly population size. 3. With three sets of field and greenhouse experiments, the following were examined: (i) larval host plant use and the dependence of larval diet on oviposition, (ii) nutritional differences between hosts, and (iii) the impact of conditions that accelerate host plant death (i,e. temperature) on larval survivorship and growth, 4. Larvae were observed to forage widely, vary their diet through time, and use hosts independently of their natal plant. Larvae tracked changes in host quality by steadily increasing their use of the longer-lasting, but nutritionally variable, host plant. Temperature conditions that accelerated host death actually conferred a survivorship advantage when larvae were able to utilize this host, 5. These results suggest that larval diet choice and movement may be an adaptive strategy for foraging on declining food resources. It also suggests that the net effect of environmental extremes on larvae is strongly mediated by host plant use, Differences in larval survivorship when one or both hosts are available suggest that the long-lasting host is essential to butterfly population persistence.

During the brief growing season in Arctic and high mountain ecosystems, undisturbed grazing is crucial in order to maximize growth and fattening.

Climatic data, activity of parasitic flies, and female reindeer behaviour were recorded from two wild reindeer populations in Southern Norway. Temperature and solar irradiation were good predictors of oestrid fly activity. Throughout the warm summer, reindeer were exposed to vigorous oestrid fly harassment, which caused dramatic decrease in feeding and lying, and increase in walking, running and standing. This behavioural change may compromise the physical condition of individuals entering winter. 3. Mosquitoes had little influence on reindeer activity patterns. In the absence of oestrid flies, weather parameters had no influence on reindeer activity pattern. Even during the warmest days, no signs of heat stress were recorded.

For many small birds at temperate latitudes, the low temperatures and long nights of winter are associated with an increased risk of starvation. Birds such as the great tit Parus major L. face this by increasing their fat reserves. Theoretical, correlative and experimental evidence indicates that the amount of fat carried is not maximized for a given set of circumstances, but optimized, at least partly because of a need to trade off starvation risk against predation risk, part of which may be mass-dependent, and therefore increased by carrying increased reserves. Evidence for such a trade-off strategy includes the observed negative correlation between fat reserves and ambient winter temperature operating as a proximate factor. 2. However, the relationship between fat and temperature requires further investigation for two reasons. First, field evidence that temperature acts as a proximate factor is equivocal. Secondly, measures of temperature used (e.g. mean temperature over the previous 24 h) have given little resolution as to the time over which temperature effects operate, and whether low temperatures might constrain the bird's ability to fatten, in addition to signalling the need to fatten further. 3. This paper uses observations of fat from a wild great tit population, studied over 17 years, to address these two areas. First, it demonstrates that temperature acts as a proximate factor influencing fat reserve levels. Secondly, by relating the time of observation more precisely than previously to temperatures prevailing at particular times during the previous 24 h, it is shown that while past temperature (e.g. 5 + h previously) is used to optimize fat reserves (strategic fattening), more immediate temperature may constrain the bird's ability to achieve the optimum. 4. This constraint is demonstrated by a positive correlation between fat reserves and current temperature; probably the first demonstration of such a relationship. However, this constraining effect of temperature has diminished over the last 17 years, presumably because of climate amelioration.",50,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Climate change | Fat reserves | Proximate factor | Temperature constraint | Ultimate factor,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,20

The oligolectic Chelostoma rapunculi utilized trap nests when the distance to the nearest food patch was less than 300 m. 3.

According to meta-population models, a superior competitor and a superior disperser can coexist in a patchy environment.

Their microhabitat (host) use and coexistence, and the quality and quantity of microhabitats were investigated in 1988, 1989, 1999 and 2000 on the coral reef. Their interspecific interaction was also examined. 2. Before the habitat destruction, the two species coexisted. Although A. clarkii was behaviourally dominant over A. perideraion in a cohabiting group, A. perideraion was a superior competitor in terms of site displacement, because A. perideraion could displace a microhabitat. Adult A. clarkii emigrated from a cohabiting group probably due to the high cost of interactions with adult A. perideraion. Although it is easier to defend a small area for a larger species, sharing a host with adult A. perideraion may not pay for A. clarkii because A. clarkii needs a larger area. 3. A. clarkii was not only a superior disperser, which was able to find a vacated host, but also a pioneer species that was able to use newly settled small hosts. Larval A. clarkii settled on such a small host because they were able to move to larger hosts for future reproduction, while A. perideraion did not settle on a small host because of low mobility after settlement. Microhabitat (host) with various sizes might have promoted their coexistence. 4. After the habitat destruction, the superior competitor A. perideraion went extinct locally due probably to lack of small host utilization ability.

Tanytarsus gracilentus population dynamics in Lake Myvatn show a tendency to cycle, with three oscillations occurring between 1977 and 1999 having periods of roughly 7 years. The population abundance fluctuated over four orders of magnitude. 2. A partial autocorrelation function (PACF) accounting for measurement error revealed a strong positive lag-1 autocorrelation and a moderate negative lag-2 partial autocorrelation. This suggests that the dynamics can be explained by a simple second-order autoregressive process. 3. We tested the alternative hypotheses that the cyclic dynamics of T. gracilentus were driven by consumer-resource interactions in which T. gracilentus is the consumer, or predator-prey interactions in which T. gracilentus is the prey. We analysed autoregressive models including both consumer-resource interactions and predator-prey interactions. 4. Wing length of T. gracilentus was used as a surrogate for resource abundance and/or quality, because body size is known to fluctuate with resource abundance and quality in dipterans. Furthermore, the wing lengths of Micropsectra lindrothi, a species ecologically similar to T. gracilentus, fluctuated synchronously with T. gracilentus wing lengths, thereby indicating that the shared resources of these two species were indeed cycling. Wing lengths of other chironomid species were not synchronized. 5.

Arguably the most important and elusive component of host-parasite models is the transmission function. Considerable empirical and theoretical work has focused on determining the correct formulation of this function although, to date, there has been little attempt to combine these studies to develop general insights into how observed transmission rates affect host-parasite dynamics. 2. Here, estimates of transmission rates from a range of host-parasite systems in the literature are described using a phenomenological function which takes into account how transmission varies with host and parasite densities. This function is placed in the appropriate model framework to determine the consequences of the observed transmission rates for each system. 3. All of the parasites had decreasing per capita transmission rates with increasing parasite densities suggesting that parasites tend to saturate at high densities, either as hosts become limiting or due to heterogeneities amongst the host population. In terms of the responses to host density, the parasites fell into two groups: those with increasing or decreasing transmission rates. This dichotomy was due to the biology of the organisms; the former group infect through cannibalism, which increased at high densities as the individuals became stressed, whereas the latter group infected through free-living stages, resulting in a form of spatial structuring reducing the number of hosts available for infection. 4. A metapopulation model was developed where hosts and parasites interacted in discrete patches according to the appropriate transmission function, with neighbouring patches linked by dispersal. The model suggested that small-scale, localized transmission events can drive large-scale epizootics at the metapopulation level. This emphasizes the importance of correctly describing and quantifying the transmission function at the individual level. 5. Traditionally, the formulation of the transmission function has depended on the scale of observation. This work shows that transmission should be considered from the viewpoint of the organisms concerned. Observed transmission rates are a consequence of the biology of the individuals meaning it should be possible to develop a priori hypotheses concerning the nature of the transmission function from a basic understanding of the life history of the organisms concerned.",86,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Microparasite | Non-linear transmission | Parasite persistence | Spatial model,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,26

Each day small birds must build up sufficient energy reserves, largely fat deposits, for the following night and for the periods when foraging is not possible.

A popular explanation for this is that birds' fatness levels reflect an optimal compromise between starvation risk and risks associated with reserve carrying and acquisition. 2. Theoretical works suggest that uncertain or variable feeding conditions should promote high reserve levels, and that in the daily perspective, feeding should peak in the morning hours. In more favourable conditions, reserve levels should be smaller and the acquisition peak should be delayed towards the end of the day. These predictions were tested by experimentally manipulating winter feeding conditions and monitoring subsequent daily body mass increase in northern population of the willow tit Parus montanus (Conrad), a small-sized forest passerine. 3. The birds using feeders appeared heavier than the control birds throughout the day. This contradicts the prevailing theory, but is understandable since the feeding procedure probably not only affected food amount but may also have decreased acquisition costs in terms of predation. 4. Daily mass gain and the gain rates were fairly similar in the food-manipulated and the control birds. However, the mass gain schedules differed between the treatment groups: the food-supplemented birds gained mass at a roughly constant rate while among the control birds the gain rate was higher in the morning than in the afternoon. Probably to avoid associated costs, birds abandon early build-up of reserves if foraging conditions become favourable enough.",12,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Daily mass gain | Food predictability | Predation | Starvation | Willow tit | Winter survival,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,27

Quantitative host-parasitoid food webs are descriptions of community structure that include data on the abundance of hosts and parasitoids, and the frequency of links between them, all expressed in the same units. 2. Quantitative host-parasitoid food webs were constructed describing the community of leaf-mining insects (Diptera, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera) and their parasitoids (Hymenoptera) in an 8500-m2 area of moist tropical forest in Belize, Central America, over a 1-year period. 3. The summary food web, containing data for the whole year, is we believe the most diverse quantitative host-parasitoid web yet described. It contains 93 species of leaf-miner, 84 species of parasitoid and 196 links between hosts and parasitoids. 4. Most parasitoids were generalists, with individual parasitoid species recorded as parasitizing up to 21 host species. In contrast, most leaf-miners were specialists, with 114 links documented between leaf-miners and their host plants. 5. A robustness analysis was used to reveal the effects of different sampling intensities on food web statistics. The results suggest that the sampling had revealed most of the species of host and parasitoid in the community, but further interactions among species would continue to be detected with additional sampling. Measures of the ratio of hosts to parasitoids and of realized connectance were relatively insensitive to sampling intensity. 6. Three seasonal webs were constructed, revealing temporal changes in the structure of the community. There was greater turnover in host species composition than parasitoid species composition among seasons, but most web statistics remained relatively constant across seasons. 7. Both the summary web and the seasonal webs show low levels of compartmentalization, suggesting that the host-parasitoid community is not divided into relatively discrete subwebs with largely independent dynamics. 8. The extent of potential indirect interactions between pairs of hosts was assessed by constructing quantitative parasitoid overlap graphs. These suggest that abundant species are likely to have greater indirect effects on less abundant species than vice versa, and that species in the same taxonomic order are more likely to interact indirectly. The graphs do not support the hypothesis that species sharing the same host plant are more likely to interact via shared parasitoids.",125,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Apparent competition | Biodiversity | Food web | Leaf miner | Rain forest,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,28

Interference is a key component of food competition, but is difficult to measure in natural animal populations. Using data from a long-term study, we show that interference between common cranes Grus grus L., feeding on patches of cereal seeds, reduces intake rates at high competitor densities, and that the strength of interference is unrelated to food abundance. 2. An alternative to measuring interference directly is to predict its strength using behaviour-based models. We test an interference model, originally developed for shorebirds feeding on invertebrate prey, for cranes. We compare the predictions of a rate-maximizing model, in which animals steal food if this increases intake rate, and a state-dependent model, in which they only rate-maximize if their intake rate is below a target value, otherwise they minimize injury risk by not stealing food. State-dependent aggression occurs in cranes. 3. The state-dependent model predicts more accurately the relative aggression rates of cranes of different dominance. However, both models predict accurately the observed strength of interference, that the strength of interference is unrelated to food abundance, at least within the observed range of crane and seed densities, and that cranes of a higher dominance have a higher intake rate than those of lower dominance. 4.

Most commonly attended trophobionts by O. smaragdina at this study site were Coccidae (Coccus sp., Milviscutulus sp.) and Membracidae (Sextius sp.), followed by Toxoptera aurantii (Aphidae), Planococcus citri (Pseudococcidae), Icerya sp.

First, the majority (68%) of aggregation sites was found on lianas, especially on the legumes Entada phaseoloides and Caesalpinia traceyi, and secondly, per capita ant visitation rate (VR) at coccoids was significantly higher on lianas compared to trees. In total, VR to homopterans was 64% higher on lianas. 4. Sites of ant-homopteran aggregations were regularly replaced by new locations on fresh plant growth. The mean longevity of nests of this polydomous ant species was 131 days, of individual aggregation sites with membracids 54 days and with coccoids 130 days. 5.

The larvae of pond breeding frogs experience high rates of mortality, predominantly through predation and pond desiccation. We investigated how the tadpoles of two common species of frog respond to these hazards using factorial experiments conducted in a laboratory. 2. The eastern brown froglet Crinia signifera Girard spawns in small, highly ephemeral ponds, while the spotted marsh frog Limnodynastes tasmaniensis Günther breeds in more permanent water bodies. Prior to our experiments it was known that C. signifera siblings develop quickly and reach metamorphosis comparatively synchronously (c. 25-35 days), while L. tasmaniensis grow and develop more slowly and time to metamorphosis is highly asynchronous (c. 60-300 days). It was anticipated that these species would have different strategies for coping with declining water and predators. 3. A separate experiment was conducted for each species. The factors were Hydroperiod (either constant or gradually declining water volume) and Predator (either the presence or absence of a restrained mosquitofish Gambusia holbrookii Girard). A random block design was used with six replicates for each possible combination of the factors (N = 24). Each replicate consisted of a 13-1 tub of water containing 20 tadpoles. Newly emerged frogs were transferred to one of 24 vivaria. In the arrangement of the vivaria, we maintained the block design of the experiment. 4. Crinia signifera tadpoles responded to declining water by accelerating development and so reduced time to metamorphosis. However, the resulting metamorphs were smaller and survival rate in the terrestrial stage was significantly lower. This is a clear demonstration of the benefit and cost of phenotypic plasticity in metamorphic traits. 5. Limnodynastes tasmaniensis tadpoles experiencing declining water were also smaller at metamorphosis, but there was no evidence that they had reduced the time to metamorphosis compared with those in constant water. Moreover the survival rates of the resulting frogs did not differ. Consequently no adaptive plasticity can be inferred. 6. The data suggest that L tasmaniensis has a bet-hedging strategy in which some siblings develop more quickly at the expense of size, while others take much longer but are bigger at metamorphosis as a result. 7. Tadpoles of both species showed clear behavioural responses to the presence of the predator. They tended to occupy the non-predator halves of the tubs in replicates where amosquitofish was present.

Theory predicts that communities comprising many species connected randomly by strong interactions are unlikely to exhibit stable, feasible equilibria (i.e. positive equilibria to which all species will return following perturbation), making the observed complexity of natural communities very surprising. This prediction has never been tested experimentally in speciose communities. 2. We tested this prediction using long-term data from experimental communities of bacteria, protists and small metazoans in laboratory microcosms. Initial communities varied in species richness (S), composition and connectance (C; the fraction of possible interspecific interactions that are actually realized). 3. Many initial communities lost species to extinction (unstable and/or infeasible communities), but population densities and species compositions subsequently stabilized. 4. We used logistic regression to describe the probability that an initial community would be stable and feasible as a function of complexity [(SC)1/2]. Probability of a stable, feasible equilibrium declined with complexity, as predicted by theory. 5. We also found that communities converged in connectance over time, so that at the end of the experiment connectance was independent of species richness. Monte Carlo simulations indicated that this result was highly improbable if extinctions occurred at random with respect to connectedness. Connectance is also independent of species richness in well-resolved natural food webs, a pattern usually ascribed to phylogenetic and/or physiological constraints on diet breadth. However, such constraints cannot explain our results. Trophic interactions causing non-random extinctions may provide a novel explanation for patterns in the connectance and species richness of whole food webs.",36,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Connectance | Food webs | Microcosms | Protists | Stability vs. complexity,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,32

The functional responses of roe deer were examined using 11 plant species. A technique to discriminate between encounter- and handling-limited processes was used, and it can be concluded that the functional response applicable to patch browsing by roe deer is governed not by the rate of encounter but by the rate of oral processing. 2. The large differences between plant species were due to variations in both parameters of the functional response: h, the time lost in biting, and Rmax, the maximum processing rate. Removing the thorns from three of the species affected these parameters differently, according to the size and density of thorns. 3. Animals took larger bites from larger patches (branches), and bite mass declined as patch exploitation progressed, implying that animals were selecting the larger items to eat first. It was demonstrated experimentally that depletion of the larger bites does occur first, and it was concluded that prey selection is an important component of herbivore foraging behaviour. 4. The gain curves for deer feeding on the different plant species are calculated as being virtually linear. Patch depression did not, in general, occur because increasing bite rate compensated for declining bite mass. Our mechanistic approach is contrasted with other approaches to describing the gain curve in the literature. 5.

Selection of prey in poor body condition allegedly is a widespread phenomenon in predator-prey systems. Yet, it remains unclear to what extent such selection reflects impeded prey escape ability due to severe malnutrition and/or state-dependent risk taking following lesser changes in prey body condition. In systems where prey food availability is adequate, few individuals should be severely malnourished and thus condition-sensitive predation should be related principally to changes in nutritional status that occur irrespective of an individual's absolute body condition. 2. I studied predation in snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus, Erxleben) when food was abundant, to test the prediction that change in body condition would contribute, more than would absolute body condition, to vulnerability to predation. Hares (n = 618) were radio-marked and monitored for survival while body condition was indexed during bimonthly livecaptures. A subsample of animals (n = 36) was equipped with motion-sensitive transmitters and activity patterns were examined in relation to the body condition index and vulnerability to predation. 3. Manipulation of hare nutritional status via food supplementation improved hare body condition but did not affect vulnerability to predation; reduction of nematode parasite numbers did not improve hare condition but reduced predation among female hares. Reproductive status affected predation in both sexes, with recently pregnant females and non-scrotal males being less vulnerable to predation. Heavier males also tended to experience lower predation rates. 4. Predation rates for both female and male hares were higher among individuals having recently experienced condition deterioration but not among animals considered to be in poor absolute condition. Yet, the parameter representing change in condition was the last to enter survival models, indicating a relatively modest effect of this factor on hare vulnerability to predation. Mammalian but not avian predators tended to kill hares in declining condition, and hare activity patterns were not correlated either to change in condition or to survival. 5. These findings indicate that nutritional status may influence vulnerability to predation even when food is abundant, but that such effects occur indirectly through changing body condition. This implies that hares are likely to forage in a risk-prone manner when subject to worsening condition.",87,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Body condition | Lepus americanus | Nutrition | Predation | Predator-prey interactions | Prey selection | Snowshoe hare,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,41

Where gradients exist it is possible for a global test of community change to fail to achieve significance even though pairwise tests between groups of samples from opposite ends of gradients reveal significant differences. This study examines the power of alternative tests in situations where spatial (or temporal) gradients exist. 2. Data from an oilfield survey in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea are used to examine the power of two types of test. There is no theoretical statistical framework with which to examine the formal power of the non-parametric multivariate tests. A univariate analogue is used to demonstrate the behaviour and relative power of linear regression and ANOVA to detect different strengths of gradients. 3. Two multivariate tests are then contrasted using simulations. ANOSIM (Analysis of Similarities) is a categorical analysis and, for an ecological matrix of pairwise dissimilarities among all samples, tests null hypotheses of the ANOVA type: H0: There are no differences between groups of samples. This test is compared with RELATE, a non-parametric Mantel test which is used here to test the null hypothesis: H0: The dissimilarities among samples in the ecological matrix are not (monotonically) correlated with corresponding 'model' distances between samples along the gradient. 4. It is demonstrated that, where a gradient is present in the data, an appropriate univariate test based on linear regression always has greater power than ANOVA to detect it. This is especially true where the gradient is weak and/or replication is low. 5. It is shown that the multivariate tests behave in a similar way to their univariate analogues. Where there is a detectable gradient in the data the correlative test (RELATE) has greater potential to detect it than does the categorical test ANOSIM. The differences in power are especially apparent at low to intermediate strengths of gradient. Distributing replicates among more groups decreases the power of both tests, but especially ANOSIM, to detect a constant gradient effect. 6. Although demonstrated using a practical application, the findings presented here are general in nature and applicable to any ecological investigation in which a gradient in response may be hypothesized.",67,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Experimental design | Hypothesis testing | Linear regression | Mantel test | Multivariate analysis,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,42

Although it is not clear to what extent density dependence acts on the survival, emigration or growth of organisms, experiments testing alternative explanations are rare. A field experiment on 1-year-old brown trout (Salmo trutta L.) was undertaken to address the following questions: are the mortality, movement and growth of wild stream-living trout affected by population density? If so, are the density-dependent effects of released hatchery trout different from the effects of wild fish? 2. In each of two small streams, two replicate treatment blocks were used, each with four treatments assigned to stream sections 50-70 m in length: (1) control, no fish was introduced and population density was kept at its original level. (2) Trout biomass was doubled by introducing additional wild fish. (3) Trout biomass was doubled by introducing additional hatchery fish. (4) Hatchery trout were introduced, but biomass was kept at its original level by the removal of some resident wild fish. 3. We found no treatment effects on the recapture rates of resident trout, which suggests that survival was not strongly affected by competition. They were also remarkably stationary, regardless of treatment. However, trout growth rate was reduced to the same extent in both treatments with increased density, suggesting that growth was negatively density-dependent, and that the density-dependent effects of hatchery trout and introduced wild fish were similar. 4. Wild resident fish grew faster than introduced wild trout, which in turn grew faster than hatchery trout. Hatchery fish and introduced wild fish moved more than wild resident fish. 5. The results show that population density affected growth in trout parr. We conclude that competition is not limited to the underyearlings, as has previously been suggested, and that density-dependent growth is the main density-dependent response in yearling trout. Furthermore, this effect was the same for wild and hatchery-reared competitors, suggesting that stocking of hatchery fish may affect natural populations negatively through density dependence.",129,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Density dependence | Growth | Movement,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,46

Habitat fragmentation may adversely affect animal populations through several mechanisms. However, little is known about how the impacts of some of these mechanisms are manifested in altered dynamics of wild populations. 2. We used a spatially explicit individual-based simulation model to examine the potential effects of disrupted dispersal due to fragmentation on the population dynamics of the endangered, co-operatively breeding, red-cockaded woodpecker Picoides borealis. 3. We simulated population dynamics as a function of population size and spatial aggregation of territories. Dispersal success (but not mortality or fecundity) was an emergent property of model runs. In the model all female and some male fledglings dispersed in straight lines in random directions, and the remaining males stayed on their natal territories as helpers and competed for breeding vacancies in their immediate neighbourhood. 4. Population trend was tied to the higher dispersal success of both males and females in larger and less fragmented populations. Helpers were more successful than dispersing males. Male breeder recruitment depended entirely on helpers when populations were small (25 or 100 territories). 5. Declining populations were characterized by high emigration rates and both failure and delay in female recruitment. The large numbers of unpaired males resulted in lowered reproductive output at the population level and in the loss of territories. Populations of 25 territories were stable when territories were highly aggregated, despite high emigration rates. These results closely match empirical observations. 6. A number of co-operatively breeding species are endangered. The unusual dispersal behaviour of helpers may make such species sensitive to habitat fragmentation but also resilient to reductions in population size when territories are aggregated.

It is generally assumed that high social status confers benefits such as increased resource acquisition and growth rate, higher survival and/or increased reproductive output relative to subordinate individuals. 2. The hypothesis that dominant juvenile Atlantic salmon would have higher growth rates than subordinates in a flow-regulated natural stream was tested. Over 2 years, seven groups of eight size-matched wild fish were tagged with passive integrated transponders (PIT tags) and assessed for dominance using a serial removal method. Fish were then introduced together into an enclosed stretch of stream and allowed to forage freely for 14 days. Their use of space was recorded by an array of eight in-stream detectors. Using in-stream video recording, a correlation between dominance measured prior to and during the trials was confirmed. 3. Contrary to our hypothesis, there were no significant correlations between dominance status and specific growth rate. 4. Mean growth rate varied significantly between trials. In females, growth declined from May through to August. Maturing male fish exhibited a prepubertal growth spurt during June and July when their rates of growth significantly exceeded those of females. 5. There were significant positive relationships between rates of movement and growth of both Sexes. Each salmon generally used only a restricted portion of the stream but there were considerable overlaps between the home ranges of individuals. 6. Sampling over space and time on two occasions revealed complex variations in rankings of patches with respect to the abundance of drifting invertebrates of aquatic and terrestrial origin. 7. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that a high degree of unpredictability in food supply results in correlation between growth and movement but not the ability to dominate high-quality feeding patches exclusively. Variation in growth between and within sexes might result from trade-offs between the costs (e.g. increased predation risk) and benefits (increased food acquisition rate) of sampling movements.

Thus, long-term energy storage enabled females to reproduce successfully even in years when prey were scarce. 3.

True annual survival was higher for diving ducks (tufted duck 0.72, common pochard 0.65) and lower for northern shoveler (0.52).

Unusual long-distance (up to 2500 km) breeding dispersal movements that we found in female tufted ducks have not been documented in any other European waterfowl and are most probably a result of saturated nesting habitats. 4.

Based on kin selection theory, it has been predicted that close relatives should aggregate to accrue inclusive fitness advantages. However, studies of genetics have failed to find convincing evidence of kin association in wild populations of territorial fish such as juvenile salmonids, despite laboratory evidence of reduced aggression among siblings. In these genetic studies, calculations of the degree of kin association have been based on the assumption that the geographical distribution of individual fish is fixed over space and time. By comparison, recent work suggests that patterns of spatial distribution are fluid and that home ranges overlap considerably. Therefore, it is possible that benefits of kin selection depend not on the juxtaposition of fish per se, but on how they interact on the occasions when they associate. 2. To explore this issue, an experiment was conducted to test whether dominant fish in pairs of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar (L.) juveniles were more likely to share food in high quality feeding patches with kin than non-kin and also whether kin-biased intimidation from dominant to subordinate fish was sustained in the absence of the dominant individual. 3. Siblings shared high-quality feeding territories for twice as long as pairs of non-kin. The food intake of dominant fish did not vary with relatedness of subordinate conspecific. However, once dominant fish were satiated, subordinate individuals consumed a greater proportion of food items when paired with kin than non-kin. 4. When dominant fish were removed from half the pairs of salmon, subordinate fish that had been paired previously with dominant kin increased their feeding activity to greater levels than subordinate fish that had been paired previously with dominant non-kin. 5. These findings indicate that subordinate fish in wild populations may gain twofold foraging advantages by close association with dominant kin: (i) by increased territory sharing, and (ii) by reduced time for food patch acquisition when dominant fish move from patches shared with subordinates. 6. We suggest that in territorial animals, the acquisition of kin selection benefits need not be dependent upon the fixed association of kin in adjacent territories, but can be accrued during occasional associations within a more fluid pattern of overlapping home ranges.",73,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Foraging behaviour | Home range | Kin selection | Territoriality,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,54

A simple model of relative effects of parental behaviour (parents present vs. absent) and nest concealment on probability of nest predation was evaluated by measuring survival of paired natural/artificial nests of four open nesting passerines over 3 years. 2. The ratio of rodent to corvid predation (i) decreased from yellowhammer (small eggs, ground/near ground nests) through blackcap (small, shrub) to song thrush and blackbird (medium sized, shrub/subcanopy); (ii) was highest in years when rodent abundance peaked - this effect was clear in yellowhammer, detectable in blackcap, but not found in thrushes. An inverse relationship was found between mean annual nest survival and abundance of the major nest predator for each species. Predators differed between poorly (corvids) and well-concealed (rodents) nests in blackcap. 3. The effects on nest survival differed among species, including: positive effect of parental behaviour combined with neutral effect of concealment (thrushes); independent positive effects of behaviour and concealment (yellowhammer); neutral effect of behaviour combined with positive effect of concealment (blackcap). These patterns are consistent with hypothesis that relatively larger species with conspicuous nests (thrushes) should either engage in more vigorous nest defence or their defence is more efficient, compared with smaller species with less conspicuous nests (blackcap). 4. The positive relationship between nest concealment and survival resulted either from an effect of nest site per se (yellowhammer) or from an effect of parental behaviour (blackcap) that changed from negative (nest disclosure) to positive (nest defence) between poorly and well-concealed nests, respectively. The view that lack of a within-species relationship between nest concealment and survival (thrushes) results from parental behaviour compensating for predation risk associated with poor nest concealment was not supported. 5.

Territoriality and group living are described in a low-density population of Eurasian badgers, Meles meles L., by studying the patterns of spatial grouping and territory marking, as well as the differences between individuals in some of their characteristics (body condition and dispersal) and in their space use (seasonally, periods of activity and interaction between pairs of individuals) under strong seasonal fluctuations in the availability of the key resource (young rabbits, Oryctolagus cuniculus L.). Finally, the role of the spatial distribution of the main prey (young rabbits) in the development of sociality was also studied in order to test some of the assumptions and predictions of the resource dispersion hypothesis (RDH). 2. Badgers were territorial, showing a flexible system of territory marking, which includes the marking of the most used areas (sett-latrines at the centres of activity) and additionally, at the smaller territories, a system of border-latrines in the areas of contact between territories. The maximum use of border-latrines was associated with the reproductive season, and that of sett-latrines with the season of food scarcity. 3. In the study area where badgers had rabbits as main prey, territories were occupied by small groups of animals, formed by one adult female who reproduced, one adult male who also showed signs of reproductive activity, the cubs of the year (if there was reproduction) and some animals born during previous years, which remained in their natal territory until their dispersal (normally during the mating season of their third or fourth year of life). This system was not strictly fixed as males, given the opportunity, expanded their territories to encompass additional females. Territories in another study site were occupied by one adult female (marked), plus the cubs of the year and another adult individual (unmarked). 4. In winter and spring dominant females and subordinates used only a small fraction of their territories, moved short distances, at a low speed and covering small areas per night. These seasons corresponded with the reproduction of rabbits (highest food availability). Dominant females were the only individuals using all the territory available in the summer (lowest food availability), when badgers had the worst body condition. Food availability increased again in autumn, as did body condition, while range sizes were again reduced. Dominant males used the same proportion of their territories over all seasons. However, in winter (reproductive season) they moved faster, over longer distances, and covered larger areas per period of activity. These results indicate that use of space by dominant males was affected by different factors from that of dominant females and subordinates. 5. RDH does not seem to explain group living in our populations because: (a) territoriality in each pair of primary animals was driven by different factors (trophic resources for females and females for males); (b) dominant males acted as expansionists; and (c) territory size was related to its richness and not to patch dispersion. 6.

When correlations exist between independent variables, as is generally the case with ecological datasets, this procedure leads to biased parameter estimates. Standard multiple regression, by contrast, yields unbiased parameter estimates. 3. In multiple regression parameters are estimated controlling for the effects of the other variables in the model, and thus multiple regression achieves what residual regression claims to do. 4.

I report a study investigating how the impacts of generalized consumers, viewed here as interaction modifications, may influence the stability of a particular interspecific interaction. 2. In a study involving overwintering oothecae of the praying mantis Stagmomantis limbata (Hahn), birds damaged 36% of oothecae, 85% of which had also been parasitized by winter-active, multivoltine torymid wasps of the genus Podagrion. Birds preferentially preyed upon oothecae oviposited high on trees, but such predation was often incomplete, leaving both viable and parasitized mantid eggs inside damaged oothecae. 3. Two factors allowed bird damage to influence the distribution of risk of parasitism among oothecae and among hosts. These were (1) that some parasites - but no mantids - emerged successfully prior to bird predation and (2) that extensive post-damage foraging by parasitoids occurred, but that the nature of this foraging was altered little by oothecal damage. 4. In all, bird damage engendered a fourfold increase (from 1.5 to 6.5) in the CV2 of parasitism risk among hosts (a stability criterion that has been proposed for host-parasitoid interactions) and increased the relative importance of host-density-dependent parasitism.

Data on host use by herbivorous insects in the tropics cannot be cross-referenced between the studies as only a fraction of the species can be formally identified. It is thus imperative for each study to include a wide range of plant and insect taxa, but this requirement has rarely been met because of logistical difficulties. 2. A novel approach using mass insect collecting and rearing by parataxonomists was applied to study the use of 59 species, 39 genera and 18 families of woody plants by 58 588 individuals and 1010 species of leaf-chewing insects in a lowland rainforest. 3. Most species had wide host plant ranges with reference to congeneric plants. The modal host range for a herbivore feeding on a particular genus (Ficus, Macaranga or Psychotria) included >90% of congeneric species studied. Only 3.7% of species feeding on these genera were monophagous. 4. Most herbivores were specialized with respect to confamilial plant genera, with modal host range of 1 genus from 9 studied in Euphorbiaceae and 13 in Rubiaceae. This pattern was corroborated by modal host range of 1 plant family from 18 studied. 5. Because of the overlap among the herbivore communities on congeneric plants, the total number of herbivores on speciose plant genera was relatively small. For example, although 336 species of leaf-chewers used the 13 study species of Ficus, the 35 additional Ficus species present locally would support only estimated 163 additional species. 6. Since large genera constitute a significant proportion of tropical floras, these results have implications for regional estimates of herbivore species richness.

Tundra swans forage on below-ground pondweed tubers that are heterogeneously distributed in space. The swans have no visual cues to delineate patches.

A quantitative analysis of movement paths recorded over short time frames (15 min) revealed that the sequential step lengths were strongly autocorrelated. After partitioning the data in low-speed paths and high-speed paths, this autocorrelation was very much reduced. 3. Movement paths with low speed were non-directional and could well be described as random walks. In contrast, high-speed paths were directed forward, and were better described as correlated (i.e. directional) random walks. 4.

Although little investigated, developmental processes that generate dispersal condition evolution of this behaviour. We have shown previously prenatal and postnatal influences on dispersal in the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara). The observation of these developmental processes was based on independent experiments; our primary goal in this paper is to test their interactions. Interactions could indeed be a source of inconsistencies in studies because they can mask, or even reverse, effects of factors treated additively. 2. We studied dispersal of juveniles released in natura from 416 pregnant females captured in the field. We used a factorial design to test interactions among the maternal habitat (dry vs. humid), prenatal conditions (temperature, humidity), and postnatal environments (dry vs. humid). 3. We found that juvenile dispersal was dependent on the humidity level at different developmental stages, but with varying and sometimes opposite effects. Dispersal was also influenced by the temperature during gestation and by populational differences not related to humidity (differences between replicated populations for the maternal and postnatal habitats). 4. These results confirm our previous findings that dispersal of the common lizard is condition-dependent and has multiple causation. In addition, most of the effects exhibited interactions, and the ontogeny of dispersal appeared as a sequential process where the maternal habitat conditioned prenatal influences, and the prenatal environment modulated postnatal influences. 5. The robustness of our results is supported by the finding of the same interactions in independent tests on both juvenile males and females.

During the past 15 years, models have been used increasingly in predictive population ecology. Matrix models used for predicting the fates of populations are often extremely basic, ignoring density dependence, spatial scale and behaviour, and often based on one sex only. We tested the importance of some of these omissions for model realism, by comparing the performance of a variety of population models of varying levels of complexity. 2. Detailed data from more than 13 years of behavioural and demographic research on a population of alpine marmots Marmota marmota in Berchtesgaden National Park, southern Germany, were used to parameterize four different population models. The models ranged from a simple population-based matrix model, to a spatially explicit behaviour-based model. 3. The performance of the models was judged by their ability to predict basic population dynamics under equilibrium conditions. Only a spatially explicit individual-based model ignoring optimal behaviour predicted dynamics significantly different to those observed in the field, highlighting the importance of considering realistic patterns of behaviour in spatially explicit models. 4. Using realistic levels of environmental and demographic stochasticity, variance in population growth rates predicted by all models was high, even within the range of population densities experienced in the field. This emphasizes the difficulty of using population-level field data to determine overall patterns of density dependence for use in population models. 5. All models were also used to predict potential density-dependent effects on alpine marmot population growth. In this regard, the models differed greatly. It was concluded that the simplest matrix model was adequate for making predictions regarding population sizes or densities under equilibrium conditions, but that for predictions requiring an understanding of transient dynamics only the behavioural model would be adequate. 6. An emergent feature of this study of alpine marmot population dynamics was the prediction of a demographic Allee effect with a profound influence on population dynamics across a very broad range of population sizes. Three mechanisms were identified as underlying this Allee effect: stochastic skews in sex ratio and demographic composition at low population sizes; less efficient social thermoregulation during hibernation in small groups; and difficulties with mate finding during dispersal, even at relatively high population sizes.",99,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Allee effects | Behaviour-based models | Density dependence | Individual-based models | Matrix models,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,68

In the 2 years following manipulation the ratios in treatment and control ponds converged. The convergence resulted from the spread of the additional species across all the ponds rather than acquisition or extinction of species within treatment ponds compensating for the skewed ratios. 4.

To do so, we used randomly constructed interaction matrices for competitive systems. To determine co-existence, we tested for local stability and equilibrium feasibility of these theoretical assemblages. 3. As expected, we found that a low mean species interaction strength could allow for many species to co-exist. However, variance in the interaction strengths may alter previous results; two systems with the same mean interaction strength show markedly different diversity depending critically on the magnitude of the variance. If species are similar enough then many can co-exist, even if they compete strongly. 4. In addition we found that the species richness of a competitive community can greatly depend on the correlation between interaction strengths, an issue that so far has gone unreported. This correlation, a result of trade-offs between species' characteristics, may profoundly increase the potential for stable co-existence of a highly species-rich community. 5.

Climatic variables are known to affect reproduction and survival in birds. 2. Barn swallows Hirundo rustica L. are long-distance migratory passerines that produce two broods in much of the European range. The relative importance of first and second broods for annual reproductive success in relation to a measure of general climatic conditions - the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) - was assessed during a long-term study from 1970 to 2000. 3. The size of first clutches increased with increasing NAO values, and clutch size increased during the study period. Brood size and hatching, fledging or breeding success did not show a significant temporal change, nor were they related significantly to NAO. However, in years with high NAO index values first broods were relatively larger than second broods compared to years with low NAO values. Similarly, the breeding success of first relative to second broods was larger in years with high NAO index values compared to years with low NAO values. 4. The quality of offspring measured in terms of T cell-mediated immune response at age 12 days was related to NAO, with offspring of first broods having stronger immune responses than offspring from second broods during years with high NAO values. 5. Individual females showed patterns of change in brood size in response to change in NAO that paralleled the patterns observed at the population level. This provides evidence of phenotypic plasticity. 6. Immigration to the study population increased following a year when annual productivity was caused mainly by fledglings from the first brood. This implies that increases in NAO increases the size of the barn swallow population through effects on the relative productivity of first broods.",102,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Barn swallow | Body condition | Breeding success | Demography | Hirundo rustica | Immune response | Phytohaemagglutinin | Population dynamics,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,71

Several hypotheses have attempted to explain why sedentary populations persist in the wintering grounds of many migratory bird species. For instance, residents may overcome the flooding of their range if they are better competitors than migrants. Alternatively, each population fraction may use different resources or even different habitat types, for example because residents benefit from site tenacity while migrants benefit from resource tracking. 2. To evaluate these hypotheses, we studied the distribution of sympatric migratory and sedentary blackcaps (Sylvia atricapilla) in southern Spain during two winters. We distinguished two habitat types: forests, which are used by residents for breeding, and shrublands, to which blackcaps spread in winter with the arrival of migrants. Shrublands are unsheltered habitats that show more abundant but less diverse fruits than forests. We investigated (i) if blackcaps show habitat segregation with respect to migratory behaviour, sex, age and body size, (ii) what resources are used by each population fraction within each habitat type and (iii) how habitat occupancy affects the body condition of individuals. 3. Residents were almost completely restricted to forests, while migrants occupied both habitat types. Among migrants, adults predominated in forests and juveniles in shrublands, but no sexual segregation was found. Body size was larger in residents than in migrants, and these were larger in forests than in shrublands (especially juveniles). If larger birds are dominant, these results support the idea that residents may endure in forests and exclude the most subordinate migrants (juveniles and small birds) towards shrublands. 4. Within forests, migrants and residents tracked fruit abundance, but residents were also associated with the most suitable breeding sites. Migrants tracked fruits less closely in shrublands, due probably to a higher fruit abundance and a lower availability of shelter. 5. Habitat segregation did not affect muscular development of migrants. However, migrants accumulated more fat in shrublands. Therefore, differences in nutritional quality cannot explain why adult and larger blackcaps predominate in forests. Instead, other factors such as food diversity or exposure to predators might account for this distribution. 6. Our results provide a mechanism to explain the persistence of sedentary populations despite migrants overflowing their range and using the same resources. Residents may challenge the arrival of conspecifics because they are better competitors. From an evolutionary perspective, this shows that non-breeding processes may be as important as breeding benefits accrued to migrants for explaining the dynamics of migratory and sedentary populations.",97,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Body condition | Habitat segregation | Resource use | Sylvia atricapilla | Winter ecology,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,72

Seven species of mustelid carnivore live in the British Isles: weasel, stoat, mink, polecat, pine marten, badger and otter. Recent studies have hypothesized that coexistence of these species is facilitated by partitioning of resources according to prey size, particularly that of mammalian prey. This hypothesis has been supported by evidence of character displacement derived from even size ratios in skull length and canine diameter. 2. To test whether this hypothesis is supported by empirical data, 98 studies of the diet of mustelids living in Great Britain and Ireland were analysed. Two main predictions were tested; that larger males ate larger prey than females and that larger species ate larger prey than smaller species. 3. Male mustelids ate larger prey than females but there was no relationship between predator size and prey size, either for all species or when largely vermivorous badgers and piscivorous otters were excluded. There was no difference in dietary niche breadth between the sexes. Dietary niche breadth increased with body size in the assemblage excluding otters and badgers. The dietary niches of mustelids were partitioned along several axes, none of which was clearly related to prey size. 4. The dietary niches of the five species living in Ireland (stoat, mink, pine marten, otter and badger) were more similar to one another in Ireland than in Great Britain and there was no difference in niche breadth between Irish and British mustelids. There was no evidence of competitive release in the diets of Irish mustelids. 5. Resource partitioning according to prey size is apparent between the sexes within species, and this is probably correlated to sexual selection for size dimorphism. Empirical data do not, however, support a hypothesis of resource partitioning according to prey size between species.

We studied a fluctuating population of the northern short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) in the Appalachian Plateau Province of Pennsylvania, USA, spanning 21 years of monitoring. We analysed the pattern of annual temporal variation fitting both time-series models and capture-mark-recapture (CMR) statistical models for survival and recruitment rates. 2. We determined that non-linear first-order models explain almost 80% of the variation in annual per capita population growth rates. In particular, a non-linear self-excited threshold autoregressive (SETAR) model describes the time-series data well. Average snowfall showed positive and non-linear effects on population dynamics. 3. The CMR statistical models showed that a non-linear threshold model with strong effects of population density was the best one to describe temporal variation in survival rates. On the other hand, population density or climatic variables did not explain temporal variation in recruitment rates. Survival rates were high during the study period. Weekly changes in population size attributable to new recruits entering in the population fluctuate between 21% and 0%, while the changes in population size related to survival fluctuate between 79% and 100%. 4. Two important results arise from this study. First, non-linear models with first-order feedback appear to capture the essential features of northern short-tailed shrew dynamics and demography. Secondly, climate effects represented by snowfall appear to be small and non-linear on this insectivore. The population dynamics of this shrew in the Appalachian Plateau are determined apparently by a strong non-linear first-order feedback process, which is related to survival rates. 5.

Logistic regression analysis suggested further that individual duckling prefledging survival was moderate in the earliest phase of the breeding season, greatest in mid-season and lowest later on. 3. However, selection acting against early hatched ducklings was surpassed by strong directional selection favouring recruitment of the earliest hatching females. The absolute and relative numbers of female recruits produced by a breeding female declined sharply with advancing hatch date in all species. 4. Unlike previous studies, an hypothesized intraspecific trade-off between duckling mass and brood size was detected, being very robust in two of three species. 5. Unexpectedly, female age effects on recruitment were manifested only indirectly by several pathways, the most important being the earlier hatching dates of older females.

Most studies of animal movements and habitat selection do not recognize empirically that different components of the environment are important to animals at different scales. Often, availability of habitats is defined at one or more arbitrary spatio-temporal scales, but use of those habitats is constrained to one scale.

We used a non-linear curve-fitting model of movement rates to identify discontinuities in the scales of movement by woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou collared with global positioning system (GPS) collars. 2. We differentiated intrapatch from interpatch movements, but were unable to distinguish interpatch from migratory-type movements for most combinations of individual caribou by season. Model fit was stronger for winter than summer movements. We suggest that increased patch heterogeneity during the winter resulted in interseason variation in movements and corresponding model fit. 3. Responses by caribou to the environment were scale-dependent. When we applied logistic regressions, land-cover type, energetic costs of movement, and predation risk differentiated the two scales of movement. Intrapatch movements had a lower cost of movement, were associated with cover types where foraging behaviours probably occurred, and were closer to areas of higher predator risk than interpatch movements. 4.

Demographic data from both breeding and non-breeding periods are needed to manage populations of migratory birds, many of which are declining in abundance and are of conservation concern. Although habitat associations, and to a lesser extent, reproductive biology, are known for many migratory species, few studies have measured survival rates of these birds at different parts of their annual cycle. 2. Cormack-Jolly-Seber models and Akaike's information criterion model selection were used to investigate seasonal variation in survival of a Nearctic - Neotropical migrant songbird, the black-throated blue warbler, Dendroica caerulescens. Seasonal and annual survival were estimated from resightings of colour-ringed individuals on breeding grounds in New Hampshire, USA from 1986 to 2000 and on winter quarters in Jamaica, West Indies from 1986 to 1999. Warblers were studied each year during the May-August breeding period in New Hampshire and during the October-March overwinter period in Jamaica. 3. In New Hampshire, males had higher annual survival (0.51 ± 0.03) and recapture probabilities (0.93 ± 0.03) than did females (survival: 0.40 ± 0.04; recapture: 0.87 ± 0.06). In Jamaica, annual survival (0.43 ± 0.03) and recapture (0.95 ± 0.04) probabilities did not differ between sexes. Annual survival and recapture probabilities of young birds (i.e. yearlings in New Hampshire and hatch-year birds in Jamaica) did not differ from adults, indicating that from the time hatch-year individuals acquire territories on winter quarters in mid-October, they survive as well as adults within the same habitat. 4. Monthly survival probabilities during the summer (May-August) and winter (October-March) stationary periods were high: 1.0 for males in New Hampshire, and 0.99 ± 0.01 for males in Jamaica and for females in both locations. 5. These annual and seasonal survival estimates were used to calculate warbler survival for the migratory periods. Monthly survival probability during migration ranged from 0.77 to 0.81 ± 0.02. Thus, apparent mortality rates were at least 15 times higher during migration compared to that in the stationary periods, and more than 85% of apparent annual mortality of D. caerulescens occurred during migration. 6.

Measures of the quality of an individual are important in the study of proximate and ultimate factors in biology. Records of developmental history are particularly desirable, as many phenotypical traits are influenced by conditions during growth. Conspicuous irregularities in feathers, known as fault bars, result from a variety of stresses that occur during feather growth. The frequency of fault bars was evaluated on primary and tail feathers (grown 1 year previously) of 1919 adult American kestrels from a breeding population in Canada (1990-97). 2. Most (91.5%) birds exhibited some fault-barring, although females had significantly more feathers with fault bars than males (17% vs. 14%, respectively). Body size, intensity of haematozoan infections and leucocyte differentials were all unrelated to fault bars; however, birds with many fault bars were in poor body condition during prelaying (males) and incubation (males and females). 3. Individual kestrels tended to be consistent in the number of feathers with fault bars from year to year. 4. The percentage of feathers with fault bars was not associated with the timing of arrival in spring or prey abundance per territory; however, birds of both sexes with many bars were less likely to breed. Birds paired non-randomly, as mates tended to have a similar frequency of fault bars. Males and females with many bars had significantly later clutch initiation dates, but there were no negative consequences regarding clutch size or egg size. 5. Female kestrels with many fault bars had lower survival probabilities. Both sexes were also less likely to be recaptured in years following initial banding if they had many bars, suggesting that they were more likely to emigrate from the study area temporarily. 6. Fault bars on feathers appear to be indicative of an individual's susceptibility to stress, and are useful in predicting components of fitness.

The timing and mechanism of the maternal response to ectoparasites is investigated in a host-parasite system consisting of great tits and a haematophageous ectoparasite, the hen flea. It has been demonstrated previously that a maternal response to this parasite enhances survival and fertility of the offspring. This may have arisen by either a maternally transferred protection via the egg, or by a parental response affecting the common rearing environment after hatching. Two experiments aimed to differentiate between the two possibilities are reported here. 2. First, mothers were either exposed to or kept free of ectoparasite during egg production, and subsequently the newborn nestlings were cross-fostered between the two treatments. The experimental design discriminates as to whether the maternal effect arises before or after hatching. Within the same nest, the nestlings originating from previously exposed mothers grew faster than nestlings of unexposed mothers. 3. Secondly, we tested for the transfer of parasite-induced immunoglobulins (IgG) via the egg. Mothers were kept free of ectoparasites until they had laid the first egg and were then either exposed to or kept free of ectoparasites to the end of laying. The IgG-concentration significantly increased from the first to the eighth egg of exposed mothers, but not in eggs of unexposed ones. 4. In summary, the first experiment shows that ectoparasites can induce a beneficial maternal response at egg laying, and the second experiment suggests that the maternal effect is due to immunoglobulins transferred via the egg. Maternal responses to other parasites, e.g. blood parasites, are known for chicken in captivity. In natural populations of birds both the timing and mechanism of the response are poorly understood, despite their relevance for behavioural and population ecology.",70,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Host-parasite interaction | IgG x transfer | Maternal response | Parasite-induced immunoglobulins | Parus major,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,81

In 1934, Adolf Remane constructed a diagram to describe changes in the number of species along a full salinity gradient within the Baltic. Despite fundamental differences in tidal regimes, the Baltic model has been applied directly to estuaries, becoming subsequently the textbook model for estuarine diversity trends. 2. Despite its ubiquity, the Remane diagram has many inconsistent features, making it unsuitable as a quantitative tool for comparing diversity trends between estuaries, including poor definition of x-axis (salinity), y-axis (number of species) and variations in sample location (subtidal/intertidal) than can greatly influence the resulting diversity/salinity relationship. Consequently, diversity trends within and between estuaries remain to be tested robustly. 3. The major environmental factor influencing the distribution of organisms in estuaries is salinity variation, rather than absolute salinity tolerance as in the Baltic. As salinity range demonstrates a quadratic relationship with mean salinity, an alternative linear model is therefore suggested utilizing mean salinity range at any one point in the estuary (x-axis) and mean α-diversity of macroinvertebrates (y-axis) obtained from subtidal samples to allow comparison with river systems and to minimize salinity variability between interstitial and overlying water. 4. The model was tested on an extensive subtidal data set from the Thames estuary (salinity 0-35), significant negative linear relationships between salinity range and α-diversity being apparent for annual and seasonal data sets. Significant models were also possible for both 'marine' and 'freshwater' halves of the estuary and for meiofauna α-diversity. 5. The linear model allows formal, statistical investigation of the differences in diversity trends between estuaries and the development of testable hypotheses on aspects of estuarine diversity, including the causes of the species minimum in estuaries. It also has potential as a management tool enabling the definition of sites of concern that fall below their predicted diversity. 6. The new model of diversity now requires testing in systems additional to the Thames in order to determine whether this relationship is a macroecological phenomenon or restricted to the test system.",198,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Benthic invertebrates | Salinity range | Thames,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,82

Recent explanations for the persistence of freshwater invertebrates in the face of downstream drift (the so-called 'drift paradox') have centred largely on recolonization by upstream flight by preovipositing adults. 2. Such explanations do not cover the many important species often found in the drift that lack an aerial phase. Here we demonstrate conclusively that long-range aerial movements are not required to explain the drift paradox. 3. We show that small-scale movements along the streambed of the order of centimetres, combined with density dependence at some stage of the lifecycle, are sufficient to maintain populations over geological timescales. 4. Further, we demonstrate that the principal previous modelling study of the drift paradox was parameterized in a way that is more compatible with such small-scale movements than the long-range flight for which it was intended.",41,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Colonization cycle | Dispersal | Invertebrate drift | Metapopulation | Population persistence,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,84

Latitudinal variation among species in life-history traits is often suggested to contribute to high tropical species richness. However, traditional methods of analysing such variation rarely control for phylogeny and latitudinal range overlap between species, potentially giving misleading results. 2. Using a method of pairwise independent contrasts which overcomes these problems, I tested for latitudinal variation among bird species in a number of traits which have been linked, theoretically or empirically, with both latitude and species richness. 3. This method indicates strong support for Rapoport's Rule and decreasing clutch size towards the equator in both hemispheres, but only partial support for decreasing body size and ecological generalism towards the equator. 4. Indirect measures of sexual selection (sexual dichromatism and size dimorphism) show no variation with latitude; an apparent increase in dichromatism towards the equator is shown to be an artefact of phylogeny. 5. Many of the associations between life history and latitude were not detected by traditional cross-species analyses, highlighting the importance of incorporating phylogeny and overlap in studies of geographical life-history variation.

Female southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina L.) expend variable, often large, amounts of their stored body resources on their pups during lactation. There is some evidence that pups with higher weaning masses have a better chance of surviving their first year. But in order to understand what level of maternal investment is required to produce successful pups, we need to understand the behaviour and problems faced by naïve pups before nutritional independence. 2. We used satellite telemetry to track 30 newly weaned pups on their first trip to sea from their natal site at Macquarie Island in 1995 and 1996. Track duration varied from 2 to 179 (mean, 77) days. Seven seals were tracked for the entire duration of their first trip. 3. The movements were grouped into three phases. Phase 1 (mean duration 30 days) was characterized by rapid and directed dispersal from Macquarie Island at daily travel rates of up to 140 km day-1. Phase 2 (mean duration 67 days) consisted of slower travel rates (generally < 20 km day-1) where activity was often centred on localized patches up to 1900 km from Macquarie Island. This phase was sometimes interrupted by bouts of increased travel rate as the seal moved to another patch. Phase 3 (mean duration 42 days) consisted of prolonged increased travel rates as the seals returned to Macquarie or, in one case, Chatham Island. 4. The routes of the tracks to the south-east were very similar. Simulated tracks based on a constant heading of magnetic east, at variable swimming speed, and modified by ocean current vectors produced a pattern similar to, but not identical to, the south-east tracks. The tracks to the west and south were more diverse and meandering. 5. Based on a nearest neighbour analysis, neither sex, year nor weaning mass influenced Phase 1-2 or Phase 2-3 transition locations. 6. Phase 2 tracks were associated in the south-eastern group with the Pacific Antarctic Ridge and in the south-west group, to a lesser extent, with the Indian Antarctic Ridge. The southern limits of Phase 2 tracks in the south-eastern group aligned with the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Circulation front. 7. Using calculated estimates of body composition at weaning and estimates of the rate of utilization of body reserves for the period before animals reach phase 2 of their trip, we estimate that large pups will have reserves remaining to supply their needs whereas pups in the small group are approaching critical limits. However, these estimates are based on several assumptions and extrapolations. More information on body composition of pups at weaning and departure is needed along with behavioural information to clarify the value of maternal expenditure in terms of offspring survival.",85,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Argos telemetry | Foraging strategy | Maternal investment | Migration | Navigation | Reporductive strategies,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,87

In many studies on cooperative breeding, helping by auxiliary individuals is considered to enhance the reproductive success of breeders. However, confounding factors other than helping could cause the differences. 2. The endemic Madagascan rufous vanga Schetba rufa (Vangidae) is known as a cooperatively breeding species. In order to evaluate the effect of helping in this species, we compared the reproductive success of breeding pairs helped by auxiliary birds, and pairs breeding alone, based on a 6-year study of an individually colour-banded population in the Ampijoroa Forest Station, western Madagascar. 3. This species is single-brooded. Brood reduction was rare and most cases of nesting failure were due to total loss of clutches and broods, probably as a result of predation. 4. Monogamous pairs with one to four auxiliary birds comprised 24-43% of all breeding groups. Most auxiliary birds were male offspring remaining in their natal territory. Auxiliary males provided a considerable contribution towards antipredator defence, territory defence and to the provisioning of nestlings. In about one-third of the groups, however, the auxiliary males did not help at all. Male offspring may remain in their natal territory in order to avoid harassment by other territorial individuals, and to increase the probability of territory acquisition and of copulation with unrelated breeding females. 5. The probability of breeding successfully was higher, and the number of fledglings produced was larger among pairs with auxiliary birds than among those breeding alone. However, provisioning by auxiliaries neither enhanced the growth rate of nestlings, nor reduced the number of days they required to fledge. 6. A pair-match comparison of the same pairs between years with and without auxiliaries showed no effect of group size on their reproductive success. Even provisioning by auxiliaries did not affect the reproductive success. 7. Pairs accompanied by auxiliary birds for more than 1 year enjoyed higher reproductive success even in those years when they were without auxiliaries than did pairs always breeding alone. 8. Neither the simple presence of auxiliaries nor their helping behaviour enhanced the reproductive success of breeding pairs.

Two main mechanisms have been proposed to account for the changes in breeding performance of long-lived animals with age: progressive appearance or disappearance of different quality individuals within a cohort and within-individual improvements with age. 2. We studied age-related breeding performance of vole-eating Tengmalm's owls (Aegolius funereus, L.), whose prey populations fluctuate in a cyclic manner in western Finland. In years of low vole abundance, most yearling owls were not able to breed. In years of initially intermediate but increasing vole abundance, clutch size increased with female age and partners of old males initiated egg-laying earlier than those of young males. In years of initially high but decreasing vole abundance, the differences in laying dates were still detectable, whereas age-related differences in clutch size of females tended to disappear. 3. Within-cohort analyses did not indicate quality differences between surviving and dying males of the same age in years of increasing vole abundance, whereas in years of decreasing vole abundance early breeding males were more likely to survive than late-breeding males. This novel finding indicates that quality differences between individuals may induce observed age-related differences in only some years, and especially that differential mortality may occur in a different year when the difference in breeding performance is detectable. 4. Within-individual analyses showed that individual males advanced their nest initiation with age, and there was a trend that females laid larger clutches with increasing age. In nests of long-lived males, a significant decline in the clutch size from mid-age (2-4 years) to older age (6-10 years) was found. 5. We conclude that environmental variation may mask age-related differences in breeding performance at the population level, since the differences appeared to emerge more clearly in poor and intermediate food conditions. Some evidence for the differential mortality-hypothesis was found for males, which are mainly responsible for subsisting their families during the entire breeding season. Substantial improvements in competence or increased reproductive effort from 1 to 3 years of age, and deteriorated skills due to senescence at older ages may account for within-individual changes in breeding performance of males.",100,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Aegolius funereus | Cyclic variation in food abundance | Differential mortality | Reproductive effort | Senescence,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,91

Plant traits can act as defences against herbivores both by reducing herbivore performance directly and by increasing the effectiveness of the natural enemies of herbivores. Natural enemy performance and rate of parasitism can be affected by plant traits and/or changes in herbivore quality. 2. Jasmonic acid is responsible for the induction of many changes in plant resistance that occur following herbivore attack. This study examines the effects of jasmonate-induced defences on the abundance and performance of natural enemies, as well as the interaction between induced plant responses and parasitism in their ability to kill herbivores. 3. In a tomato field containing plants induced with jasmonic acid and control plants, the abundance of natural enemies was counted using several census techniques. Induced resistance affected the abundance of natural enemies of herbivores differently. One predator of aphids, syrphid flies, was negatively affected by the decrease in herbivore abundance on induced plants. One parasitoid of caterpillars, Hyposoter exiguae Viereck, was not affected by induced resistance in this study although it was positively affected in a previous study. Two other natural enemies, a parasitoid of aphids and ladybeetle predators, were not affected by induced resistance. 4. Induced resistance and parasitism both reduced the survivorship of herbivores. In a 2 × 2 factorial design with induced resistance crossed by parasitism, the interaction between the effects of induced resistance and parasitism on herbivore survival was tested. Two trials of this experiment were conducted; one where induced resistance affected both herbivore quantity and quality and one where induced resistance only affected herbivore quality (herbivore density was equalized). 5. Parasitoids were more effective at killing herbivores feeding on control plants than herbivores on induced plants. This difference was due to a difference in herbivore quality, not herbivore quantity. Herbivores feeding on induced plants have lower mass than herbivores on control plants and this appears to be a major factor reducing the performance of developing parasitic wasps. 6. Thus, jasmonate-induced responses influence natural enemies species in differing ways, sometimes reducing the density of herbivores and sometimes reducing the quality of herbivores for natural enemies.",66,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Development time | Field experiment | Induced resistance | Parasitic wasp | Tomato,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,92

It is often assumed that, in migratory birds, males of highest phenotypic quality are the first to arrive at breeding grounds, as only males in good body condition can afford the costs of early arrival. Here it is argued that variation in how much an individual can gain from being early may sometimes override these patterns of condition dependence. Benefits from early arrival will depend on how good the chances of an individual are of successfully occupying and defending a high-quality territory. Other studies have shown that these chances depend on male resource-holding power (RHP) and on value asymmetries (VA), as resulting from prior ownership. 2. Patterns of spring arrival were studied in a polygynous population of the dusky warbler Phylloscopus fuscatus Blyth, a species with high breeding-site tenacity. During the period of postnuptial moult, just before departure to winter quarters, about half of the males preoccupied and vigorously defended high-quality territories. Apparently these males enhanced their success in competition over these territories in the following breeding season by taking advantage of having prior ownership. 3. Males with good chances of obtaining a high-quality territory (i.e. males that had occupied such territories before) were the first to arrive in spring, suggesting that high motivation drives early arrival. In contrast, there was no indication for male quality or body condition to affect arrival patterns. 4. Interestingly, males of small body size, possibly reflecting low RHP, invested more in gaining prior ownership than did large males. 5. The present study suggests that, in some species, individual variation in benefits rather than in costs resulting from early arrival determine which males are the first to arrive.",116,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Condition | Prior ownership | Resource-holding power | Territory quality | Value asymmetry,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,96

We did not find evidence supporting age-specific survival probabilities in males. However, in females there was a significant decline in survival after the age of 5 years. 3. Reproduction did not impair individuals' chances of being alive in the subsequent year (short-term cost) because breeding males and females had similar survival rates as non-breeders. 4.

Females skipping breeding earlier in life showed a higher probability of survival after the age of 5 years than females that bred every year until that age.

The observed decline in survival probability late in life is likely to result from an increased cost of reproduction due to higher allocation of resources to breeding earlier in life, i.e. increased effort early in life is traded with survival late in life.

This behavioural aspect of their population dynamics has been ignored, but is now examined for the first time by testing the hypotheses: (i) a power function was a suitable model for the spatial distribution of common species of Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera in a stony stream; (ii) the spatial distribution varied between species but was similar within species for larvae greater and smaller than half-size; (iii) diurnal and nocturnal spatial distributions were significantly different for each species. To ensure that the conclusions were consistent, large samples (n = 30) were taken near midday and midnight in April, June and November over 4 years. 2. Twenty-one species were taken in sufficient numbers for the analyses; seven species were too sparse to be included. The first hypothesis was supported. A power function, relating spatial variance (s2) to mean (m), was an excellent fit in all the analyses (P < 0.001, r2 > 0.95), i.e. the spatial variance was density-dependent. The power b, often used as an 'index of aggregation', varied in the range 0.88-2.50. 3. Most analyses supported the second hypothesis. For four species, the difference between the two size groups was just significant (P > 0.05), but was due to inadequate data for three species. Large larvae of the fourth species, the caddis Odontocerum albicorne, were less aggregated than small larvae at night, and were the only group with a b-value less than one. 4. The third hypothesis was partially supported. The distribution did not change significantly (P < 0.05) for nine species; five burrowers in gravel, moss or mud, two highly mobile predators, one sedentary, case-building, Trichoptera species, and one net - spinning Trichoptera species. Aggregation was reduced significantly (P < 0.001) at night for four species, all case-building Trichoptera larvae. Aggregation increased significantly (P < 0.001) at night, except at low densities, for the remaining eight species, one being a nocturnal predator and the others being herbivorous species; all occurred frequently in night samples of invertebrate drift. Day-night changes in spatial distribution were therefore an essential part of the behavioural dynamics of 12 of the 21 species, and should be investigated in other species, including terrestrial species.",24,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Aggregation | Ephemeroptera | Plecoptera | Trichoptera | Variance-mean relationship,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,98

The force of Mycobacterium bovis infection (λ) in feral ferret Mustela furo populations in New Zealand was estimated, by fitting candidate models to age-specific disease-prevalence data. The candidate models were constructed from a set of a priori hypotheses of how M. bovis infection is transmitted to ferrets, and model selection used to assess the degree of support for each hypothesis. 2. The estimated force of M. bovis infection ranged between five sites from 0.14 year1 to 5.8 year-1, and was twofold higher in males than in females. 3. The data most strongly supported the hypothesis that transmission of M. bovis to ferrets occurs from the ingestion of M. bovis-infected material from the age of weaning, as modelled by the force of infection being zero up to the age of weaning, and constant thereafter. Other candidate transmission hypotheses (e.g. mating, suckling, routine social interaction) and combinations thereof were unsupported in comparison, and hence it was concluded that transmission from these postulated mechanisms must be insignificant compared with dietary-related transmission. 4. The preferred transmission hypothesis was nearly equally supported regardless of whether disease-induced mortality was included or not, although omitting disease-induced mortality resulted in a lower force of infection estimate. The dietary transmission hypothesis (omitting disease-induced mortality) could be easily represented by a generalized linear model, enabling simple analysis of critical experiments designed to identify the source of M. bovis infection in feral ferrets.",39,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Bovine tuberculosis | Ferret | Force of infection,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,99

In sexually size-dimorphic birds, the larger sex requires more energy during growth, and often suffers from a higher mortality risk during growth than the smaller one when food is limited. 2. Sex-specific growth and mortality were examined in Tengmalm's owl Aegolius funereus (L.) nestlings, a species in which adult females are slightly larger than males. Nestlings were unambiguously sexed using molecular techniques. Nestling mortality in broods provided with supplemental food was compared with that in controls in an experiment carried out during two breeding seasons, 1998 and 1999. 3. The natural food supply during the two years of the experiment differed. Although the spring vole abundance was similar for the two years, 1998 was characterized by a less severe decline in vole abundance during the previous winter, and also a greater increase in vole abundance during the summer than 1999. It was consequently inferred that the owls' natural food supply was more limited in 1999. 4. In 1998, female nestlings attained a 5% higher asymptotic mass than males, and fed nestlings were heavier than controls. No difference in rate of mass gain or wing growth was detected. 5. Overall mortality was lower in fed broods than controls in 1999 only. Unexpectedly, female nestling mortality was unaffected by supplemental feeding during both years. However, in 1999, when natural food supply was more limited, male nestling mortality was reduced in supplementary-fed broods. 6. It is suggested that the females' larger size gives them a competitive advantage against their male siblings when fighting over food items, and that when food is limited, males rather than females suffer increased mortality owing to lack of food. 7. This study illustrates the importance of repeating food supplementation experiments to account for annual variation in natural food supply.",60,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Cyclic vole abundance | Differential mortality | Nestling mass | Repeated feeding experiment | Sibling aggression,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,100

Over the last three decades the main prey species (wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus, zebra Equus burchelli, Thomson's gazelle Gazella thomsoni, and Grant's gazelle Gazella granti) of spotted hyaenas Crocuta crocuta in the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania, substantially declined in numbers, whereas buffalo Syncerus caffer numbers increased strongly. This provided a 'natural experiment' to investigate how a generalist predator such as the spotted hyaena responds to long-term changes in prey populations. Here we compare data on the feeding ecology of Crater hyaenas from the late 1990s (period II) with equivalent data from the late 1960s (period I). 2. Hyaenas showed strong hunting preferences for wildebeest calves and gazelle fawns during both periods I and II. Adult buffaloes, prey difficult to hunt for hyaenas, were rarely hunted in either period despite a large increase in buffalo numbers from period I to II. 3. Hyaenas exhibited a functional response to the changes in prey populations by killing more buffalo calves and adult wildebeest during period II, relatively easy prey categories for hyaenas to hunt. 4. The proportion of carcasses scavenged and acquired by kleptoparasitizing other predators increased from period I to II. This was facilitated by an increase in the relative number of lion kills available to hyaenas during the same period. 5. Hyaenas defended a similar proportion of their kills against kleptoparasitic attempts by lions during both periods. Since the ratio of kills hyaenas kleptoparasitized from lions in relation to kills lost to lions increased from period I to period II, hyaenas obtained more food resources from lions during period II than I. 6. The success of hyaenas kleptoparasitizing lions was influenced by the presence of male lions and the ability of hyaenas to recruit sufficient clan members to appropriate carcasses from lions. 7. This study is the first to demonstrate both a functional response of a predator to changes in the size of prey populations and an associated change in foraging behaviour of the predator.",83,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Crocuta crocuta | Lion | Predator-prey relationship | Preference index | Scavenging,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,101
