A large-leafed and a small-leafed genotype of Trifolium repens were grown with homogeneous low or high phosphate (P) supply, or with heterogeneous P supply so that the plant grew from a low P patch into a high P patch. Intraplant distribution of recently acquired 32P, morphological and physiological characteristics and biomass allocation were measured so that genotypic variation in physiological integration for P and its implications for growth could be assessed. 2. Low vs. high homogeneous P supply induced differing proportional reductions in the values of plant characteristics with magnitude for percentage of branching of non-rooted ramets > leaf size > petiole length > internode length > stolon diameter and rate of ramet production. 3. In homogeneously supplied plants, only 5% of 32P exported from a single root was transported to proximal ramets. Genotypes differed in physiological integration: under heterogeneous P supply 50% of 32P exported from the first root of the high P patch was transported basipetally in the small-leafed compared with only 3% in the large-leafed genotype. 4. Despite the genotypic difference in 32P distribution under heterogeneous P supply, the dry mass and morphology of proximal ramets supplied with low P were unaffected by P supply to distal ramets in both genotypes. 5. The size of distal ramets in heterogeneously supplied plants was smaller than in plants with homogeneous high P supply. Consequently, in both genotypes placement of ramets and ramet size were influenced by both the local environment and by the environment of proximal ramets (i.e. by the nutritional status of the whole plant). 6. Compared to the large-leafed genotype, the small-leafed genotype had less rapid production of biomass, smaller responses of relative growth rates to different rates of P supply, more ramets with leaves when grown in low P supply, and, when exposed to hererogenous P supply, an elevated tissue concentration of phosphorus in leaves. It was concluded that the genotypes differed in growth strategy in a manner consistent with predictions based on fertility level within their habitat of origin and that thorough assessment of physiological integration of P nutrition within genotypes of T. repens required measurement of all the processes involved in acquisition, allocation and utilization of P.",Clonal plant | Environmental heterogeneity | Phosphorus distribution | Radioactive tracer | Resource acquisition,NA,NA

Fitness decreased with later seedling emergence in five of six population-by-year combinations tested. 3 The frequency of juvenile mortality also differed with emergence date in five cases. 4 Later emerging plants flowered sooner than would be expected based on the range of emergence dateS, but this was not sufficient to overcome the penalty of late emergence on flower and fruit production. Total flowers per flowering plant always decreased with later emergence, and total fruits and seed-set were negatively correlated with emergence date for two of the three populations. 5 Fitness functions were used to describe the fitness relationship between emergence dates. In all cases individual fitness declined non-linearly at later emergence dates, and in many cases the earliest emergents had the highest expected fitness. The variance in fitness differed among years and sites, and ranged from 0.043 to 0.766 seeds individual. 6 The degree to which days to seedling emergence was heritable in two further native populations of P. drummondii was measured by conducting divergent artificial selection for two generations.

For long-lived species, drought episodes have not generally been found to cause population decline of more than about 20%. There are no documented examples of recurring recruitment episodes. Single recruitment episodes reported have been highly variable in magnitude and often patchy in space. 4 Continuous processes of recruitment and mortality have been recorded as background in most arid zone shrub populations, but the contribution of this low level change to overall dynamics is often perceived as small in comparison to episodic events.

In Macaranga triloba, ants are nourished by food bodies (FBs) that are produced on the abaxial surfaces of recurved stipules. We estimated the costs arising from this kind of anti-herbivore defence by following FB production. 3 FB production of 36 different-sized plants was estimated in the field by comparing even-aged stipules with and without access for ants. 4 FB dry mass production amounted to about 5% of daily above-ground biomass production in unbranched saplings. When the chemical composition of FB and leaf tissue was taken into account, this represented about 9% of the above-ground tissue construction costs. In energetic terms, unbranched saplings invested 0.6-5% of their total assimilation in the FBs. 5 The relative investment in anti-herbivore defence arising from FB production decreased hyperbolically with increasing plant size. However, a linear relationship was found between FB production and plant size. Thus, in spite of the plants' decreasing relative investment with increasing size, a continually increasing food supply was provided for the ant colonies. 6 A second study was conducted to investigate whether FB production is influenced quantitatively by the presence of symbiotic ants. Ant-inhabited plants produced up to 35 times (mean 8 times) more FBs than similar-sized but ant-free ones. This difference resulted mainly from lower stipule numbers in ant-free plants. FB production of a whole plant therefore seems to be regulated to a high degree via stipule longevity. 7 Since the ants protect their host-plant very effectively, nourishing specialized mutualistic ants by FBs must be considered a rather expensive, but nevertheless highly beneficial, strategy of anti-herbivore defence, but regulation ensures that FB production is maintained at high rates only when ants are present.",Ant-plant interaction | Costs of 'biotic' defence | Mutualism | Myrmecophytism | Regulation of metabolic costs,NA,NA

In each experimental gap, we recorded the cover of the understorey species in four 4-m2 permanent quadrats from before to 4 years after gap formation. We estimated resistance to disturbance in terms of changes in species composition and abundance. 3 Younger communities changed less than older ones after disturbance. Sites with more species changed less in composition after gap formation than less rich sites. Richer quadrats contained species that could react quickly to disturbance by increasing their cover and preventing invaders from dominating the understorey. 4 Stronger resistance of understorey species communities to gap formation can persist in older sites because of the particular disturbance regime. Gaps created by the spruce budworm in older sites dominated by balsam fir increase microsite heterogeneity and diversity by allowing the co-existence of early and late successional species.",Boreal understorey | Community structure | Disturbance | Resistance,NA,NA

Size also had little impact on rhizome production. Within sets of genetically identical ramets, flowering ramets were larger than non-flowering ramets. When there was an effect of habitat, ramets performed best in late successional forest. 4 Neither sexual nor asexual reproduction decreased the future performance of a ramet. Having connections to other ramets had little effect on survivorship or rhizome production, but often was associated with an increased probability of flowering. Clones with more ramets outperformed smaller clones and spread the risk of genet mortality. 5 Rhizome lengths were shorter in the high light, early successional forest, but no other clonal growth parameters differed between habitats. Empirically calibrated simulation and diffusion models indicated that the between-habitat differences in rhizome length were not great enough to affect the long-term expansion of clones. 6 Diffusion coefficients for the long-term spread by clonal growth or seed dispersal were compared for a number of species.

Variation in leaf RWC was analysed in relation to soil depth, soil water potential and species composition of the vegetation at the sampled sites. 2 Despite the unusual severity of the drought, low RWC was confined to the vegetation of shallow daleside soils and rock outcrops where turgor remained conspicuously higher in tap-rooted forbs such as Sanguisorba minor and Pimpinella saxifraga. Over the sampled area as a whole; it was apparent that desiccation-avoidance through continued access to subsoil moisture was more important as a controller of leaf RWC than restriction of transpiration. 3 Under the extreme conditions of 1995 differences in water relations became apparent between several pairs of congeners and morphologically similar species co-existing in the same communities. 4 In species with distributions concentrated on the deeper soils of the plateau and valley bottom, a consistent correlation was established between declining frequency of occurrence and falling values in RWC. This relationship was due to the failure of outlying populations on shallow soil to maintain turgor and suggested that extreme moisture stress was acting as a resetting mechanism restricting the excursion of drought-sensitive species on to the areas of shallow soil. 5 With the exception of a small number of tap-rooted plants, species associated with the shallow soils and rock outcrops showed a negative relationship between abundance in communities and leaf RWC; this supports the hypothesis that areas of shallow soil are suboptimal for such species and merely provide a refuge from the competitive effects of the more robust species occupying the deeper soils.",Community | Limestone grassland | Water stress,NA,NA

Only the more temporally stable properties showed any relationship with vegetation patterns. 5 These results suggest that environmental gradients reflect patterns of environmental variation in four dimensions. Variation in the vertical dimension and over time is as pronounced and important as variation in the horizontal dimensions. 6 Many methods used to analyse vegetation implicitly assume temporal and spatial stability of environmental properties.

The production of vegetative propagules is often limited by the patchy availability of light in the understorey. A field study and a greenhouse experiment investigated the patterns of clonal growth under different light conditions in the shade-tolerant herb species Uvularia perfoliata. 2 In the field study, vegetative propagation in four populations, two growing under closed canopy and two in gaps, was compared. A significantly higher proportion of plants in gap populations produced clonal offspring than plants from closed-canopy populations, possibly because of higher light availability. The cost to plants of producing clonal offspring was seen as a significantly lower probability of survival and reduced capacity of the survivors for future clonal propagation. 3 In the greenhouse experiment, offspring ramets of three size classes (small, medium and large) from both closed-canopy and gap sites were grown under low and high light conditions. Plants grown from larger ramets from both sites produced more clonal offspring and invested more biomass in reserves and clonal propagation than plants grown from small ramets. Counter to our expectations, plants did not produce more clonal offspring in high light than in low light. However, plants invested more biomass in clonal propagation in high light, especially if they were grown from larger ramets. The only evidence for adaptation to conditions at the site of origin was that increased reserve allocation in high light was more marked in plants from gaps. The effect of tamer size on performance was stronger than the effect of light level or site of origin of plants, although plants grown from larger ramets also benefited more from high light. 4 Unless plants have sufficient biomass and morphological capacity their positive response to high light is delayed. Although clonal propagation is always costly, costs are less severe in gaps where plants have the potential to produce clonal offspring repeatedly in consecutive seasons.

However, debate has focused on genetic variation that is neutral rather than under selection. This distinction is particularly important in antagonistic or co-evolutionary interactions such as host-pathogen or predator-prey systems. Plant host-pathogen systems provide some of the best examples of studies in which numerical and genetic dynamics have been investigated in a spatially explicit context, and where genes under selection can be unambiguously identified. 2 Empirical studies of natural host-pathogen interactions have shown that, while in some cases pathogens appear to be locally adapted to their hosts, in others there is no local correspondence between resistance and virulence genes. Recent theory suggests that the dynamics (epidemic vs. endemic) and migration rates of host and pathogen will be important factors in the maintenance of genetic polymorphisms in resistance and virulence. 3 We argue that the relative spatial scales at which hosts and pathogens interact are crucial to understanding the evolution of resistance/virulence structure. Pathogens that disperse further than their hosts will be more likely to show gene-for-gene interactions than pathogens dispersing over spatial scales similar to or smaller than their hosts. 4 We predict that life-history features that influence encounter rates between specific host and pathogen genotypes will be important factors in determining the evolution of resistance-virulence structures. In particular, we would expect correlative and/or causal relationships between pathogen life-history features [e.g. local vs. systemic infection, type (fecundity vs. mortality) and severity of effects], and whether dynamics are endemic or epidemic. 5 Plant host-pathogen systems provide ideal models for investigating the evolution of non-neutral genetic variation in spatial systems.

In the intermediate part of this elevational gradient, the maximum annual increase of 1.2 mm of silt corresponded to an annual increase of 5.6 g N m-2 in the topsoil (0-50cm). The average sea level rise in this area over the last 170 years was 0.63 mm year-1. A sedimentation model suggests that this has had strong effects on sedimentation and the annual inundation frequency in the mid-part of the elevational gradient, thus affecting vegetation zonation on the salt marsh. For the major part of the investigated transects, sea level rise has probably speeded up succession due to an increased rate of sedimentation. 3 The occurrence and dominance of all plant species were recorded in 3927 plots, and and for the 11 most common species response surfaces were calculated for their dependence on elevation and transect age. Most plant species were clearly separated along these axes. Most halophytic species, which were preferred by the geese, occurred early in succession and low on the gradient, where we observed the highest densities of Brent geese grazing. Forage quality of Festuca rubra increased towards the lower salt marsh. Other preferred forage species (Puccinellia maritima and Plantago maritima) were gradually displaced during succession by the tall grass Elymus athericus, especially in the mid- and upper salt marsh. Few geese grazed in areas where Elymus was dominant. 4 Herbivores first increased in numbers but then declined along a gradient of primary productivity. We propose that declining forage quality (due to changing vegetation composition during succession) is a better explanation for this pattern than the classic explanation of predator control of herbivores at high levels of primary productivity. This quality threshold hypothesis, as an alternative explanation of the exploitation ecosystem hypothesis, is expected to hold especially where smaller (quality-sensitive) herbivores such as geese are present. 5 Grazing by cattle in a 200-year-old part of the salt marsh led to the disappearance of Elymus athericus, to establishment of early successional halophytes and a return of Brent geese. Grazing by a larger herbivore therefore facilitated conditions for smaller herbivores by preventing the dominance of plant species that were good light competitors, and thus improved forage quality. Populations of these small herbivores could then become regulated by predators, although none was present at our site.",Facilitation | Herbivory | Nitrogen accumulation | Salt marsh | Sea level rise | Succession,all,All Open Access

We have developed a more general hypothesis that includes these contradictory predictions as special cases that apply under different types of resource dynamics and different types of interactions between the growth and survival components of fitness. 2 The two-phase resource dynamics hypothesis of plant interactions along productivity gradients is based on the fact that soil resources are usually supplied in pulses rather than continuously, as assumed by most formal theory for community dynamics of terrestrial plants. When soil resource supply is temporarily variable, individual plants will experience two distinct phases of resource availability: pulse periods when resources are high and most growth and resource accumulation occurs, and interpulse periods when resources are too low for most plants to take up and most mortality due to resource deficits takes place. 3 Competitive effects on growth should occur during pulses at both high and low productivity. In productive environments, interpulse intervals should be relatively mild and infrequent and therefore competitive effects during pulses will usually be important for individual and population persistence. However, as productivity decreases, the frequency of pulses (as well as or in place of their magnitude) often decreases and the duration of interpulse periods increases. Therefore, we suggest that processes occurring during interpulse intervals become increasingly important for individual and population persistence as interpulse intervals become longer. Whether or not competition occurs under low productivity will then depend on (i) the extent to which the asymptotically low resource availability during interpulse periods is determined by plant uptake or by abiotic factors such as leaching, drainage evaporation and volatization and (ii) the extent to which decreased growth due to competition during pulses results in decreased survival during pulse periods. 4 According to the two-phase resource dynamics hypothesis. Grime's hypothesis that competition is unimportant at low productivity will hold when soil resource availability between pulses in unproductive environments is controlled by abiotic factors and which survival during interpulse intervals is independent of or even negatively correlated with growth during pulse periods. In contrast, Newman's and Tilman's hypothesis that competition is equally important along productivity gradients will apply when either of these conditions is not true. We predict that the conditions for Grime's hypothesis to apply are more likely for productivity gradients driven by water than by mineral nutrients and when response to competition is measured for community structure or individual survival rather than for individual growth. 5 We tested the predictions about water vs. nutrient gradients and growth vs. survival or community structure response using data from a literature survey on field and garden experiments measuring relative competition intensity along productivity gradients. The results are consistent with the prediction that competitive effects on survival but not on growth will increase with productivity. However, the second prediction on nutrient vs. water gradients is not supported, although data on water gradients are extremely limited. 6 We intend this description and preliminary test of the two-phase resource dynamics hypothesis to stimulate experiments that explicitly examine processes occurring during pulse and interpulse phases of resource supply, as well as more direct comparisons of actual resource dynamics along productivity gradients. Even if the details of the hypothesis do not hold up under such detailed scrutiny, our more general point should still be relevant: that much of the controversy over the role of competition along productivity gradients could be resolved by a more careful consideration of the conditions under which apparently contradictory hypotheses are expected to apply.",Depletion ability | Drought tolerance | Nutrient gradients | Plant competition | Productivity gradients | Pulsed resources | Unproductive environments | Water gradients,NA,NA

For each species the population density, number and size of leaves and the number of flowers were measured. 2 Both species responded more strongly to fertilizer addition than to the exclusion of herbivores. Mertensia produced more flowering stems, more leaves per stem, and stem density increased in the fertilized plots. Fertilizing increased total leaf length per plant for non-flowering stems but this was not observed for flowering stems. However, the net effect of having more flowering stems and having greater leaf area on non-flowering stems was to increase the total leaf area of the population. The responses of Mertensia make it likely to become a stronger competitor in a more productive plant community. 3 Anemone showed contrasting responses at both individual and population levels. While individual stems produced slightly more leaves in fertilized plots, the density of stems declined. There were no strong effects on either leaf size or flowering. There was evidence of higher leaf turnover in fertilized plants. Meanwhile, control and exclosed unfertilized plots showed an increase in population density. 4 The weak responses to herbivory may be explained by the timing; this part of the experiment was run during a period of declining herbivore activity.

Our aim was to determine whether interspecific differences in dynamic photosynthetic responses to light could further explain observed differences in seedling ecology. 3 In contrast to the expected trend for shade-tolerant species, D. lanceolata showed faster induction in higher light environments and S. leprosula showed no relationship between light environment and induction rate. However, both species showed greater potential sunfleck utilization efficiency in low light environments through slower rates of both induction loss and stomatal closure. 4 Shorea leprosula attained greater rates of maximal photosynthesis and g(s), had faster rates of induction and retained a higher level of induction in prolonged darkness (>30 min) than D. lanceolata in all light environments. However, S. leprosula showed faster induction loss and stomatal closure in the short term (10 min) than D. lanceolata, which, together with a potentially negative carbon balance between sunflecks, may limit its distribution to microsites of higher sunfleck frequency. 5 The balance between photosynthesis (A) and g(s) during induction resulted in a constant intercellular CO2 concentration of c.270 p.p.m. after c. 11 min, which may represent a physiological optimum for both species. 6 In some circumstances transient peaks in A and g(s) were observed during induction, rather than a rise to stable maximum, which we attribute to overcompensation of the stomatal response to light.

We studied secondary seed dispersal on snow using a wind tunnel, experimental releases in clearings, and observations of the dispersal curve of an isolated Betula alleghaniensis in a large clearing. We derived a model for wind dispersal which couples the primary and secondary movement for a point source, and then used this to modify an area source model dispersal curve. 2. The wind tunnel results showed that the probability of entrainment of the seed was directly proportional to wind speed and inversely proportional to the square root of wing loading. Field releases showed that secondary distance traveled was, in turn, proportional to the probability of entrainment and to travel time. 3. The point source model overestimated seed density in the distance interval of rising entrainment probability and underestimated seed density at subsequent distances. The area source model adequately predicted dispersal for autumn vs. winter fractions of a B. alleghaniensis stand dispersing seeds into a clearing. The isolated B. alleghaniensis indicated that travel time was ≃ 10 h. 4. According to the model, secondary dispersal for trees on snow is inconsequential when the fraction of seeds that abscise in winter is <0.15 (conifers and most angiosperms). However, it will have an important role for genera such as Betula which have large winter-abscising crop fractions. 5. Further, we note that the relative importance of secondary dispersal is almost solely an inverse function of release height, and therefore for very small statured plants (e.g. herbs), secondary dispersal should display a dramatic effect even if only a small portion of the crop is involved. Finally, we argue that wind speeds near the surface within a forest are so low that the effect of secondary dispersal within forests will be minor.",Wind dispersal | Wing loading,NA,NA

Season-dependent demography was also compared for four phenotype classes segregated by cluster analysis of leaf morphology. 2. The finite rate of increase for the entire population was largest in autumn (October-January) and declined throughout the rest of the year. Overall, there was a small reduction in the population size. Size-specific probabilities of survival, growth and fertility varied dramatically among seasons. Sensitivity analyses showed that small individuals were particularly important to population growth from autumn to spring. Larger individuals were more important during summer. 3. Highly season-dependent demographic rates have large implications for population distribution and persistence since increased vulnerability to perturbation during particular seasons may constrain population growth and stability. Although T. officinale is a long-lived perennial, annual censuses may mask the importance of certain individuals or life history traits for maintenance of genetic variability and population viability. 4.

A mathematical model demonstrates the potential for two divergent dynamics, with positive feedback leading to the loss of diversity at a local scale and negative feedback leading to its maintenance. A linear contrast of the growth of plants in association with their own soil communities compared to the growth of plants in association with each others' soil communities can be used to differentiate between these possibilities in empirical studies. 3. Spatially explicit computer simulations demonstrate that the dynamics of a spatially structured community, as the soil community is likely to be, can differ from those predicted for a well-mixed population. Specifically, diversity can be maintained between locally homogeneous patches when positive feedback and dispersal occur at local scales. 4. Using a simple experimental protocol, we have found substantial negative feedback on plant growth through the soil community, suggesting that it may be involved in the maintenance of plant species diversity. 5.

The mean number of translucent glands containing potent insecticidal allelochemicals in leaves of Porophyllum gracile was observed to vary up to nearly twofold under field conditions in the area of Tucson Arizona (USA). 2.

To investigate if the production of glands in leaves of P. gracile is under genetic control, seeds were collected from individuals for which this trait varied under field conditions. There was no correlation for the mean number of glands per leaf between individuals of P. gracile sampled in the field and their progeny seedlings grown under controlled conditions. This suggested that the production of glands in leaves of P. gracile is not strongly hereditary. 4.

Soil-borne fungi are a major group of economically important plant pathogens, yet they have rarely been studied in the context of host pathogen population biology. We develop general models of annual hosts and soil-borne fungal pathogens to explore the conditions for host pathogen coexistence in both agricultural and natural plant populations. We use empirical data from the literature to parameterize and simulate dynamics with these models. 2. Initially we consider a simple system in which host density is assumed to be constant, as would be appropriate for agricultural systems. Model analysis shows that initial increase of the pathogen population requires that host (crop) density be above a threshold; this threshold decreases with increases in the pathogen's over-winter survival rate and ability to grow saprophytically. 3. A more complex model, in which both host and pathogen populations can vary, is needed for natural populations. Results from this model show that stable coexistence is possible even when the pathogen has a positive intrinsic growth rate (and therefore it is also possible for the pathogen to persist in the complete absence of the host). 4. Model parameter estimates were obtained from the empirical literature for two common and important soil pathogens; Phytophthora spp. and Fusarium oxysporum; these pathogens differ in several life-history features. Computer simulation showed that for Fusarium, there were substantial ranges for which coexistence or loss of the pathogen were predicted, while for Phytophthora most parameter estimates resulted in complete extinction when linear disease transmission was assumed; under the assumption of exponential disease transmission, predicted dynamics were most likely to lead to host persistence. 5. For both pathogens, within biologically realistic regions of parameter space, small changes in parameter values could lead to qualitatively different outcomes, including deterministic chaos, suggesting that long-term dynamics may be difficult to predict.",NA,NA,NA

We examined architectural and life-history traits of 14 abundant non-pioneer tree species at various size classes in a warm-temperate rain forest on Yakushima Island, southern Japan. The 14 species were categorized according to maximum attainable size (five canopy, seven subcanopy and two understorey species). 2. Within each maximum-size category, the relative frequency of trees of 2-8 cm d.b.h. (trunk diameter at breast height) in gaps compared with closed-canopy stands differed between species. In the closed-canopy stands, the positions of the crowns in the heterogeneous canopy differed between species within each of the canopy and sub-canopy categories at 8-40 cm d.b.h. 3. We regressed the relationship between d.b.h. and crown architecture by a non-linear allometric equation for the 14 species. There was a continuum from wide-crown species to narrow-crown species within canopy and subcanopy categories at 2-16 cm d.b.h. The two understorey species were wide-crown species throughout their ontogeny. 4. Interspecific differences in both rate of increase of d.b.h. and mortality over 10 years (1983-93) were detected within the canopy and subcanopy categories. 5. Principal component analysis based on five architectural and life-history traits revealed species differentiation within the canopy and subcanopy categories, reflecting a trade-off between responsiveness to increasing light in narrow-crown species and shade tolerance in wide-crown species. Multiple regression analyses suggested that most of these traits could be predicted by the light environments experienced by species rather than by species' maximum sizes. We concluded that species differentiation in this community was primarily related to different regeneration behaviour in gaps by trees of 2-8 cm d.b.h., and to different space occupation in the heterogeneous canopy at 8-16 cm d.b.h.",Allometry | Canopy heterogeneity | Community structure | Gap | Growth | Mortality,NA,NA

The study area includes one of very few temperate Quercus ecosystems not degraded by fire suppression, logging or excessive grazing. 2. We compared patterns of tree seedling establishment, tree height growth and post-fire survival in gaps between savanna, found only on south and west aspects in our study area, and dry forest, found only on north and east aspects, to determine which factors contributed to maintaining structural differences. 3. Canopy gaps constituted 42% of savanna area compared with 17% for dry forest. Mean canopy gap size in savanna was 316 m2 compared with 185 m2 for dry forest, but gap sizes were highly variable and the difference was not significant. Remnants of canopy trees were found in 37 of 38 gaps, indicating that gaps in both savanna and dry forest can usually support trees. 4. Savanna and dry forest gaps were generally favourable for seedlings and growth of small trees. Seedlings of most woody species were widespread in the understoreys of both savanna and dry forest but were more abundant in gaps than under closed canopies. Species had different height growth patterns depending on site, with growth rates ordered as follows: Quercus velutina in savanna > Q. velutina in forest > Q. stellata in forest> Q. stellata in savanna. Site differences were significant for Q. stellata but not for Q. velutina. 5. Tree survival in two surface fires was significantly lower in gaps in savanna compared with gaps in dry forest. Survival within individual gaps was inversely related to grass cover.

Three hypotheses were tested relative to the rise of shallow water in intercanopy locations by two coexisting semiarid-woodland tree species, Pinus edulis (a pinon) and Juniperus monosperma (a juniper): (i) both P. edulis and J. monosperma can use shallow water from intercanopy locations; (ii) J. monosperma is able to obtain more shallow water from intercanopy locations than P. edulis, and (iii) the spatial arrangement of the trees influences the amount of water they obtain. Soil moisture and plant water potential (i.e. plant water stress) were measured before and after the addition of water to shallow depths (0.30 cm) of intercanopy locations for trees of both species in two spatial arrangements: isolated and paired with a contiguous tree of the other species. 3. Both species responded to the addition of shallow water in intercanopy locations, as measured by plant water potential. The response of J. monosperma was significantly greater than that of P. edulis, as measured by depletion of shallow soil moisture in intercanopy locations and by change in plant water potential per unit change in soil water potential (the difference was not detectable on the basis of plant water potential alone): in addition, the amount of depletion was correlated with basal area of J. monosperma but not of P. edulis. The responses were not influenced by spatial arrangement (isolated vs. paired with a contiguous tree of the other species). 4. The results of this study are consistent with differences in the relative abundances of the two species across locations, suggesting that species differences in ability to use shallow water in intercanopy locations is important in structuring semiarid woodlands. Further, the results suggest that current theoretical concepts for semiarid ecosystems, which ignore either vertical or horizontal variability in soil moisture, may be inadequate for predicting changes in the ratio of woody to herbaceous plant biomass, particularly for plant communities with co-dominant woody species that differ in ability to acquire spatially heterogeneous resources.",Competition | Juniper | Pinon | Plant water potential | Woodland,NA,NA

The reconstruction technique revealed that the mosses had a relatively fast growth rate (90 250 mm shoot-1 year-1) and were short lived (0.7-2.9 years). The shoots of both moss species grew faster in deep than in shallow water. Growth experiments in summer confirmed that Sphagnum grew more slowly and decayed more rapidly in shallow than in deep water. 3. Fast growth of mosses in deep waters can be accounted for by lower temperature, extensive CO2 supersaturation and nutrient enrichment in the hypolimnion during summer stratification. Maximum rate of light-saturated photosynthesis in July was 3.3-fold higher and of dark respiration 1.3-fold lower in Sphagnum from 9.5 m incubated at the ambient 8 C than in Sphagnum from 0.7 m incubated at 20 C.

These observations were explained by the high probability that added nitrogen is lost from these flood-plains, in combination with N-limitation in these naturally P-rich alluvial soils. 3 For two valley slopes, primary production, nutrient uptake and litter production were higher where soil N- and P-availability were higher. At the low-nutrient slope, low tissue P-concentrations, a high P-retranslocation and a high phosphorus use efficiency (PUE cf. Vitousek 1982) were found. This reduced the annual P-loss, which was interpreted as an adaptation to low nutrient availability. The high PUE led to litter and subsequently soil organic matter with a high C/P ratio. N-mineralization showed a strong negative correlation with the C/P ratio of soil organic matter. This suggested an interaction between P and N cycling for soil organic matter break-down, at low nutrient availability. 4 For the slopes we concluded that feed-back between plant production and soil nutrient availability was primarily mediated by litter quality. 5 P-availability was positively correlated to soil pH and soil wetness. We concluded that N- and P-availability had different controlling variables. 6 We found long-term retention of added nutrients in the soil organic matter of the high-nutrient slope. The amount of N-retention was however, limited through plant feed-back on the quality of litter and soil organic matter, which enhanced N-mineralization rates.

Sulphur uptake into growing Sphagnum accounts for 5-10% of the total sulphur input to the bogs. Bog surface waters are more strongly depleted in sulphate and more strongly enriched in 34S than can be accounted for by Sphagnum sulphur uptake alone. 4 Strong depletion of sulphate (very low SO4/2+/Cl-) accompanied by strong enrichment in 34S occurs at depth in the bogs due to bacterial sulphate reduction.

Several chemical species, however, behave nonconservatively and respond more directly to climatic change. 6 Discharge zones for groundwater seem to be an essential prerequisite for bog formation in arid regions.

This paper investigates the effects of the spatial scale of heterogeneity upon growth of the clonal herb Glechoma hederacea. 2 Clones were grown in eight experimental environments, each containing the same total amount of two types of soil distributed in separate patches. Contrast between patch types was the same in all treatments. The number and size of patches differed between treatments, from two 25-cm x 50-cm patches to 64 6.25-cm x 6.25-cm patches. In six of the treatments roots could grow freely between patches. Partitions prevented root growth between patches in the remaining treatments. 3 Although all treatments provided the same quantity of nutrients, clone biomass was dependent on the scale of heterogeneity. Biomass was highest in the 25-cm x 25-cm patch-size treatment and declined significantly at smaller patch sizes. It varied by a factor of four when only the treatments allowing root growth between patches were compared, and by a factor of seven when the treatments preventing root growth between patches were included. 4 Clones displayed a scale-dependent capacity to locate roots selectively in nutrient-rich patches. Although the proportion of biomass allocated by clones to above-ground structures and roots did not differ significantly between treatments, a significantly greater proportion of the root biomass of clones was located in rich than in poor patches in the larger patch-size treatments, promoting more efficient foraging for nutrients in these treatments. As patch size decreased, the proportion of clone root biomass located in the two patch types became more equal. 5 Root: shoot ratio within clones responded to patch scale and quality. In the larger patch-size treatments, in which clones foraged more efficiently, parts of clones located in rich patches had a higher root: shoot ratio than parts of clones located in poor patches, thus enhancing nutrient acquisition from rich patches. However, G. hederacea behaved like plants with a single rooting point in the smaller patch-size treatments, in that root: shoot ratio increased when nutrients were scarce. 6 Thus, the foraging response of G. hederacea was coarse-grained in environments where patches were large. In comparison, G. hederacea apparently responded to environments with small-scale patchiness as if they were homogeneously poor. It could not adjust its morphology rapidly enough to respond to these less predictable environments where changes in patch quality were more frequent.",foraging | grain response | nutrient patchiness | physiological integration,NA,NA

Seeds from plants with and without ant nests were equal in fresh mass and were equally likely to germinate. 3 Soil from beneath plants with ant nests contained significantly higher concentrations of nitrate, ammonium, phosphorus, and water than soil from beneath plants without nests. Soil from ant nests also had significantly higher nitrogen mineralization rates. Seed production was not, however, significantly correlated with the concentration of any single soil nutrient measured. Nutrients may interact in ways that benefit plant reproduction. In addition, the microenvironment of ant nest soils may lead to the proliferation of soil organisms beneficial to the plant. 4 Because A. constricta is capable of forming symbioses with nitrogen fixing bacteria, it was predicted that plants with ant nests, exposed to greater concentrations and fluxes of available nitrogen, would utilize more soil nitrogen and less atmospheric nitrogen than plaints without basal nests. Nitrogen isotopic analysis of seed tissue revealed that plants with and without ant nests obtained nitrogen from the same source or combination of sources, suggesting that nitrogen may not have limited A. constricta reproduction. Additional interpretations are also discussed. 5 Ants were much more abundant on plants with ant nests at the base than on those without ant nests, but there was little evidence that proximity to ant nests increased protection against herbivory. Plants with and without basal ant nests sustained similar levels of damage to leaves and seeds. 6 If seed production is correlated with reproductive success, then selection may favour A. constricta plants which harbour Formica perpilosa nests at the base.

Mayapple shoots are borne at the terminal ends of rhizome segments (one per segment), are annual, and are either vegetative or sexual. The number and type of shoots emerging next year (t + 1) are determined by developmental events that unfold in the current (t) and prior years (t - 1, etc.). Such protracted organ development is common to many other perennial species. 2 In 1990 (= year t), the growth of new rhizome segments, the success of segments in producing new shoot buds, and the types of shoots in these buds were recorded on plants for which the following data were available: the 1990 (t) shoot type and leaf area, the 1989 (t - 1) and the 1988 (t - 2) shoot types. Natural flower and experimentally induced fruit abortion in 1990 sexuals was also used to evaluate plant responses to reproduction. 3 The outcome of developmental events in year t, affecting shoots in year t + 1, was influenced by current (t) and historical (t - 1, t - 2) factors. Shoot size and reproductive condition in year t affected new rhizome size and growth and the new shoot type. Shoot type in year t - 1 influenced the number of new rhizomes that formed and whether or not branching occurred. Shoot type in year t - 2 had a weak effect of new rhizome growth and size. Thus, a complex and overlapping set of historical and current factors combined to determine future demography. The parallels between the historical influences in mayapple and other forms of carryover and maternal effects are discussed. 4 Reproduction elicited a number of demographic costs, but these were differentially expressed on the number vs. the type of new shoots. Reproduction had little effect on branching but had marked effects on shoot type. This differential sensitivity to reproduction at our site is a function of mayapple's developmental phenology. Branch determination begins in year t - 1 and is completed by early spring of year t, and so is not affected by fruit costs incurred later in year t.

There was, however, significant variation in seed weight among maternal plants within treatments. 3 We grew individually weighed seeds from 33 of these maternal plants in three competitive regimes (individually, with one conspecific neighbour, with three Festuca pratensis neighbours) to test if maternal environment and seed weight influenced first-year growth, and if these effects were more pronounced in the presence of competition. 4 There were a few weak but significant environmental maternal effects on offspring performance. Seed weight was positively correlated with initial growth, but its influence decreased over time and disappeared after 8 weeks. The presence of one conspecific neighbour or three Festuca pratensis neighbours did not influence growth during the first few weeks, but strongly suppressed growth after 9 weeks. Competition did not accentuate the influence of seed weight on offspring performance. 5 Differences among individual maternal plants were a major source of variation in seed weight and early offspring growth. Some of the evidence that has been cited in support of environmental maternal effects in plants may be the result of confounding maternal identity and maternal environment. 6 Our results support the generalization that seed size is one of the least plastic of plant characters. Plants express great plasticity in reproductive output, but this occurs primarily in terms of the number of seeds produced, and only secondarily, if at all, in terms of seed size or quality. 7 Effects of a plant's maternal environment on its performance can be detected, but they appear to be small compared to other factors that influence a plant's fitness, such as its genotype and the environment in which it grows.",Centaurea maculosa | maternal effects | offspring quality | seed size | seed weight,NA,NA

It declines when time to local population extinction decreases and when fecundity is lower. The latter emphasizes that sufficient seeds must be available for dispersal to ensure gap colonization. 5 Stable patch/population-type distributions given different parameter values were obtained as the right eigen-vectors of metapopulation matrices.

Periods of reduced radial growth reflect spring-summer moisture deficits and coincide with approximately decade-long periods of fewer surviving trees. 4 Prior to c. 1900, relationships of age structure to variation in radial growth are less clear due to the confounding influences of increasingly inaccurate age determinations of older trees, and the cumulative effects of past changes in disturbance regimes. 5 Variations in both climate and disturbance regimes influence the regional pattern of age structures of Austrocedrus.

At higher densities, cosexes were quantitatively more female than at lower densities. Also, larger males and cosexes produced more pollen per vegetative biomass than did smaller ones, while allocation to seed production by cosexes increased only proportionally with plant biomass, so that cosexual gender shifted consistently towards greater maleness in larger plants. 5 Males produced between about five and 10 times as much pollen as cosexes, indicating that cosex sex allocation is strongly female-biased. This, and inflorescence architecture, suggest that female-biased cosexuality in M. annua has evolved as a response to selection for facultative self-fertilization in a wind-pollinated species. 6 In M. annua, androdioecy appears to be maintained by a balance between selection for reproductive assurance during colonization, which favours self-fertile cosexuality with female-biased sex allocation, and frequency-dependent selection within populations, favouring increased male allocation and thus allowing the invasion and spread of males.",androdioecy | dioecy | reproductive assurance | trade-off | wind pollination,NA,NA

In one experiment, populations of uniform density but differing size were planted out, whilst in a second study both the density and size of populations were varied. 3 The number of individuals in a population had no effect on pollinator visitation or subsequent seed set in either experiment. 4 Population density, however, had strong effects on both visitation and reproductive success. 5 The position of a plant within a population had an impact on pollinator constancy in the second experiment, but had no effect on visitation rates or reproductive success.",density-dependence | field experiments | pollination | population density | population size,NA,NA

High levels of infestation, however, adversely affected all plant parts. Root and lignotuber biomass declined linearly, while the responses of stem and leaf biomass were nonlinear, with respect to increasing total insect load. 3 Plant responses to scale insect infestations may be explained by considering sapsucking insects as additional sinks that compete against plant sinks and both redirect and drain resources from the plant. 4 Scale insect populations exhibited strong density dependent effects, suggesting they were severely depleting resources within their hosts. Extensive shoot death at high levels of infestation may have contributed to insect population decline by causing scale insects to die prematurely or by reducing the availability of suitable feeding sites.",density dependence | plant growth analysis | source-sink interactions,NA,NA

Individual seedling growth, light acquisition, and stand size structure were monitored throughout the first year of growth. 2 Elevated CO2 increased average seedling biomass in stands by 14%, a value much lower than the average enhancement reported elsewhere for individually grown yellow birch seedlings. Maternal families within stands differed significantly in their growth responsiveness to elevated CO2, ranging from +51% to -16%. As a result, CO2 altered the genetic identity of dominants in regenerating stands. 3 Seedling size inequalities were generally lower in CO2-enriched environments, a result that contrasts with other studies that have reported increased size inequality with increased productivity in resource-rich environments. Distribution modifying functions relating initial seedling size and subsequent growth suggest that there was a relatively smaller advantage to being larger in elevated vs. ambient CO2 environments. Together, these results suggest that competition in CO2-enriched environments was less size-asymmetric. 4 Differences in stand size structure between CO2 treatments were related to competition for light. Empirical measures of seedling light acquisition per unit biomass suggest competition for light was less size-asymmetric in CO2-enriched environments. Decreased size-asymmetric competition for light was attributable both to differences in the CO2-use efficiency of high-light canopy dominants vs. low-light canopy subordinates, and to CO2-induced differences in plant allometry. 5 This study highlights the importance of stand-level competition studies in global change research, and more generally, the value of studies that combine phenomenological descriptions of stand development with physiological mechanisms of competition.",Betula alleghaniensis | forest regeneration | global change | resource competition | size hierarchies,NA,NA
