Major changes in climate and vegetation are encompassed by the transect which extended from the Apurimac Valley floor at 500 m to the summit ridge of the range at > 3,500 m. Four vegetation zones are easily discerned-lowland rain forest, montane rain forest, cloud forest, and elfin forest. In progressing upwards there is a monotonic trend toward decreasing canopy stature and reduced number of plant strata. The vegetation gradient provided the opportunity to examine the relation between bird species diversity and habitat complexity in an entirely natural setting. The decrease in forest stature with elevation was closely paralleled by decreasing avian syntopy (the total number of bird species cohabiting the forest at a given elevation). Bird species diversity was shown to be highly correlated with foliage height diversity, using either four or five layers in the foliage height diversity calculation (r = .97), and less well correlated using three layers, as defined previously by MacArthur (r = .84). At this superficial level the trend in bird species diversity seemed to be adequately explained as a response to the vegetation gradient. This preliminary conclusion was found to be illusory when the elevational trend in syntopy was reexamined separately for three major trophic subdivisions of the fauna. The number of insectivores decreased 5.2-fold from the bottom to the top of the gradient, frugivores decreased by a factor of 2.3, and nectarivores showed no change. It was now clear that the diversity in each of these trophic categories was responsive to environmental influences other than, or in addition to, the gradient in habitat structure. Additional factors implicated by the available evidence are competitive interactions with other taxa at the same trophic level, changing composition of the resource base as a function of elevation, and declining productivity at high elevations. Analysis of netted bird samples revealed an unexpected diversity maximum in the lower cloud forest zone. The immediate cause of this was a relaxation of the vertical stratification of foraging zones, such that an anomalously large fraction of the species present entered the nets. The excess diversity was found to consist almost entirely of insectivores. Several factors appear to contribute to the ultimate causes of the diversity maximum: greater patchiness of the montane forest due to the rugged topography, a higher density of foliage near the ground, and possibly increased resource productivity. A correlation between diversity and density in the netting results suggested a causal connection mediated via resource levels. The conclusion is that diversity is a complex community property that is responsive to many types of influences beyond simply the structure of the habitat.",350,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Andes | Birds | Ecotone | Environmental gradient | Foliage height diversity | Peru | Species diversity,20308,NSF,GB-20170,National Science Foundation,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Microtus breweri is endemic to Muskeget Island, Massachusetts. A nearby live-trap grid provided information about residents. The same design was used on the mainland to trap the meadow vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus, to compare with the beach vole, which does not undergo the regular 3- to 4-yr cycles typical of the mainland. Both populations, however, had similar peak densities (160-180/ha). In M. breweri, dispersal is a simple process. Dispersers move short distances and are a random sample of the control population for age structure and sex ratio. In M. pennsylvanicus dispersal movements are longer. More mainland ♀ ♀ disperse in summers and more ♂ ♂ in winters. The age structure of mainland dispersers is not a random sample of the control population. Seventy percent of the variance in number of dispersers is explained by the density and rate of increase of the control population in M. breweri, but only 46% is thus explained in M. pennsylvanicus. Density is the more important of the 2 variables. Twenty-nine percent of the losses in the control population are caused by dispersal on Muskeget Island with a corresponding figure of 7% for the mainland. Virtually none of the mortality in the cyclic decline on the mainland can be accounted for by dispersal. In both species, dispersers are in reproductive condition to a greater extent than residents. Mice in the island population have larger home ranges than the mainland mice. Males have larger home ranges than ♀ ♀, and on the mainland, adults have larger home ranges than subadults. Both species have larger home ranges in summers. A model is constructed in which the differences in dispersal characteristics between the 2 species are attributable to differences in availability of a place into which the dispersers can move. I suggest that the mainland population has selective dispersal leading to cycles, whereas the island has a simple drainage of excess recruits, no selection by way of dispersal, and subsequently no cycles.

Field data were incorporated into energy balance and gas exchange equations to determine water-use efficiencies (mass C0 2 fixed/mass H 2 0 transpired) at various times throughout a year. These results were compared with simulated values for leaves without the observed seasonal changes in morphology. For Encelia, leaf lengths were over 3-fold greater during the winter and spring than during the drier summer and fall (4.0 cm vs. 1.2 cm). Increases in pubescence during dry periods led to substantial decreases in the leaf absorptance to solar irradiation (from 0.61 to 0.43). Similar alterations occurred for Hyptis, but with less month-to-month variation, while Mirabilis had comparatively small changes in these leaf parameters. For Mirabilis A mes /A was about 75% greater (maximum values of ≈70 vs. 40 for Encelia and Hyptis) and varied less (9% variation) during the year compared with Encelia and Hyptis (46% and 24% variation, respectively). Minimum leaf resistances to H 2 0 vapor diffusion (R wv ) were similar for Encelia and Hyptis throughout most of the year, while Mirabilis had much higher values. The optimal temperature for photosynthesis was several degrees higher for Mirabilis (34°C vs. 30°C for Encelia and Hyptis). The calculated cellular resistance for C0 2 diffusion (R cell Co 2 ) was lowest for Mirabilis (147 s/cm) and almost identical for Encelia and Hyptis (282 s/cm). Encelia, and to a lesser degree Hyptis, had maximum photosynthetic rates at a lower water-use efficiency when water was available and greatest water-use efficiency at reduced photosynthetic levels during drier periods of the year. During a shorter growth period in the wet portion of the year, Mirabilis had a consistently high water-use efficiency (.016) and a moderate photosynthetic rate, reflecting its much higher A mes /A and R wv combined with a lower R cell CO 2 . Simulations for leaves without the observed changes in morphology that occurred during the drier months showed that the mean water-use efficiency for the year would have been ≈48% less for Encelia, 41% less for Hyptis, and only 3% less for Mirabilis. A decrease in leaf length, a decrease in absorptance, and an increase in A mes /A contributed about equally to the estimated seasonal increases in water-use efficiency for Encelia and Hyptis.

In A. sieboldi this sexual dimorphism may be further accentuated because the ♀♀ are trimorphic in size and shape. The intermediate-sized, cruciform, and especially the largest, campanulate morphs are cannibalistic. However, the ♂♂ axe protected from these cannibalistic ♀♀ by 2 different types of mechanisms. They can fail to elicit contact feeding responses and they can have body sizes and body wall outgrowths sufficiently large to prevent attacking ♀♀ from capturing them. The degree to which each of these mechanisms is developed can vary greatly between clones or taxa, may be inversely related, and may be a function of the voracity and size of cannibalistic ♀♀ to which the ♂♂ are generally exposed. Campanulate ♀♀ from clone 12C1 readily attacked both ♀♀ from the smallest, saccate morph of their own clone and also ♂♂ from clone 10C6, but they rarely attacked ♂♂ of their own clone. Campanulate ♀♀ from clone 10C6 regularly attacked <5 clonemates, but cruciform ♀♀ from this clone responded more frequently to ♂♂ from clone 12C1 than to ♂♂ from their own clone. On a given diet, ♂♂ from clone 10C6 were about 1.5x larger and had more pronounced body wall outgrowths than those from clone 12C1. In both clones, the sizes of <J 8 and mictic (♂-producing) ♀♀ were influenced by the diet, being larger in populations fed on the rotifer Brachionus calyciflorus than those fed on the ciliate Paramecium aurelia. It may be adaptive for ♂♂ to be as small and simply constructed as possible; they have only a rudimentary digestive system, and so energy for their production must come entirely from their mictic-♀ parents. Therefore, ♂ size and body wall outgrowth development may represent a balance between production costs and ability to withstand cannibalism. Evolution of a mechanism preventing attack by cannibalistic ♀♀ may decrease the requirements for defensive structures and increase the efficiency of ♂ production and hence subsequent resting egg production.",9,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Asplanchna | Behavior | Cannibalism | Feeding | Males | Polymorphism | Predation | Rotifers | Sexuality,20308,NSF,GB-31282,National Science Foundation,0,FALSE,5,NA,NA

The power of the test of the slopes’ being equal to 1 depends on the magnitude of density-dependent and independent (random) influences and on the type of error, measurement or environmental.

Longleaf pine forest interspersed with blackjack, red, and post oaks occupied the sandy uplands east of the Apalachicola River. Alluvial terraces west of the river supported pine stands probably dominated by longleaf and slash pines. The mesic hammock forest of the river bluffs was comprised of an admixture of hardwood species, dominated by magnolia and beech. The tributary bottomlands community consisted primarily of bay, holly, and beech; the Apalachicola floodplain forest was dominated by bay, gum, and oak.

Many of these islands are asymmetrical, having a surface layer of dead branches to windward and some live branches to leeward. I made repeated observations of these islands in all seasons from 1956 to 1967 along a 1.75-km belt ≈20 m wide on Niwot Ridge in the Front Range west of Denver, Colorado. The location of islands was mapped on a transparent overlay on an aerial photograph, annual growth of stem tips was measured, and an abundance of notes and photographs was taken. Some tree islands of Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) are conspicuous because they grow in microsites in which no tree seedlings have been found, and which general observations suggest would be outside their environmental amplitude. These islands often have live branches connected to windward with dead branches, some of which have roots. These observations led to the hypothesis that some tree islands move along the ground climbing out of more moderate microsites in which a seed germinated and moving into microsites for which they are not well adapted. In this movement process, wind-exposed organs are killed, while leeward stems grow to leeward often taking root and forming an upright stem system in the process of ""stem tip layering."" Islands with interconnected live and dead stems to windward, illustrating movements of 5 m, are common; isolated dead stumps and wood fragments in a line extending to windward indicate that some islands may have moved at least 15 m.

The pattern in a 5th species could not be distinguished from a random dispersion. Partial nest counts in 3 more species suggested a clumped dispersion in at least I species. The 4 species with uniform nest spacing all use pheromones for recruitment in foraging, whereas the remaining 4 species do not. The 3 most uniformly dispersed species are also intraspecifically aggressive at food sources. We propose that colony spacing is accomplished in these species by aggressive prevention of new colony establishment.

Sources of variation in the elemental compositions of the major natural plant species of the floodplain were examined statistically. In herbaceous species (Scirpus cyperinus and Andropogon sp.), 52-56% of the variation in P, Mg, Mo and Na concentrations was accounted for by differences in the chemical composition of stems, leaves, roots and seeds. Seasonal variation in the mineral element composition of leaves from woody species was greater than that in stems. Concentrations of K, P, AI, Mo and Sr in leaves were significantly different among seasons in 3 woody species (Alnus serrulata, Myrica cerifera, Salix nigra). Mean concentrations of Ca, Na, AI, B, Mo and Sr in leaves tended to increase from spring to autumn, while K, Mg, N, P, Cu, Zn and Cs-137 concentrations declined.

Discriminant function analysis showed that K concentrations, which are low in the floodplain soils, contributed more than did concentrations of II other elements to species differences.

The mud proved to be an effective barrier to both immigration and emigration. All 4 gastropods selectively removed 3 diatom species from the pipes: Melosira moniliformis, Melosira nummuloides, and Fragilaria striatula var. californica. These species consist of long chains of moderate-sized cells that form an overstory within the diatom mat; a total of 130 additional species may be found within the diatom community. Selective removal may be facilitated by the chain morphology, by the location of these diatoms in the outermost portion of the mat, and by loose adhesion of these species to the rock surface. Diatoms with potentially tighter adhesion such as the stalked Achnanthes spp. are less affected by grazers. The abundance of 3 species of blue-green algae was little changed by grazing. All 4 grazers had remarkably similar diets, apparently using the same resource in about the same way.

Ground-dwelling lizards and probably arboreal lizards move nonrandomly with respect to sun and shade; thus the percentage of lizards in sun is inversely proportional to air temperature. Arboreal lizards shift to higher perches at midday in summer and to logs or ground in winter thus decreasing and increasing incident heat loads, respectively.
