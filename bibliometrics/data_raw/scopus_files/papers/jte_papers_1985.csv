Arvicanthis niloticus, was traced through phases of a low density population from January to August 1981, a rapidly growing population from September to January 1982, and a high and declining post-reproductive population from February to April 1982. Apart from late in the population cycle there was considerable movement, interchange and establishment of new ranges. As the population increased individual ranges became smaller. The rats apparently preferred field edges and did not favour the fields themselves. Females frequently established themselves at certain sites where they produced their litters; some of the offspring remained with the mother in the warren. There is also evidence that ousiders of both sexes joined these warrens. Males were generally more wide-ranging than females. Agricultural practices, e.g. mowing and trampling by cattle, influenced the rats preparedness to remain within a particular location.

Migrant birds markedly increased in abundance during spring migration in late March in a young (approximately 25 years old) second-growth woodland in Panama. Migrant abundance and diversity was greater at mist-net level on the second-growth site than in nearby old forest. Diversity of canopy migrants also was greater in the young woodland than in an old second-growth forest. Thus, many migrant species appear to select young second-growth during spring migration in central Panama. Degree of frugivory by many migrant species was greater during migration than earlier in the dry season. Most migrants selecting the second-growth site were highly frugivorous and migrants accounted for most of the visits to common fruit species, but use of fruit trees appeared to be influenced by fruit size relative to gape width. Most migrants have mouths that are better suited to eating the small fruits predominating in young forest than the larger fruits characteristic of old forest. Abundances of bird-dispersed fruit plants and, particularly, those fruit species known to be eaten by migrants were greater in young than in old forest. The high food demands of migrating birds added to the high degree of frugivory of most migrants selecting second-growth forest suggests that the abundance of small fruits in second-growth may be a strong cause for habitat selection during migration. © 1985, Cambridge University Press.

Data from primary, secondary and experimentally cleared forest sites are compared to estimate the minimum time required for various phases involved in the re-establishment of tropical rain forest after disturbance. A simple model is proposed to accommodate the data and other estimates in the literature. The model predicts a minimum period for the stablization of secondary species numbers as 60–70 years and the replacement of primary species as 150 years at which point gap formation is initiated.

Thirteen-year increments in each species were analysed using growth simulation, a stochastic technique which projects growth trajectories. Median growth rates ranged from 0.35 mm yr-1(Anaxagorea crassipetala) to 13.41 mm yr-1) (Stryphnodendron excelsum). Maximum ranges ranged from 0.95 mm yr-1(Quararibea bracteolosa) to 14.62 mm yr-1(Hernandia didymanthera). Minimum rates ranged from zero growth (Capparis pittieri, Colubrina spinosa, Doliocarpus spp.) to 7.45 mm yr-1(Stryphnodendron excelsum). Projected lifespan (from 100 mm dbh to the maximum dbh for the species) varied from 52 years (Anaxagorea crassipetala, Guatteria inuncta) to 442 years (Carapa guianensis). The mean longevity among the 45 tree species studied is 190 years. Four main patterns of growth behaviour are recognized, based upon longevity and growth rates: (1) understorey species have slow maximum growth rates and short lifespans; (2) shade-tolerant subcanopy trees live around twice as long as understorey trees and grow at approximately the same maximum rates; (3) canopy and subcanopy trees that are shade-tolerant but respond opportunistically to increased light levels have long lifespans and fast maximum growth rates; (4) shade-intolerant canopy and subcanopy species are short-lived and have fast maximum growth rates. Understorey species intergrade with shade-tolerant subcanopy species in terms of growth behaviour; shade-tolerant subcanopy species with opportunistic, shade-tolerant species; and opportunistic, shade-tolerant with shade-intolerant species. Intraspecific variation in growth rates is lower in short-lived trees (understorey species with uniformly slow growth and shade-intolerant species with uniformly rapid growth) than in the two long-lived groups. These patterns are discussed in the context of tree ecophysiology and forest light environments. © 1985, Cambridge University Press.

Nuts dispersed (by white-tailed deer) to abandoned pastures immediately adjacent to the forest suffer less than 20% post-dispersal seed predation but seedlings are killed by frequent grass fires. S. mombin displays significant recruitment of saplings and young trees only on forest edges free of fire for long intervals. The very high percent seed predation in the forest and the failure of many nuts to ever be dispersed away from the parent tree is attributed directly and indirectly to the absence of a herbivorous (frugivorous) megafauna that would have been part of the habitat of S. mombin through most of its evolutionary history. These large animals would have consumed large numbers of S. mombin fruits and thereby dispersed the nuts in such a manner as to have both led to more escape from bruchids and an overall reduction in the bruchid population density. By their defecation patterns, these mammals would also have defecated more nuts in sites of high quality for S. mombin sapling survival than is the case at present. In contemporary habitats, S. mombin is culturally deprived in that it can no longer interact with the habitats, animals and densities of animals whose selective pressures were a major force in the evolution of the tree's traits. © 1985, Cambridge University Press.

Nine plots were selected between 1750 m in altitude and the upper limit of vegetation at 3250 m, at intervals of about 200 m in altitude. The plots are distinguished according to their main dominants, and the population structure of the dominant species is examined. The lower forests have species showing the whole range of size classes as well as solitary giants as dominants, but the upper forests lack these giants and are floristically poorer. Between 1750 m (the start of well preserved natural vegetation) and 2950 m (the forest limit) three forest zones are distinguished, and between 2950 and 3250 m a scrub zone. Upper forest zones tend to be dominated by species of the same genus or family which form important understory components of the zone below. Based on floristic comparisons with mountains of higher latitudes (i.e. Himalayas and Japan), the two lower forest zones (up to 2400 m) represent a subtropical zone, and the upper forest zone a warm-temperate zone. Climatic conditions at the forest limit on Mount Kerinci are similar to those at the latitudinal limit of warm-temperate evergreen trees; in the Himalayas the forest limit represents the latitudinal limit of the cool-temperate, and in Japan of the subarctic. Altitudinal zonation patterns change with latitude, reaching their most complex on subtropical mountains where the two floristic realms, the Boreal and Palaeotropical, meet.

Land types were identified by aerial photo survey and ground observation and mapped on a 1:100,000 scale LandSat Satellite (colour) Image. Soil types were classified according to the method used by the US Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service. Vegetation was sampled according to the Braun-Blanquet approach in 52 releves located within previously mapped land types, and analysed using the traditional phytosociological methods and the DECORANA and TWINSPAN computer programs. The results of these methods are compatible with one another. Most community types identify distinct land types: basalt and limestone uplands, gypsum and alluvial interplains, and depressions and gentle rises of the Juba River terrace. Commiphora and Acacia species dominate the open thorny bushland. They are mostly medium-sized shrubs and trees, 1 to 4 m in height. There is little herbaceous ground cover except in depressions and drainageways. Total shrub and tree cover averages 34%. Due to the large influx of refugees, there has been excessive cutting for fuelwood and construction material and notable bushland converted to cropland.

During a general flowering a very large number of tree families, including the well-known Dipterocarpaceae, flower and fruit exceptionally heavily. The huge pulse of flowering is echoed by an apparent explosion in the number of pollinators, and this is further augmented by migration of pollinators from the forest fringes. The huge demand for pollinators seems to be solved among several dipterocarps through utilization of tiny, fast breeding, floral-feeding insects such as thrips and hoppers. Competition for pollinators is further reduced through development of sequential flowering among several groups of trees that share similar pollinators. The resulting massive general fruiting seems to contribute to a heightened level of faunal activity and numbers. This long-intervalled flowering and fruiting phenology which dominates these lowland dipterocarp forests may have partly contributed to the lowered animal biomass frequently alluded to when these forests are compared with neotropical forests. © 1985, Cambridge University Press.

There was considerable variation in the number and types of chemicals to which each of the orchid bee species was attracted. Two cycles of seasonal abundance occurred annually in the number of orchid bee individuals and species collected at the chemical baits. A major peak occurred a month following onset of the wet season, and a minor peak occurred during the dry season. Species body size was related to seasonal activity, but additional factors such as flowering phenology and nest parasites were also probably involved. The number of orchid bee species found on the Tambopata Reserve was similar to the number found in forest sites of eastern and central Brazil, Costa Rica, and Panamá. This homogeneity in species richness is in marked contrast to other insect groups such as Odonata, Lepidoptera, Asilidae (Diptera), Tabanidae (Diptera), and Cicindelidae (Coleoptera), for which the species numbers recorded on the Tambopata Reserve are the highest for any similar sized area in the world. © 1985, Cambridge University Press.

The plant most commonly used for tent construction was Anthurium ravenii (Araceae). Bats create a tent on A. ravenii by severing the basal 2 to 5 lateral nerves at a distance of 5 to 10 mm from the midrib; the entire margin of the leaf then collapses downward to form a pyramid-shaped tent. The number of altered leaves per plant ranges from 1 to 4 with a mean of 2.1. A. watsoni appears to be selecting leaves of medium size and low within the plant. The size, shape, and location of leaves selected is consistent with the hypothesis that tent construction provides bats with roost sites that will be available to them for a long period of time and provides protection from both predators and the elements, thus conveying a selective advantage to the bats. © 1985, Cambridge University Press.

Variables included aspects of all vegetation layers but concentrated on those considered to be important to small mammal distribution. Ordination and classification methods resulted in similar analyses of the data. Differences in habitat structure were primarily related to the moisture conditions of the trapping sites and secondarily to their successional age (regenerating versus primary forest). The most important habitat variables for differentiating between sites were LITTER, CLEARING, SOILS, PIG DAMAGE, FLOODING, FAN PALM, EMERGENTS, CANOPY SURFACE and SEEDLINGS. Habitat structure also varied within sites with some suggestion of small-scale patterning. Small mammal captures were more likely in drier sites and subsites, but there was no difference in trap success between regenerating sites and primary forest sites. Greater numbers of species were captured in sites containing a variety of habitats, a discrete layering of vegetation and an extensive understorey. Small mammal captures were positively associated with five habitat variables (EMERGENTS, LITTER, ROTTING LOGS, SEEDLINGS, ROUGH BARK) and negatively associated with five others (LAYERS, BERTAM, SEDGES, PIG DAMAGE, FLOODING). The destruction caused by pigs is thought to be a major factor since it reduces litter and food availability over wide areas. Leopoldamys sabanus was the most abundant small mammal captured (40/68 individuals) and trap success differences among sites (0.4–1.9%) reflect its preference for higher, well-drained habitats. The study demonstrates the usefulness of a simple method of ranking habitat features according to importance/abundance thus eliminating the all but impossible task of direct measurements in this complex system. This simple method of habitat description provides a basis for studying variables influencing faunal distribution patterns. © 1985, Cambridge University Press.

In the Kenya highlands, mounds formerly attributed to termites have recently been found to be Mima mounds produced by rhizomyid mole rats. We investigated Mima mounds on black cotton soils near Kenyatta International Airport and on brown clay soils between Nairobi and Thika. At Kenyatta Airport, mounds had loamier, more granular soils than intermounds, and contained small rocks that mole rats can move. At the site between Nairobi and Thika, mound soils were more friable, higher in pH, and lower in carbon than intermound soils. Data from this and other studies indicate that Mima mound soils are more favourable for plant growth than those of true termite mounds. Mound vegetation exhibited lower coverage of grasses and greater coverage by forbs, shrubs, and bare ground, a pattern indicative of intense grazing and soil disturbance. Acacias, absent from most mounds, were abundant in the zone bordering the mound. This pattern may reflect the favour-ability of mound soils, combined with the effects of high grazing pressure. Future studies of savanna vegetation should distinguish between termite mounds and Mima mounds. © 1985, Cambridge University Press.

The dense Pinus plantation produced considerably more litter (10 t/ha/yr, with 5.5 t/ha as needles) than any of the Agathis stands (2.6-6.2 t/ha/yr; 2.3-3.5 t/ha as leaves) or nearby Lower Montane Rain Forest (6.8 t/ha/yr; 5.4 t/ha as leaves). Litterfall in the Agathis forests increased with stand age. The shrubs produced sizeable amounts of litter (3.4 t/ha/yr). The various species responded differently to a drought occurring during the study period. Pine litter generally exhibited low nutrient concentrations (on average 9.2, 1.9, 2.5, 0.4 and 6.0 mg/g of calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen respectively in needle litter), whilst concentrations in shrub litter were generally high (37.8, 4.9, 1.4, 1.05 and 21.5 mg/g for the same elements); Agathis litter usually showed nutrient concentrations that were intermediate between those for pine or shrub litterfall with only minor differences between stands. Comparison of the present findings with observations at other tropical sites suggests that nutrient content of litterfall in plantation forests may approach that of natural forests when the former become about 20 years old.

A study of the three plants and the bumblebee in maquis-like mountainous vegetation in northern Thailand suggests that they form a floral mimicry system with two mimics (the orchids) to one model (R. lyi). The flowers of the two orchid species offer no food reward to pollinators. Flowers of the three species show definite morphological and visual resemblance, and the species overlap to a great extent in flowering phenology and habitat. Mimic flowers were much less numerous than model flowers, which occurred abundantly in the area. The rate of pollinaria removal was very low in both orchid species, resulting in a relatively small percentage of fruit set, especially in D. infundibulum. Infrequency of pollinator visits was, however, somewhat counterbalanced by long-lasting flowers. The pollinaria of the two orchid species are differently positioned on the bee, hence interference between the different reproductive systems is minimized.

Kuntze, a dominant, shade-tolerant species of tropical moist forest in Costa Rica, were raised under three light conditions to assess their acclimatization and growth responses to irradiance. The light environments used were full sun, partial shade (25% of full sun), and full shade (1% of full sun). To test the effect of a sudden change in light level such as would occur in the event of a treefall gap, the seedlings in the above conditions were switched between environments after two months and grown for an additional 1.5 months. Plants in full sun and partial shade had similar total weight; switching between the two environments had no effect on biomass. Plants switched from full sun and partial shade to full shade had negative growth as a result of negative CO2 flux and leaf abscission. Plants transferred from full shade to full sun had lower growth rates than those switched from full shade to partial shade because of severe leaf damage in full sun. The previous environment significantly affected the response of most growth and size characteristics to the present environment. Maximum photosynthesis changed only 30% in response to light level during growth. However, large changes in other photosynthetic and structural characteristics were found. Leaves developed in full shade had lower respiration, leaf thickness, and stomatal density and higher apparent quantum yield, specific leaf area, and chlorophyll content than leaves from full sun. Osmotic potentials were similar between treatments. Despite only small changes in maximum photosynthesis, acclimatization to extreme shade or sun rendered leaves unsuitable for large changes in environment. Consequently, in the event of a large treefall gap, plants already present in the understory will require a substantial period of adjustment before they respond to the increase in light. © 1985, Cambridge University Press.

In April 1977, August–January 1980/1 and August 1984, all woody recruits in the plot were tagged and numbered, identified and measured (height), and mapped on a 1 m grid. The height of coppice was recorded. Ten of the eleven tree species present before felling produced coppice shoots. Two individuals almost attained canopy height by 1984. Twenty tree species and three shrub species were recruited from seed; six of the tree species were normally absent from the forest. Species composition changed very little with time. The rate of seedling recruitment was greatest immediately after clearing. The overall density of individuals changed little after 1977. Overall mortality of recruits was about 10% per annum. Mortality of the earliest recruits declined with time since establishment. Later recruits and individuals with poor growth had higher mortality than other plants. Mortality was not density-dependent. Growth rates of recruits were relatively slow. Only ten individuals exceeded 4 m by 1984. Recruitment rates, density, growth and species diversity were greatest in the parts of the plot where the mor humus had been removed or piled up during the initial clearance. Recruitment, growth and density were least, and mortality was greatest, at the edge. There was no relationship between any of these parameters and the presence of coppicing stumps. Tree species showed a clear spectrum from obligate gap-demanders to obligate shade-bearers. The persistence of gap-demanding species in this forest (in which gaps are normally rare) may be due to infrequent hurricanes, and also to a natural ability to produce basal sprouts. The succession conforms to an initial floristic composition model; it is slow, and we suggest that at least 50 years will elapse before the plot begins to resemble the undisturbed forest. © 1985, Cambridge University Press.
