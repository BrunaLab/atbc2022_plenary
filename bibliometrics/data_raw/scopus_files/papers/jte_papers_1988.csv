Different gap zones (root, bole and crown) are more similar to one another, in terms of their species composition, than they are to other zones in the same gap. This nonrandom pattern is established soon after gap formation, indicating that mortality of young seedlings is both high and related to gap zones. Some tree species are strongly positively associated with one of the gap zones, whereas others are associated with the age of the gap at the time the census was taken or the species of tree whose fall caused the gap. Root zones are dominated by fewer species than are bole or crown zones. Results are consistent with the assumption that an initial random distribution of seedlings is quickly changed to a strongly non-random pattern by selective mortality of seedlings of different tree species in the different gap zones. The internal heterogeneity of gaps is probably one of the factors helping to maintain the high tree species richness characteristic of tropical wet forests. © 1988, Cambridge University Press.

Dissemination of the seed from the fruit can be delayed for several years without affecting the viability of the embryo, due to very low respiration rates. Germination can be enhanced slightly by high temperatures under natural conditions, and by gibberellic acid or removal of the endosperm under laboratory conditions. Relative growth rates for both Harpagophytum species are lower than for subtropical grasses and legumes, due to a strong investment in root and tuber biomass.

A method for constructing shade enclosures to study the contribution of these two variables is described. Three tropical leguminous vine species (Abrus precatonus L., Caesalpinta bondicela Fleming and Mucuna prunens (L.) DC.) were grown in two shade enclosures with 3-4% of solar PPFD with either the R:FR of sunlight (1.10) or foliage shade (0.33), and compared to plants grown in sunlight.

However, these plants did not differ in chlorophyll content per leaf dry weight or area. In most cases the effects of low R:FR and PPFD were additional to those of high R:FR and low PPFD.

(2) Although there was not a pronounced seasonal pattern of leafing activity, more species produced new leaves in the dry season. Species that flush large quantities of new leaves do so more commonly in the drier months. Leaf loss was gradual and unobtrusive in species observed. (3) Flowering activity was greatest in the late dry season and early wet season. Most species exhibited extended flowering; only 15% of the species were massively flowering. Massive flowerers showed less seasonality than extended flowerers. (4) Of the species studied, the majority had relatively unspecialized flowers which were visited by a variety of insects; small bee-pollination was the next most common, followed by hummingbird, beetle, settling moth, sphingid, butterfly, large bee and fly pollination (the pollination system of 18 species was unknown). Hummingbird pollinated species showed little seasonality of flowering when compared with species exhibiting small moth, and beetle pollination syndromes, as well as those with unspecialized flowers. (5) The vast majority of species studied have fleshy fruits (sarcochores). Fruiting activity was less markedly seasonal than flowering. Species with fruit are more numerous in the second half of the year (the wet season and early dry season). The second year of the study saw substantially fewer species in fruit than the first year; this is attributed to the greater than usual rainfall and inclement weather during the peak flowering season. (6) Cloud forest shrub and treelet phenology is compared with patterns of other forests that have been studied.

Faunal richness lies within limits expected on the basis of the length of the dry season and species ricluiesses of non-Australian faunas. There are few lizard species and an abundance of frog species (none of which is a rain forest specialist) in comparison to rain forest herpetofaunas in other tropical regions. The impoverished lizard fauna, and the paucity of rain forest specialists may be because (a) seasonal invasion of rain forest by frogs prevents evolution of, or colonization by, specialists or (b) rain forest specialists may not have been able to cross semi-and habitats separating the Northern Territory from eastern Australian rain forests.

These plots have been maintained under fire protection, annual early or late dry season burning since 1934/35. Before establishment stems over 20.3 cm girth at breast height were enumerated. Three of the eight plots (one fire protected and two annually early burnt) were enumerated in 1982, 48–49 years after establishment. In addition, a coppice plot at Chitwi, 16 km southwest of the Ndola plots, cleared in 1972 and left to regenerate naturally was enumerated in May 1982 and August 1986 to assess woody plant growth. The density of stems over 20.0 cm girth in the 13-year-old coppice at Chitwi was 2.5 times that in an adjacent shelterbelt woodland. The stem density in the fire protected plot at Ndola in 1982 was 86% of the pre-felling density while in one of the early burnt plots it was 95% of the pre-felling density. The protected plot had the lowest species diversity after 49 years, largely because of the loss of 11 understorey species that were present before felling. There were no significant differences in stem mean girth at breast height (gbh) of canopy species in the Ndola plots under fire protection and early burning regimes. Mean annual gbh increments of abundant species were estimated at 1.17–2.21 cm yr_1 and 0.59–1.42 cm yr_1 during 0–9 and 0–49 year age-periods, respectively.

Leaf litter formed 56.6% of this total, woody material 22.7%, and reproductive material 20.7%. Total litterfall was strongly seasonal, at a maximum in the late wet season or early dry season, and at a minimum late in the dry season. A broadly similar pattern was shown by the various components of the litter, except for woody litterfall, which followed no strong seasonal trend. Variation in the amount of available soil moisture, as calculated from a simple water balance model, accounted for much of the variation in the components of litterfall. The proportion of all initiated flower heads which produce seeds was estimated to be between 2.1 and 4.5%. The mean annual seed fall was 9103 m-2, nearly two orders of magnitude higher than most native shrub populations, and it is argued that this is partly a result of the absence of natural enemies in the introduced range. © 1988, Cambridge University Press.

These studies have been mis-represented in more recent literature, and confusion has arisen over their interpretation. Similar comparisons are reported here for six forest sites in Ghana. At any one site, clear differences in composition were recognized between adult and juvenile samples, but in terms of the variation in flonstic composition over the whole of the forest zone, they are slight and forest types appear to ‘breed true’. At one site, Kade, compositional differences between size classes are fully described for all canopy species on a 0.25 ha plot. There was an abrupt change in composition at about 30 cm gbh. At this site, mortality rates for trees >30 cm gbh were greater amongst species with a high proportion of juveniles in the population. At other sites, changes in composition were sometimes abrupt, occurring at various size classes, or were more gradual. The populations of some species included a large number of juveniles at all sample sites, but the converse, where species always have low densities of juveniles, were not seen. The possible implications of these results for future canopy composition are discussed in relation to temporal equilibrium, or lack of it, in tropical forest composition. © 1988, Cambridge University Press.

The northernmost Neotropical rain forest, at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico, was searched for young (1-2 years old) single-event gaps that would meet the criteria of the definition. In 60 ha of rain forest, only 12 such gaps containing pioneer species could be found. Thirty-three pioneer species (shrubs and trees) were used as indicator species for gap conditions. Gap size, measured as projected canopy opening (sensu Brokaw 1982a), underestimated from 44 to 515% the size of the area colonized by pioneer species. On average the size of the colonized area was 3.4 times larger than the size of the projected canopy opening. The majority of the pioneer species showed a relative preference for gap borders, an area generally not included in the projected canopy opening. Pioneer plant abundance and density, and species richness and density, did not differ significantly between gap centres and gap borders. Floristical variation was not related to gap size or location in the gap. These findings can be explained if gap environment (to which pioneer plants respond) is seen as the result of many interacting factors, of which size of the canopy opening is only one. It is concluded that the definition for delimiting gaps in the field as proposed by Brokaw (1982a) cannot be regarded a generally applicable definition, and that its value as a comparative standard is doubtful. © 1988, Cambridge University Press.

In addition they provide an exceptional abundance and variety of genetic resources, which make substantial contributions to modern agriculture, medicine, industry and energy. On top of these materials, tropical forests supply significant environmental benefits, such as protection of the soil and safeguards for watershed systems. While it is sometimes difficult to quantify the economic values of these diverse goods and services, they are often to be reckoned as equal to, if not higher than, the marketplace values represented by the commercial hardwood timber. Yet when the forests are exploited for their hardwood timber, the process is usually so disruptive to forest ecosystems that the other outputs are severely reduced.
