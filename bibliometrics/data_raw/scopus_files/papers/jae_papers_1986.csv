Because newborn animals require 2-4 years to reach maturity, the size relationship among these species is complex with an array of either 3 or 4 year classes per species each interacting with other year classes of their own and other species. These scorpions prey on a variety of insects and arachnids. Average overlap in prey size (0.67) is considerably higher than the overlap in prey taxa (0.43). Different year classes of the same species use substantially different prey from each other and differ in the degree that they overlap with adults of other species. Prey use is a general function of scorpion size; scorpions more different in size are less similar in prey size but not prey taxa. In general, P. mesaensis (especially adults) occur during times (spring; late summer to early fall) and in the habitat (sand) characterized by the highest availability of prey. Only the temporal patterns of P. mesaensis adults were significantly correlated with prey abundance; the feeding rate of P. mesaensis is significantly greater than that of the other species. The success of P. mesaensis is partially due to the fact that it is the only one of these species fully adapted to sand.

The monthly variations in total population size were largely due to monthly variations in the numbers of juveniles recruited. The number of juveniles recruited during the 12-yr period represented 8.0% of the possible total. This shortfall was due to the failure of many females to become pregnant (52%), and to losses between birth and weaning, of young born to those females which did become pregnant (85% of the estimated number born). Monthly variations in the numbers recruited were probably due to variations in the number of adult females breeding; this peaked in mid-summer. The peak in the number of adult females breeding was preceded by a peak in the percentage of the adult female population breeding in early summer. The monthly mortality rate for the 12-yr period was c20%. In most years the rate was similar at all seasons. Mean ages of both males and females were higher in winter than in summer because more young were recruited in warm weather. About 32% of males and 19% of females recruited into the population moved from their home shelters to neighbouring shelters. Of the females that reached adulthood 43% were breeding on one or more occasions. The percentage breeding was highest among cohorts recruited between August and November.

In polyandry reproductive success was high if both males mated with the female because they then both helped to feed the young. Success was low, however, if the alpha male prevented the beta male from mating because then only the alpha male helped the female to feed the young and the beta male sometimes interfered with the breeding attempt.

A. cahirinus (38.3 g body mass) had the highest energy flux and expended 1.35 kJ g-1 d-1 during its 10.5-h activity period. A. russatus (45.0 g) expended 1.06 kJ g-1 d-1 during its 9-h activity period and S. calurus (41.2 g) expended 1.07 kJ g-1 d-1 during its 10.5-h activity period. Water influxes of these 3 species were intermediate between those of other rodents, suggesting that behavioural diet selection can be as important as physiological water conservation in adapting to desert life. Their energy expenditures were lower than those predicted for rodents of their body mass, consistent with the notion of low energy expenditures among desert-adapted rodents. The ratio of water influx to dry matter intake (ml:g) was 1.3 in A. cahirinus, compared with 1.9 in A. russatus and 2.5 in S. calurus. Thus more water was available for evaporative cooling in the latter 2 species. This could explain, at least in part, their different geographical distributions. -from Authors",51,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,46,NA,NA

In Eskdale land-use remained stable during this period, but in Annandale tree-felling and agricultural changes reduced nesting and hunting habitat. Annual survival of established breeders was the same in both areas, but recruitment of incoming breeders was lower in the declining population. This was the main proximate cause of decline. In Eskdale, density-dependent processes prevailed, acting to stabilize the population around a mean of 35 pairs. Birds probably competed for prime home ranges, so that entry to the breeding population depended largely on gaps created by deaths or movements of previous breeders. This led to a density-dependent recruitment of new breeders, and hence a density-dependent loss of pre-breeders. Early spring weather modified the density dependence; cold wet conditions in February-April led to lower populations than expected from nest numbers the previous year. In these months, prey numbers reached their lowest level, and hunting was further impaired by rain. Annual losses of established breeders were not density dependent nor was production of young. Breeding performance was similar in the 2 areas and tended to fluctuate in parallel from year to year, apparently influenced by weather. When it was warm and dry during March- April, egg-laying in both areas was early, clutches were large, and overall production was high; but when it was cold and wet during this period, laying in both areas was late, clutches were small, and production was low. -from Authors",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,48,NA,NA

The 2 species used different plant species and substrates as sources of insect prey. Redtails used capture methods more appropriate for mobile prey more often than blue monkeys. Both species showed a bimodal annual seasonality in consumption of fruit, leaves and insects, but differed in how the proportions of these items in the diet inter-relate. In both species, adult males were highly frugivorous, adult females more insectivorous and/or folivorous. Juvenile size was directly related to the proportions of leaves and of insects in the diet, but inversely related to the proportion of fruit. Largest juveniles were more folivorous and insectivorous than adults. Dietary variation between species and between species-age-sex classes is related to body size, the physiological demands of reproduction and growth, social constraints, and competition, especially for fruit.-from Author",83,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,68,NA,NA

Birds laying few (5-6) eggs had a lower hatching and fledging success than those laying many (7-8) eggs. Hatching failure increased with increasing hatching spread. Nestling mortality was also generally higher for 'asynchronous' broods than for 'synchronous' ones, but mean nestling weight at fledging of the 'asynchronous' broods was higher. Synchronous hatching was advantageous when survival of juveniles did not depend on fledgling weight, contrary to the prediction of the brood reduction hypothesis. Synchronous hatching may also be selected for when breeding conditions are unfavourable but are not so bad that complete breeding failures occur. There seem to be some proximate constraints on starting incubation during egg production. Birds may hatch the eggs rather synchronously under unfavourable conditions, such as in marginal habitat and cold weather. This possibility of constraints may explain why hatching spread increased the later in the season the clutch was laid. Alternatively, early initiation of incubation late in the season may reflect the need to hasten breeding to utilize declining food resources.-from Author",90,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,69,NA,NA

The drop in egg production resulted from beetles delaying oviposition for several hours when aphids were absent. The coccinellids did not delay oviposition when exposed to aphid odours and honeydew (but not to aphids). Female beetles were more active when aphids were absent than when they were present. Females were also more active when only aphid odours and honeydew were present than when aphids were present. Thus, the females' delay in ovipositing in the absence of prey did not result simply from their increased activity. -from Authors",77,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,70,NA,NA

About 81% of fry in field experiments rarely fed, soon lost weight after their yolk was exhausted, drifted downstream chiefly at night and died. The others started to feed and either remained near their birthplace or migrated, usually upstream. The proportion migrating was density-dependent, increasing from <1% to c 12% as the number of fry per nest increased. Few fry emigrated out of the stream and therefore population losses in spring were chiefly due to mortality. The 2nd spatial change, an increase in relative clumping in the first winter of the life cycle, was related to the behavioural movements of 1st-year trout when they migrated to deeper pools in the stream. A few 1st-year trout emigrated out of the stream in winter, but population losses in the first summer and winter of the life cycle were chiefly due to mortality, usually within the stream, rather than migration. The 3rd spatial change, a slight increase in the relative clumping of 3rd-year trout, was related to their increased mobility just before they emigrated from the stream as smolts. -from Author",117,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,71,NA,NA

Predatory arthropods were the most important cause of mortality of eggs and larvae. Such predation was restricted to early in the reproductive season. Seasonal adversity (heat stress in midsummer, and autumn flood) decreased survival of newly-emerged adults but from then on adult survival up to the reproductive stage was more likely to be size- and sex-dependent. Foliage damage of thistle plants by beetle-feeding and leaf senescence was particularly clear after summer.

Grazing or clipping of vegetation resulted in higher and prolonged peaks in N concentration but peak N levels in these plants still occurred within a week of the end of the hatching period. Standing crops of graminoids increased until early August while the standing crop of arrowgrass (the most nutritious plant in the diet) in preferred foraging habitat began to decline in mid-July due to grazing by geese. Peck-rates of adult cackling geese tended to decline as brood-rearing progressed, indicating the preferred foods declined in availability during this period. Late in brood-rearing, preferred foraging areas were used less and arrowgrass comprised a smaller proportion of the diet. Changes in plant nutrient levels and shifts in diet and habitat use reduced the nutritional quality of the diet as brood-rearing progressed. As a result of both the natural phenology of tundra plants and grazing by geese, late hatching broods were at a nutritional disadvantage; hence early nesting is encouraged. -from Authors",100,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,74,NA,NA
