Fruit production varied from year to year and was not related to annual rainfall. On average I. angolensis trees fruited once every two years while J. globiflora trees fruited once every two and one-half years. Number of fruits per tree was correlated with tree size for both species. In a peak year fruit biomass represented two to four percent of total above ground biomass but for J. globiflora about 5.5 and 4.5 percent of nitrogen and potassium, respectively, were in fruits compared to 0.6 and 1.8 percent for I. angolensis. The lower fruiting frequency in J. globiflora was probably related to the depletion of N reserves during a fruiting year which required a longer replenishment period than in I. angolensis. Predispersal seed predation was low for J. globiflora (10%) and very high in I. angolensis (65-85%) and for the latter species predation rate increased from August to November 1991 and significant variations were observed among years and pod types. Seed predation rate was lowest in a peak fruiting year and this observation provides support for the satiation hypothesis. The results of the study also suggest that I. angolensis and J. globiflora may have different regeneration strategies although reproductive allocation in both species was within the range reported for other iteroparous plants.",10,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Fruit production | Isoberlinia angolensis | Julbernardia globiflora | Miombo woodland | Seed predation | Zambia,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Density of stems ≥ 1 m tall and ≤5 cm DBH (included canopy tree, midstory tree, liana, palm, shrub, and tree fern species) was highest in the road edge plots than either the track or logged forest plots.

For stems >5 cm and ≤20 cm DBH, density and basal area in the track plots averaged about one-fourth of edge and logged forest plot values. We estimated recovery of basal area in road tracks to take at least 80 yr to reach the status found in logged forest, and species richness over an even longer period.

Pins also set more seed than thrums, suggesting that the higher frequency of compatible pollen deposited on pin stigmas results in greater fecundity; alternatively, greater seed set in pins could be due to the differential allocation of resources to male and female function between morphs.

First, some extended areas around N. princeps colonies appear unexploited, as this species practices interference competition on a wide scale, defending large territories inter- and intra-specifically. Second, interspecific relations are asymmetrical. In some plantations, large colonies of N. princeps expand their territory by destroying colonies of M. biroi, but when the pressure of N. princeps is relaxed, dense populations of colonies of M. biroi can recolonize the trees in a few years' time. Territorial boundaries may thus change relatively fast. N. novarumhebridarum often colonizes dead trees and interferes less with the other species.
