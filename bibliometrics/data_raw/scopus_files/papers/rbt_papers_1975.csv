It has the advantage of preserving the specimen alive without the complications of cell culture, and can be performed under field conditions.",3,1224021,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,1

Experiments suggest a mechanical action of the abrasive particles on the epicuticle, making it permeable, and thus accelerating dehydration. Other insects, such as the honey bee (Apis mellifera), were not affected externally but through the ingestion of ash-contaminated nectar and by the massive destruction of the vegetation on which they depended. Great destruction of bee populations was observed during 1964 and 1965-66 in the San José area. On the other hand, the volcanic ash apparently favored other insects, especially those protected by a waxy secretion, and by the possible elimination of their natural enemies, to such proportions that they became pests of economic significance.",17,1224020,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,2

The leaves of A. mexicana have more water storage tissue than those of H. glomerata; on the other hand, H. glomerata is capable of root absorption. In A. mexicana, modified nonfunctional stomata increase transpiration resistance. Also, this species shows more specialized foliar trichomes which permit the uptake of water and possibly of nutrients. The balance between transpiration and absorption rates is regulated in both species by the combined presence of peltate scales and stomata. The degree of adaptation to drought presented by epiphytic species is more complicated than that shown by terrestrial species. Epiphytic plants like A. mexicana may be derived from xerophytic species that have undergone readaptation to a humid climate. The conspicuous negative geotropism in the leaves of A. mexicana causes the formation of basal deposits of water, which play an important functional role in survival.",10,1197816,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,4
