These systems can harbor a rich entomofauna, including ants, which could be predators of key pests in these systems. However, the role of shade on the distribution and abundance of these ants is unknown, yet such knowledge could suggest guidelines for manipulating certain environmental conditions of their habitat, thereby achieving their conservation and increase. Therefore, we studied the effect of shade on the spatial and temporal distribution of three ant species (Solenopsis geminata, Pheidole radoszkowskii and Crematogaster curvispinosa) that may prey on the coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei (Coleoptera: Scolytidae), and the mahogany shootborer, Hypsipyla grandella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae). To do this, abundance was evaluated across a sun-shade gradient in a coffee plantation with four alternate plots (from pure sun to total shade) in Turrialba, Costa Rica. In the community that was studied 28 species of ants were collected, of which S. geminata was the dominant species (79 % of the total individuals), followed by P. radoszkowskii (16 %). S. geminata and C. curvispinosa preferred sunny areas, while P. radoszkowskii showed no defined preference.

To evaluate if transplant stress increased the corals availability to fish predation, comparisons of fish foraging intensity among transplanted versus native colonies were made. To determine the density of herbivorous and corallivorous fishes on the transplants area visual censuses were made. The transient herbivorous fishes (Scaridae and Acanthuridae) were the most abundant fishes, and the corallivorous fishes (mainly Chaetodontidae) were the scarcest. A negative effect of territorial herbivorous fishes on M. annularis transplants survival was observed, mainly early on the study. Fish foraging intensity was similar on transplanted and native colonies, but differed among coral species, being lowest on D. labyrinthiformis. Fast macroalgal growth inside full-cages due to reduced fish grazing was observed. This caused partial bleaching and partial mortality in some colonies, mainly of P. astreoides. No significant difference in healthy tissue percentages among full-cage and uncaged colonies on M. annularis and D. labyrinthiformis was found, while in P. astreoides there were evident differences. The results indicate a damselfish negative effect on transplants survival early on the study, which can change depending on the fish and coral species involved. Results also indicate a fish grazing positive effect, caused by the reduction of coral-algae competition pressure, mainly on P. astreoides. Parrotfishes seem to affect corals survival both negatively through direct biting, and positively by controlling algal growth.

Flower buds (FB) 2 to 6 mm in length were collected from 7:00 AM through 6:00 PM, their perianths removed, and fixed in Carnoy I (3:1 ethanol/glacial acetic acid) for 24 h and stored in ethanol (70 % v/v) until observation. Light microscope observations were done on temporary preparations obtained by overflowing anther content suspended in acetic orcein (1.5 % w/v) for 5 min and softly squashing with the cover slip. A total of 9 411 cells were analyzed. Upper mitotic activity was observed in FB from 3.8 ± 0.09 mm long, collected at 11:00 AM through 1:00 PM; 17% of PMCs showed one to eight sister chromatid bridges from anaphase to telophase; 13%, one to seven micronucleus of variable diameter (0.9 to 4.8 μm); 8.1% were united by thin chromatin filaments, and 0.1% lacked a nucleus. Other evaluated cells (61.8%) had apparently normal mitotic configurations, without considerable morphometric variations. The evident irregular proliferation of a PMCs fraction (39.2%) suggests that environmental stress conditions (day temperatures ranging 32.7 to 39.8°C, high solar radiation and low humidity) induce chromosome instability and physiologic changes that affect the normal development during premeiotic mitosis. As a consequence, loss or addition of chromosome fragments can occur in association with deficiencies and gene duplications.",6,19086386,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Aloe vera | Chromosome abnormalities | Dicentric chromosome bridges | Micronucleus | Premeiotic mitosis,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,16,NA,NA,NA

Traveling occurred along different points parallel to the coast, with a low percentage of cases across the gulf (16.56 %), suggesting that the bottlenose rarely crosses from one side to the other. In the spotted dolphin, several behaviors were observed simultaneously in the schools and it was not possible to associate areas with particular behaviors. The lack of significant relationships among activities and particular environmental variables (ANOVA tests) is attributed to three aspects: (a) transitions among activities generally occurred into a low variable area, (b) dolphins often traveled along large areas without changing activities and (c) environmental conditions in Golfo Dulce are homogeneous.

Detailed karyotype analysis revealing 2n=34 in B. cylindrica and 2n=36 in B. gymnorrhiza was reported for the first time and 2n=34 in B. parviflora and B. sexangula was confirmed. On the basis of the common types of chromosomes present among Bruguiera, two distinct groups were found; one consists of B. cylindrica and B. parviflora and the other of B. gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula. The symmetrical karyotype with same chromosome types grouped B. cylindrica and B. parviflora together and presence of Type E chromosomes placed B. gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula in a separate group, suggesting their closer affinity in their respective group. Analysis of chromosome length, volume, INV and 4C DNA content confirmed this division. Nuclear DNA content was two-fold higher (∼17.0 pg) in the second group than in the first (∼8.0 pg). The amplification products generated through RAPD revealed 1-9 amplicons with size variations from 600 bp to 2 500 bp with 49.31% genetic similarity between B. gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula and 47.10% in between B. cylindrica and B. parviflora. The high copy number marker band (∼ 1 100 bp) yielded in OPN-15 primer in B. parviflora the characteristic DNA marker, which was cloned and used as probes for assessment of genetic diversity, and demonstrated its close genetic affinity to B. cylindrica. B. gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula also produced similar marker bands of ∼600 bp and ∼2 200 bp in the same primer. All of the cytological, 4C DNA content and RAPD data confirmed the existence of two taxonomically distinct groups of Bruguiera: one consisting of B. cylindrica and B. parviflora and the other of B. gymnorrhiza and B. sexangula as placed earlier (1862) in the tribe Rhizophoreae by Bentham and Hooker, on the basis of the flowering habits of Bruguiera. Genetically, the B. sexangula and B. gymnorrhiza group was found to be very closely, rather than distantly, related to B. parviflora and B. cylindrica.

This digestive tract represents an extreme microenvironment due to its high pH and presence of antimicrobial substances secreted by the insect or derived from ingested plant tissue. At the same time, it contains large amounts of nutrient-rich food, for which microbes may compete among themselves and with the caterpillar. There is little information about the microbiota associated with tropical caterpillar guts, although bacteria from different genera have been isolated from gut and pupae samples. The study of the enzymatic activities generated by these organisms constitutes a starting point to understand their metabolic and physiological relationships with their hosts, and to find enzymes that have potential biotechnological applications. In this study we evaluated several enzymatic activities in two collections of bacteria isolated from caterpillar guts and pupae of the tropical lepidopteran species A. zugana and R. lebeau. Bacteria grown under aerobic conditions were tested for an array of enzymes, including gelatinases, caseinases, lipases, esterases, cellulases, xylanases, amylases and chitinases. Both collections displayed similar patterns of enzymatic activity. No isolate showed activity for all enzymatic tests, but as a whole, at least some bacteria in each collection were able to degrade each substrate tested. Isolates with the same taxonomic identification obtained from caterpillar guts and pupae had almost the same enzymatic activities. In both collections, it was possible to group bacterial isolates according to their enzyme activity pattern. In addition to a heterogeneous ensemble of isolates exhibiting two or less enzymatic activities, there were two groups with at least five activities that showed an apparent specialization for the substrates they were able to use. The first consisted exclusively of isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae, which were positive for lipolytic and chitinolytic activities, but completely lacked amylasic, cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities. The second group, composed mainly of Gram-positive rods, exhibited the opposite pattern: they were positive for amylasic, cellulolytic and xylanolytic activities, lacked chitinolytic activity and had few isolates with lipolytic activity.

At the three moments of the day studied (6 am, 2 pm and 10 pm), the oxygen concentrations in the overlying water and in the superficial sediment layer were near air-saturation in the diurnal samplings (582 μM at 6 am and 665 μM at 2 pm), and sub-satured during the night (158 μM). In the sediments, the models of vertical distribution of Eh and organic carbon distributions were very irregular due to the bio-perturbation of the benthic, meio- and macrofauna, whose activity allows the superficial organic carbon to migrate towards sediment deeper layers. Vertical distribution of the different viable bacteria populations seems to be related to the hydrodynamic patterns of the communicating canal and sediments heterogeneity. In the sediment column, the heterotrophic bacteria total number varied from 6.8 to 20.3 × 108 cells cm-3. The highest heterotrophic bacterial biomass values were encountered during the diurnal samplings (39.2 μgC.l-1 at 6 am and 34.4 μgC.l-1 at 2 pm) and the lowest during the night (9.7 μgC.l-1). The fluctuations of viable heterotrophic bacteria populations with different respiratory metabolisms (aerobic, microaerophilic and anaerobic) can be explained by the existence of suboxic microniches that appear when particles of sediment are resuspended due to the water circulation and the benthic infauna excavating activity, that allows the supernatant water oxygen to penetrate through its galleries towards deeper sediment zones.

Strongyluris brevicaudata had the highest prevalence of infection (82.3 %), followed by P. awokoyai (74.5 %), Raillietiella (10.3 %), Capillaria sp. (8.4 %) and O. agamae (7.4 %). M. monas and Oxyuris sp. had low prevalences: 1.61 % each. Raillietiella sp. and Capillaria sp. can cause localized inflammation and intestinal infections in humans. The prevalence of infection was higher in larger adult lizards. Prevalence in males was 97.6 % (94.1 % in females). In four of the helminth species, intensity of infection was higher in male lizards. Parasite intensity was highest in the rectum, followed by the intestine (p<0.05). Infection intensity was, to a large extent, dependent on the type of parasite, and age of lizard. During May, P. awokoyai had its highest mean intensities and prevalence. The prevalence and mean intensity of helminthes varied with the month of collection (both p<0.05).
