The forest was sampled by three 0.18 ha plots, with each plot made up of eight contiguous 15m X 15m quadrats, four of which were placed at the river margin and the remaining four in the forest interior. A canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the species density distribution was significantly correlated with some soil chemical characteristics and topographical features. The soils of the three sample plots showed statistically significant differences for the levels of Ca, Mg, K and pH, with the fertility (expressed by the cation exchange capacity) increasing from Plot I to Plot III. These variations were mainly explained by the first canonical axis while the second was strongly correlated with topographical variables, separating the quadrats into two groups: those of the higher and steeper sites from those of the lower sites. The only soil property that was significantly different in lower and upper sites was the concentration of phosphorus. No significant difference in tree species distribution was found between river margin and interior quadrats, certainly because this forest sector lies on the outer side of a curve of the river where erosion is currently building high and steep river banks and forcing the forest to retreat. A tentative ecological classification of the 30 most abundant species according to their habitat preference in terms of soil fertility and topographical sites, and to their growth strategy in the forest dynamics, is presented. It is suggested that these factors play an important role in promoting the coexistence of tree species in this type of forest. © 1994, Cambridge University Press.

Is there a qualitative difference in the nature of nutrient limitation under primary forest and adinandra belukar? Results showed that there was a strong limitation by P availability in both primary forest and adinandra belukar under the experimental conditions used. Once plants had an adequate P supply, all other nutrients became limiting to growth in primary forest soil. These findings are interpreted as support for the hypothesis that P availability would limit the productivity of moist tropical forests in general in the absence of mycorrhizas; tentative conclusions are drawn on the assumption that most woody tropical plants are mycorrhizal.

Habitat structure was measured at 197 points throughout the study site, both in areas used by the pheasant and in those areas not used by the pheasant. A DECO RAN A ordination revealed that two gradients explained much of the variation in micro-habitat structure.

Within these clusters, display scrapes were sited in areas that were more stable and were more influenced by the rivers than elsewhere within the area used by the calling males.

Intuitively, termites would seem to be a very suitable group to illustrate effects of ecosystem fragmentation. Being detritivorcs, they do not control directly the rate at which their resources are available, nor do they restrict the ability of the resources to regenerate. Consequently, termites do not mask the ecosystem depletion caused by fragmentation. With this in mind, we compared the communities of termites in undisturbed Amazonian forest with those of two isolated fragments nearby, aiming to show that the differences observed may have resulted from habitat fragmentation. Dissimilarities between communities in the undisturbed forest suggest natural patchiness in their distribution, which could lead to misinterpretation of the effects of fragmentation. Continuous forest had higher species richness and fewer rare species than the fragments. Guild structure in the forest was biased towards soil-feeding termites, which are subterranean and soft bodied, and therefore more sensitive to variation in microclimate. In the fragments, litter-feeders and species intermediate between soil-feeding and wood-feeding types were numerically more important. Habitats in the forest were more equally used than in the fragments, suggesting habitat unsuitability increased with fragmentation. It is suggested that the community composition of the fragments is a result of the intrinsic patchiness of the original forest and deterministic and stochastic extinctions caused by fragmentation. The need for manipulative experiments to test such ideas is discussed. © 1994, Cambridge University Press.

Median growth rates ranged between c. 0.5 mm yl(Grias neuberthii, Neea divaricata) and 11.6 mm y1(Cecropia sciadophylla). The maximum simulated life-span spent between a DBH of 10 cm and the largest DBH of a species varied from 54 y (Cecropia sciadophylla) to 529 y (Neea divaricata). Fast growing species and species that potentially can grow old showed a convex survivorship curve, whereas slower growing species and species that do not grow very old showed sigmoid, linear and convex survivorship curves. The species were grouped according to their DBH-height relationship and according to their maximum age, maximum growth rate, and maximum DBH. The groups probably reflect different light requirements. A negative correlation was found between maximum age and mortality rate. Growth rates vary within species, thus the largest tree is not necessarily the oldest. © 1994, Cambridge University Press.

Growth was unaffected by a salinity of 10% artificial sea water, but was reduced by one third in 20% and by two thirds in 30% artificial sea water respectively. Initial adjustment to salinity was due both to increases in the concentrations of sodium and potassium per unit dry weight and to reduced hydration, the latter being the more important at higher salinities. The increase in ion concentration in the cell sap balanced the salinity of the medium at 10% artificial sea water, but was excessive at higher concentrations of sea water. Net photosynthesis was unaffected by 10% artificial sea water but declined at higher salinities. The potassium content of the plants did not fall below 200-250 mM, and the sodium to potassium ratio did not exceed three, even at the highest salinities. Variation in the concentration of nutrients (potassium, nitrate and sulphate) in the medium in the presence of 25% artificial sea water had significant effects upon growth, but these were small in relation to the inhibitory effect of the salinity. The reduction in growth could not be attributed to lack of osmotic adjustment or to nutrient deficiency, and was probably due to ion toxicity within the leaves. The tolerance to reduced hydration, combined with the ability to germinate in saline conditions previously observed, could enable D. aegyptium to establish in a saline soil. The population did not exhibit any halophytic characteristics but did survive with a low growth rate at salinities up to 50% artificial sea water. It is concluded that the species was able to colonize the saline site because of its inherent adaptability, rather than the possession of an ecotype adapted to saline conditions. © 1994, Cambridge University Press.

The fate of mature Acacia tortilis pods on the tree and ground and A. nilotica pods on the ground were investigated at a site in South Africa. Pods on Acacia trees were browsed only by giraffe whereas pods on the ground were browsed by kudu, impala, steenbok and duiker. In the absence of giraffe most A. tortilis pods fell from the tree to the ground. When giraffe were present they consumed most A. tortilis pods at tree level. Bruchids infested 21.6-54.0% of seeds within pods on the tree. Once fallen, in the absence of browsing ungulates, A. tortilis and A. nilotica pod and seed disappearance could be attributed to burial by termites and ants, seed consumption by rodents and to decomposition; when browsing ungulates were present they consumed most pods on the ground. Between 20.0-47.6% of A. tortilis and 31.0-58.0% of A. nilotica seeds on the ground were infested by bruchids. Ungulate browsing had no effect on bruchid infestation of seeds.

During a two-year study in Tanzania, we tested three hypotheses to investigate the proximal causes of this seasonality. Food availability was no limiting factor since food supply could not induce continuous breeding. Temperature was always high and thus not a restrictive climatic factor. Diet was probably always sufficiently varied and protein-rich to allow reproduction. This contradicts earlier hypotheses that consider Mastomys as an opportunistic breeder in which reproduction is seasonally limited by poor conditions; environmental predictors were believed not to be involved since the animals live in an unpredictably unstable environment. However, although the occurrence of rain may be unpredictable, it is highly predictable that heavy rainfall will be followed by good conditions.

The diet of capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella, in a 250 ha semideciduous forest in south-east Brazil was studied for 44 consecutive months.

Seventy-one plant species were consumed by capuchins. Food availability was markedly seasonal. During the dry season the fleshy fruit availability decreased, and at that time the capuchins became seed predators and flower-eaters. Several fruits eaten by capuchins in the dry season were not consumed by other frugivorous vertebrates, such as howler monkeys, parrots or squirrels, allowing capuchins to avoid competition with other arboreal frugivores. In semideciduous forests where fleshy fruits are less abundant than in the wet forests capuchins are important seed predators. © 1994, Cambridge University Press.

One exception is an area at Yapilika where a large tract of savanna is dominated by Acacia shrubs. An ordination analysis of 122 quadrats revealed that the boundary of Eucalyptus dominance did not correspond to a major change in floristic composition. Detailed transect studies at one site on the boundary showed that Eucalyptus trees were abruptly replaced by a band of Crevillea trees which gradually gave way to Acacia shrub dominance. There was a gradual change in the floristic composition of the savanna across the boundary. The distributional limit of Eucalyptus was found to be independent of any hydrological discontinuity. There was a slight decrease (<2.5 m) in altitude from Eucalyptus to Acacia savanna. The Acacia savanna soils were sandier and their surface soil had significantly lower concentrations of Ca and Mg and significantly greater concentration of Al compared with the Eucalyptus savanna soils. Eucalyptus seedlings planted in the three savanna communities were not found to be under drought stress (pre-dawn leaf xylem potentials of >-0.9 MPa) during the dry season. Over a 12 month period Eucalyptus tttrodonta and E. miniata seedling growth was not significantly different on the Acacia or Eucalyptus savanna, although this result may be due to the counteracting effects of greater soil fertility and tree competition in the Eucalyptus savanna and lower soil fertility in the treeless, and hence competition-free, Acacia savanna. This hypothesis is supported by the significantly greater growth of Eucalyptus seedlings on fertilized Acacia savanna soils. The limited production, dispersal and establishment of Eucalyptus seeds and the greater frequency of fires in the Acacia savanna probably explains the abrupt limit to Eucalyptus dominance along the edaphic gradient. © 1994, Cambridge University Press.

Flowering periods varied between seasons rather than between species and no niche separation in flowering times existed between the study plants.

Minimum numbers of species and individuals were seen in the study area during July and August. Such seasonal variation was more pronounced in riverine and dry deciduous forest than in the secondary vegetation which was avoided by most of the winter migrants. There was a greater species overlap between riverine and dry deciduous forest than between riverine and secondary vegetation. No relationship could be established between bird species diversity and tree species/foliage height diversity. The secondary vegetation had fewer specialized forest species and more generalists. Larger birds (200 g) were rare but smaller ones (50 g) were more common.

The aim of the research was to collect moreinformation about the life-cycles of tropical isopods by analysing size-class distributionsof two sympatric isopod species, belonging to the genus Burmoniscus. Biomass of the populations was estimated from length-weight conversions established for each species in the laboratory. The efficiency of the Tullgren extraction method was estimated by comparison to hand sorting; no difference was found between these methods. The abundance of the two species differed significantly with time. Burmoniscus Sp. A was more abundant during the wet season, whereas the population fluctuations of Burmoniscus Sp. B were more spread over the year. Reproduction of both species took place in the wet season. Burmoniscus Sp. A had one generation per year, while for Burmoniscus Sp. B the situation was unclear due to extensive overlap of sizeclasses. Comparisons were made with isopod abundance in other tropical and temperate forests. The mean density of the two species found in this study was 258 m for Burmoniscus Sp. Aand 272 m for Burmoniscus Sp. B, while biomass was 80.4 mg m and 37.6 mg m respectively.

Over a five-year period, all seedlings (heightlt;50 cm) and small saplings (height 50 cm to dbh 1 cm) were measured and monitored in permanent tree-centred transects (N#x003D; 10#x2013;11 trees per species). Survival rates increased with plantsize class and were similar among species. Maximum height growth rates increased with increasing plant size, but average growth rates did not; this disparity suggests the importance ofrelease from understorey suppression for long-term recruitment success. Among the three species, Quararibea had the lowest standing seedling densities and almost no sapling recruitment,whereas Tetragastris had the highest densities of both seedlings and saplings; Trichilia seedling and sapling densities were intermediate. In all three species, a few trees produced very high seedling and sapling densities in comparison with the sample average. All three species exhibited a year of exceptionally high new seedling recruitment during the study period; these good years were not coincident among the species but instead reflected the species#x2019; phenological differences. Since seedling survival becomes relatively constant and highafter the first few years of life (c. 80#x0025; y), such large new cohorts persist as a year-class effect in the seedling population and thus maintain seedling numbers over time. The interspecific differences in seedling and sapling dynamics were consistent with overall 10-year trends of a declining Quararibea population, a stable Trichilia population, and an increasing Tetragastris population. © 1994, Cambridge University Press.

Of the chimpanzee dung samples, 98.5% contained seeds, and fig seeds were the most common. The number of large seeds (2 mm) per dung sample was often high, even for species with a relatively large seed. For example, Mimusops bagshawei has a 15-mm diameter seed and had an average of 26.5 seeds per sample. In addition, many seed species were found in the dung repeatedly over several months. Germination trials demonstrated that the species of seed commonly collected from dung were viable. Comparisons of both the rate and success of germination of chimpanzee-dispersed seeds with seeds collected directly from the parent trees, showed that gut passage increased the speed and probability of germination. The number of large seeds dispersed by the chimpanzee population was estimated at 369 large seeds km day We suggest that in Kibale, chimpanzees may play a more significant role in primary seed dispersal than implied by their low numbers and biomass.
