The population ecology of a colony of P. virginiensis was studied in Connecticut. Survival to instar IV for P. virginiensis is comparable to that observed for its superabundant congener, P. rapae, but for P. virginiensis problems begin with instar IV and V larvae, which appear to be victimized by unpredictable host phenology. In 1982, early senescence of Dentaria stranded most IV and V instar caterpillars; stranded caterpillars were unsuccessful at locating secondary host plants. P. virginiensis adults also encounter difficulties because they attempt to oviposit in the spring, when weather conditions are rarely suitable for flight or oviposition. Furthermore, when the females do fly, they are not very effective at laying eggs rapidly. Buildup of granulosis virus through soil contamination may also contribute to the butterfly's rarity. Finally, because P. virginiensis appears reluctant to fly across open fields, recolonization of extinct colonies is an unlikely event. P. virginiensis may have been more abundant in the past, when butterflies would have had less trouble dispersing among Dentaria stands because fewer woodlands were dissected by open habitats.-from Authors",49,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Interspecific competition should not lead to qualitatively different behaviours for the dominant species because the effects of the subordinate are weak.

However, censuses of 18 host trees, on 6 of which the proportion of damaged leaves had been experimentally increased, revealed that these leaf miners do select significantly more intact leaves than damaged ones for oviposition. Miners on damaged leaves experienced significantly lower survivorship, owing to increased parasitism, than did miners on intact leaves. The higher rate of attack by parasitoids is probably attributable to physical or chemical alterations in damaged leaves.

In the high settlement limit, the intertidal landscape is a mosaic of cohorts, punctuated with occasional gaps of vacant substrate. In the low settlement limit, the intertidal landscape has vacant space and organisms of all ages mixed together, and spatial variation in abundance is caused by microgeographic variation in settlement and mortality rates. -from Authors",379,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,22,NA,NA

Estimates of threshold volumes used by bumblebees are very similar to theoretical optimal threshold volumes.

Occasional violations of the threshold departure rule prevent bees from maximizing rates of net energy intake, but average rates of return adjusted for violations were higher than rates from any of 3 random plant-departure rules.

Acceptabilities of climax forest plants and early-successional plants were not significantly different for any of the slug species. The plant-defense hypothesis was supported when predictability was measured as seasonal leaf persistence. As seasonal leaf persistence of forest herbs increased, acceptability declined. As alternative explanation based on growth rate is discussed. Alternatively, feeding choices were hypothesized to be determined by adaptations of these generalist herbivores to plants available in their local habitats (the herbivore-adaptation-hypothesis). Because slugs are generally restricted to feeding on herbs, woody species were predicted to be less acceptable than herbs; this was strongly supported. Also, each slug preferred a few herbaceous species unique to its specific habitat, suggesting local adaptation. If both plants and slugs are coevolving, plant choices would depend upon where we examine the coevolutionary spiral, but they should be unique for each species as it coevolves with local plants (the coevolution hypothesis).

Patterns of change in richness can be explained by the different effect of treatments on the vegetation structure and by the role of the dominant species in each field. In the bi-layered older field, disturbances greatly disrupted the closed canopy of S. canadensis, thus providing resource patches (ie, increased light, moisture) for suppressed and invading species. In the younger field, the impact of disturbance was only detectable in early and midsummer, and changes in richness were mainly related to the seasonal cycle of the dominant annual A. artemisiifolia. -Authors",185,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,42,NA,NA

During midsummer, when planktivorous silversides Menidia menidia were abundant in the eelgrass bed, pelagic copepod densities were significantly reduced in the eelgrass bed, relative to channel abundances. Differences declined overnight, when fish were not feeding, and were reestablished after dawn. In late winter, coincident with the arrival of large numbers of postlarval fish in the eelgrass bed, there was a selective reduction of juvenile Centropages spp. in the eelgrass bed, relative to channel abundances. These differences were due to intense predation by planktivorous fish, but the littoral copepod Pseudodiaptomus coronatus appeared unaffected by the intense predation in the eelgrass bed. Its epibenthic habit and cryptic coloration allow P. coronatus to utilize refuges in the littoral habitat.

Higher densities of T. aureotincta depressed the growth of individual T. aureotincta more than that of T. eiseni, whereas densities of T. eiseni displayed the opposite pattern. The relative impacts of intra- and interspecific competition did not conform to expectations derived from logistic-based models of competitive coexistence. Both species fluctuated little in abundance over 6 yr, suggesting that they indeed coexist. However, detailed examination of the microdistribution of Tegula species indicated that they co-occurred within 0.1-m2 quadrats less often than expected by chance. The significant negative correlation in abundance of the Tegula species within the cobble reef is a pattern consistent with the operation of interspecific competition. Tegula-consuming predators influence the among-reef patterns of distribution and abundance of both gastropod species: mean abundances of both snails were inversely correlated with density of predators and, as a consequence, were positively correlated with each other among reefs. -from Author",24,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,44,NA,NA

In the 1st instance, parasite attack would diminish the cost of the gall to the plant, and thus favor plant genotypes that facilitate parasites. In the 2nd parasites would exert selection pressure on the gall maker to induce larger galls. Field experiments showed that parasite attack does not stop gall growth. The parasitoid wasp Eurytoma gigantea is limited to attacking small galls because of the limited reach of its ovipositor.

Recruitment of juveniles of almost all species in the rubble/sand fish assemblage occurred more heavily on reefs that were built 20-40 m away from the main reef (into the lagoon) than on those built at the edge of the backreef, probably due to differences in available shelter and differences in encounter rates with predators. Seagrass and algae, which provide shelter to very small juvenile fishes, are absent in a 'halo' zone close to the reef due to the feeding activities of reef-associated grazers (fishes and urchins). Part of the explanation for the observed spatial pattern of fish recruitment is the spatial pattern of the shelter provided by seagrass and algae.

During the extinction years, the beetles were attacked by a parasitic water mite (Eylais sp.). There was a high late spring-early summer immigration, but no exchanges could be shown between adjacent populations. Regular long-distance dispersal is indicated. The size of the new generation generally is not proportional to the size of the locally hibernated fraction. This may or may not indicate some sort of density-dependent regulating factors. With high winter mortality, between-year population fluctuations were much affected by large-scale recruitment of spring colonizers from remote localities. G. substriatus had a long life-span and 4-13% of immigrants overwintered 2yr as adults. But winter mortality was severe; 47- 86% of late-autumn beetles died by the following spring.-from Author",11,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,127,NA,NA

The level of aggression is variable with availability of a food resource. As prey density increased, behavior associated with predator-prey interactions (attacks, feeding) increased for some stoneflies, and other activities (dispersal, cleaning, stationary behavior) decreased, generally increasing the predator's probability of finding and consuming prey. Large species of stoneflies had shorter prey handling times than small species, and all stoneflies had very low rates of capture (successful captures 10-25% of total attacks).
