Recently, Ricklefs & Lovette (1999) have emphasized the possible confounding effect of habitat diversity on area while studying species-area relationships. They illustrated this problem using four groups of organisms (birds, bats, herptiles, and butterflies) on 19 islands of the Lesser Antilles. Although they referred to the potential for species to migrate between islands, they did not take into account the geographical distances between islands. 2. Here, I reanalyse their data using a multivariate method, based on permutation of distance matrices, which incorporates pairwise geographical distances between islands. The analysis includes as independent variables the geographical distances between pairs of islands, size, maximum elevation, and habitat diversity of each island. The last three variables were obtained from Ricklefs & Lovette (1999). 3. Results of the analysis were similar to those of Ricklefs & Lovette (1999). In addition, however, geographical distances influenced species richness of bats, birds and butterflies. 4. These new results are helpful for investigating the processes that may contribute to the observed pattern of species richness. The level of endemism of the four taxonomic groups is related to the influences of geographical distances among islands, and might be explained by differences in their vagility. 5. Finally, I emphasize the need to incorporate geographical distances among islands, using statistical methods that can manipulate distance matrices.",25,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Area | Geographical distance | Habitat diversity | Island biogeography | Permutations | Species richness,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA,NA,NA

A new laboratory-based growth model for brown trout (Salmo trutta) was used to explore latitudinal variation in growth among natural populations. The model included the effects of differences in ambient temperatures and fish size among populations. Annual growth rates of anadromous brown trout parr from 22 Norwegian populations at 61-70 °N were compared with predictions from the growth model. Published field data from one Spanish, 15 British and four Danish populations at 44-58 °N were included in the analysis to increase the latitudinal range. 2. Among the Norwegian populations, the ratio between observed and predicted growth rates was not significantly different from 1.00 in eight rivers, but was significantly higher in eight, and was significantly lower in six. Observed growth was highest, relative to predicted growth, in the coldest rivers. In Spanish, British and Danish rivers, observed growth did not exceed predicted growth. 3. The ratio between observed and predicted annual growth rate decreased significantly with increasing annual mean temperature. Observed annual growth was higher than predicted growth only in rivers with an annual mean temperature lower than 5.1 °C, and this indicates that some kind of thermal adaptation may occur in trout populations in the coldest rivers. 4. Regression analyses showed that besides the direct effects of temperature and body size predicted by the growth model, annual growth rates were significantly related to annual mean temperature, densities of juvenile salmonids, duration of twilight (average for May-August) and latitude. Adding these variables to the original model increased the explanatory power from 73.9 to 80.6%.",86,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Density dependence | Geographical variation | Temperature | Thermal adaptation | Twilight,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,3,NA,NA,NA,NA

The theory of food-regulated self-thinning (FST) for mobile animals predicts population density (N) to be an inverse function of mean body mass (W) scaled to an exponent (b), such that N=k W-b, where k is a constant. FST also predicts energy requirements (or energy flow) to remain constant over time (termed energetic equivalence) as losses to cohorts (e.g. emigration and mortality) are balanced by increased growth of surviving individuals. 2. To test these predictions, we analysed the dynamics of six experimental minnow cohorts. Replicate populations of fish were held under identical conditions with a constant and limited supply of food over a 126-day period. Half of the cohorts were open to emigration, and half were closed so that fish could only be lost through starvation mortality. 3. Patterns of self-thinning indicated non-linear changes in population density and energy flow in relation to changes in mean body mass and time, respectively. Non-linear patterns of self-thinning were probably due to a delayed growth response to changes in population density effected through mortality and/or emigration. Contrary to results of similar experiments on other fish, emigration did not have a significant influence on the pattern of self-thinning. 4. These results may be attributed to trophic interactions within cohorts and the importance of social behaviour to cohort dynamics. Both population density and energy flow in our experimental populations appeared to cycle, with episodes of starvation and mortality alternating with food recovery and weight gain, as predicted by recent models of stepwise die-off and stunted growth in animal cohorts. 5. Most of the support for FST in mobile animals comes from observational data on mean body mass and population density. Potentially important mechanisms, including the manner in which individuals are lost or retained in populations, are usually not investigated directly. Such tests of FST can only provide equivocal support. Detailed observational study and controlled experiments are needed to understand casual mechanisms.",17,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Animal energetics | Cohort dynamics | Density dependence | Energetic equivalence population regulation | Self-thinning | Social behaviour,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,4,NA,NA,NA,NA

The distribution and dynamics of a host-specific moth Wheeleria spilodactylus were studied between 1998 and 1999 at a hierarchy of spatial scales: Geographic (c. 8000km2), regional (c. 35km2), subregional (mean c. 12km2) and local (c. 0.03 km2). We tested the hypothesis that resource quantity and isolation would assume different levels of importance at different scales of analysis, with respect to habitat occupancy and population turnover. 2. Experimental releases in occupied and empty habitats showed that W. spilodactylus dispersal was very rare over distances in excess of 100m, and that relatively large plants were more likely to be colonized. 3. The host-plant distribution was very fragmented and the moth did not occupy the entire distribution of its host-plant at any of the spatial scales studied. At most spatial scales, occupancy decreased with isolation and increased with habitat quantity. 4. Colonization was most likely to occur in non-isolated habitat patches at the regional scale, in patches with large numbers of plants at the subregional scale, and in patches with large plants at the local scale. Relatively isolated populations were more likely to go extinct at the subregional scale of analysis. 5. At a geographic scale, the distribution apparently depends on metapopulation persistence, which itself depends principally on the amount of habitat in each region. At regional and subregional scales, distributions and dynamics reflect colonization - extinction dynamics within metapopulations; these are affected by the interaction of habitat quantity (number and size of host-plants) and isolation. At the local scale, distributions and dynamics are affected by relatively frequent movements of individuals between resource patches (influenced by behavioural choices). 6. Long-term metapopulation dynamics of the moth also reflect population dynamics of its disturbance-dependent host-plant Marrubium vulgare.

We used the composition of nest middens to describe the extent of dietary partitioning in an exceptionally diverse assemblage of harvester ants in the Kakadu region of northern Australia. Eight of the > 15 harvester species known from adjacent 30 × 30-m plots, comprising four species of Meranoplus and two species each of Monomorium and Pheidole, maintained conspicuous nest middens. 2. All these eight harvester species are monomorphic (or functionally so in the context of seed collection), with total body length ranging from 2.0 to 5.0 mm. The two species of Monomorium are column foragers, whereas the others apparently forage solitarily. Nests averaged 0.1 m2, but were highly patchy both within and between plots. 3. Seed fragments from a total of 33 plant species were identified from 50 middens sampled during the end of the wet season, with up to 19 seed species recorded from a single midden. Seed species diversity was greatest in middens of Meranoplus minimus, Monomorium sp. 1 (rothsteini group) and Pheidole sp. 1 (mjobergi group), and least in middens of the diversus group of Meranoplus. 4. Despite a high overall diversity of seed species, each harvester species collected primarily two or three seed species (with one exception, all grasses), and there was virtually no overlap in these species between harvesters. The pronounced dietary separation of harvester species was demonstrated by multivariate analysis of midden composition. 5. The extent to which differential seed selection is determined by intrinsic preferences, vs. interactions between, harvester species is unknown, nor is it clear why the diversity of harvester ants is so high.

Parametric intensity and spatial arrangement analyses were used to investigate the spatial pattern of the slugs Arion intermedius and Deroceras reticulatum. 2. The spatial lag of sampling (distance between sampling points) was shown to be unimportant in the intensity analyses. Rather, the 0.25 m grain scale was imposed on the whole sampling. The observed slope of the variance to mean relationships was common to both species, possibly determined by egg laying in batches at 0.25 m. However, the variance of the sample, for a given mean, was lower in summer. This corresponded with a reduction in the proportion of zero counts, which could be due to slug movement, possibly increased by predator activity, acting at the 0.25 m scale. 3. By contrast with the intensity analyses, the lag scale was important for spatial arrangement. At 0.25 m, in March 1997, the A. intermedius and D. reticulatum juveniles were aggregated, presumably about where egg batches were laid. At higher scales, the arrangements of D. reticulatum became spatially random, and A. intermedius resolved to a patch arrangement at the 16 m scale. 4. Over time, the D. reticulatum spatial arrangements remained random and independent of the previous sampling date. From March to July 1997, the A. intermedius patch persisted. A crash in abundance of both species, between July and October 1997, appeared to destroy the patch, but subsequent association suggested that the patch persisted until March 1998. The arrangements of the species were independent of one another on all sampling dates. 5. These species-specific spatial arrangements were independent of all measured environmental factors and consistent with differences in the local reproduction, survival and migration of A. intermedius and D. reticulatum. 6. This comparative study indicates that the terms aggregated, random and regular should have separate definitions for parametric intensity and spatial arrangement. Furthermore, spatial scale has different meaning in intensity and arrangement analyses. Spatial arrangements are not described by parametric intensity. Spatial arrangements change with spatial scale.

In this study we examined the clutch size of Hyssopus pallidus (Askew) (Hymenoptera, Eulophidae), a gregarious ectoparasitoid of codling moth (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) larvae that is characterized by a host handling time of 2 days approximately. 2. Clutch size increased asymptotically with host larval size (fresh weight) to a maximum of 32 eggs. A single male developed from each clutch, brood survival was 83% and pupal size of female offspring was 0.45 mg, all independent of clutch size. 3. A comparison of the response of both experienced and naìve adult parasitoids to varying host larval size, indicated that experience was not necessary for H. pallidus to be able to accurately estimate host size. 4. Clutch size increased by 50% for medium size host larvae (30-40 mg) and 83% for large host larvae (60-76mg) when the encounter rate was reduced from one host every second day to one every seventh day. A significantly lower clutch size was produced on the last day at the highest encounter rate for large host larvae, suggesting exhaustion of the egg supply for H. pallidus. 5. Manipulation of parasitoid clutch size on constant size host larvae did not influence sex ratio (single male) or brood survival (93%), but produced a linear tradeoff between clutch size and the size (fresh weight) of female pupae. Longevity, lifetime fecundity, total number of hosts attacked, and clutch size all increased linearly with the adult size (female pupal weight). 6.

In long-term laboratory studies, the influence of different food materials on parameters of population dynamics was compared in the sympatric woodlice, Porcellio scaber and Oniscus asellus, as a measure of interspecific differences in the utilization of food. 2. Freshly fallen leaf litter of different tree species had been acidified and microbially inoculated prior to the experiments. By analysing the influence of Ph level, density and activity of litter-colonizing microbiota and several physico-chemical characteristics of the leaf litter, we obtained information on those factors that determine food quality, 3. The studied species responded similarly to different leaf litter species in that both P. scaber and O. asellus performed better on litter with low C:N ratio. Overall, both isopod species reproduced more successfully on litter with higher Ph levels, containing half the levels of tannins and other phenolics. 4. Interspecific differences were obvious with respect to the significance of litter-colonizing microbiota, and the dependence of juveniles on particular food parameters. While the performance of adult P. scaber was influenced by both litter-colonizing microbiota and physico-chemical characteristics of the leaf litter, adult O. asellus were influenced by leaf litter characteristics, but not by litter-colonizing microbiota. Juvenile mortality was affected by the tested food parameters in O. asellus, but not in P. scaber.

Python growth rates exhibited considerable variation among individuals. Growth rates of siblings were not correlated, suggesting that environmental rather than genetic factors cause this wide variation. 3. The availability of prey varied considerably among years, due to annual variation in rainfall patterns. Pythons grew more rapidly in years with high rat abundance than in years when rats were scarce. Also, python cohorts that hatched in years when prey were abundant exhibited faster growth rates than those that hatched when prey were scarce. 4. The snakes showed strong ontogenetic consistency in relative growth rates: That is, an individual with faster-than-average growth in its first year of life continued to grow rapidly throughout the study period. Thus, these pythons displayed a strong 'silver spoon' effect, whereby favourable conditions (high prey abundance) in the first year of life exerted a long-term effect on growth trajectories and thus, adult body sizes. This effect was strongest in the faster-growing sex (females). 5.

Traditional explanations for interspecific variation in home range size are based almost exclusively on analysis of northern hemisphere eutherian mammals. These suggest that variation in body size is the most important factor, while climate and diet are less important. The generality of these explanations is tested using a novel database on macropod marsupials (kangaroos and allies). 2. We found a 490-fold difference in home range size and a 50-fold difference in body weight amongst macropods. In agreement with studies on eutherians, female home range size was strongly correlated with body weight. 3. However, unlike the pattern in eutherians, climate was more strongly associated with home range size than was body weight: annual rainfall explained more than half of the variation, while group size (6%) and population density (8%) were minor explanatory variables, and female body weight explained no further variation. 4. When we used a phylogeny-based comparative method, annual rainfall explained 32% of the variation and body size a further 16%. 5. Sex differences in home range size were not explained by body size dimorphism, but were strongly related to rainfall and less strongly related to the degree of female home range overlap. Species with large sex differences in home range size lived in high-rainfall habitats where female ranges were small. 6. We suggest that climate has been a key factor in social evolution of macropods. In species inhabiting productive habitats, small female home ranges allow males to overlap with more females by increasing home range size. Males often compete for females by searching widely. In less productive habitats, males cannot further increase or defend their already large home ranges, resulting in similar-sized ranges in both sexes. Where female home range overlap is high, males need not increase home ranges as much, but this effect is secondary to that of climate. 7. In agreement with the theory that competitive searching by males is not necessarily related to body size, species with extreme size dimorphism had no sex difference in home range size, and species with extreme home range differences between the sexes showed no particular pattern of dimorphism. 8.

After this the relative variance in population growth increased to 0.00575 between 1981 and 1989, and increased again to 0.00848 between 1990 and 1997. 3. In the first phase of population growth (1971-80) changes in the birth rate contributed most to the variance in relative population growth (30%), then adult winter survival (23%), with calf summer and calf winter survival contributing less than 10%. Birth rate tended to covary strongly with adult winter survival, and to a lesser extent with calf winter survival. 4. The contribution of birth rate to the variance in relative population growth diminished to less than 5% in both the periods 1981-89 and 1990-97. In contrast, the contribution of adult winter survival increased to 36% in 1980s and 40% in 1990s. At the same time, the covariation of adult winter survival with calf winter survival increased successively to reach 40% in 1990-97. 5. Changes in population age structure were small and contributed little to the variance in relative population growth (≈ 1% over the entire study).

The data were analysed further with respect to individual territory size, the level at which competition is assumed to operate. Pairs in the experimental sub-area enlarged their territories. We argue that variation in territory enlargement is not caused by individual quality. 5. Both pre-manipulation territory size and territory enlargement positively affected the probability that a territorial pair nested, the growth rate of their chicks, the number of fledglings that recruited into the breeding population and the survival of the territorial adults. No effect of territory enlargement was observed on clutch size, nor on the probability that pairs started a second brood. 6. The positive effect of the experimental territory enlargement argues for a causal effect of territory size on these reproductive parameters, independent of individual quality. 7. An effect of the density reduction on fecundity may not be detectable at the population level, either due to the large variation in territory sizes within the experimental treatments or to the negative effect of the experiment per se, which counter balances the positive effect of territory enlargement.",78,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Brood size manipulation | Density dependence | Fitness | Parus major | Removal experiment,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,14,NA,NA,NA,NA

Sporadically eruptive house mouse populations provide an opportunity to test ideas about how intrinsic and extrinsic factors interact to limit rodent populations. New Zealand house mouse populations inhabiting beech forests and associated mosaics erupt when autumn beech seedfall is high. We analysed 25 years of data on mouse density and beech seedfall from a beech and podocarp/hardwood forest mosaic in New Zealand to test the effects of mouse density, beech seedfall and rat density on rates of change in mouse abundance, estimated as the rate of change in a density index for sequential seasonal transitions (r). 2. For autumn to winter and winter to spring transitions, r was related to the magnitude of autumn seedfall and mouse density at the start of each transition, regardless of whether forest types were considered separately or together. For spring to summer and summer to autumn transitions, r was related to mouse density alone. Density dependence could reflect the influence of intrinsic social factors, intraspecific competition for food, or the effects of parasites, diseases or predators. 3. We modified a conceptual model of variation in rodent reproductive effort to derive a general model of how numerical responses to density-independent increases in food availability, modified by density-dependent mechanisms and extrinsic precursors to population increase, drive sporadic eruptions in the density of some rodent populations. For house mice in New Zealand, the numerical response to seedfall was modified by some unidentified density-dependent mechanism(s) to generate sporadic eruptions. Extrinsic precursors to population increase appear to be important in other eruptive house mouse populations. 4. House mouse density in beech forest was more volatile than in podocarp/hardwood forest, maximum rates of increase and decrease being higher in the former. Density tended to be higher in podocarp/hardwood forest when overall density was low, and higher in beech forest when overall density was high. This suggests that between eruptions, mice persist in podocarp/hardwood forest at higher densities than in adjoining beech forest.",77,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Density dependence | Mice | Population eruption | Predation | Rate of increase,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,15,NA,NA,NA,NA

The distribution, ecology, and behaviour of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) is profoundly influenced by environmental stress and competition. As in plants, trade-offs in adaptations to these factors are the basis for functional classifications of ant taxa and communities at a global scale. 2. Theory predicts a trade-off between stress tolerance and competitive dominance in both plants and ants. In ants, low temperature is the thought to be stressful, so I hypothesized that there would be a positive relationship between temperature and behavioural dominance. I evaluated this relationship in a South American, Chaco ant community. 3 The activity and behaviour of ground-foraging, omnivorous ants were examined at baits in Open and closed, forested habitats during different seasons and times of day to characterize the responses of ant taxa to variation in microclimate and competitors. 4. Behaviourally dominant ants were most active at moderately high temperatures, whereas subordinate species were active at extreme temperatures, when they had virtually exclusive access to resources. 5. The patterns presented here and those observed in other studies suggest that there is a general trade-off between behavioural dominance and thermal tolerance in ants. This trade-off creates a linear relationship between temperature Use and dominance for ants up to ≈ 35°C, but extremely high temperatures may also be stessful such that the full relationship is actually unimodal.",173,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Competition | Formicidae | Functional types | Microclimate | Stress,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,16,NA,NA,NA,NA

In certain predator-prey models, enrichment of nutrients produces large amplitude population oscillations that can cause extinctions; this effect has been termed the 'paradox of enrichment'. Metapopulation models also show that despite enrichment reducing the stability of equilibria in local populations, spatially subdivided populations may show bounded fluctuations because of asynchronous local density fluctuations. 2. Effects of enrichment and subdivided habitat structure were tested using two protozoans, predatory Didinium nasutum Müller and its bacterivorous prey, Colpidium striatum Stokes. A replicated experiment compared predator-prey dynamics in low, medium and high nutrient microcosms. Microcosms consisted of subdivided arrays of nine interconnected 30mL bottles, undivided bottles of the same total volume (270 mL) and isolated 30 mL bottles. 3. Consistent with the paradox of enrichment, isolated populations produced greater mean predator densities at high nutrient concentrations than low or medium concentrations. The proportion of replicates in which predators drove prey extinct was also greater with high than with low or medium nutrient concentrations. 4. Enrichment increased prey density in all microcosm types. This is consistent with published predator-prey models where dynamics are mathematically unstable. 5. Predators and prey persisted longer in all subdivided microcosms than in undivided bottles. However, there were some unexpected changes in spatial dynamics with enrichment. For prey, direct or indirect effects of enrichment raised numbers dispersing, spatial synchrony of density fluctuations and variability in the number of patches occupied. 6. For predators in arrays, enrichment reduced the starvation rate, total numbers dispersing, and spatial synchrony. Time until recolonization of individual patches by predators was also longer in enriched microcosms, suggesting a possible decrease in the likelihood of regional persistence. A published simulation model produced qualitatively similar changes in dynamics with changes in prey and predator dispersal rate. 7. This study shows that spatial dynamics can potentially explain persistence of subdivided populations for long periods despite nutrient enrichment.

Recently, contrasting evidence of density-dependent offspring sex ratio variation in red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) has been presented. Kruuk et al. (1999) reported that the proportion of male red deer born on the island of Rum, Scotland, each year declined with increasing population density and with winter rainfall, i.e. as nutritional stress in females increased. In contrast, Post et al. (1999a) reported increasing male-biased offspring sex ratios in Hordaland, Norway, with both rising numbers of hinds and increasing values of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which they regarded an index of severe winters. 2. Compared to Post et al. (1999a), we reanalysed sex ratio variation on a greatly extended data set, including four populations of Norwegian red deer, taking into account a finer population substructure. 3. The proportion of male calves shot each autumn declined markedly as density increased in all four populations. The proportion of male calves shot each autumn increased significantly with an increasing NAO index in one of the four populations, but there was no residual effect of the NAO once the effect of snow depth (at low elevation) was controlled for (decreasingly male biased harvest with increasing snow depth). 4. At the west coast of Norway, the NAO is positively correlated with temperature and precipitation. However, since temperatures in this region often are around 0 °C during winter, the relationship between the NAO and snow depth may be difficult to predict. 5. An analysis of variation in snow depth revealed that snow depth was negatively correlated with the NAO at low altitudes (below 400m), but this relationship was reversed at high altitudes giving a positive correlation between snow depth and the NAO. We therefore suggest that a high NAO index indicates favourable winter conditions for red deer, as red deer winter at low altitude, and since recent studies show that a high index of the NAO is generally positively correlated with body weight in red deer. 6. Female red deer thus reared fewer sons as nutritional stress increased with increasing density and severity of climate in Norway, which is consistent with the birth sex ratios observed on Rum, Scotland.",146,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Cervus elaphus | Density dependence | Extrinsic modification hypothesis | North Atlantic Oscillation | Ungulates,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,18,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

This was highest at intermediate depths (10-75m) at all latitudes where there were sufficient data, but there was no statistically significant variation with depth for the overall data set (all latitudes pooled). Mean assemblage species richness showed no significant variation with latitude, although the highest individual values were generally from lower latitudes. There is thus as yet no convincing evidence for a latitudinal cline in the alpha diversity of North Atlantic bryozoans. 3. Pooling of data into bins of 10 degrees of latitude, or into biogeographic provinces, to estimate regional species richness revealed significant undersampling. Two independent techniques to correct for this undersampling revealed a latitudinal cline in the regional species richness of North Atlantic bryozoans, with a peak around 10-30°N, and a steady decrease in richness north to 80°N. 4. Two measures of beta diversity (Whittaker and Jaccard) revealed relatively high turnover, presumably related to habitat heterogeneity within regional bins or to significant environmental variation across bins. There was a tendency for beta diversity to be higher at lower latitudes, as would be expected from a combination of a latitudinal cline in regional diversity with a mean assemblage species richness invariant with latitude. Null models were used to clarify the expected relationship between the two measures of beta diversity, and these indicated a strong influence of species-abundance structure in the North Atlantic bryozoan data.",128,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Assemblage | Beta diversity | Latitude | Regional diversity | Species turnover,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,19,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, I explicitly evaluate the often-proposed trade-off between growth rate and predation risk, in a study of the temperate butterfly, Pararge aegeria (L). 3. By rearing larvae with a common genetic background in different photoperiods it was possible to experimentally manipulate larval growth rates, which vary in response to photoperiod. Predation risk was assessed by exposing larvae that were freely moving on their host plants to the predatory heteropteran, Picromerus bidens (L.). 4. The rate of predation was significantly higher in the fast-growing larvae. An approximately four times higher relative growth rate was associated with a 30% higher daily predation risk. 5. The main result demonstrates a trade-off between growth rate and predation risk, and there are reasons to believe that this trade-off is of general significance in free-living animals.

In long-lived birds with delayed recruitment, variation in prebreeding population parameters is difficult to study, although potentially important. Cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) often return to their natal colony when 1 year old, enabling direct study of first-year survival and emigration. Density-dependent regulation mechanisms may be strong at this stage of the life cycle. 2. In the Danish cormorant colony Vorso, 11 000 chicks have been colour-ringed between 1977 and 1997. Returning birds have been resighted in the colony and dead recoveries have been collected. Since 1990, the proportion of a cohort observed in the colony as 1-year-olds (return rate) has declined from 0·40 to 0·10. Possible explanations include increased mortality, increased emigration and a later age of first return to the colony. Breeding success has also declined strongly as a consequence of low food availability. 3. We used capture-recapture analysis of recovery and resighting data to investigate variation in first-year survival, emigration and resighting probabilities. Survival fluctuated widely (0·42-0·75, mean 0·58); emigration increased in the 1990s from 0·05 to 0·15; resighting probability declined from 0·75 to 0·20 after 1990. 4. First-year survival was particularly low in 1993 and 1996. The causes of the year-to-year variation were not clear. Survival may have been affected by food availability during the post-fledging period. 5. The declining return rate was caused mainly by decreasing resighting probability of 1-year-olds, although increasing emigration also contributed. The biological mechanism was that increasing numbers of cormorants did not return to the natal colony as 1-year-olds. We suggest that this was a consequence of low physiological condition among newly fledged young, caused by low food availability in the 1990s. 6. We conclude that declining food availability has had several consequences for colony dynamics.

The increasing population of cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis) in Europe since 1970 has led to conflicts with fishery interests. Control of cormorant populations is a management issue in many countries and a predictive population model is needed. However, reliable estimates of survival are lacking as input for such a model 2. Capture-recapture estimates of survival of dispersive species like cormorants suffer from an unknown bias due to permanent emigration from the study area. However, a combined analysis of resightings and recovery of dead birds allows unbiased estimates of survival and emigration. 3. We use data on 11 000 cormorants colour-ringed as chicks in the Danish colony Vorso 1977-97 to estimate adult survival and colony fidelity. Recent statistical models allowing simultaneous use of recovery and resighting data are employed. We compensate for variation in colour-ring quality, and study the effect of population size and winter severity on survival, as well as of breeding success on fidelity by including these factors as covariates in statistical models. 4. Annual adult survival fluctuated from year to year (0.74-0.95), with a mean of 0.88. A combination of population size in Europe and winter temperatures explained 52-64% of the year-to-year variation in survival. Differences in survival between sexes was less than 1%. Cormorants older than ≃ 12 years experienced lower survival, whereas second-year birds had survival similar to adults. Colony fidelity declined after 1990 from nearly 1 to ≃ 0·90, implying 10% permanent emigration per year. This change coincided with a decline in food availability. 5. Apparently, survival was more severely affected by winter severity when population size was high. This could be caused by saturation of high-quality wintering habitat, forcing some birds to winter in less good habitat where they would be more vulnerable to cold winters. There was thus evidence for density dependence in adult survival, at least in cold winters. 6.

A two-host shared-macroparasite model was parameterized from the results of infection and transmission experiments, to investigate whether apparent competition between the ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) and the grey partridge (Perdix perdix), mediated via the shared nematode Heterakis gallinarum, could theoretically cause partridge exclusion. 2. Both the model created and the experiments conducted show that the bulk of H. gallinarum infection to partridges, when they occur in the same locations as pheasants, will be from the pheasants and not from the partridges themselves. This is due to R 0 for the parasite being 1.23 when infecting pheasants, but only 0.0057 when infecting partridges. Thus, when the pheasant is present in the model the partridge population is impacted by the shared parasite but, when the pheasant is absent, the parasite is lost from the system. 3. Based on best available parameter estimates, the observed impact of H. galli-nature on the grey partridge may be sufficient to cause exclusion when the pheasant is present in the model. This supports the hypothesis that the UK grey partridge decline observed over the past 50 years may be partly due to apparent competition with pheasants. 4. Habitat separation between the two host species, where it decreases the rate of H. gallinarum transmission from the pheasant to the partridge, may allow them to co-exist in the field in the presence of the parasite.

Studies of sex allocation in birds have traditionally centred on Fisher's (1930) theory of equal parental investment in male and female offspring. They concentrate particularly on sexually dimorphic species, where costs of rearing offspring are assumed to vary between male and female young because of body size differences. 2. Higher mortality of the larger sex (males), particularly in poorer conditions, is expected to result in female-biased sex ratios in the great tit, Parus major. Several studies have found the contrary, reporting male-biased fledging and recruiting sex ratios when conditions are poor. One reason why this may be the case is that males can gain more food resources than their sisters because of the competitive advantage afforded by their larger size. They may thus suffer less mortality in the nest or fledge in better condition, thereby enhancing their survival prospects. 3. This study investigates the importance of size in competitive interactions between nestlings of different sexes. A cross-fostering design was employed to create broods of mixed size through swapping half a brood of 2-day-old 'small' and half a brood of 4-day-old 'large' nestlings. Nestling morphometrics and mortality were measured during the nestling period. Nestlings were sexed by PCR amplification of sex-linked genes. To test for a male advantage in competitive environments, size and mortality measures were compared between 'small' males and females, and 'large' males and females (i.e. the interaction term 'size treatment' and 'sex'). 4. There was greater sexual dimorphism between small nestlings than large nestlings at fledging. This is interpreted as revealing enhanced competitive ability of male offspring under stressful conditions. Offspring from the 'large' group suffered lower mortality, but there was no difference in mortality according to sex, and no significant size*sex interaction. Similarly, no difference in recruitment was found, although this may be due to the small overall proportion of birds recruiting (3.1%). 5. The study suggests that male biased fledging/recruitment sex ratios in great tits may be explained by enhanced competitive ability of male nestlings in poor rearing environments.",136,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Asynchrony | Sex allocation | Sex-specific growth | Sexual size dimorphism | Sibling competition,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,27,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We use quantitative linkage webs to investigate the impact of alien gall wasps on community structure. Britain has been invaded by four alien species of cynipid gallwasp, Andricus corruptrix, A. lignicola, A. kollari and A. quercuscalicis, over the last 150 years. To date, Britain can be divided into four zones from the north to the south with one, two, three and four invading species established in each zone. 2. The four species are naturalized in their new ranges and are locally the most abundant cynipid species, especially in their spring (sexual) generations. Like the native cynipid species they showed dramatic changes (up to three orders of magnitude) in density between generations, and the dominance structure of alien and native host species changed radically from generation to generation. 3. All four invading cynipid species were attacked by native parasitoid species. Using quantified linkage webs, we assess the contribution made by individual host gall species to each parasitoids population size. Although the parasitoid species have been described as broadly polyphagous, suggesting that the aliens should be richly linked with the native cynipid communities, we found that the galls of the invading species have become the main, and in a few cases the sole, contributors to local parasitoid populations, indicating major host shifts by the parasitoid species. 4. Within generations we found very little overlap among the parasitoid and inquiline communities associated with native and alien galls within generations. Similarly, the quantification of indirect interactions among cynipids between generations suggests that parasitoids and inquilines are not main factors in the dynamics of local cynipid communities. The recruitment of parasitoids and inquilines by the invading cynipid species is therefore unlikely to have a strong affect on native cynipid species.",49,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Absolute densities | Community dynamics | Cynipid gallwasps | Invasion,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,28,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Fauna in stable gravel, mud and biogenic habitats are more adversely affected than those in less consolidated coarse sediments. 3. Recovery rate appears most rapid in these less physically stable habitats, which are generally inhabited by more opportunistic species. However, defined areas that are fished in excess of three times per year (as occurs in parts of the North Sea and Georges Bank) are likely to be maintained in a permanently altered state. 4.

In co-operatively breeding birds and mammals that live in family groups, helpers may gain indirect fitness benefits by increasing the number of breeding attempts in a season, by increasing the success of each nesting attempt, and by increasing the survivorship of related breeders. 2. The effects of helpers were examined in an analysis of reproductive success in the laughing kookaburra (Dacelo novaeguineae), where a monogamously breeding pair is assisted by offspring of both sexes. 3. Helpers could not increase the number of attempts in a season, because kookaburras are single-brooded. 4. in a paired analysis controlling for pair and territory quality, increases in group size were not matched by increases in the number or weight of fledglings in each breeding attempt, even though brood reduction was the major source of productivity loss. This concurs with previous results showing that group size does not affect overall provisioning levels to broods, because all group members reduced their provisioning effort as group size increased. 5. Because kookaburras prefer to reduce workloads during breeding rather than raise larger broods, the costs of caring for young must be high. Thus breeders with helpers may enjoy energetic savings and enhanced survivorship. 6. Helpers had different effects on nest success depending on their sex. Whereas male helpers had a neutral effect on fledgling success and fledgling weight, additional female helpers reduced fledgling success. Females are relatively poor helpers, and other group members may not properly compensate for the female's 'inadequate' help. 7. High-quality kookaburra pairs, or pairs on good territories, were more likely to be in larger groups because they produced more potential recruits for their groups than relatively 'poor' performers. This was demonstrated by comparing the results of the paired comparisons with those of a correlational analysis that showed that in groups of two to six birds, group size was positively correlated with fledgling success and fledgling weight (which affects the probability of juvenile survival). 8.

One interaction that occurs in treehole habitats involves leaf shredders that facilitate growth of detritivores, and it may be affected by both leaf litter quantity and changes in water quality. 2.

Experimental microcosms that mimic treehole habitats were used to test the hypothesis that this abiotic factor, pH, also affects facilitative interactions. Leaf litter resources and pH were varied independently of presence of leaf-shredding scirtid beetles (Helodes pulchella and Prionocyphon discoideus), and the mosquito Aedes triseriatus, to examine interactions among pH, resources and insects. 3. pH affected the interaction between the insects, such that effects of scirtids were more evident at pH 4-5 than at 6.5. Female mosquitoes were larger in the presence of scirtids, low resource and low pH conditions than in absence of scirtids, low resource and low pH conditions. 4.

Winter diversity is predicted more precisely from environmental factors than summer diversity. 6.

Maternal care is a major component of demographic tactics in mammals. In ungulates most work has been done on capital breeders (e.g. bighorn sheep), which rely heavily on body reserves to raise their young. Roe deer, in contrast, are close to the income breeder end of the capital-income breeder continuum, and show high levels of maternal care. 2. The aim of this study was to explore the factors determining the level of maternal care in roe deer, in particular the effects of maternal body weight, mother's parity, litter size and year of birth on the amount of prenatal care (i.e. the average mass of an offspring multiplied by the number of offspring) and postnatal care (i.e. the average growth rate of the offspring multiplied by their number). The study was carried out on a captive population of roe deer fed ad libitum, and in a wild population. 3. In both populations prenatal care increased with increasing maternal body weight. In the population fed ad libitum this effect was found in light females only (< 22 kg); in the wild population the positive relationship between maternal body weight and prenatal care was entirely accounted for by variation in litter size (i.e. heaviest females produced larger litters) and density (i.e. females were lightest in years with high population density). Parity did not affect prenatal care. 4. In 14 females fed ad libitum there was no relationship between postnatal care and maternal body weight. Multiparous females had higher levels of postnatal care. In contrast, 20 wild females showed a positive relationship between postnatal care and maternal body weight, and only litter size affected the level of postnatal care. 5. Even after accounting for the confounding effects of maternal body weight, parity. litter size and population density, we found no trade-off between pre- and post-natal care in any of the two populations.

Variances associated with density estimates can lead to positive bias in estimation of growth rates when populations are distributed in ephemeral patches.

Cross-fostering experiments have shown that egg mass per se positively affects post-hatching growth and development in passerine birds. In most studies, however, the initial influence of egg mass was not sustained, leading to questions about the importance of egg mass relative to the cumulative effects of environmental factors during the period of post-hatching care. 2. In house wrens, Troglodytes aedon Vieillot, evidence from cross-fostering experiments suggests that food availability mitigates the influence of egg mass on post-hatching growth: early in the season, when food was putatively abundant, the initial effect of egg mass was lost as nestlings aged; however, later, when food was putatively scarcer, the effect of egg mass persisted until nestlings left the nest. 3. We tested the hypothesis that abundant food for provisioning nestlings can decouple the relationship between fitness-related traits of nestlings and the mass of the eggs from which they hatch ('egg-mass override hypothesis') by providing daily mealworm supplements to broods of house wrens. 4. The food supplements did not increase final nestling mass, final nestling tarsus length, growth rate, or survival until nest-leaving in late-season broods, when the hypothesis of food limitation predicts that there should be such an effect. Instead, the food supplements significantly, but only slightly, increased final nestling mass in early-season broods, when food is putatively abundant. 5. The effect of the food supplements on final nestling mass was independent of egg mass.

A large group of parasites, including many of the larval pathogens of insects, cause an infection from which infectious hosts are unable to recover. In addition, a proportion of those individuals that do not develop the lethal disease on exposure to the parasite may still be harmed by it. 2. We examined the role of these sublethal effects on host-population dynamics. Specifically we considered the case where there are three distinct classes of individuals: (i) susceptibles; (ii) infected and infectious individuals that will not reproduce and cannot recover; and (iii) sublethally infected individuals. 3. Parasites with sublethal effects are less likely to persist and control their host population. This is a consequence of the sublethally infected individuals not being infective. Less intuitively, the sublethal infection is highly destabilizing, increasing the risk of cyclic behaviour in host-parasite population densities. 4. Because sublethal infection acts as a destabilizing force in these host-parasite interactions, parasites with pronounced sublethal effects may be less effective as classical biological control agents.",32,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Biological control | Cycles | Disease | Insect pathogens | Parasites,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,44,NA,NA,NA,NA

An explicitly spatial sampling approach was employed to test the null hypothesis that the predation on slugs by the carabid beetle Pterostichus melanarius (Illiger) was opportunistic. 2. The beetles and slugs were sampled across a nested series of grids of sampling points, in a field of winter wheat during June and July 1997. 3. The spatial distribution of all slugs in June was found to change with the scale of the sampling grid, from random on the 0.25 m scale, through aggregation at 1 m, to random at 4 m. At the highest scale of 16 m, the slugs were significantly spatially aggregated. 4. The distribution of beetles in June was also spatially dynamic, with randomness observed at the 4 m and 8 m scales. At 16 m, significant aggregation was observed. 5. The dynamic distributions of slugs and beetles, at 16 m, were found not to be associated with, and thus were not determined by, soil or crop factors. 6. Comparison of slug and beetle populations showed, however, that the distributions at 16 m were dynamically associated with each other. In June where there were many slugs there were also many carabids, whilst in July where there were many carabids there were few slugs. 7. Approximately 11% of the beetles sampled across the 16 m grid in June and July were found to have ingested slug protein, following intensive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing. 8. The spatial distribution of these slug-positive beetles was significantly associated with the distribution of the larger slug classes, over 25 mg. Where there were many large slugs in June there were many slug-positive beetles. Conversely, in July few large slugs were found where there were many slug-positive beetles. 9. Parametric analysis revealed that these changes in the large slug class, at each sampling point between June and July (growth), were negatively related to the local numbers of slug-positive beetles, and that growth declined as the local numbers of beetles increased. 10. These findings suggest that predation was not opportunistic, but direct and dynamic, falsifying the null hypothesis. Moreover, this predation elicited significant changes in the spatial distribution and local density of the slugs, in a manner that may be termed spatially density dependent.",176,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,ELISA | Pterostichus melanarius | SADIE | Spatial density dependence | Spatial sampling,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,45,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Many studies have provided evidence that first-time breeders have a lower survival, a lower probability of success, or of breeding, in the following year. Hypotheses based on reproductive costs have often been proposed to explain this. However, because of the intrinsic relationship between age and experience, the apparent inferiority of first-time breeders at the population level may result from selection, and experience may not influence performance within each individual. In this paper we address the question of phenotypic correlations between fitness components. This addresses differences in individual quality, a prerequisite for a selection process to occur. We also test the hypothesis of an influence of experience on these components while taking age and reproductive success into account: two factors likely to play a key role in a selection process. 2. Using data from a long-term study on the kittiwake, we found that first-time breeders have a lower probability of success, a lower survival and a lower probability of breeding in the next year than experienced breeders. However, neither experienced nor inexperienced breeders have a lower survival or a lower probability of breeding in the following year than birds that skipped a breeding opportunity. This suggests heterogeneity in quality among individuals. 3. Failed birds have a lower survival and a lower probability of breeding in the following year regardless of experience. This can be interpreted in the light of the selection hypothesis. The inferiority of inexperienced breeders may be linked to a higher proportion of lower-quality individuals in younger age classes. When age and breeding success are controlled for, there is no evidence of an influence of experience on survival or future breeding probability. 4. Using data from individuals whose reproductive life lasted the same number of years, we investigated the influence of experience on reproductive performance within individuals. There is no strong evidence that a process operating within individuals explains the improvement in performance observed at the population level.",134,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Age | Capture-recapture | Experience | Fitness components | Selection hypothesis,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,46,NA,NA,NA,NA

Omnivory, where an animal crosses trophic boundaries, is thought to be common in natural and managed communities. Foraging theory predicts that omnivores will balance their diet as a result of nutritional needs, food quality and availability of alternate foods. We investigated diet selection of the western flower thrips [Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande)], a herbivore under some circumstances, and a predator under other circumstances. 2. We demonstrate that induced plant resistance can indirectly affect diet selection by thrips. The density of herbivorous spider mites is reduced on induced plants compared to controls and is also positively correlated with the number of mite eggs that the thrips consume. 3. In choice tests, mite eggs from induced plants were less preferred by thrips than eggs from control plants. Mite egg size was also smaller on induced plants compared to controls. However, this alone did not explain the diet selection by thrips. In a field experiment, thrips avoided colonizing induced plants, but they were attracted to induced plants that we inoculated with mites. Thus, the presence of herbivorous prey on induced plants attenuated the negative effects of induced resistance on thrips colonization. 4. Feeding decisions of thrips can be influenced by several factors. We showed previously (Agrawal, Kobayashi and Thaler 1999a) Influence of prey availability and induced host plant resistance on omnivory by western flower thrips. (Ecology, 80, 518-523.) that reducing plant quality can cause omnivores to shift towards relatively more predation than herbivory. We show now that on induced plants, reduced prey density and quality may antagonize this shift towards increased predation. 5. Induced plant resistance has negative effects on both the plant-based food resource (direct effect) and the animal-based food resource (indirect effect) of omnivorous thrips. Thus, variation in the quantity and quality of food items interact to determine the diet selection of omnivores.",68,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Herbivory | Induced plant resistance | Omnivory | Optimal diet selection | Tritrophic interactions,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,47,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We consider the movement of carabid beetles in a fragmented woodland landscape. Landscape ecology has lacked a formal framework for the analysis of dynamics of this kind, and stochastic spatial simulations have generally been needed to gain insight. 2. We first define an individual-based stochastic model for movement in a heterogeneous landscape. From this a deterministic approximation is derived which describes the build-up in association of the beetles with their environment; the deterministic model makes use of a second-order spatial moment. It is shown that the results of the deterministic approximation match closely those of the underlying stochastic process. On this basis we suggest that the dynamical system provides a formal framework for the dynamics of animal movements in ecological landscapes. 3. The results show that the beetles, starting from an initial random layout, rapidly become associated with the woodlands and, by the time 100 days have elapsed, the association is close to its asymptotic state. The strength of the association depends very much on the spatial auto-covariance function of the environment. 4. A number of extensions are suggested, including landscapes comprising multiple habitats of different degrees of suitability, landscapes that change through human activity, birth and death processes of single species, and interactions between species.

Many songbird species are absent from small forest fragments. One possible explanation for this finding is that populations in small fragments decline to extinction because reproductive success is too low to compensate for adult mortality (λ < 1). I tested this hypothesis from 1995 to 1997 by measuring reproductive success, adult survival, and population viability for four banded populations of the Eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis, White), an area-sensitive songbird. The populations inhabited two small (55 ha, termed S1, S2) and two large (500-1000 ha, termed L1, L2) forest fragments set within an agricultural landscape. 2. Females produced more fledglings but a similar number of independent young per capita in the small compared to the large fragments. Local female survival did not vary with fragment size. 3. Population models were used to calculate the finite rate of increase (λ) from the number of young produced (female yearlings per female per year) and adult female survival rates. Combining data from all four populations, λ = 0.96, indicating that robins produced 4% fewer female young per year than were needed to compensate for adult losses. Combining data from the two small fragments, λ = 1.02, suggesting that populations in small fragments were viable on average. In contrast, λ = 0.85 for the two large fragments combined, indicating that, on average, 15% fewer young were produced than were needed to replace missing adults each year. Averaging across fragments within the same size class masked the variability in population dynamics that existed between the replicates. Considering each of the four fragments separately, there was one potential demographic source (S2, λ = 1.12; L2, λ = 1.23) and one demographic sink (S1, λ = 0.90; L1, λ = 0.46) within each of the fragment size categories. 4. Observed changes in population sizes were similar to those predicted by the population models. Combining all populations, recruitment replaced most but not all missing females, and the observed population size declined by 8% per year. In both the small and large fragments, observed recruitment was insufficient to replace missing females and population sizes declined 5% and 8% per year, respectively. Within each of the fragment size categories, there was one stable population (S2 and L2) and one population that declined in size (S1 and L1, respectively, declined by 14% and 20% per year). 5. Reproductive success, adult survival, and population viability did not vary with fragment size. To explain area-sensitivity, I suggest that a threshold in fragment size exists below which populations are never viable, but above which populations may or may not be viable depending on factors unrelated to fragment size, such as nest predation rates.",63,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Area-sensitivity | Eastern yellow robins | Forest fragmentation | Passerines | Source-sink demography,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,49,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Individual variation in the intake rate of foraging animals arises largely from variation in two characteristics: their intrinsic ability to forage in the absence of competitors (foraging efficiency) and the detrimental effect of competitors on their intake rate (susceptibility to interference). We use a model to explore the relative importance of foraging efficiency and dominance, which influences susceptibility to interference, in determining the intake rate of foraging animals at a range of competitor densities. 2. The model is parameterized and tested for a shorebird-prey system, oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus L. feeding on mussels Mytilus edulis L., in which interference occurs because dominant individuals steal prey from subdominant ones. In both oystercatchers which open mussels by stabbing their bill between the shell valves (stabbers) and those which hammer a hole through the shell (hammerers), foraging efficiency is predicted to be the major determinant of intake rate at competitor densities below 100-150 birds ha-1 and dominance the major determinant at higher densities. In reality, a very similar relationship is found in stabbers, but in hammerers foraging efficiency remains the most important determinant of intake rate across the full range of observed competitor densities, in contrast to the model's prediction. Oystercatchers typically forage at densities in the range 100-250 birds ha-1, in the region in which foraging efficiency and dominance are of approximately equal importance to stabbers, while foraging efficiency is most important to hammerers. We suggest reasons for the difference in the model's predictive power for stabbers and hammerers. 3. We use the model to make the general predictions that the relative importance of foraging efficiency is higher when (i) it varies more between individuals, (ii) prey encounter rate is high, (iii) handling time is short, (iv) prey stealing (kleptoparasitic) attacks occur over short distances, (v) the probability of stealing prey is low, and (vi) movement speed while foraging is low. In the oystercatcher-mussel system, prey encounter rate is lower and handling time longer than in most other shore-bird-prey systems. This suggests that the importance of foraging efficiency in determining intake rate is likely to be greater in many other shorebirds. 4. Most studies of between individual variation in intake rate have focused on the importance of dominance rather than variation in foraging efficiency. Both the model predictions and field data suggest that variation in foraging efficiency may be a more important source of variation in intake rate than its previous depth of study would suggest.",35,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Competitive ability | Interference | Kleptoparasitism | Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus | Shorebirds,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,50,NA,NA,NA,NA

A trend towards increasing average spring temperatures has been observed in Europe over the past 25 years. This climatic variation has been attributed to a natural, large-scale atmospheric phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). A number of studies have reported associations between the winter NAO-index and both breeding phenology and cohort-specific morphology. These studies have been cross-sectional rather than longitudinal and therefore have not been able to determine whether the changes result from phenotypic plasticity or microevolutionary processes. 2. We analysed (i) cross-sectional correlations between the winter NAO-index and breeding performance (laying date, clutch size, fledging success and number of recruits produced) and morphological traits (tarsus and wing length), and (ii) within-individual variation in the same traits for individuals experiencing different values of the NAO-index in a population of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) breeding on Gotland, Sweden, over a period of 16 years (1980-95). 3. None of the four measures of breeding performance changed consistently over the study period, while tarsus length of males (and marginally females) decreased over time. Of the six traits investigated using cross-sectional data, only laying date was related to variation in the NAO-index. 4. All characters investigated showed significant repeatability within individuals among years, revealing the importance of factors specific to individuals in determining their value. However, within individuals the NAO-index significantly affected laying date and clutch size such that females laid earlier and produced larger clutches after warmer, moister winters. 5. Our data show a high degree of concordance between cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of the effect of NAO on laying date and clutch size. The similarity of responses across and within individuals suggests that the population-level response to the NAO-index can be explained entirely as the result of phenotypic plasticity.",211,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Ficedula albicollis | Morphology | NAO-index | Phenotypic plasticity | Timing of breeding,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,51,NA,NA,NA,NA

We assessed the impact of predation by hen harriers and peregrine falcons on a red grouse population in southern Scotland during 1992-98.

Winter losses of grouse between October and April averaged 33% and were density-dependent. Raptors were the cause of about 70% of winter mortality and they killed about 30% of the grouse present in October. We were unable to determine whether winter mortality in raptors was additive to other losses. 3. Summer losses of adult grouse between April and July averaged 30% and were density-dependent. Raptors were the cause of more than 90% of the early summer mortality of adult grouse. Summer losses of grouse chicks between May and July averaged 45% and were not density-dependent. Harriers killed about 28% of grouse chicks by late July and about 37% by the end of August. Summer raptor predation on adult grouse and chicks appeared to be largely additive to other losses and we estimated that it reduced autumn grouse densities by about 50%. 4.

Even though feeding conditions typically improve over time during the laying period, clutch size decreases over the course of the nesting period in most bird species. We examined whether seasonal decrease in offspring value could explain the seasonal decline in clutch size in arctic-nesting greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens atlanticus L.). 2. Nesting was synchronized within a year, with more than 90% of the nests being initiated within about 8 days. Despite this high synchrony, there was a steep seasonal decline in clutch size in each of the 7 years of the study, from about five eggs in early clutches to three in late ones (-0.20 egg day-1). 3. Late parents performed more poorly than early parents in most components of reproductive success. The relationship between laying date and nesting success was curvilinear, early and late nests having a higher failure rate than those initiated near the median. Prefledging survival decreased by about 50% over the season, although the earliest hatched goslings also tended to have a reduced survival. The postfledging survival showed the strongest seasonal decline, as survival probability of late-hatched birds was about five times lower than in early-hatched ones. 4. Overall reproductive success showed a very steep seasonal decline as the number of young surviving to the first winter was about eight times lower in late-nesting birds than in early-nesting ones. Reproductive success declined slightly in the earliest-nesting birds, suggesting a cost to nesting too early. 5. The observed clutch size generally matched the clutch size that yielded the highest reproductive success for each laying date, except in earliest-nesting birds which should have done better by slightly delaying nesting. Our data suggest that trading off additional eggs for earlier nesting to increase reproductive success is an option in geese. Consequently, the seasonal decline in clutch size may be an adaptive response to seasonally declining survival prospects of offspring.",116,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Clutch size | Individual optimization | Laying date | Reproductive success | Seasonal decline,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,54,NA,NA,NA,NA

A field experiment was carried out to determine whether the accumulation of stream invertebrates in refugium patches during high flow disturbances was influenced by the geometric scaling of the patches, i.e. edge to size relationships. 2. Flow was reduced experimentally by creating artificial flow refugia and comparing invertebrate colonization of refugium and control patches. There were eight sizes of colonization cage (1.5 cm mesh) with surface area/volume quotients (SA/V) which ranged from 1.2 to 0.5. Control cages were open to the flow; artificial refugia were baffled upstream by 0.3 cm mesh to reduce flow. Four, week-long experimental trials were carried out during the winter months in an upland Scottish stream. On two occasions, discharge was high, on two it was low. 3. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that stream invertebrates accumulate in refugia during high flow disturbances. The density of colonists was higher in refugia than control cages after high discharge for some taxa. There was no difference between treatments for any taxon at low discharge. 4. The shape of soft-edged microhabitat patches appears to be important in mediating the impact of disturbance in streams. Small refugium patches (high edge to size ratio) appeared to be more efficacious than large patches for taxa that accumulate in refugia during disturbances. Density increased with SA/V in all trials and for all taxa, but the slopes of the lines relating density to SA/V differed between control and refugium patches after disturbance for some taxa. 5.

Annual prevalence of infection based on positive serological and bacterial tests varies between 10.3% and 17.7% of the population. 3. Infection was aggregated in social groups in the west of the study area, confirming the findings of previous studies. However, temporal trends in disease were not synchronized amongst neighbouring groups, suggesting low rates of disease transfer between them. 4. There was significant serial correlation in the disease status within groups over time, suggesting that infection persists for many years in some social groups. The presence of infectious adult female badgers in groups was associated with new infections, and provides further evidence for their importance in the maintenance of infection within groups. However, no statistically significant correlations were detected between the demographic characteristics of social groups and group infection status. 5. The distribution of disease reflects stable persistent loci of infection in the badger population, with limited evidence of transfer between social groups. The accurate identification of stable foci of infection would allow a range of management strategies for the control of bovine TB to be efficiently targeted in such populations. However, the extent to which this pattern of infection is representative of low-density and disturbed badger populations is unknown.",151,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Disease dynamics | Foci of infection | Host social organization | Transmission,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,56,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Bottom fishing using towed nets and dredges is one of the most widespread sources of physical disturbance to the continental shelf seas throughout the world. Previous studies suggest that degradation and ecosystem changes have occurred in intensively fished areas. Nevertheless, to date it has been difficult to attribute habitat and benthic community changes to fishing effort at a spatial scale that is truly representative of commercial fishing activities. 2. In this study we present convincing evidence that chronic bottom-fishing disturbance has caused significant and widespread changes in the structure of two distinct soft-sediment benthic assemblages and habitats. 3. Our study compared the benthic fauna found in areas that have been exposed to either high or low levels of bottom-fishing disturbance over the past 10 years. We were able to validate the fishing effort data in some areas using scars in the shells of a long-lived bivalve mollusc (Glycymeris glycymeris) which result from fishing disturbance. Shell scars occurred most frequently in bivalves collected from the area of highest fishing effort. 4. Multivariate analyses and the response of abundance/biomass curves indicated that chronic fishing has caused a shift from communities dominated by relatively sessile, emergent, high biomass species to communities dominated by infaunal, smaller-bodied fauna. Removal of emergent fauna has thus degraded the topographic complexity of seabed habitats in areas of high fishing effort. The communities within these areas currently may be in an alternative stable state.",210,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Abundance/biomass curves | Bivalves | Chronic fishing disturbance | Seabed | Shell scarring,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,57,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We hypothesized that plasma corticosterone was the proximate mechanism by which condition and dispersal are linked, and tested this by manipulating the level of circulating corticosterone in pregnant females of the common lizard. 3. After parturition, we measured juvenile attractiveness towards the mother and juvenile dispersal of corticosterone (B) and placebo (P) implanted females. 4. Offspring of B females did disperse in lower number than those of P females. B offspring were also more attracted by the mother's odour than P offspring. 5. In quite a few cases, the behavioural response of juveniles was dependent on the interaction between the hormonal treatment and the mother snout-vent length or condition (body weight corrected for snout-vent length). 6.

The following three hypotheses explaining why spruce bud moth (Zeiraphera canadensis Mut. and Free.) populations decline at crown closure were evaluated: (i) first-instar larval mortality increases as a result of asynchrony between budburst and egg hatch (phenology hypothesis); (ii) larval mortality increases and fecundity of females decreases due to decreased nutritional quality of shaded foliage (nutrition hypothesis); and (iii) egg densities decrease because females lay fewer eggs in closed stands (oviposition preference hypothesis). 2. Field experiments and surveys supported the phenology and oviposition preference hypotheses but not the nutrition hypothesis. 3. Increases in the degree of asynchrony between the time of egg hatch and budburst following increased shading of tree crowns resulted in high mortality of first instars in closed stands. 4. In closed stands budburst was delayed because snow cover reduced soil and root temperatures when air temperatures were above the minimum threshold for egg development. Consequently, many eggs (which are located in the crown) hatched before buds burst. 5. Decreases in larval survival following crown closure were not attributable to changes in the nutritional quality of shaded foliage for larval development and did not influence adult sex ratios in 2 of 3 years. 6. Females that developed on closed or open trees were of similar size, indicating that declines in population density following crown closure were not due to reduced fecundity. 7. When trees in a closed stand were opened by removing nearby trees, they were subjected to higher levels of herbivory. Egg hatch was more closely synchronized with budburst on opened than on closed trees. 8. We conclude that declines in bud moth populations following crown closure are caused by increased first-instar larval mortality, resulting from temporal asynchrony between budburst and egg hatch, and reduced oviposition caused by female preference for open trees.",23,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Asynchrony | Budburst | Crown closure | Female oviposition behaviour | Larval survivorship,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,59,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Previous work has suggested that species diversity in resource-limited insect communities on patchy resources is maintained by spatial aggregation, not by resource partitioning. The most comprehensive test of this claim to date was by Shorrocks and Sevenster (1995), but some of their datasets only a few resource types, which reduces the likelihood of finding a strong effect of resource partitioning. Also, methods of analysis have since been refined, e.g. to account for patch size. 2. We collected 733 mushroom samples belonging to 66 taxa a Dutch woodland area. From these mushrooms, 38,891 insects were reared, belonging to 60 taxa of Diptera and Hymenoptera. Drosophilid species and their parasitoids were identified to the species level; other taxa to the family level. We argue that the community is resource limited. 3. Generally, the insects have fairly narrow diets, including only a few of the available mushroom species. The degree of niche overlap varies widely in this community. 4. Within single resource types, co-existence can be explained by intra-specific aggregation over patches alone, in accordance with previous studies. 5. This conclusion remains unchanged for the mycophagous community as a whole: intra-specific aggregation of competitors is a sufficient and necessary mechanism for co-existence in this diverse community, while resource partitioning does not contribute detectably to species diversity. This is the first time that this pattern has been demonstrated in a dataset involving such a large number of resource types. 6. Our conclusions are strongly supported by data manipulations in which we removed or intensified the effect of resource partitioning and spatial aggregation. 7. We argue that this community may be close to saturation, but we emphasize that saturation is a gradual phenomenon in patchy systems. 8.

The aridity food-distribution hypothesis (AFDH) maintains that ecological constraints and foraging risks in arid environments curtail dispersal and promote the evolution of cooperatively foraging social groups within African mole-rat populations. To assess the influence of habitat constraints upon mole-rat social behaviour and hence the validity of the AFDH, we investigated the differential patterns of dispersal and philopatry in two populations of the common mole-rat, Cryptomys hottentotus hottentotus Lesson, one from a more 'optimal' habitat (mesic) and another from a 'suboptimal' habitat (arid). 2. Rates of immigration and emigration were markedly lower in the arid relative to the mesic site, reflecting divergence in the ecological constraints upon dispersal. 3. The rates of dispersal at both sites increased as a function of group size. However, for any given group size, colony attrition was significantly greater at the mesic site than at the arid site, probably reflecting the relaxation of constraints upon dispersal in mesic areas. 4. There was no sex bias in dispersal at either study site. 5. At the mesic sites dispersing and nondispersing individuals were of comparable mass, whilst at the arid site there was a trend for dispersing animals to be heavier than their nondispersing counterparts. 6. This investigation revealed marked differences between the study populations in the nature of dispersal. This reflects adaptive variation in social behaviour between the regions, and the results suggest that delayed dispersal and cooperation may be more crucial to individual survival in arid than in mesic areas. As such, these findings provide support for the underlying contention of the AFDH that ecological constraints on successful dispersal and colony formation in arid areas have promoted a greater degree of social cohesion in mole-rats occurring in these regions, ultimately advancing the evolution of group-living and cooperative foraging in the Bathyergidae.",84,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Aridity food-distribution hypothesis | Bathyergidae | Cooperative foraging | Ecological constraints,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,62,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many animals choose to breed in sites where they have previously been successful. Such fidelity could arise from the predictability of high quality breeding sites in a temporally stable environment. The quality of a site may be indicated by factors other than an individual's own success, because it may fail as a result of a random event that is unrelated to the intrinsic quality of the site. In particular, prior experience (familiarity) with the breeding area and the performance of neighbours could give complementary information about the quality of the site. 2. We present results from a long-term study of colonial great cormorants (Phalacrocorax carbo sinensis), where movement and reproductive success of individually marked birds within a colony was known. 3. Individuals were more likely to return to the same breeding site if they had been successful the previous season. 4. Fidelity of both males and females increased with increasing level of familiarity with the breeding area. Males were more likely to breed again in the same area, and their fidelity was more dependent on familiarity with the area than female fidelity. 5. The success of breeding sites within the colony was spatially autocorrelated, and cueing on neighbour performance should thus be advantageous. Female fidelity increased with increasing success of neighbouring birds, while male fidelity was unaffected by neighbour success. 6. We suggest that the difference between the sexes in the criteria determining fidelity arises because it is mainly the males that are involved in territorial disputes. They may therefore benefit more than females from knowing their neighbours, and this could override the importance of the intrinsic quality of the breeding area (i.e reproductive success of neighbours). 7.

The harlequin bug, a herbivore on bladderpod, is attacked by two specialist egg parasitoids Trissolcus murgantiae and Ooencyrtus johnsonii. Ooencyrtus can out-compete Trissolcus in the laboratory, but coexistence is the norm in field populations. Despite the heavy mortality inflicted by the two parasitoids, the host-parasitoid interaction is persistent in all sites that have been studied in southern California. 2. I manipulated inter-patch distances in a field experiment to determine whether spatial processes drive parasitoid coexistence and/or host-parasitoid dynamics. I first tested the hypothesis that the parasitoids coexist via a dispersal-competition trade-off. Both parasitoid species took significantly longer to colonize isolated patches than well-connected patches, suggesting that they have comparable dispersal abilities. Ooencyrtus did not exclude Trissolcus even when inter-patch distances were reduced to 25-30% of those observed in natural populations. These data suggest that parasitoid coexistence can occur in the absence of a dispersal advantage to the inferior competitor. 3. Since the treatments with isolated vs. well-connected patches did not differ in parasitoid composition, I next asked whether isolation would destabilize, or drive extinct, the host-multiparasitoid interaction. No local extinctions of bugs or parasitoids were observed during the 18-month study period. Bug populations in the isolated patches were no more variable than those in the well-connected patches. In fact, temporal variability in the experimentally isolated patches was comparable to that observed in highly isolated natural populations. 4.

To elucidate the links between avian brood size, parental effort and parental investment, we measured daily energy expenditure (DEE(fem)), condition (residuals of mass on tarsus) and feeding rate in female great tits Parus major L. rearing broods in which the number of young was either reduced, unmanipulated or enlarged. 2. Female condition was negatively correlated with manipulation when measured at the nestling age of 8 days (measured during the day), which suggests a shift in allocation from self-feeding to chick-feeding. However, there was no detectable manipulation effect on condition measured at the nestling age of 12 days (measured during the night). Either female condition was only affected by manipulation in the early nestling phase or the females adjusted their diurnal mass trajectory in response to brood size manipulation. More detailed data are required to verify this point. There were no indications of a fitness cost associated with the condition during the day, but condition at night was positively related to winter survival. Since manipulation only affected condition during the day, there was no link between manipulation and winter survival. 3. The duration of the working day was not affected by manipulation and female feeding rate tended to flatten off with manipulated brood size. Similarly, brood reduction resulted in a lower DEE(fem), whilst brood enlargement had no effect. This suggests that females worked at an energetic ceiling when rearing an unmanipulated brood. However, the level of this 'ceiling' in DEE(fem) was not fixed: it differed between years. This leads us to conclude that the observed ceiling was imposed by extrinsic factors (e.g. available foraging time) and not by an intrinsic factor such as maximum energy assimilation rate. We hypothesize that time limitation was the cause for the observed ceiling in energy expenditure and that the annual variation in the level of this ceiling was due to annual variation in ambient temperature. 4. A cost of reproduction was previously demonstrated in this population: brood enlargement caused a reduction in the incidence of second clutches.

Females were sampled in the interior canopy of grapefruit trees either just before and at the end of the foraging period over 2 days and were dissected to determine the starting and ending eggload distributions. A group of females was caught before the onset of activity and kept in vials in the field in trees with honey but without access to hosts during the foraging period. Their eggload at the end of the day was used to estimate the egg maturation rate during the foraging period. 3. Two stochastic models are used to predict the eggload distribution at the end of the day. Both use the observed starting eggload distribution, the observed length of the foraging period and the estimated rate of egg maturation. The model providing the better fit uses an oviposition rate which is an increasing function of the eggload. 4. The eggload does not attain a steady state distribution during a foraging period. One-third to one-half of the population is predicted to experience egg-limitation at some time during the foraging period. Five percent of the population will experience egg-limitation a second time within a single day. 5.

The climate change was assessed by examining changes in sea-surface temperature (SST), time of permanent ice disappearance (ID), wind (WV) and current vectors (CV). Changes in the distribution of zooplankton biomass in the study region were used to assess changes in prey communities. Bird reproductive success was determined as the number of chicks fledged per nest occupied. 3. There were two distinct sets of oceanographic conditions in the study region, as reflected in the SST, ID, WV and CV. Strong northerly winds in the spring produced a late ice disappearance in the study region, whereas easterly winds determined an early ice disappearance.

A linear relationship between the number of species in ecological communities (local richness) and the species pools from which the communities are drawn (regional richness) suggests that species interactions are not sufficient to limit local richness and that communities are not saturated with species. Instead, this relationship implies that communities are open to regional influences and are interlinked by dispersal. 2. Here we show how the linear relationship between local and regional richness in real, noninteractive, assemblages of cynipid gall wasps on California oaks, can be predicted from a simple patch-occupancy model. 3. One cynipid assemblage has been surveyed for 3 years, allowing for crude estimates of colonization and extinction rates per patch. Using the mainland/island model of patch occupancy dynamics, these rates are combined with the observed number of cynipid species associated with each oak species (regional richness) to predict the expected local species richness in each patch. Assuming that species are independently distributed among localities, the expected variance in species richness among localities is also computed. 4. The model is then tested on an independent data set. When differences in sampling effort (number of surveyed trees per locality) were accounted for, the regression equation relating observed (n = 41) to predicted local species richness does not differ statistically from the line of perfect agreement. The residuals are also distributed according to the predicted variance. 5. Although not statistically significant, the variance in local richness appears to be slightly underestimated by the model. One explanation may be that cynipid species display some positive covariance in their distribution among localities, that is, groups of species occur together in given localities more frequently than would be expected by chance. Variance ratio tests identified statistically positive covariance within cynipid assemblages for three oaks species. 6. The close fit of the model to the data supports the theoretical scenario for noninteractive communities, that the slope of the local-regional richness relationship and patch-occupancy processes are different expressions of the same phenomenon.",30,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Cynipid wasps | Extinction and colonization rates | Island biogeography | Metapopulation | Species associations,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,71,NA,NA,NA,NA

We sought evidence for state-dependent behaviour and energy expenditure by manipulating the body-state of birds. We reviewed three hypotheses that could describe responses to a change in body-state: the Increased Effort; Reduced Effort; and Balanced Effort Hypotheses. 2. Territorial European robins Erithacus rubecula L. were captured at dusk during winter, and chilled or warmed overnight to manipulate body-state. 3. The robins were released onto their territories before dawn. Their subsequent behaviour was monitored by radio-tracking, and energy expenditure was measured using the doubly labelled water technique. 4. Robins with high overnight energy expenditures (= 'negative' body-state; chilled) were less likely to initiate vocal behaviour, and less likely to respond to the song or calls of conspecifics than those with low overnight expenditures (= 'positive' body-state; warmed). 5. Chilled birds moved around their territories at almost twice the rate of warmed birds, and had significantly higher daytime energy expenditures. 6. We concluded that behaviour, including vocalizations and activity levels, and energy expenditures of robins, were sensitive to manipulations of body-state. 7. These behaviours are interpreted as adaptive responses to restore condition, while minimizing the risk of mortality from predation and starvation. Our results were consistent with the Balanced Effort Hypothesis, entailing an increase in energy expenditure on foraging and a reduction in expenditure on non-maintenance activities. 8.

Local recruitment of Audouin's gull (Larus audouinii Payraudeau) was studied between 1988 and 1997 at the Ebro Delta colony (north-western Mediterranean). Since its establishment in 1981, the colony has dramatically grown to include, in 1997, 65% of the total world population. Several hypotheses were tested, involving the effects of a badger predatory event in 1994, and sex, age and cohort (year of birth) on recruitment. 2. Results supported the prediction that colony size influenced recruitment: the probability for any individual to have previously bred increased throughout the study, together with colony size. At the end of the study, 90% of breeders aged 4 years had already been recruited at age 3, the age of first reproduction by Audouin's gulls. As expected by the dramatic increase of breeding numbers, most local recruitment occurred at very young ages, especially when compared with other Laridae. 3. Neither food availability nor reproductive success affected recruitment. Recruitment was not affected by high nest predation by the badger, although after the event, the proportion of Ebro Delta birds nesting on the nearby Columbretes Islands tripled. 4. Probability of first reproduction depended on age: it was the highest at ages 3 and 4, and then decreased sharply with age to stabilize beyond age 6 to a value depending on the year and cohort but always very low (< 5%). Cohort and sex did not influence local recruitment. 5. Annual resighting rates ranged between 35% and 82%, and were higher for females.

The role of different environmental factors and functional traits in shaping the organization of foraging of limpets at different time scales was analysed by using a state-dependent optimal foraging model, based on stochastic dynamic programming. The model includes interaction among mortality risks and energy costs incurred during the different tidal phases, the effect of different levels of energy reserves, gut fullness and changing food availability. 4. The model is able to reproduce a variety of foraging patterns with reference to the tidal cycle when changing combinations of values assigned to the risk of mortality, energy costs and food availability.

Theoretical studies predict that limited amounts of dispersal of individuals in host-parasitoid systems can both enhance the stability of the subpopulations and promote the co-existence of competing parasitoid species. We investigated the effects of dispersal on the population dynamics and parasitoid community structure of a natural host-multi-parasitoid system consisting of the midge Rhopalomyia californica that forms galls on the shrub Baccharis pilularis and the parasitoids that attack the midge. 2. An experiment involving the release of midges into a field with a low background density of galls demonstrated that the midges, on average, travelled approximately 1.7m in their lifetime. This suggests that the appropriate spatial scale at which to look at the effects of dispersal is relatively small. 3. Dispersal of midges and parasitoids between individual bushes was experimentally eliminated in a caging experiment. The midge populations in all of the uncaged replicates displayed dynamics that were similar to each other, while the dynamics of the midge populations in the caged replicates diverged. The midge dynamics on the uncaged bushes were not significantly more stable than those on the caged bushes. 4. Dispersal among bushes was found to play a major role in co-existence of the competing parasitoid species. There was a dramatic drop in the parasitoid species diversity on the caged bushes, with only a single parasitoid species, Platygaster californica, persisting at high numbers in the caged populations. In accordance with theoretical models, P. californica is the parasitoid species in the community that has the highest attack rate and is most effective at searching for hosts in a restricted area.

We tested the brood reduction hypothesis by manipulating hatching spans of Eurasian kestrel Falco tinnunculus (Linnaeus) broods during two low vole years (1996-97) in western Finland. In addition, half the broods in 1997 were food supplemented during the entire nestling period. 2. Nestling mortality was high, occurring in 55% of nests, and the effect of manipulated hatching span on fledging success was more pronounced than either the effects of year or supplementary food. In contrast to the predictions tested, fledging success was higher in synchronous than asynchronous nests, both when food was limiting and when food conditions were substantially improved by food supplements. 3. We found no evidence that brood reduction resulted in higher quality (body mass) of surviving young in low vole years. On average, fledglings were heavier at synchronous than asynchronous nests. This was only the case, however, when food was limiting. 4. Most nestling mortality occurred when the chicks were 2 weeks old, and age of death did not differ between the brood types. Parents at synchronous nests fed their broods at a higher rate than at asynchronous broods, this divergence arising only in the latter part of nestling period. 5. This is the first hatching span experiment where synchronous hatching seemed more profitable than asynchronous during conditions of both food scarcity and food abundance. The higher parental workload at synchronous nests could, however, counterbalance the benefits of synchronous hatching. 6. Hatching in natural broods of Eurasian kestrel is more synchronous in low vole years compared to high vole years. The fact that synchronous broods out-performed asynchronous broods in both 'low' years of the study is consistent with the facultative manipulations.

The effect of predation risk on the distribution of animals foraging in a patchy environment was explored using a simulation model based on the work of Bernstein, Kacelnik and Krebs (1988, 1991), extended to incorporate predation risk. 2. Modelled foragers consume prey within patches, having different prey densities, at a rate that depends only on prey density and interference from other foragers in the patch. Prey density remains constant (no depletion). A forager leaves a patch if its intake rate drops below its estimate of the average intake rate available in the environment. This estimate is continually updated by taking a weighted average of current intake and the previous estimate, giving a simple learning process. Decisions on whether to leave are made at regular intervals and a forager leaving a patch may arrive at random at any other patch. 3. Simulation results were sensitive to the computational scheme used to represent estimates of average intake rate in the environment and to the way in which foragers' decisions were distributed over time, illustrating the need for careful formulation of such models. 4. Predation risk was modelled as a cost that reduced effective intake, and could be distributed uniformly or skewed to patches of high prey density. The effects of different levels and distributions of predation risk on distribution of foragers were examined using model parameters broadly appropriate to hedgehogs (Erinaceous europaeus L.) foraging for earthworms (Lumbricus spp.) and risking opportunistic predation by badgers (Meles meles L.). The distribution of foragers with respect to prey density took an 'ideal free' form for zero or uniform risk, and was domed when cost of predation risk was relatively high and concentrated in the richer patches, as might be the case when predators and foragers share a common food resource.",30,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Hedgehog | Ideal free distribution | Interference | Learning | Patchy environment,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,77,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

In order to assess the importance of predation in this system, we constructed both an explicit four-species model and a simplified model with two functional groups which was more amenable to analytical treatment. 2. The models were parameterized using new data on adult emergence and recruitment combined with previously published data on larval densities and prey uptake. The models were falsified if parameterizations led either to negative prey carrying capacities or to unstable dynamics. 3. Both the functional group and four-species models predict asymptotically stable interactions, with feasible carrying capacities. The models are consistent in predicting that the observed prey are in excess of 70% of their carrying capacities. The four-species model indicates that predation impact is not evenly shared between the two prey, with L. nigra being depressed further from its carrying capacity than N. pictetii. 4.

A geographical gradient in the relative impact of generalist and specialist predators on small rodent populations has been hypothesized to be responsible for the gradient in cyclicity found in Fennoscandia. Population oscillations resulting from weasel-vole interactions are said to be dampened by the increasing stabilizing impact of generalist predators in southern Fennoscandia resulting from: (i) a greater abundance and diversity of predators sustained by alternative prey; (ii) the absence of significant snow cover leading to constant exposure of voles to generalist predators; and (iii) a heterogeneous habitat that makes dispersing voles more vulnerable to predators. 2. Changes in the abundance of field voles (Microtus agrestis L.) in a man-made spruce forest in northern England were recorded during 1984-98 using sign indices at 14-18 sites calibrated with capture-recapture estimates of vole density. 3. Field vole populations exhibited cyclic dynamics which were in many ways similar to those reported from Fennoscandia, including population declines taking place during the breeding season and long periods with no recovery in numbers following population crashes. 4. The density dependence structure of the time series was explored by means of partial autocorrelation functions, which suggested second-order density dependence. Analyses based on two density estimates per year (spring and autumn) reveal significant negative values for lags of 1, 1.5 and 2 years, suggesting that the time-lag might be somewhat shorter than 2 years. 5. Estimates of predation on field voles by red foxes and tawny owls at high vole density were above the value predicted for this site and for the whole generalist predator community by a published model assuming that predation by generalist predators stabilizes vole populations. However, empirical estimates of the parameter used both for designing and testing the model are inherently imprecise. 6. A qualitative evaluation of the three variables (see 1) correlated to the Fennoscandian gradient and assumed to contribute to variations in generalist predation pressure did not support the hypothesis that low predation rates by generalist predators are necessary for vole dynamics to be dominated by the destabilizing impact of weasel-vole interactions.

On the tidal flats of the Wadden Sea, the predatory polychaete Nephtys hombergii (Sav.) is sensitive to low winter temperatures, whereas its main prey, the smaller polychaetes Scoloplos armiger (O.F.M.) and Heteromastus filiformis (Clap.) are not. 2. Monitoring macrofauna dynamics during the last three decades (1970-97) in two distant Wadden Sea areas revealed that Nephtys abundance was severely reduced in all eight coldest winters (generally to an average of < 0.1 g ash-free dry weight m-2), whereas its biomass reached mean values around 1 g AFDW m-2 during periods with mild winters (≤ 5 days with an air temperature remaining below 0°C all day). Over-winter changes in Nephtys abundance were strongly related to temperature and 70% of the variability in late winter abundance of this species could be explained by temperature characteristics of the foregoing winter. 3. Biomass values of Nephtys observed in late winter predicted to a high degree (90%) the generally somewhat higher values in the subsequent summer. This seasonal change of predator abundance was generally not related to prey density. Only locally (in an exposed low-biomass area) and rarely (one-tenth of the years of observation) did low prey supply (if it was lower than simultaneous predator biomass) coincide with a decline, rather than the usual seasonal increase in Nephtys biomass. 4. A negative influence of predator abundance on prey biomass was observed in both prey species over the entire range of observed predator biomass values. The usual seasonal (winter to summer) increase of prey biomass was significantly smaller at high than at low Nephtys biomass and was even reduced to nil at the highest predator density observed. Scoloplos biomass was about four times higher after years with low (< 0.1 g m-2) than after years with high (> 1.0 g m-2) Nephtys biomass. Similar differences were observed in biomass of Heteromastus. 5. It is concluded that winter temperatures act as an important structuring factor in the Wadden Sea zoobenthic community by directly governing the densities of an important infaunal predator and indirectly affecting the abundance of at least two important prey species. Cold winters intervene by starting a new cycle of predator-prey interaction on average once per 3 or 4 years. 6.

A food web is presented which describes trophic interactions among the herbivores, parasitoids, predators and pathogens associated with broom, Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link. The data come from published work on the community at a single site. The web comprises a total of 154 taxa: one plant, 19 herbivores, 66 parasitoids, 60 predators, five omnivores and three pathogens. There are 370 trophic links between these taxa in the web. The taxa form 82 functionally distinct groups, called trophic species. 2. Predators consumed significantly more species than did parasitoids: a median of two prey species per species of predator (range = 1-9), compared to a median of one host species per species of parasitoid (range = 1-4). Significant differences in the number of species consumed were also found among the five predator groups: birds (median = 4), spiders (median = 5), Coleoptera (median = 1), Diptera (median = 2) and Hemiptera (median = 7). 3. Vulnerability, measured by numbers of consumer species, was significantly affected by the herbivores' feeding styles: externally feeding herbivores were most vulnerable and the concealed herbivores were least vulnerable. Miners were vulnerable to the most parasitoid species and externally feeding herbivores were the most vulnerable to predators. 4. Resource species had a median vulnerability of 13 consumer species, a figure far higher than that in most published food webs. No significant relationship was found between species' vulnerability to predators and vulnerability to parasitoids. However, there was a strong negative relationship between the percentage mortality due to predation and percentage mortality due to parasitism. 5. The broom food web contains nine orders of insects, a figure higher than previously recorded. The web also contains vertebrates, arachnids, bacteria and fungi. Most of the interactions between the orders were weak. Connectance was calculated for the complete web, the parasitoid sub-web and the predator sub-web. The connectance of the predator sub-web, a value of 0.0364, was more than an order of magnitude larger than the connectance of the entire web (0.0156) or the parasitoid sub-web (0.018). 6. The body lengths of 52 species in the food web were estimated from field guides or museum specimens. Larger predators consumed smaller prey in 93% of predator-prey interactions. Smaller parasitoids consumed larger hosts in 79% of parasitoid-host interactions. Parasitoids were significantly smaller than predators. 7. The 52 species were arranged in order of increasing body length along the columns and down the rows of a food web matrix. The predator sub-web was predominantly upper triangular with 8% of non-zero elements falling below the leading diagonal. The parasitoid sub-web was predominantly lower triangular with 21% non-zero elements falling above the leading diagonal.

Introduced rabbits are known to have catastrophic effects on oceanic islands, either by direct destruction of the vegetative cover, or by the resulting disturbance of indigenous vertebrates. 2. Another dramatic effect, less well known, but potentially of major importance, is the hyperpredation process. This process, related to apparent competition, predicts that an introduced prey species, well adapted to high predation pressure, could induce the extinction of an indigenous prey, through the sudden increased population size of an introduced predator. In many island ecosystems, the simultaneous presence of introduced feral cats and rabbits is thus potentially a further threat for small vertebrates endemic of these islands. 3. Through a mathematical model, we tested this hypothesis, using a tri-trophic system comprising an indigenous prey (birds), an introduced prey (rabbits) and an introduced predator (cats), and we demonstrated the theoretical existence of the hyperpredation process. 4. In addition, the numerical analysis of the model allowed a quantification of this process. It shows that the conditions required for an indigenous species to cope with the hyperpredation process imply very high intrinsic growth rates and/or carrying capacity, as well as behavioural anti-predator response to the introduced predator. Since these conditions are unlikely to be met, this process is a further potential threat to most indigenous vertebrate prey. 5. Finally, our model shows that, although it can be induced by both types of adaptation together or alone, behavioural adaptations alone are more powerful in generating the hyperpredation process, than are life history traits adaptations.",188,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Apparent competition | Bird extinction | Feral cats | Introduced mammals | Mathematical model,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,83,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is commonly believed that the smaller clutch size of tropical compared with temperate birds is a response to a high predation rate. If this is true, one would expect incubation and fledging periods in the tropics to be shorter than in temperate regions, but they are generally thought to be longer in the tropics than in northern temperate areas. 2. In this paper we show that among passerines in both the Old and the New World, there is little or no difference in either incubation or fledging periods between temperate and tropical areas. 3.

In birds with bi-parental care, handicapping is often assumed to decrease the amount of parental care of the handicapped partner. We discuss how handicapping could alter the shape of the handicapped bird's survival-effort curve (theoretical curve relating the survival of a parent to its effort) and show that the optimal response could yield a decrease, no response or even an increase in effort of the handicapped bird. 2. Male or female great tits Parus major (L.) were handicapped during the nestling period by clipping a number of feathers in order to study the effects on parental care and body condition. 3. Handicapped males significantly decreased their feeding rates, while handicapped females did not. Condition of handicapped females significantly deteriorated, while condition of handicapped males did not change during the experiment. Females with a handicapped partner fully compensated for their partner's decrease in work rate, while males with a handicapped partner did not show any compensation and even tended to decrease their feeding rates. 4. Using an inverse optimality approach, we reconstructed the theoretical curve relating the survival of a parent to its effort on the basis of the experimental effects. The handicapped male's survival-effort curve appeared to be slightly steeper than that of handicapped females.

The construction of a predictive metapopulation model includes three steps: the choice of factors affecting metapopulation dynamics, the choice of model structure, and finally parameter estimation and model testing. 2. Unless the assumption is made that the metapopulation is at stochastic quasiequilibrium and unless the method of parameter estimation of model parameters uses that assumption, estimates from a limited amount of data will usually predict a trend in metapopulation size. 3. This implicit estimation of a trend occurs because extinction-colonization stochasticity, possibly amplified by regional stochasticity, leads to unequal numbers of observed extinction and colonization events during a short study period, 4. Metapopulation models, such as those based on the logistic regression model, that rely on observed population turnover events in parameter estimation are sensitive to the implicit estimation of a trend. 5. A new parameter estimation method, based on Monte Carlo inference for statistically implicit models, allows an explicit decision about whether metapopulation quasi-stability is assumed or not, 6. Our confidence in metapopulation model parameter estimates that have been produced from only a few years of data is decreased by the need to know before parameter estimation whether the metapopulation is in quasi-stable state or not. 7. The choice of whether metapopulation stability is assumed or not in parameter estimation should be done consciously. Typical data sets cover only a few years and rarely allow a statistical test of a possible trend.

Competitive interactions between Eriocrania spp. Zeller (Lepidoptera: Eriocraniidae) leaf-miners and other folivorous guilds (free-living Lepidoptera and phloem feeding aphids) of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) were examined experimentally. 2. Measurements of the foliage quality were taken from the experimental trees in order to discover whether variation in nitrogen and secondary compounds (specifically total phenolics), had an effect on the strength of any competitive interactions between the guilds. 3. There was evidence for indirect interactions within the leaf-mining guild mediated by the host plant: miners in aggregations had double the mortality of single miners. Interactions with leaf-chewing Lepidoptera were limited to interference and resource removal since only damage to the leaf being mined had an effect on the miner performance. There were no interactions between Eriocrania and aphids, despite the presence of aphids reducing the quantity of foliage available by 33%. 4. The strength of the competitive interactions, either within or between guilds, was not modified by the quality of the host trees. However, biomass of emerging larvae was negatively related to increased phenolic content of host trees and positively related to increased nitrogen content. Furthermore, larvae emerged later from trees where foliage had higher phenolic content. 5. The longevity of feeding events by competitive folivore guilds and the proximity of the feeding to the miners were identified as the key factors influencing the effects of foliage damage on the performance of Eriocrania.",37,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Feeding guilds | Interaction modification | Leaf-chewers | Phloem-feeders | Resource modification,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,87,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous work in streams, where many organisms disperse downstream by drifting in the water column, has suggested dispersal distances could be related to the overall proportion of the stream within dead water zones (DWZ), places such as backwaters, pools or behind large obstacles, where the water is out of the main flow and is stored temporarily. However, dispersal distances might also be influenced by the spatial organization of DWZ within a reach; this would require us to distinguish between reaches containing many small DWZ compared with those having a few large ones in order to understand fully differences in dispersal patterns among reaches differing in this regard. 2. We constructed a spatial model of flow in stream reaches, in which we varied the density and size distribution on DWZ distributed through the reach. We defined flow conditions under which streams organisms, modelled as passive particles, would settle to continue to drift dowstream. We then examined the horizontal dispersal profiles of such particles through reaches differing in arrays of DWZ. 3. Our results support those of previous studies, but suggest that the spatial arrangement of DWZ may be just important as the overall proportion of DWZ within a reach.

Single-species models show the greatest persistence when the mixing between subpopulations is large, so spatial heterogeneity is of no benefit. This result is confirmed by stochastic simulation of the full metapopulation. 3. In contrast, natural-enemy models exhibit the greatest persistence for intermediate levels of coupling. When the coupling is too low, there are insufficient rescue effects between the subpopulations to sustain the dynamics, whereas when the coupling is too high all spatial heterogeneity is lost. 4.
