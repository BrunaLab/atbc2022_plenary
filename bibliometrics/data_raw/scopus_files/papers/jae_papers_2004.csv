Parasitism is a non-negligible cost of reproduction in wild organisms, and hosts are selected to partition resources optimally between current and future reproduction. While parents can compensate for the cost of parasitism by increasing their current reproductive investment, such change in resource allocation is expected to carry-over costs on future reproduction. 2. Life history theory predicts that because long-lived organisms have a high residual reproductive value, they should be more reluctant to increase parental effort in response to parasites. Also, when rearing successive infested broods, the cost of parasitism can cumulate over the years and hence be exacerbated by past infestations. 3. We tested these two predictions in the alpine swift Apus melba, a long-lived colonial bird that is infested intensely by the nest-based blood sucking louse-fly Crataerina melbae. For this purpose, we manipulated ectoparasite load over 3 consecutive years and measured reproductive parameters in successive breeding attempts of adults assigned randomly to 'parasitized' and 'deparasitized' treatments. 4. In current reproduction, fathers of experimentally parasitized broods produced a similar number of offspring as fathers from the deparasitized treatment, but the rearing period was prolonged by 4 days. Fathers that were assigned to the parasitized treatment in year x produced significantly fewer fledglings the following year x + 1 than those of the deparasitized treatment. The number of young produced by fathers in year x + 1 was correlated negatively with the number of days they cared for their brood in the previous year x. We also found a significant interaction between treatments performed over 2 successive years, with fathers of parasitized broods suffering a larger fitness loss if in the past they had already cared for a parasitized brood rather than for a deparasitized one. Similar effects of parasitism, although partly non-significant (0.05 < P-values > 0.10), were found in mothers. 5. Altogether, our results show that parasites can modify resource allocation between current and future reproduction in long-lived hosts, and that the cost of parasitism can cumulate over the years. It emphasizes the fact that effects of parasites can depend on past infestations and become apparent in future reproduction only.",39,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Apus melba | Cost of plasticity | Ectoparasite | Hatching asynchrony | Hippoboscidae | Life history theory | Trade-off between current and future reproduction,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,1

Dispersers in heterogeneous habitat theoretically should target the habitat(s) where reproduction and survival (i.e. fitness) will be highest. However, the cues that dispersing animals respond to are not well understood: differences in habitat quality ultimately may be important, but whether animals respond to these differences may be influenced by their own familiarity with different habitats. 2. To determine if dispersers reacted to differences in habitat, we documented the exploratory movements, dispersal, and settlement patterns of juvenile North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) originating in adjacent patches of different habitats. 3. Dispersers originating in mature, closed-canopy forest (linked to higher female reproductive success and smaller territories) did not explore contrasting open forest with lower tree densities, and the magnitude of the dispersers' explorations was relatively similar. In contrast, dispersers from the open forest habitat made explorations that carried them into contrasting, mature forest habitat, and their explorations were more variable across individuals. 4. When settlement occurred, it was strongly philopatric in all groups of dispersers, although the distances and directions favoured during the exploratory phase of dispersal remained strong predictors of where settlement occurred. Overall, processes favouring philopatry (i.e. maternal influences, competitive advantages, etc.) appeared to dominate the dispersal of our study animals, even those that were exposed to higher quality habitat during their explorations. 5. Secondarily, annual stochasticity (or some correlate) affected the scale of exploration and timing of settlement more than the relative quality of habitat in which dispersers were born. 6.

The quality-variability trade-off hypothesis predicts that (i) energy density (kJ g-1) and spatial-temporal variability in abundance are positively correlated in nearshore marine fishes; and (ii) prey selection by a nearshore piscivore, the pigeon guillemot (Cepphus columba Pallas), is negatively affected by variability in abundance. 2. We tested these predictions with data from a 4-year study that measured fish abundance with beach seines and pigeon guillemot prey utilization with visual identification of chick meals. 3. The first prediction was supported. Pearson's correlation showed that fishes with higher energy density were more variable on seasonal (r = 0.71) and annual (r = 0.66) time scales. Higher energy density fishes were also more abundant overall (r = 0.85) and more patchy at a scale of 10s of km (r = 0.77). 4. Prey utilization by pigeon guillemots was strongly non-random. Relative preference, defined as the difference between log-ratio transformed proportions of individual prey taxa in chick diets and beach seine catches, was significantly different from zero for seven of the eight main prey categories. 5. The second prediction was also supported. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to summarize variability in correlated prey characteristics (energy density, availability and variability in abundance). Two PCA scores explained 32% of observed variability in pigeon guillemot prey utilization. Seasonal variability in abundance was negatively weighted by these PCA scores, providing evidence of risk-averse selection. Prey availability, energy density and km-scale variability in abundance were positively weighted. 6. Trophic interactions are known to create variability in resource distribution in other systems.

An animal's perceptual range defines the spatial extent of the landscape for which information is available to make movement decisions. Ecologists studying and modelling animal dispersal have commonly assumed that individual movements arise from a predefined set of local decision rules operating within a static isotropic (i.e. circular) perceptual range. 2. We discuss how this assumption fails to recognize the potential for plasticity in perceptual ranges and present a conceptual model that illustrates how anisotropic perceptual ranges can arise from animal orientation to environmental stimuli. 3. Using model simulations we show how perceptual distance (i.e. greatest Euclidean distance at which habitat patches can be perceived), horizon (i.e. panoramic view or angular degrees of the landscape perceived) and breadth (i.e. areal extent of the landscape perceived), change as a function of increased strength of a hypothetical stimuli. 4. Our results show that anisotropic perceptual ranges can differ substantially from traditional, isotropic perceptual ranges in all three aspects depending on the strength of the stimuli and nature in which it interacts with other elements of the landscape. 5. We highlight the implications of these findings for modelling animal movements in ecological landscapes with the hope that context-dependent perceptual ranges are considered in future studies.",92,Journal,re,Review,100,4,4,Anisotropic | Behaviour | Connectivity | Isotropic | Orientation | Patch context,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,5

Additional factors relevant to dispersal are necessary to establish a general theory that can explain the sex-biased dispersal pattern of most taxa. The present study evaluated the influence of pre-dispersal copulation on the evolution of sex-biased dispersal. The influence of fluctuating environment, population size and dispersal cost were also analysed. 2. The simulation models were designed on the basis of the life history of Pieris rapae crucivora, in which female butterflies disperse among local habitats after copulation although male butterflies remain in the natal habitat. In the first model, where females always copulate before dispersal, the evolution of female-biased dispersal was facilitated by the fluctuating environment, but was suppressed by the stable environment. However, the fluctuating environment also suppressed the sex-biased dispersal in the second model where female dispersers always copulate after dispersal. Thus, the interaction between the pre-dispersal copulation and the fluctuating environment is a sufficient condition for the evolution of sex-biased dispersal. 3. The present study is the first report to reveal the important influence of pre-dispersal copulation on the evolution of sex-biased dispersal.

The introduction of animals to novel environments has been used as a model system for investigating the factors affecting small populations during their initial period of establishment. Previous studies of introduction success in birds have identified a number of factors associated with successful establishment. 2. We predicted that species with strong non-specific immune responses would have an elevated probability of establishment because they would be better able to cope with parasites in the novel environment. Consistent with this prediction, we found that nestling T-cell mediated immune response, as reflected by the response to a challenge with the mitogenic lectin phytohaemagglutinin, was a reliable estimator of establishment success. In multivariate analyses that took previously identified predictors into account, this was only the case when propagule sizes of introduced birds were large. 3.

Compartmentation has been less explored than other forms of community structure. We assessed compartmentation of associations between insects and plants on a regional scale, and analysed some of its causes and consequences. The data set used was the host records of fruit flies (Diptera; Tephritidae) that breed in flowerheads of plants of the tribe Vernonieae (Asteraceae) in the Espinhaço Mountain range, Minas Gerais, Brazil. This data set was obtained with a consistent sampling protocol and is taxonomically fully resolved. 2. The binary association matrix had a total of 35 insect and 81 plant species. Most of the insects were specialized on plants of a single subtribe, genus or species group. Correspondence analysis showed that the association matrix is divided in six well-delimited compartments of insects specialized on subtribes or genera of plants. 3. Host dissimilarity among insects and insect dissimilarity among plants were expressed as Jaccard distances. Tests with a multi-response permutation procedure (MRPP) showed that both kinds of dissimilarities were higher among compartments than within them. 4. Monte Carlo randomizations were used to compare matrix parameters with values expected in the absence of compartments. In 4000 runs, the number of insect species that shared at least one host plant (ecological neighbours) was smaller than expected. Nevertheless, mean host similarity among insects, and the proportion of exclusive host plants used by each insect species did not differ from null model predictions. Host similarity of insects with their nearest neighbours in niche space was higher than expected by the null model. On the other hand, host similarity with farthest neighbours was lower than expected. 6. The observed compartmentation of insect/plant associations can be ascribed to the marked specialization of flowerhead tephritids, and allows the reduction of diffuse competition among insects. However, compartmentation did not decrease overall niche overlap among insects because reduction in number of neighbours is offset by increased overlap with species in the same compartment. Therefore, the pattern in this system cannot be derived from resource partitioning alone.",94,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Brazil | Campos Rupestres | Niche overlap | Null-models | Tephritidae | Vernonieae,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,8

Home range size, spatial organization and territoriality of reproductive Arctic foxes were studied during the summer. The influence of spatial distribution and availability of the main prey was investigated in order to evaluate whether the spatial organization of Arctic foxes was coherent with key predictions of the resource dispersion hypotheses (RDH). The RDH includes the spatial characteristics of resource abundance, while there is also growing attention to the importance of the temporal characteristics of resource abundance. Hence the role of temporal and spatio-temporal predictability of prey explaining carnivore spatial organization was also investigated in this study. 2. The study was conducted on Svalbard; a simple High-Arctic terrestrial ecosystem which allowed unique estimates of prey abundance. The main prey of the Arctic fox (Svalbard reindeer Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus, seabirds Alcidae and Procellariidae and geese Anseridae) was surveyed systematically. These surveys revealed highly contrasting patterns in prey abundance within the terrestrial ecosystem. 3. Arctic fox summer home ranges varied in size (4-60 km2), as well as in overlap (17-76%). The diverse spatial organization covaried with spatial and temporal patterns in prey abundance. Small home ranges (10 ± 5.6 km2) with large overlap (76 ± 19.6%) were characteristic for coastal areas where prey was concentrated in small patches and predictable both in space and time. Medium home ranges (23 ± 4.2 km2) and overlap (50 ± 6.6%) occurred inland where prey was clumped in larger patches and less predictable. Large home ranges (52 ± 8.4 km2) with little overlap (17 ± 3.5%) occurred inland where prey was widely scattered and unpredictable. 4. Spatial dispersion and richness of prey resources explained most of the variation in Arctic fox spatial organization. The RDH framework could be used to explain the presence of relaxed territoriality found in this study. We suggest that the observed absence of more permanent social groups is due to the extremely severe winter conditions which force juvenile individuals to disperse from the natal area during the first winter. 5. Predictability of resources was an additional significant factor affecting both home-range size and overlap. Resource predictability captures the degree to which an animal can depend on its environment to offer suitable and secure living conditions over time. 6. This study emphasize the need to incorporate both spatial and temporal characteristics of resource distribution in order to fully understand the diversity of spatial arrangements among carnivores.",90,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Home range | Predictability | Resource dispersion hypothesis (RDH) | Svalbard | Territoriality,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,9

Long-tailed tits (Aegithalos caudatus) are a cooperatively breeding species in which helpers often invest effort in the provisioning of young that are not their own. 2. We quantified the lifetime reproductive success (LRS) and the individual fitness, lambda, of 228 long-tailed tits using 8 years of field data. Calculation of lambda took account of the effect of helpers on reproductive success, and thus lambda estimates the inclusive fitness of individuals. We examined the relationships between the fitness estimators and the provisioning effort, cohort, body size and dispersal status of individuals. 3. LRS of individuals which bred successfully varied between 0 and 13 local recruits (mean 0.71 ± 0.11 SE); lambda varied between 0 and 2.54 (mean 0.28 ± 0.04). The measures were highly correlated, and their distributions were strongly skewed. Helping by individuals contributed little to their fitness, but one-fifth of birds that accrued fitness did so only through helping. In general, individuals that gained fitness from helping did not gain fitness directly. 4. Both LRS and individual fitness were significant predictors of the number of grand-offspring that an individual had, but they accounted for only about one-third of the variation. 5. When variance in LRS was partitioned between length of breeding life span, average fecundity and offspring survival, the latter component was the most important in accounting for variance in LRS. 6. Offspring local survival was positively related to the provisioning effort of mothers, but was unrelated to that of fathers. As a result, the fitness of females was positively related to their provisioning effort. 7. Immigrant birds tended to be more reproductively successful than philopatric ones. Among females, only immigrant birds accrued any LRS or individual fitness. 8. The probability that an individual had at least one offspring recruit to the local breeding population varied among cohorts, probably as a result of variation among years in offspring local survival.

Dispersal limitation is widely invoked to explain species coexistence and cooperation in the face of competition and cheating. However, empirical evidence from natural ecosystems for the stabilizing effect of space is sparse. 2. We use a Neotropical ant-plant and its ant symbionts to show how mutual dispersal limitation brings about the stable persistence of coexistence and mutualism. 3. We demonstrate that two ant genera exhibit hierarchies in competitive ability, fecundity and dispersal ability, which suggests that a competition-colonization trade-off could be producing coexistence. However, we also show that this trade-off is not a sufficient explanation for coexistence. 4. Instead, we provide evidence that a dispersal-fecundity trade-off stabilizes the system by making each genus more dispersal-limited in a different portion of the environment. In this way, dispersal limitation can be seen as a form of environmental niche partitioning. 5. We also find that regeneration niche partitioning and a competition-colonization trade-off may help to bring about local mixing. 6. This study shows that care needs to be taken in identifying the critical mechanisms producing coexistence. Trade-offs between different stages of colonization may be more important for explaining coexistence than any trade-offs between competitive ability and colonization rate.",57,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Habitat destruction hypothesis | Metacommunity | Mutualism | Myrmecophyte | Recruitment limitation | Spatial ecology,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,15

The number of reproductive events per lifetime affects all levels of ecological complexity, including the structure and dynamics of species communities. Here we investigate a sexual parasite-host system with two water frog species of which one (Rana esculenta, E) is a hemiclonal hybrid that depends on one of its parental species (R. lessonae, L) for successful reproduction. Previous theoretical models have shown that relative fecundities are important for the species composition and stability of this system, but empirical data from natural mixed LE-populations were lacking. 2. We used three different methods to estimate the proportion of annually reproducing hybrid and parental females: (a) screening for eggs through a tiny incision into the belly skin, (b) measuring plasma hormone titres from blood samples and (c) counts of egg clumps deposited into the pond. 3. After accounting for the respective adult population sizes of the two female types - calculated from mark-recapture analyses - we found that all three estimates revealed a higher proportion of reproducing L- than E-females. Ratios ranged from 1.43 (method c), to 1.90 (a) to 2.38 (b), with an average of 1.90. 4. We also investigated three potential causes for the fecundity difference (age structure, hybrid sterility and differences in reproductive costs) but could not find compelling evidence for any of them. We hypothesize that size-related differences in energy budgets offer the most probable explanation. 5. The consequences of the observed species differences in annual reproductive success were analysed with a theoretical model. The higher proportion of reproducing R. lessonae females increases the possibilities for stable coexistence in mixed LE-populations under a variety of combinations of mating patterns, relative fecundity and larval performance. The results, however, also indicate new limits for coexistence and highlight the paramount importance of larval competition for explaining the composition and dynamics of mixed LE-populations.",11,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Fecundity | Hybridogenesis | Lifetime reproductive success | Reproductive costs | Water frogs,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,16

A measure of population density accounting for the spatial patchiness of the population was constructed for breeding and wintering counts. No relationship was found between spatial and numeric dynamics, which suggests different mechanisms for both dynamical patterns. 3.

Both wintering population density and rainfall during post-nuptial moult exerted a positive effect on subsequent spatial expansion during breeding, which suggest a major role for social interactions during wintering and wetlands availability on spatial dynamics. 5.

Population dynamics results from an interplay between the environmental state and population density. With many organisms there is structure to the life history, and this structure has important consequences for the population's density dependence and its interaction with environmental noise, and therefore its population dynamics. Perturbing population structure, such as through harvesting, may therefore affect the way that the populations respond to stochastic environmental variation. 2. We conducted three experiments on populations of soil mites kept under controlled conditions and harvested a constant proportion of eggs, juveniles or adults. The experiments (a) minimized environmental variability, (b) created environmental variability by randomizing food supplies, and (c) provided excess food and repeatedly subdivided the populations to maintain them below carrying capacity. 3. We find that harvesting different stages has marked effects on stage structure, which differ between constant and variable environments. For example, harvesting adults decreases the number of adults, harvesting eggs increases the number of adults and harvesting juveniles has no effect under near constant conditions, whereas in a variable environment harvesting adults and juveniles reduces adult numbers, but harvesting eggs has no effect. 4. As well as changing the mean age structure, harvesting can change the variance of the different stages. For example, in a constant environment harvesting juveniles does not change the variability in juvenile numbers or population size, but in a variable environment harvesting juveniles increases the variability in the size of the juvenile class and hence the total population variability. 5. For populations that are kept at one-third to one-half carrying capacity (approximately where the maximum sustainable yield should result) harvesting of the different age classes has marked positive effects on the population growth rates. Harvesting different age classes causes changes in the density dependence, which explains the way in which the population parameters respond. 6. In conclusion, the population response to harvesting depends on the stage/age structure and the way it changes with harvesting and environmental conditions. Managing economically important populations, subject to harvesting, should consider structured life histories.",58,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Age structure | Density dependence | Environmental stochasticity | Perturbation | Population growth rate,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,21

By combining a realistic simulation of the hydrodynamic environment with a model of phenology we infer the time and location at which the stages observed in each sample were recruited as eggs. This yields a spatial and temporal map of the recruitment history required to produce the observed densities. 4. Using an empirical relationship between C. finmarchicus egg production and the abundance of phytoplanktonic food, the spatio-temporal patterns in chlorophyll a can be inferred. The distributions during the spring bloom are spatially heterogeneous, and we estimate that the phytoplankton patches are of the order of 30 km across. This result is robust to substantial variations in the assumed stage-dependent mortalities. 5.

Buffer effects occur when changes in population size result in the disproportionate use of poor-quality habitats. Thus, at low population sizes high-quality habitats are used preferentially. As population size increases an increasing proportion of the population uses poorer-quality habitats. Assessment of the temporal and spatial variation in patterns of habitat occupancy can therefore shed light on the differences in quality between habitats and the individual fitness consequences of habitat choice. 2. We provide the first evidence of the potential operation of a buffer effect for a site-attached marine species. Caribbean cleaning gobies Elacatinus prochilos (Böhlke & Robins) occupy coral and sponge on fringing reefs in Barbados. For adult gobies, resource selection indices suggested a preference for sponge. However, as cleaning goby population size increased, the number of adult cleaning gobies occupying sponge increased more rapidly than the number occupying coral. In contrast, adults preferentially re-colonized coral following experimental removals and at these low population densities the rate of population increase was greater on coral. Our results suggest that coral may be the preferred habitat, but in Barbados this habitat becomes saturated at very low population densities as a consequence of low client densities and ectoparasite loads. Thus, a larger proportion of the population occupies sponge at most observed population densities. 3. Patterns of habitat occupancy with population size for recruits and juveniles suggest only a small difference in habitat quality between sponge and coral. Indeed, recruits and juveniles do not discriminate between sponge and coral. The population shift towards sponge rather than coral occupancy between recruitment and maturity may arise as a combination of differing survival of recruits and juveniles on coral and sponge and active movement of individuals towards sponge. 4.

The two native populations (Malpais Spring and Salt Creek) are genetically distinct and have been isolated historically in dissimilar aquatic habitats (brackish spring and saline river, respectively). Two populations were established c. 1970 from translocation of Salt Creek fish to another saline river (Lost River) and another brackish spring (Mound Spring). 3. Physid snails (Physidae) occur in the two brackish spring habitats but not the saline river habitats. These snails are first intermediate hosts for white grubs (Diplostomatidae).

Diplostomatids were the presumptive cause of this crash, but this was inferred from observation of infection in collected fish. 5.

Parasite intensities were significantly lower in winter compared to summer, suggesting that heavily infected fish were lost from the population on a seasonal basis. 6. We conducted an artificial infection experiment to assess the costs of parasitism for previously uninfected C. tularosa females for various life-history traits. Under experimental conditions, diplostomatid infection caused increases in C. tularosa mortality and decreases in growth and fat storage.

The holly leaf-miner Phytomyza ilicis Curtis shows density patterns typical for non-eruptive leaf-miners, with stable mean densities, but consistently different infestation rates on individual trees. 2. To identify the mechanisms responsible for these patterns the population dynamics of P. ilicis were studied during an 8-year period on 92 host trees in 15 holly patches. The patterns of oviposition, mining and survival and the dominant sources and rates of mortality were monitored. The impact of tree and patch parameters on leaf-miner population dynamics was analysed, and the dispersal ability of P. ilicis was evaluated experimentally. 3. Infestation differences among trees were due to host selection, which determined egg numbers on individual trees and was explained partly by holly variety and leaf availability. 4. Egg distributions on medium to highly infested host trees were aggregated, suggesting limits in the availability of young leaves for oviposition. 5. Due to a suite of mortality factors mean survival rates of P. ilicis were below 10% and did not show a relationship with host choice. 6. There was strongly density-dependent pre-mine mortality most probably caused by intraspecific competition in the leaf midrib. This lead to the formation of a single mine on most leaves. There was a weak density-dependent effect of mine density on miscellaneous larval death and on the attack rates of the larval parasitoid Chrysocaris gemma. 7. In the holly leaf-miner system phenology effects set a population ceiling delimited by the availability of oviposition sites. The resulting egg distribution determined the impact of density-dependent intraspecific competition in the leaf midrib.

Elasticity analysis, conducted on the model's output, therefore did not lead to accurate predictions. 5.

Levels of an intestinal coccidian parasite, Isospora lacazei, were manipulated in captive male greenfinches (Carduelis chloris) by suppressing the natural infections with a coccidiostatic sulphonamide drug. Subsequently, half the birds were experimentally infected, while another half continued receiving medication. 3. Over the course of the experiment the effect of our treatments upon 14 mainly haemato-serological condition indices was recorded. Additionally, changes in colour and carotenoid content of yellow tail and breast feathers, which serve as sexually dimorphic ornamental traits, were measured. 4. Eighty-nine per cent of birds hosted chronic isosporan infection before the experiment, yet experimental inoculation with mixed parasite strains resulted in drastic but transient decreases in serum carotenoid, vitamin E, triglyceride and albumin concentrations, and reduced body mass, indicating serious pathology and probable nutrient malabsorption due to damaged intestinal epithelium. 5. Laboratory-grown tail feathers of infected birds contained 52% less carotenoids and also had smaller values of chroma and hue than those of medicated birds. 6. These results suggest that coccidian infection reduced the expression of plumage coloration by creating a deficiency of carotenoids available for deposition in ornamental feathers.",103,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Carotenoids | Coccidia | Experimental infection | Plumage colour | Vitamin E,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,29

Fleas Xenopsylla conformis and Xenopsylla ramesis parasitize the rodents Meriones crassus and Gerbillus dasyurus. Previously reported isodar analysis of host selection suggested that at low density, X. conformis parasitizes M. crassus only, but with an increase in flea density, G. dasyurus is also parasitized. Xenopsylla ramesis at low density parasitizes both hosts equally, whereas at high density prefers M. crassus. The ultimate cause of underlying these patterns was suggested to be differential fitness reward of parasitism on a particular host species, while the mechanism can be adaptive host selection by fleas. 2. To justify the suggested fitness-density relations, we studied reproductive success in X. conformis and X. ramesis feeding on either M. crassus or G. dasyurus. We hypothesized that reproductive success would differ between two host species for each flea species. 3. Xenopsylla conformis parasitizing M. crassus produced more eggs than when parasitizing G. dasyurus, whereas time of oviposition and larval hatching did not depend on host species. In contrast, egg production in X. ramesis did not differ between host species. However, fleas fed on M. crassus needed fewer bloodmeals, oviposited earlier and hatching of their larvae took less time than those of fleas fed on G. dasyurus. 4. Patterns of egg production and development time in both fleas were consistent with the hypothesis that their between-host distribution arose from adaptive host selection strategy.",59,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Development time | Egg production | Fleas | Host selection | Rodents,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,30

Here we develop population models incorporating demographic stochasticity in both sexes. Furthermore, we consider the effects on the estimated time to extinction and whether density regulation acts only on females or on total population size. 2. We applied these models to two populations of polygynous great reed warblers Acrocephalus arundinaceus L. with differences in population trends to investigate the importance of considering sex in population viability models. 3. Demographic stochasticity was larger in a polygynous than in a monogamous mating system. 4. The estimated time to extinction was considerably shorter for a monogamous than for a polygynous mating system, particularly if density regulation acted only on females than rather on the total population. 5.

Under benign laboratory tank conditions we compared food consumption and metabolism of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) juveniles exposed to simulated ice cover (darkness) with fish in natural short, 6 h light, day length (without ice). Three different populations along an ice-cover gradient were tested (59°N-70°N). 2. Resting metabolism was on average 30% lower under simulated ice cover (6.6 J g-1 day-1) than under natural day length (9.4 J g-1 day-1), and the response was similar for all populations. Northern salmon grew equally well in dark and light conditions, whereas the southern grew significantly poorer in the dark. Fish from all populations fed more under natural day length than in the dark and the northern population had higher consumption than the southern. The relative high growth of fish from the northern population in the dark compared to the southern populations was due partly to higher consumption and partly to higher growth efficiency. Fish from the southern populations had negative growth efficiency in the dark. 3. We also studied the importance of ice cover under more hostile conditions in stream channels using the northern population only. Juveniles held in channels with simulated ice cover lost less energy (20 J g-1 day-1) than those held in channels with transparent cover (26 J g-1 day-1). This difference in energy loss was due partly (50%) to higher food consumption under simulated ice (4.5 and 1.6 J g -1, respectively) and partly (30%) to light-induced differences in resting metabolic rate. 4. In conclusion, both experiments showed lower metabolic costs in darkness under simulated ice cover than without ice. Under benign laboratory conditions the response to light (ice cover) varied among populations and only the northern population were able to attain positive growth in the dark. Under semi-natural conditions the lack of ice cover induced strong negative effects on the energy budget. Because energetic deficiencies are assumed to be an important cause of winter mortality, our study indicates that ice break-ups or removal following climatic change may affect winter survival significantly, particularly in northern populations.",70,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Climate change | Energy reserves | Food consumption | Light | Metabolism,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,32

Commensal mammals live in habitats that appear to provide both benefits and costs compared with natural and semi-natural (non-commensal) habitats. These commensal habitats offer potentially rich food resources but are also characterized by instability in time and space. We expected to demonstrate that animals in these habitats have high reproductive rates to counter high mortality rates and show flexibility in spatial organization. House mice (Mus musculus domesticus) are unusual because they are able to persist entirely in both commensal and non-commensal habitats, and so can provide a test of the distinctiveness of commensal populations. 2. We studied populations of commensal house mice on two neighbouring farms in North Yorkshire, UK, for 2 years by capture-mark-recapture using the robust design. A total of 568 house mice were captured, with a total of 1053 recaptures. Population size varied from nine to 93 individuals, estimated with closed population models. Apparent survival was surprisingly low (0.54 per month) and was best modelled as constant across age, sex and time. 3. In situ reproductive recruitment occurred throughout the study and was numerically more important than immigration. Immigration was important during only two intervals and was probably from untrappable areas within the study site. Breeding throughout the year allowed the population to persist despite low survival rates. The results suggested that births and deaths had more influence on the overall population dynamics than movement. 4. The population was divided into subgroups to represent the territorial, demic structure known to be present in commensal house mouse populations. Dispersal between subgroups within the population was limited, representing only 6.6% of recaptures. The low rates of dispersal suggested that house mice responded to their environment as consisting of aggregated patches of suitable habitat. 5. In comparison, non-commensal house mice have lower mortality, seasonal breeding, and individuals move more frequently and further than commensal house mice. 6. These differences illustrate the responses of house mice to the specific opportunities and demands of commensal habitats and demonstrate the importance of a flexible life-history strategy for animals exploiting these habitats.",92,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Capture-mark-recapture | Dispersal | Immigration | Recruitment | Survival,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,33

Prey behavioural changes in response to predation risk can result in significant effects on prey body growth rates and reduced reproductive output, with resultant impacts on prey population dynamics. This paper examines the influence of habitat structure on these non-lethal impacts of predation using a model, field-based experimental system, with house mice as prey. 2. Three treatments were employed in eight 50 x 50 m pens that contained mice, but allowed access to a suite of free-living vertebrate predators, which included feral foxes, feral cats and native raptors: a treatment where the natural grassland vegetation in the pens was maintained at a height < 10 cm; a treatment where small, felled cypress pine trees covered with wire netting were added to low grassland vegetation to create refuge areas covering 10-15% of the area in a pen; and a treatment where predators were excluded from a 25 x 25 m section of some pens with an underlying grassland structure. A 5 x 5 grid of felled trees was added to grassland and predator-exclusion pens to allow assessment of mouse behaviour. 3. Mice in grassland pens avoided open areas, had lower body growth rates, and began breeding later in spring than mice in both predator-exclusion areas, where they foraged more readily in the open, and in refuge pens, where mice avoided open areas but had safe access to supplementary food located within the refuge. These results occurred despite mouse population densities being much lower in grassland pens, and presumably competition for food being much less, compared with under the other treatments. 4. The results indicate predators can have significant non-lethal impacts on prey, and these effects can be mediated by habitat structure.",49,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Habitat structure | Non-lethal effects | Population dynamics | Predation | Refuge,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,34

Previously unnoticed patterns emerged in the lengths and slopes of trophic links of the food web of Tuesday Lake, Michigan, USA, when species were plotted on axes of log body mass (vertical) vs. log numerical abundance (horizontal). Link length was defined as equal to the number of orders of magnitude difference in mean body size between predator and prey plus the number of orders of magnitude difference in numerical abundance between predator and prey. 2. The average length over all trophic links was 6.2 [SD (standard deviation) = 2.8] orders of magnitude in 1984, and 5.8 (SD = 2.6) in 1986. Thus, for the average link, the ratio of the mean body mass of predator to prey, times the ratio of the numerical abundance of prey to predator, was about one million (106±). To a first approximation the typical predator was 10 times as long as its prey but 1000 times less numerically abundant. Link length distributions were approximately normal. Mean link lengths in 1984 and 1986 were not statistically different, but were more than an order of magnitude larger than the mean distance between all possible ordered pairs of species in each year. Ordered pairs of species that were between 9 and 11 orders of magnitude apart were the most likely to be links in both years. 3. The angle of a (non-cannibalistic) link was defined so that an angle of 135° indicates that the predator was larger than the prey by exactly as many orders of magnitude as the prey was numerically more abundant than the predator, and so that the biomass (mean body mass times numerical abundance) of predator and prey were equal. For all non-cannibalistic links, the median angle was 132° in 1984 and 129° in 1986. Both of these angles were significantly less than 135°. Angle deviated much from its median value only for short links. When the link was short or had the median angle, the predator species' biomass was probably greater than that of the prey species. 4. Several models of food web structure failed to reproduce the observed normal distribution of link lengths. Observed predation matrices with species ordered by body mass had links arranged in blocks suggesting functional groups. Models that incorporated this block structure reproduced the normal link length distribution, but a model that forced a normal link length distribution did not produce blocks.

Other patch characteristics, including aspect, amount of vegetation within the patch and an index of habitat quality based on survival probability of pikas also had a significant influence on recolonization. 4.

Although conceptually robust, it has proven difficult to find practical measures of niche width that are simple to obtain, yet provide an adequate descriptor of the ecological position of the population examined. 2. Trophic niche has proven more tractable than other niche dimensions. However, indices used as a proxy for trophic niche width often suffer from the following difficulties. Such indices rarely lie along a single scale making comparisons between populations or species difficult; have difficulty in combining dietary prey diversity and evenness in an ecologically meaningful way; and fail to integrate diet over ecological time-scales thus usually only comprise single snapshots of niche width. 3. We propose an alternative novel method for the comparison of trophic niche width: the use of variance of tissue stable isotope ratios, especially those of nitrogen and carbon. 4. This approach is a potentially powerful method of measuring trophic niche width, particularly if combined with conventional approaches, because: it provides a single measure on a continuous axis that is common to all species; it integrates information on only assimilated prey over time; the integration period changes with choice of tissue sampled; and data production is theoretically fast and testing among populations simple. 5.

Host acceptance decision in parasitic wasps depends strongly on the parasitism status of the encountered host. In solitary species, a host allows the development of only a single parasitic larva, and then any oviposition in an already parasitized host leads to larval competition and to potential loss of offspring. The ability of parasitoids to discriminate between parasitized and healthy hosts is well documented. Despite this, parasitized hosts are still accepted by the foraging wasps, an occurrence termed superparasitism. 2. In the last decades, theoretical studies have suggested that under certain circumstances superparasitism can be optimal. Generally, the superparasitism theory predicts that the optimal host acceptance decision should follow a zero-one rule: in response to both environmental and physiological state characteristics, a given female should switch from acceptance to rejection of parasitized hosts. 3. However, some experiments have shown that parasitoids may decide to accept parasitized hosts with an intermediate probability. 4. A model was developed in order to explain this partial preference in parasitoids. 5. More generally, the present study demonstrates that when the consequences of one decision cannot be predicted perfectly, the optimal decision rules could be stochastic rather than deterministic. Accordingly, behavioural stochasticity need not necessarily result from errors in decision-making or from an incapacity to assess the actual environmental state but could instead have evolved as the optimal response to the uncertainty of future environmental state.",13,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Host selection | Partial preferences | Solitary parasitoids | Stochastic decision,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,40

Dispersal contributes to spatio-temporal variation in population size and is a key process in studies of life history evolution and studies with conservation implications. However, dispersal is still one of the major gaps in our knowledge of ecological dynamics. The very large literature on metapopulation dynamics lacks empirical bases on dispersal and relevant behavioural parameters. We used multistate capture-recapture models (data from 1988 to 2001) to address hypotheses about movement probability and habitat selection within a system of two breeding colonies in Audouin's gulls (Larus audouinii), an endemic species breeding in the Mediterranean and considered as threatened. 2. Movement probability varied over time, and differed greatly between the colonies. 3. We did not find evidence of an influence of colony size or density of predators on movement probability. 4. In dispersers, our results did not support the hypotheses that movement probability between year t and t + 1 was influenced by mean breeding success in the colony of origin (i.e. an indicator of habitat quality) or the destination colony in year t or t + 1, or by the ratio of breeding success in these colonies in year t or t + 1 (i.e. quality gradient). 5. Overall, movement probability was higher from the smaller colony to the larger, and from the colony with lower breeding success in year t to the more productive one. This provides slight support for two nonexclusive hypotheses about habitat selection (conspecific attraction and conspecific success attraction). 6. Movement probability from the smaller, less productive colony was very high in some years, suggesting that the dynamics of both colonies were strongly influenced by adult dispersal. However, in absolute numbers, more individuals moved from the larger, more productive colony to the smaller one. This suggests that the system may function as a source-sink system. 7. Use of multistate models to re-assess local survival showed that survival was lower in the less productive colony with higher emigration probability.

Consequently, the epiphytic prey of small fish were free to respond to sewage enrichment, but the benthic prey of suckers were not. 4. The important elements of complexity seemed to be the factors that determine the realized pattern of feeding linkages: heterogeneity in prey vulnerability (predator-prey size ratios) and predator efficiency (vegetation cover for ambush predators, inaccessibility of epiphytic prey to bottom-feeding suckers). 5. Because of the openness of the system, the community was able to respond to enrichment by a combination of demographic (production) and behavioural (migration) mechanisms. We argue that the food web model described an energetically favourable state, and that migration provided a 'shortcut' for the system to approach this state within a short growing season.",4,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Behaviour | Bioenergetic model | Enrichment | Prey heterogeneity | Trophic control,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,43

Cyclic dynamics of various periods are pervasive in many insect populations where interactions with natural enemies are known to be important. How stage-structured processes within the host population, such as competition and cannibalism, affect these interactions has received little attention so far. 2. Using the well-studied laboratory host-parasitoid system of Plodia interpunctella and Venturia canescens, we explore a series of host-parasitoid models of increasing complexity. Specifically, we identify the circumstances under which stage-structured processes both within the host and parasitoid populations generate dynamical behaviour ranging from generation to true consumer-resource (multi-generation) cycles. 3. We find that both within-host interactions (strong competition and egg cannibalism by late instar larvae) and parasitoid recruitment structure (a developmental lag in the parasitism of larvae) can suppress long period cycles and promote host generation cycles. In short, we show that simple stage-structured processes in both host and parasitoid can modulate the strength of the consumer-resource interaction. 4. For some parameters we find more than one stable cyclic attractor. The presence of multiple attractors means that the same mechanism can give rise to cycles of different periods depending on initial population numbers. Because the host-alone system may exhibit transient dynamics for a substantial period, the timing of a parasitoid invasion can be crucial to the dynamical outcome. 5. We discuss the consequences of using a single descriptor of an ecological time series, the cycle period, to infer properties about the underlying system and its food web interactions.",26,Journal,re,Review,100,4,4,Cannibalism | Multiple attractors | Plodia-Venturia | Population cycles | Stage-structured models,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,44

Bison (Bison bison) abundance in Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada, declined from in excess of 10 000 bison in the late 1960s to a low of 2200 bison in the late 1990s. 2. Bovine tuberculosis (Mycobacterium bovis) and brucellosis (Brucella abortus), were introduced to Wood Buffalo National Park in the late 1920s. As each of these pathogens have the potential to reduce survival and reproduction in bison, they are suspected to have played a role in the decline in bison abundance. 3. We live-captured bison for disease testing in February and March of 1997, 1998 and 1999. Forty-nine percent tested positive for tuberculosis (i.e. were positive on the caudal fold test and/or fluorescent polarization assay, n = 342). Further, 30-9% of bison were seropositive for brucellosis (i.e. agglutinated in the buffered-plate antigen test and had a titre of 1:5 in the complement fixation test or had a titre of ≥ 1:10 in the complement fixation test, n = 346). Prevalence for both diseases increased with age and males were more likely to test positive for tuberculosis. Prevalence of either disease did not appear to be directly related to density of bison, as prevalence rates were not greater in the high density Delta population than the lower density Hay Camp and Nyarling River populations. 4. Comparison of our results to previous brucellosis and tuberculosis surveys in Wood Buffalo National Park indicates that prevalence of neither pathogen is a direct function of bison density.

Pairs on territories with large prey were more likely to initiate breeding. Females taking larger prey items experienced higher mortality rates when they bred late in the season, whereas those taking smaller prey had a greater probability of survival when laying later in the season - relationships likely linked to opposing seasonal differences in prey availability. 3. Interannual differences were by far the most influential variable assessed, affecting reproductive success and female survival. Pairs on-site in the first year of the study were more successful breeders and had greater survival prospects than those present in the latter two seasons. This pattern corresponds strongly to the observed frequency of heavy rain downpours and implicates these events as the main cause of reproductive failure and mortality amongst adult females. These detrimental effects were due probably to an increased chance of chilling, exposure and starvation for chicks and parents alike. 4. The importance of unpredictable climatic variables in shaping the reproductive success and survival of brown falcons and raptors from other regions indicates that, in the absence of significant nest predation, weather, in this case in the form of heavy rain, may well be the most important ultimate factor influencing long-term reproductive success in this group.",60,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Costs of reproduction | Fitness | Life history | Parental quality | Prey size,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,46

Fishing changes the structure of fish communities and the relative impacts of fishing are assessed usefully against a baseline. A comparable baseline in all regions is fish community structure in the absence of fishing. 2. The structure of unexploited communities cannot always be predicted from historical data because fisheries exploitation usually precedes scientific investigation and non-fisheries impacts, such as climate change, modify ecosystems over time. 3. We propose a method, based on macroecological theory, to predict the abundance and size-structure of an unexploited fish community from a theoretical abundance-body mass relationship (size spectrum). 4. We apply the method in the intensively fished North Sea and compare the predicted structure of the unexploited fish community with contemporary community data. 5. We suggest that the current biomass of large fishes weighing 4-16 kg and 16-66 kg, respectively, is 97.4% and 99.2% lower than in the absence of fisheries exploitation. The results suggest that depletion of large fishes due to fisheries exploitation exceeds that described in many short-term studies. 6.

The increased turnover time of the fish community will lead to greater interannual instability in biomass and production, complicating management action and increasing the sensitivity of populations to environmental change. 8.

In Britain, the song thrush Turdus philomelos is categorized as a species of high national conservation concern because of a large population decline during the last three decades. We calculated a series of annual national population estimates for woodland and farmland habitats combined for the period 1964-2000. We then used turning points analysis to identify seven blocks of years within the period of decline (1968-2000) with uniform rates of population change in the smoothed trend. 2. We used recoveries of song thrushes ringed as nestlings, juveniles and adults during April-September to estimate survival rates separately for the post-fledging period, the remainder of the first year and for adults. Daily survival probability was lower during the post-fledging period than during the remainder of the first year or for older birds. 3. There was evidence for variation in survival rates among blocks of years with different rates of population change, particularly for first-year survival. There were significant positive correlations across blocks between mean population multiplication rate (PMR) and both post-fledging and first-year survival. 4. Survival of first-year birds was correlated negatively with the duration of the longest run of frost days and the survival of adults was correlated negatively with the duration of the longest summer drought. Variation among blocks in mean PMR was correlated with block means of the duration of runs of frost days and drought days, but significant correlations between PMR and both post-fledging and first-year survival remained after allowing for the influence of weather on survival. 5. Changes in survival in the first winter, and perhaps also the post-fledging period, are sufficient to have caused the song thrush population decline.

We considered the impact of an emerging pathogen (Mycoplasma gallisepticum Edward and Kanarek) on apparent survival, encounter and transition rates in a population of a novel host (the house finch, Carpodacus mexicanus Müller). We used a multi-state analysis of mark-encounter data from individually marked birds. Individual birds were categorized to a particular disease 'state'; transition rates among states, conditional on apparent survival, were analogous to rates of new infection and recovery from infection. We hypothesized that M. gallisepticum infection would reduce the apparent survival of infected individuals, and that the magnitude of this reduction would vary as a function of the physiological condition of the host (which was characterized in our analyses by including a demographic and an environmental surrogate as covariates). 2. We found consistent support for the hypothesis that M. gallisepticum infection resulted in lower apparent survival among infected individuals, and that recovery rates (from infected to non-infected) were greater than infection rates in this population. We also found strong evidence indicating that infected individuals were less likely to be encountered than were non-infected individuals. Although we predicted that both sex and temperature (proxies for physiological condition) would explain a significant proportion of the variation in our data, only marginal influences of both factors on apparent survival, encounter and state transition rates were detected. 3. Our analyses identified several factors that may be important to studies of disease in the wild. First, disease state assignment may be uncertain, which can complicate parameter estimation. Secondly, encounter rate for infected individuals in our study was low relative to that for non-infected individuals, reflecting possible behavioural changes in infected individuals. Low encounter rates reduces precision of estimated parameters, especially for multistate models. Finally, our results (and mark-recapture models in general) assume independence among individual birds. However, we are aware that there is a social structuring in house finches (and in general for many bird species). Accounting for such non-independence may be especially important for situations where the state transitions are directly related to the pattern of social contact.",104,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Carpodacus mexicanus | Disease dynamics | Multistate mark-recapture | Sex effects | Temperature effects,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,50

Synchronous fluctuations of the abundance of several populations at a regional scale can be a sign of a climatic effect on their dynamics (Moran effect). However, the interpretation of spatial synchrony is often complicated by the interaction between climatic disturbances and migrations between the studied populations. 2. We addressed this question by studying 24-year time-series of abundance estimates for four populations of four fish species in three different catchment basins in Côte d'Ivoire (West Africa). As localities from two different basins cannot exchange individuals, dispersal cannot be considered a synchronizing factor in this system. 3. A sign test performed on the four site x site correlation matrices rejected the null hypothesis of no spatial synchrony. No relation was detected in relating the level of synchrony in species dynamics (r = 0.58 on average) to the geographical distances between the four sites (176-367 km). A more detailed analysis taking account of sampling error was carried out between two sites, and confirmed the above results. When corrected for sampling noise, high values of spatial synchrony were obtained (r = 0.88 on average). 4. Interspecific spatial synchronies (r = 0.57 on average) were almost as high as intraspecific values, suggesting that the four species are reacting in the same way to the same Moran effect. 5. A good correlation (r = 0.54) between a regional river discharge index and the total catch of the four species 1 year later was observed, suggesting that hydrological variability is one of the main synchronizing factors. Moreover, as expected on theoretical grounds, spatial synchrony in river discharge (r = 0.84 and 0.88 on a log scale) is similar to spatial synchrony in population dynamics (r = 0.88 on average and corrected for sampling error).",40,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Disconnected populations | Hydrology | Moran effect | Sampling error | Within and between species synchrony,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,51

Despite its importance in the evolution of central-place foraging strategies, few studies have distinguished between patch use by parent birds for their own consumption vs. patch use for the purpose of provisioning young in the nest. 2. Adult Palestine sunbirds (Nectarinia osea) consume nectar and arthropods, but feed only arthropods to their nestlings. This partial separation of food types allowed us to experimentally test sex-specific trade-offs in parental foraging effort between two patches. 3. A 'variable' patch on one side of a pair's territory contained only artificial nectar for parental self-feeding (in varying sucrose concentrations between 0.25 and 0.75 mol kg-1 H2O). A 'constant' patch on the other side of the territory contained artificial nectar for parental self-feeding (sucrose concentration = 0.25 mol kg-1 H2O), plus a dish of flightless houseflies for provisioning young. 4. Experimental increases in sucrose concentration in the variable patch led the parents to: (a) consume greater amounts of sucrose solution from this patch; (b) collect more flies from the constant patch to feed their young; and (c) persistently use the 0.25 mol kg-1 H 2O feeder near the dish of flies. By titration (gradually changing the sucrose concentration in the variable patch), we demonstrate that at concentrations of 0.47 mol kg-1 H2O for males and 0.55 mol kg-1 H2O for females, the birds spent an equal amount of time foraging in both patches. Therefore, sucrose concentration in the variable patch (for self-feeding only), had to be higher for the females than for the males, in order to balance the additional value females placed upon the flies provided for chick-feeding in the constant patch. 5. These results reflect previously described sex-specific parental roles in this species, with females provisioning young mainly in the nest and males patrolling more and guarding against nest predators. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time the fine details of alternative adaptive trade-offs in foraging effort by parent birds when using patches for self-feeding or for delivery of food to the young.",25,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Behavioural titration | Foraging | Nectarinia osea | Parental care | Sunbirds,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,52

The Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) is one of the most widely applied theoretical concepts in ecology. Many experimental tests of the IFD incorporating unequal competitors have revealed three consistent departures of observed results from those predicted by the theory. Specifically these are: (1) the full range of predicted equilibria are rarely realized; (2) under-matching of individuals to resource inputs; and (3) continued movement of individuals after equilibrium is reached. 2. It has been suggested previously that a model including simple random movements can explain simultaneously all three of these departures. The acceptance of this theory has been hindered by arguments about model construction relating to the timing of events and whether an analytical or individual-based model is more appropriate. 3. Here we present the first internally consistent and biologically realistic model of the IFD incorporating random non-IFD movements (movements made at a rate independent of intake rates). We use this model to confirm that random movements alone can explain all three of the observed departures from the IFD. Furthermore, it is not necessary to have any detailed a priori knowledge about the motivation behind the non-IFD movements, in order to predict their consequences. We expect non-IFD movements to be widespread in animal systems, and so warrant further experimental consideration and investigation.",18,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Individual based model | Markov Chain-Monte Carlo | Unequal competitors,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,55

Identifying which age-specific demographic rates underlie variation in a population's growth rate (λ) is an important step towards understanding the population's dynamics. Using data from a 20-year study of marked individuals, we describe patterns of demographic variation and covariation in the Scottish red-billed chough population (Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax), and investigate which demographic rates have the greatest projected and realized influence on λ. 2. Survival, the probability of breeding and breeding success varied with age in this population. Data were sufficient to estimate year-specific probabilities of first-year, second-year and adult (all ages over 2) survival and mean breeding success. A population trajectory modelled using these parameter estimates closely matched census data, suggesting that estimates and simplifying assumptions were sufficient to accurately describe important demographic processes. 3. Elasticity analyses based on stage-classes for which year-specific survival was estimable suggested that A, was more elastic to variation in adult survival than first- or second-year survival or breeding success. These ranks were consistent across all 15 years for which λ could be estimated directly, although the elasticity of adult survival declined with population growth. 4. Survival and breeding success were positively correlated across years. λ remained most sensitive to adult survival when this demographic covariation was incorporated into elasticity analyses. 5. However, elasticities calculated from a fully age-structured model suggested that λ was more elastic to variation in first- and second-year survival than to survival at any individual older age class. These ranks were robust to realistic demographic variation, but sensitive to postulated patterns of demographic covariation. We emphasize that covariation should be measured and incorporated into elasticity analyses, and that estimated elasticities must be interpreted in the context of the way in which stage-classes are defined. 6. Of the demographic rates in which we quantified between-year variation, first-year survival varied most, followed by second-year survival, breeding success and adult survival. These rates consequently contributed more equally to variation in λ than elasticities predicted. Overall, variation in λ was caused primarily by variation in survival rather than breeding success, and variation in prebreeding survival accounted for 56% of the total variation in λ.",55,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Age-specific reproduction | Integrated elasticity | Life-history covariation | Sensitivity | Survival,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,56

Mobility and emigration were investigated for the wolf spider Pardosa monticola in grey dune fragments from two high-density and one low-density population, where population density was related to patch quality. Pitfall trapping was applied in combination with absolute density estimates by means of quadrat sampling. Orientation behaviour was additionally observed in the high- and low-density patches during two periods in the adult life-phase (mating and reproduction period). Dune grassland is the core habitat; moss dominated vegetation is the matrix in which dispersal occurs. 2. Our field experiments confirm the hypothesis that increased activities of a dune wolf spider in a low-density habitat result in higher emigration rates. 3. The diffusive emigration rates, which are higher close to the patch border, and mobility within the patch are higher in the low-density population. In the low-density patch, females are even more active than males and emigrate in the same proportions as males. 4. Both males and females were not able to orientate and perform homeward movements during the spring period, in which vegetation height is more or less equal in the core habitat (grassland) and the matrix (moss dune). In June, no homeward orientation was observed in the habitat patch with low quality and low densities (low vegetation height). In the high-density patch, females but not males were able to perform homeward orientation behaviour at distances close to the pronounced border between grassland and moss dune. At distances of 3 m, females also orientated randomly. 5. The pattern of differentiated homeward orientation behaviour indicates that it results from visual perception of high contrast borders by the females but not by the males or by sex-differentiated motivation to return to the core habitat. 6.

Stable isotope values of specialist feeders, Olrolg's (Larus atlanticus) and dolphin gulls (Leucophaeus scoresbii), which were previously assumed to feed mainly on crabs and sea lion excrement, respectively, suggested a broader diet than expected. 4. Based on stable isotope values of individuals, groups of phylogenetically related species generally showed a high degree of overlap within each group. 5. Given the degree of isotope overlap in this species-rich community, coexistence could be interpreted as a consequence of superabundance of food or species diversification in morphology and foraging strategies. The short range of trophic level makes these seabirds vulnerable to the reduction of fish stocks due either to commercial fishing or stochastic fluctuations.",105,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Argentinean coast of Patagonia | Food relationships | Seabird community | Stable-isotopes,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,58

Invertebrate community assembly is described for two contrasting proglacial chronosequences (over 1900 years) at Kongsfjord, W. Spitsbergen, Svalbard. 2. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) community assembly is deterministic, directional and predictable; (2) succession is inextricably linked to plant community and soil development; and (3) dispersal is a rate-limiting factor for community assembly. 3. Communities, dominated by omnivores and detritivores, are more complex than supposed previously. Herbivore species were few but predators, parasitoids and hyperparasitoids were abundant. 4. Species fell within one of eight defined groups with respect to colonization. This relates to ecophysiological tolerances, need for facilitation or dependence on other species. Spiders, surface-active Collembola and drought-resistant cryptostigmatic mites arrived before vascular plants established and soils developed. Later colonizers required site facilitation through soil development or host availability. 5. Comparisons between the proglacial area of Midtre Lovénbre, a land-terminating glacier, and three Lovén Islands, released from beneath a tidewater glacier, showed similarities in community composition and species abundance with respect to successional stage, suggesting determinism and direction in community development. 6.

Body size is a central parameter in determining prey selection, and where animals exhibit large increases in size, ontogenetic diet shifts are common. Optimal foraging models have proved to be useful tools in predicting changes in diet, but previous applications have been limited to those associated with changes in external drivers such as habitat use. 2. We conducted laboratory and field experiments to parameterize an optimal foraging model to test whether prey choice can be determined by internal mechanisms such as metabolism. 3. Model predictions were made for Pomatoschistus microps, the common goby (Pisces: Gobiidae), a sit-and-wait predator that exhibits a shift in prey choice independently of external drivers. The model predicted a change in diet at a fish length of 30 mm, which agrees well with existing empirical observations. This is the first time the link between metabolism and prey choice has been considered as a major determinant of diet shifts. 4. P. microps, using a sit-and-wait foraging mode, were expected to act as cost-minimizers but the model indicated that gobies were typically not time-limited and that prey selection maximized energy intake rates both before and after the diet shift. 5.

Predictions about how species will respond to climate warming are based commonly on eco-physiological models or niche models.

We examined how resource competition affects the responses of two ciliate species, Colpidium striatum Stein and Paramecium tetraurelia Sonneborn, to warming in laboratory microcosms. 3. We found that warming had a negative effect on Colpidium abundance and a negligible effect on Paramecium abundance in the absence of interspecific competition. When Colpidium and Paramecium competed, however, Paramecium coexisted with Colpidium at low and high temperatures, and was competitively excluded at intermediate temperatures. 4. Temperature-dependent strength of the interaction between Colpidium and Paramecium may explain the unexpected responses of Paramecium, which were inconsistent with its response to temperature in the absence of Colpidium. 5.

Animal aggregation has been well studied, with many proximate and ultimate models proposed. Many of the proximate models have relied on cost-benefit arguments, but frequently aspects of cost have been inferred in relation to position in group. An expected cost to an animal that rests in aggregations, but departs to forage, is that being in the centre of a group may impede foraging opportunities, in that 'inner' animals cannot leave to forage until outer animals have done so. 2. Experiments with a limpet Cellana tramoserica, on a rocky shore in New South Wales, Australia, showed that central limpets remain central more often than would be expected by chance. In respect of costs due to access to foraging, we show that there is no effect of position (central vs. outer) in timing of foraging excursions or of feeding-rate. We also show that an aggregated distribution of C. tramoserica at rest does not translate into an aggregated distribution of foraging animals. 3. We propose that aggregations of C. tramoserica are probably a function of how the group reassembles after foraging and is much dependent on processes happening at a small spatial scale.

After its initial discovery in Macedonia in 1985, during the last 19 years the leafminer moth Cameraria ohridella has invaded most of Central and Western Europe. The species, which causes aesthetic damage to horse chestnuts, is generally observed first in highly populated locations before colonizing the countryside. This pattern is consistent with a stratified dispersal process combining long-distance movements and local diffusion. 2. Using large-scale spatial data on damage caused by Cameraria ohridella in Germany, three stochastic spatial models of spread are compared: a diffusion model, a leptokurtic dispersal model and a stratified dispersal model that assumes a two-scale dispersal process. In addition, the association between human population and moth invasion is tested in this last model by linking long-distance infestation probability to human population density. Finally, these spatial models constructed with data from Germany are tested at the European scale and compared to historical records of first occurrence. 3. The fat-tailed dispersal kernel models (leptokurtic and stratified dispersal models) allowing for long-distance dispersal provide better predictions than the diffusion model. Among these models, the stratified dispersal model incorporating the effect of human population density provides the best description of the spread of Cameraria ohridella in Germany in predictive (lowest sum of squared errors) and qualitative (similar fractal dimension) terms. 4.

All kills observed by safari guides are documented routinely in Mala Mala Private Game Reserve, South Africa.

Males and females of the sexually dimorphic felid species were treated as functionally distinct predator types. Prey types were classified by species, sex and age class. 3. Prey profiles were compared among predator types in terms of richness and evenness to consider how both the range of prey types used and the dominance of particular prey types within each range may be influenced by predator size. No significant size-dependent relationships were found, so factors separate from or additional to body size must explain variation in prey diversity across sympatric predators. 4. A statistically strong relationship was found between mean prey mass and predator mass (r 2 = 0.86, P = 0.002), although pairwise comparisons showed that most predators killed similar prey despite wide differences in predator size. Also, minimum prey mass was independent of predator mass while maximum prey mass was strongly dependent on predator mass (r2 = 0.71, P = 0.017).

We test the hypothesis that leaf mine appearance can affect the risk of leafminers being discovered by parasitoids, and therefore influence parasitic assemblages, using a comparative study of parasitic complexes associated with 28 agromyzid species in Central Argentina. Analyses were based on size, structure (defined as the number of species in host-range categories) and impact (percentage parasitism) of parasitic complexes on leafminers. Mine appearance was defined in terms of shape (linear, linear-blotch, blotch) and colour (high or low contrast with the leaf lamina). 2. Irrespective of the agromyzid species involved, significant differences were found in the structure of the parasitoid complexes: specialists were more abundant and generalists rarer than expected in blotch and cryptically coloured mines. 3. There were no differences in average parasitoid species richness and parasitism rates among differently coloured or shaped galleries. However, mine appearance significantly affected parasitic assemblage structure, with shape driving generalist species richness and contrast influencing that of specialists. Mine shape also affected parasitism rates, which were highest for generalists in linear mines, and for specialists in blotch mines. The existence of a gradient of discovery from the cryptically coloured blotch mines to the most apparent highly contrasting linear ones was supported by significant correlations of this gradient with richness and parasitism rates of generalist and specialist parasitoids. 4. Taxonomic composition of parasitic complexes (analysed through parasitoid species abundance) was separated significantly according to host mine shape. An even more significant classification of assemblages was achieved when the combination of mine shape and colour was considered in the discoverability gradient. 5.

Costs of reproduction might be mediated by a resource-allocation trade-off between immunity and reproductive effort. Recent studies have suggested that the moult-breeding overlap observed mainly in males may affect this trade-off. In order to test whether increased investment in immunity may affect the onset of moult or reproductive output in a species with moult-breeding overlap, we immunized breeding male pied flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca (Pallas) with a non-pathogenic antigen (sheep red blood cells) in the first week post-hatching and compared their moult score, parental effort and reproductive success shortly before fledging with that of control males injected with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. 2. Immunized males provisioning nestlings delayed the onset of post-nuptial primary moult compared to control males. The experimental activation of the immune defence of males affected their stress levels (heterophile/lymphocyte ratio, heat-shock proteins) on day 13 after chicks hatched. An activated immune response tended to depress reproductive output, although the experimental design was not efficient enough to find a significant effect because the manipulation was not performed early enough in the nestling period. 3. The results suggest that experimental activation of the males' immune system decreased the resources necessary for initiating post-nuptial moult. The trade-off between immunity and moult onset may imply costs of delayed moult in cases of infection and may interact with reproductive immunosuppression in cases of moult-breeding overlap.

Strong density-dependent survival stabilized the population at a similar density in all three stretches within the first 4 months of life for the 1997 cohort and somewhat later for the 1998 cohort.

In this study, foraging trip duration and brood-cell density (in trap nests exposed for a 15-month period) were analysed for three species, which represent three guilds in 24 agroforestry systems in Central Sulawesi (Indonesia): the pollinator Heriades sp. aff fulvescens (Apidae), the cacao caterpillar-hunting predator Rhynchium haemorrhoidale umeroatrum (Eumenidae) and the spider-hunting predator Auplopus levicarinatus (Pompilidae). The agroforestry systems were characterized by plant species richness, blossom cover of herbs, light intensity and distance from the nearest natural forest. 3. The correlation of foraging time to bee and wasp density showed the relative importance of food and nest-site availability for the pollinator and the spider-hunting predator, because both parameters are correlated with light intensity in the agroforestry systems. In contrast, foraging time and nest density of the eumenid predator were not correlated because of the distance between high quantities of food resources (in sites with dense cacao plants) and nesting sites (in adjacent natural forests). 4. The eumenid response to local and regional agroforestry management illustrates that species may survive only in landscapes that permit access to a multiple set of resources.

Predation has been suggested as a major cause affecting survival, reproductive success and behaviour in vertebrate prey populations. The breeding season is a critical phase because the essential difference between selecting the proper nest site may be a question of breeding success and failure. 2. Islands may serve as refuges for ground-nesting birds against natural mammalian predators. However, many of the bird species breeding on islands are currently threatened by introduced predators because they may lack mechanisms to confront the threats of the new predator. 3. We studied the combined effects of an introduced generalist predator, American mink (Mustela vison Schreb.), and island isolation and size on species richness, abundance and equilability of birds breeding on small islands in the outer archipelago of SW Finland, Baltic Sea. The study comprised two mink removal areas (one during 1993-2001 and the other during 1998-2001) and two comparable control areas (during 1994-2001 and 1998-2001), each covering 72-130 km2, of which between 1.07 and 1.27 km2 were land area. The mean island size in all areas was < 2 ha. 4. In the two control areas, both the species richness and abundance were highest on the most isolated islands, while isolation did not have obvious effects on these variables in mink removal areas. Species equitability was not influenced by mink removal or island isolation. 5. The distribution of a maritime species, the razorbill (Alca torda L.), has changed dramatically: in the 1973-74, before mink invaded the area, the species was found commonly on less isolated islands than in 1994, after mink invasion. 6. We suggest that in the presence of mink birds may have changed their breeding site selection and started to breed on the most isolated islands, which are not visited by mink as frequently as less isolated islands. Therefore, our results indicate that increasing island isolation may increase the number of bird species and their numbers, because island isolation slows down mink dispersal.",76,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Archipelago birds | Breeding behaviour | Introduced predator | Nest site selection | Prey distribution,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,72

Furthermore, many of the published methods for investigating patterns of species co-occurrence do not account for potential differences in the site characteristics that may partially (at least) explain non-random patterns (e.g. due to species having similar/different habitat preferences). 3. Here we present a statistical method for modelling co-occurrence patterns between species while accounting for imperfect detection and site characteristics. This method requires that multiple presence/absence surveys for the species be conducted over a reasonably short period of time at most sites. The method yields unbiased estimates of probabilities of occurrence, and is practical when the number of species is small (< 4). 4. To illustrate the method we consider data collected on two terrestrial salamander species, Plethodonjordani and members of the Plethodon glutinosus complex, collected in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, USA. We find no evidence that the species do not occur independently at sites once site elevation has been allowed for, although we find some evidence of a statistical interaction between species in terms of detectability that we suggest may be due to changes in relative abundances.",284,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,Detectability | Great Smoky Mountains National Park | Likelihood | Occupancy | Plethodon glutinosus complex | Plethodon jordani,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,73

Recent efforts to understand how the patterning of interaction strength affects both structure and dynamics in food webs have highlighted several obstacles to productive synthesis. Issues arise with respect to goals and driving questions, methods and approaches, and placing results in the context of broader ecological theory. 2. Much confusion stems from lack of clarity about whether the questions posed relate to community-level patterns or to species dynamics, and to what authors actually mean by the term 'interaction strength'. Here, we describe the various ways in which this term has been applied and discuss the implications of loose terminology and definition for the development of this field. 3. Of particular concern is the clear gap between theoretical and empirical investigations of interaction strengths and food web dynamics. The ecological community urgently needs to explore new ways to estimate biologically reasonable model coefficients from empirical data, such as foraging rates, body size, metabolic rate, biomass distribution and other species traits. 4. Combining numerical and analytical modelling approaches should allow exploration of the conditions under which different interaction strengths metrics are interchangeable with regard to relative magnitude, system responses, and species identity. 5. Finally, the prime focus on predator-prey links in much of the research to date on interaction strengths in food webs has meant that the potential significance of nontrophic interactions, such as competition, facilitation and biotic disturbance, has been largely ignored by the food web community. Such interactions may be important dynamically and should be routinely included in future food web research programmes.",406,Journal,re,Review,100,14,14,Allometry | Body size | Ecological networks | Interaction strength | Keystone species | Population dynamics | Stability,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,74

A new procedure for estimating the population densities of ground-dwelling arthropods with pitfall trapping is described. It couples the fitting of single hyperbolic functions to trap data with the use of a 'nested-cross array', a cross-shaped trap arrangement with distances between traps doubling with increasing distance from the central trap. 2. We used individual-based simulation modelling to test the method's reliability given changes in population density, turning rate, trapping period, beetle distribution and intertrap distance. 3. Simulations show that function fits are more likely, and density estimates more accurate, with greater body size and therefore with net displacement, increasing population density, decreasing aggregation and increased turning rate. 4. Simulation indicates that the method is a promising procedure for density estimation that is worth testing in the field.

Examination of the fine-scale internal structure of species geographical ranges, and interspecific variation therein across landscapes, contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the structure of geographical ranges. Two components of this internal structure that require further examination are the occurrence, extent and position of spatial autocorrelation, and relationships between the spatial abundance structures of closely related, ecologically similar species. 2. Here we compare the abundance structures of an assemblage of gall-forming sawflies (Tenthredinidae) across a landscape. We identify the relative roles of spatial and non-spatial factors in explaining their abundance structures and test the hypothesis that sawfly density is explained by host plant quality, as has been demonstrated repeatedly at finer scales. We use these results to distinguish between alternative sets of mechanisms that may be operating at the landscape scale. 3. Species densities were mainly multimodal across the landscape and significantly spatially structured, with patch, periodic and trend components. The abundance structures thus mimic those found generally for species across the full extent of their geographical ranges. 4. Many abundance structure characteristics were unique to species, with differences in their correlogram profiles, distances over which densities were positively autocorrelated, and the absence of significant spatial structure in one species. 5. In contrast to previous, fine-scale studies, host plant quality explained little of the variation in sawfly gall density across the landscape, whereas unexplained spatial structure contributed between 30% and 50%. Based on knowledge of the biology of these species and the absence of competitive interactions, species dispersal characteristics and the Moran effect are suggested as probable alternative hypotheses at this scale. 6. Therefore, a spatial approach has identified the hierarchical nature of mechanisms underlying the population dynamics of this sawfly assemblage for the first time. Furthermore, it has highlighted the importance of spatial processes in explaining the densities of species at the landscape scale, as well as the individualistic nature of their abundance structures.",41,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Moran effect | Population dynamics | SADIE | Salix lasiolepis | Spatial autocorrelation,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,76

Harmonia axyridis is a generalist predator with a high range of accepted prey. Prey differ in nutritive contents, energetic values and cost associated with their capture and ingestion. As a result of selection pressures, animals will tend to hunt for their prey efficiently. In this paper we evaluated the suitability of Myzus persicae and Aphis fabae to the adults of the aulica phenotype of H. axyridis, their feeding preferences and the impact of mixed diets on their fitness. Feeding preference of predators was evaluated through their response to different relative abundance of prey. 2. Under a single diet regime, the adults of the aulica phenotype fed on more individuals M. persicae than A. fabae but consumed less biomass from the former. None of those prey affect relative growth rate and reproductive capacity of the ladybeetles. 3. Males and females present different types of response to three levels of different relative abundance of prey. While males show a constant feeding preference for M. persicae, females did not show a feeding preference (i.e. null switching response). Under a mixed diet regime, adults' voracity gradually increased as the proportion of M. persicae increased, but biomass consumed and relative growth rate was not affected. On the other hand, fecundity and fertility increased. 4. Our results suggest that H. axyridis present self-selection behaviour because they agree with the basic criteria of Waldbauer and Friedman's self-selection, i.e. (i) the animal's choice of food or nutrients is non-random, and (ii) the coccinellid benefits from self-selecting.",71,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Aphis fabae Scopoli | Harmonia axyridis Pallas | Myzus persicae Sulzer | Prey preference | Reproductive capacity | Voracity,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,77

The local stability properties of the resulting food web models were then determined. 5. We found that by choosing interaction strengths using an empirically defined scaling law, the resulting food web models are always dynamically stable, despite the residual uncertainties in the modelling approach. This contrasts with the statistical expectation that random webs with random parameters have a vanishingly improbable chance of stability. 6.

On west-coast Irish shores, where native congeneric hosts were more common, significantly more P. dendritica attacked C. tomentosum on the shore whereas Elysia viridis disproportionately attacked the exotics. In Lough Hyne, Co. Cork, Ireland, juvenile E. viridis attacked both C. fragile ssp. tomentosoides and the native, sympatric C. vermilara; in pairwise-choice feeding trials, sacoglossans preferred the host species from which they were collected. 4. In the Channel Islands, adult E. viridis were common on C. tomentosum on Guernsey shores. In pairwise-choice feeding trials adults exhibited no preference between native and introduced hosts, indicating that the stenophagous herbivores could change their associations. 5.

Flexibility in host use enables stenophagous marine herbivores to respond within years to the presence of recently introduced hosts. The implicit peril of the host-specificity paradigm - that specialists could change their associations - does occur in stenophagous sacoglossans, and there is considerable intra- and interspecific variation in response. 7.

Much of the debate surrounding the consequences of biodiversity loss centres around the issue of whether different species are functionally similar in their effects on ecological processes.

We manipulated the biomass and density of banded sunfish (Enneacanthus obesus) and measured their impact on populations of Southern leopard frog (Rana sphenocephala) larvae. We also evaluated the ability of models relating metabolic rate to body size to predict the relative impacts of populations that differ in average body size and population density. 3. Our results indicate that population biomass, density and their interaction each play a large role in determining the effect of a predator population on its food resource. Populations with smaller but more abundant individuals had effects as large or larger than those populations with larger but fewer individuals. 4. Although we found qualitative agreement between the observed relative effects of populations with that predicted by allometric models, we also found that density-dependence can cause effects of a population to differ from that expected based on allometry. 5.

Offspring sex ratio may be an unpredictable component of life history that might select for behavioural plasticity in parental care. If the parents do not have such plasticity and the two sexes of offspring differ in size, individuals in a brood or litter biased towards the larger sex offspring may suffer from food shortage. Sibling sex ratio could also affect the young through asymmetric sex-related sibling competition. 2. We created single-sex broods of sexually size-dimorphic Eurasian kestrels (Falco tinnunculus L.) with mixed-sex control broods in order to test whether parents have behavioural plasticity to respond to the sex ratio of their brood and whether smaller male chicks suffer from reduced health status because their larger female siblings outrival them in sibling competition. The experiment was conducted during two years (2000 and 2001) that differed in the abundance of voles, the main natural prey of kestrels. 3. No obvious effects of the brood sex ratio manipulation on parental effort were detected, as there were no differences in prey delivery rate, biomass of prey brought to the nest, body mass or heterophile/lymphocyte ratio of the parents. 4. Female chicks in all-female broods had lower haematocrit levels than those in mixed-sex broods in a year of low vole abundance. As haematocrit is an index of nutritional condition and health state, this result indicates that in the year of low vole abundance the female chicks in all-female broods fledged in poorer condition than those in mixed-sex broods. 5. These results indicate that when the parents do not alter their level of parental effort in response to the sex ratio of their brood, the young in a brood biased towards the larger sex offspring can be reared successfully when food is abundant, while they may suffer under food shortage situations. 6. Kestrel chicks of both sexes had low haematocrit levels and T cell-mediated immune responses in the year of low vole abundance.

Small mammal population fluctuations, cyclic or not, have been an ecological puzzle and a source of heated debate among ecologists.

We also estimated population density, fecundity rate, age at maturity and life span on a weekly basis. 3. Survival, maturation and fecundity rates exhibited phase-related changes during major density fluctuations, but they showed density-independent temporal variations during the prolonged low-density phases. Among these variables, maturation and juvenile survival rates covaried most closely with population density. 4.

We derived a functional response function that accounted for both predator and prey size. Laboratory experiments were then performed to investigate the size relationships of the functional response of the benthic isopod Saduria entomon (L.) feeding on Monoporeia affinis (Lindström) amphipods. 2. The S. entomon predators, in general, showed sigmoid (type III) functional responses. The attack rate of S. entomon was a bent ridge-shaped function of predator and prey size. The maximum attack rates of small predators were found on small prey, and then attack rate declined rapidly as prey size increased. In large predators attack rate increased slowly up to a maximum for large prey. The shape of the attack rate was dependent on the size scaling of predator and prey body mass in the attack rate function. We suggest that the ridge-shaped attack rate function found in our study is likely to be general for predators that feed on prey with a large size range. The handling time of small S. entomon increased rapidly as prey size increased. In contrast, we found only small differences in handling time of large predators. The complete functional response may provide size-refuges for very small and large M. affinis depending on the size-structure of S. entomon. 3. To investigate the realism in our functional response estimates, we incorporated the functional response in a consumption model based on the densities and size-structures of the predator and the prey in the field (Bothnian Sea). We adjusted the attack rate using a correction factor to predict the observed survival of the different age-classes of M. affinis from field samples. The field data-based consumption model accounted for 1 year of size-dependent predation by the size-structured population of S. entomon on M. affinis.

Movement is often conditional on environmental parameters and behavioural phenotype. A reasonable assumption is that individuals behave as random walkers, when environment and behaviour are fixed. 2. Based on this assumption, observations of movements can be analysed with a set of generalized linear models. Such models can predict the occurrence of behaviour and movement distance distributions resulting from different behavioural or environmental parameters. 3. This method was applied to study short-range movement of tiger beetles (Cicindela hybrida) along corridor roads. 4. Logistic regression was used to estimate probabilities of behaviour types occurring during 5-min observation intervals. 5. Movement distances were investigated with a pair of generalized regression models for both the mean and the variance of the distances covered during observations. The models estimate mean and variance of a normal distribution per set of environmental conditions and per combination of behaviour types observed in the observation interval. 6. Flying behaviour, the number of interactions with other beetles and the amount of food items handled differed between spring and summer season. 7. Advective movement was demonstrated, and it occurred in the direction of the sun. The advection effect is more pronounced when beetles fly. We propose that this advection occurs as a side effect of thermoregulatory behaviour. 8. Diffusion or spread of displacements increased with the occurrence of flying and decreased when beetles spent time sheltering in shade or handling food. 9. Simulations were used to generate movement distributions over longer time spans, assuming that the selected model applies per time step.

Mycoplasma gallisepticum is an emerging eye disease that spread rapidly among wild house finches (Carpodacusmexicanus) in the eastern United States following initial reports of infected birds in 1994. The hallmark signs of infection have allowed systematic monitoring of disease at both local and continent-wide scales for more than 7 years since the onset of the epidemic. 2. Using data collected by a network of citizen science volunteers, we examined both long-term trends and seasonal dynamics of mycoplasmal conjunctivitis in three different climatic regions in eastern North America over a 77-month period (November 1994-March 2001). 3. Time-series prevalence data from all three regions suggest that following establishment, marked seasonal fluctuations in prevalence each year were characterized by autumn-winter epidemics (in October and February) and consistent summer declines (with prevalence falling close to zero from May to July). 4. The maximum peak, annual rates of increase and timing of epidemics varied among three geographical locations that were delineated by minimum winter temperatures. Annual autumn prevalence in the South increased more rapidly, and maximum prevalence was nearly three times greater in the South than in the colder North and Central regions. 5. Longer-term trends showed evidence for multiyear fluctuations in prevalence that were characterized by greater amplitude in the southern region. 6. Finally, monthly estimates of house finch flock sizes derived from a similar citizen science data set showed that winter flock sizes were associated positively with average monthly prevalence in the northern and central regions, although regional differences in flock sizes did not correspond to regional differences in maximum prevalence. 7. This study represents the first evidence of multiyear fluctuations, regional differences and highly predictable annual outbreaks of this recently emerged wildlife pathogen.

It is often assumed that the timing of annual migrations of marine fish to spawning grounds occurs with very little change over time. However, it is unclear how much migration is influenced by climate change in marine species that spawn at sea but spend most time in estuarine conditions, especially as thermal regimes in estuaries may differ significantly from those in the open sea. 2. Migration phenology was studied in a population of flounder, Platichthysflesus (L.) off south-west England using high-temporal resolution trawling data over a 13-year period. 3. Flounder migrated from their estuarine habitat to spawning grounds at sea some 1-2 months earlier in years that were up to 2°C cooler. Flounder arrived on the spawning grounds over a shorter time period (2-6 days) when colder than normal conditions prevailed in the estuary, compared to warmer years (12-15 days). This suggests that they were responding to low temperatures by exhibiting a more synchronous, population-level early migration. 4. The timing of migration was earlier when the largest differences in temperatures between near-estuary and offshore environments occurred, differences that were related significantly to cold, negative phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). 5. Flounder migration phenology appears to be driven to a large extent by short-term, climate-induced changes in the thermal resources of their overwintering habitat.

Many studies of the movements of riverine fish have found that most individuals are sedentary and occupy very restricted home ranges. Recently, this 'Restricted Movement Paradigm' has been challenged and there is currently a need for tests of the home range concept as a theoretical basis for describing the movements of riverine fish. In this paper, I describe a radio-tracking study of golden perch (Macquaria ambigua) and carp (Cyprinus carpio) in the Broken River, Australia that aims to assess the home range concept as a means of describing the movements of these species. 2. A random movement analysis and a translocation experiment were conducted to test for site fidelity and home range occupation. Both golden perch and carp exhibited strong site fidelity and occupied restricted home ranges. Carp had larger total home ranges than golden perch, and both species had areas of concentrated use (core areas) within the home range. 3. Several golden perch and carp exhibited shifts in the locations of their home ranges during the study. To incorporate such shifts into a theoretical framework, a 'home range shift' conceptual model is proposed and the need to consider the temporal stability of site fidelity when describing home range movements is discussed.",105,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Cyprinus carpio | Homing | Macquaria ambigua | Radio-telemetry | Site fidelity,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,87

Migration is widespread among marine fishes, yet little is known about variation in the migration of individuals within localities, and the consequences for spatial population structure. We tested the hypothesis that variation in the migratory behaviour among plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L.) in the North Sea could be explained by large-scale differences in the speed and directions of the tidal streams, which the fish use as a transport mechanism. 2. We released 752 mature female plaice tagged with electronic data storage tags at eight locations with contrasting tidal flow properties between December 1993 and September 1999. 3. The experiment yielded 20 403 days of data from 145 plaice. Individual tags recorded depth and temperature for up to 512 days. The position of each fish was determined at intervals throughout the liberty period using the tidal location method. 4. The results show that the fish were segregated into three discrete feeding aggregations during the summer non-breeding season. Two clusters were in warm, thermally mixed water in the eastern and western North Sea, respectively, and one was in deeper, cold, thermally stratified water to the north. 5. In the winter spawning period, fish from all three aggregations mixed together in the southern North Sea, and fish from the eastern and northern subunits spawned in the south-eastern North Sea. The only fish that left the North Sea were western subunit plaice that visited spawning grounds in the eastern English Channel. 6. Our results re-affirmed the major role of the tidal streams in the southern North Sea in structuring plaice dispersion, both by providing transport and guidance and by delimiting the extent of distribution due to thermal stratification during the summer. However, plaice from the northern North Sea did not use tidal stream transport. 7. These results confirm the prediction that large-scale variation in migration behaviour can be explained in part by the tidal guidance and transport mechanisms available. They have also revealed features of spatial dynamics not observed previously from a century of conventional tagging experiments and illustrate how the study of individual fish can successfully define the migratory characteristics of populations.",72,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,"Bird migration | Data storage tags | Fish behaviour | Fisheries | Flatfish, spatial dynamics | Thermal stratification",29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,88

Models of functional and aggregative responses generally assume that rates of prey encounter and handling times limit a predator's intake rate (Holling's disc equation). Two different lines of approach build upon this fundamental foraging concept. In the first, mutual interference further constrains intake rate, while in the second, intake rate may be constrained by rate of digestion. By combining both approaches, we come up with four competing models that differ in whether predators interfere and whether they face a digestive constraint. 2. The functional responses expected by these four models are tested experimentally in a medium-sized shorebird, the red knot (Calidris canutus), fed a shelled prey, the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis). The experimental results suggest that intake rate is constrained by rate of digestion at low bird densities and by interference at high bird densities. 3. Using the experimentally obtained parameters, we predicted aggregative responses for each of the four models, which we verified by using field observations. We found evidence that the combination of interference and digestive constraints similarly governed the aggregative responses of red knots. Compared to the expectations of the models that do not include digestive constraints, red knots fed in lower and more variable prey densities and were generally aggregated in denser flocks. In addition, they were packed twice as densely when feeding on hard-shelled prey than when feeding on soft-bodied prey. 4. We suggest that digestive constraints allow red knots to live in dense flocks: if digestion proceeds during interference interactions, the time-cost of interference may be negligible.",55,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Aggregative response | Calidris canutus | Digestive constraint | Functional response | Interference competition,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,89

For iteroparous organisms life-history theory predicts a trade-off between current and future reproduction, and therefore the evolution of host responses to current parasite infestation that will maximize lifetime reproductive success. The parasite-induced variation in reproductive success is thus not the net result of parasite infestation alone, but the parasite-mediated outcome of optimal resource allocation among current and future reproductive events. Understanding the importance of parasites for the evolution of host life history therefore requires an experimental investigation of the effects of parasites over the host's life span. Such studies are currently scant. 2. We manipulated the load of an ectoparasite, the hen flea (Ceratophyllus gallinae), in the nests of its most common host, the great tit (Parus major), over a period of 4 years and recorded, the components of current and future reproductive success including survival, divorce, breeding dispersal and various reproductive parameters. Finally we assessed, for females only as paternity of males was unknown, the lifetime reproductive success as a close correlate of Darwinian fitness. 3. For current reproduction, our experiment demonstrates that parasites reduce current reproductive success via an increase in the probability of nest failure during incubation and the nestling period. In the presence of fleas, clutch size and the number of fledglings were reduced while the incubation and the nestling period were prolonged. Thus parasitism led to an increase in parental effort but nevertheless reduced current reproductive success. 4. For future reproduction, the experiment shows that females breeding in infested nests dispersed over longer distances between breeding attempts. The divorce rate following infestation, the probability of breeding locally in the future and residual reproductive success were not affected significantly by ectoparasites. The study thus suggests that hen fleas play a minor role in shaping the trade-off between current and future reproduction. 5. Lifetime reproductive success of females, measured as the total number of locally recruiting offspring over the 4 experimental years, was reduced significantly by ectoparasites. The negative effect of parasites arose by a reduction of the number of fledglings per breeding attempt rather than by a reduction of the number of breeding attempts.",119,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,Ceratophyllus gallinae | Ectoparasite | Great tit | Hen flea | Host-parasite interaction | Life history | Lifetime reproductive success | Parus major,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,90

Offspring growth was not affected by either maternal parasite infection or direct parasite infection. Body mass of all pups at sexual maturity was equivalent but there were differences in body composition (fat mass, organ masses) between parasitized and unparasitized pups and between males and females. 5. Only offspring from parasitized mothers cleared their own infection but for offspring that retained their infection there were no effects of either offspring sex or maternal parasite infection on infection intensity. 6.

The leech, Erpobdella octoculata (L.), occurred as two local populations at sites A (deep section with macrophytes) and B (shallow stony section) in a small stream. A June census estimated densities of young leeches (R1 m-2) and mature leeches (R2 m -2) towards the end of the first and second years of the life cycle, respectively. An August census estimated the density of cocoons laid by the mature leeches before they died in autumn. Cocoon density multiplied by the mean number of young per cocoon estimated the density of young produced at the end of each year-class (R3 m-2) and also the density at the start of the next year-class (S m-2). Information was obtained for 25 year-classes (1966-90). 2. The spatial distribution of the leeches and their cocoons was aggregated and similar at both sites in spite of the marked differences in habitat. Survivor density at three life stages (R1, R2, R3) was related to the density of young at the start of each year-class (S), the density-dependent relationship being described by a dome-shaped Ricker curve that differed markedly between sites. A few year-classes were excluded from the analyses because their density was reduced by a severe spate and three summer droughts. A stability analysis showed that the subpopulation at site A was essentially stable around the equilibrium density, whereas that at site B was strongly cyclic and was approaching chaotic behaviour. 3. Loss-rates were fairly constant in the second year of the life cycle, but those in the first year were very variable and related positively to the density of mature leeches. The latter ate newly hatched leeches, even those still in cocoons. Cannibalism appeared to be the most obvious mechanism responsible for the density-dependent relationships, its impact being greatest at site B. Loss-rates were not dependent on the density of the young leeches themselves (i.e. direct density dependence) but on the density of mature leeches that ate them (i.e. delayed density dependence).

It is well established that the likelihood of an individual animal becoming mature is influenced strongly by its previous growth.

There was spatial variation in the size of parr, a large proportion of which was attributable to altitude. However, this did not explain the variation between sites in the maturation rate of parr. In contrast to earlier findings, there was no relationship between the mean size of parr at a site and the percentage of males that matured there for the age class in which most mature males were found. 4. Within a site size at age was a good predictor of maturation, but across sites this relationship was modified by altitude. For a given age and size a parr was more likely to become sexually mature if it came from a high-altitude site. 5. Spatial variation in the incidence of male parr maturity is not simply the result of variation in growth rates. The size threshold above which parr male parr matured depended on altitude, which could serve as a proxy for growth opportunity. 6.

The risk of parasitism and infectious disease is expected to increase with population density as a consequence of positive density-dependent transmission rates. Therefore, species that encounter large fluctuations in population density are predicted to exhibit plasticity in their immune system, such that investment in costly immune defences is adjusted to match the probability of exposure to parasites and pathogens (i.e. density-dependent prophylaxis). 2. Despite growing evidence that insects in high-density populations show the predicted increase in resistance to certain pathogens, few studies have examined the underlying alteration in immune function. As many of these species show increased cuticular melanism at high densities, the aim of this study was to use a multivariate approach to quantify relative variation in the allocation of resources to immunity associated with both rearing density (solitary vs. crowded) and cuticular colour (pale vs. dark) in a phase-polyphenic Lepidopteran species (Spodoptera littoralis Boisduval). 3. Relative to pale individuals, dark larvae (the high-density phenotype) exhibited higher haemolymph and cuticular phenoloxidase (PO) activity and a stronger melanotic encapsulation response to an artificial parasite inserted into the haemocoel. However, they also exhibited lower antibacterial (lysozyme-like) activity than pale larvae. Larval density per se had little effect on most of the immune parameters measured, though capsule melanization and antibacterial activity were significantly higher in solitary-reared than crowded larvae. 4. Correcting for variation in larval body condition, as estimated by weight and haemolymph protein levels, had little effect on these results, suggesting that variation in immune function across treatment groups cannot be explained by condition-dependence.

The hypothesis of site-dependent population regulation predicts that birds utilize available nesting sites in a pre-emptive (ideal despotic) manner, leading to density dependence in heterogeneous habitats as poorer sites are used at higher population densities. At small population sizes adaptive site choice protects populations against fluctuations (the buffer effect). 2. Common guillemots Uria aalge (Pontoppidan) breed at high density on sea-cliffs. The population breeding on the Isle of May, Scotland increased by 60% between 1981 and 2000. A good nest-site is a prerequisite for successful breeding and there is much competition for the best sites. Throughout this period, site use correlated with two measures of site quality, and photographs taken in 1936 show that this pattern has been extremely stable. 3. The data indicate declining quality of sites that remain available as the population has increased. Site-dependent regulation was evident in that average breeding success declined over the years, but no declining trend was detected in the best (and most preferred) sites. 4. An individual guillemot generally uses the same nest-site from year to year, but a minority move, usually less than 2 m, between breeding seasons. These movements can be involuntary or voluntary. Involuntarily moving birds that had occupied very good sites before moving often spent several years as non-breeders (floaters) close to their previous site before breeding again, and then occupied poorer sites. Voluntarily moving birds significantly improved their site quality by moving. 5. Birds responded both to the physical site characteristics and to their own experience (breeding failure) when abandoning a site. Their behaviour thus combined aspects of the 'win-stay, lose-switch' strategy with direct assessment of site quality.

We know that sexually transmitted parasites and pathogens have extremely deleterious effects in human and domesticated animal populations, but know little of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in natural populations. 2. One previously reported natural system is the sexually transmitted mite, Coccipolipus hippodamiae, on the eastern European coccinellid, Adalia bipunctata. Our aims were to determine how widespread this parasite is in terms of incidence and prevalence across host species, to identify the causes of the prevalence pattern and whether the parasite reduces fertility in all host species. 3. Coccipolipus hippodamiae was present on four of 19 European species examined. The wide distribution and high prevalence of C. hippodamiae on A. bipunctata indicates that this is the major host. The mite was also present at substantial prevalence on Adalia decempunctata and at lower prevalence on Synharmonia (= Oenopia) conglobata and Calvia quatuordecimguttata. 4. Laboratory studies on mite development time and transmission efficiency revealed that although physiological factors may affect incidence, they do not explain prevalence variation between hosts, but characteristics of host life history and reproductive behaviour are important in this context. Adalia bipunctata is more promiscuous than the less commonly infected A. decempunctata and S. conglobata. Diapause is needed before breeding will occur in C. quatuordecimguttata, leading to a lack of the consistent sexual activity between generations, which is needed for STD maintenance. Calvia quatuordecimguttata is probably periodically reinfected through hybrid matings with other host species. 5. Coccipolipus hippodamiae infection has similar strong deleterious effects on female reproduction in A. decempunctata and S. conglobata as have previously been demonstrated in A. bipunctata. 6.

Compositional analysis revealed that woodland was the most preferred habitat: its availability was therefore used as an index of home-range quality. 4. It was found that the quality of the does' winter home-range affected fawn production in the subsequent spring, as females with greatest availability of preferred habitat during winter produced the larger litters the subsequent spring. 5. Furthermore, the winter weights of the fawns seemed to be affected by home-range quality in a complex way. First, home-range quality in the prenatal winter seems to influence the birthdate and in turn the weight of the fawns in August.

The results showed that, with time, motile species richness increases significantly while evenness indices remain high and constant. Sessile species, on the other hand, increased in both species richness and evenness through time. 3. For the motile species, regions seem to remain different while local saturation is observed. These results suggest that this group is under species-sorting: species are mobile enough that recruits and adult dispersal within a region maintain differences among regions, while local communities are saturated. 4. For the sessile species, the local-regional relationship was unsaturated at all sampling dates with both untransformed and rarefied data. Regions are initially similar in community structure, then differ through time to become similar again at the last sampling date. This may reflect a priority effect: propagules that arrive at a shell may initially exert influence on the species composition on a shell, so that at intermediate sampling times regions differ in community structure. However, at the last sampling there were no differences detected among regions, suggesting that dispersal distances might be larger for this group of species. 5. These results suggest the following. (1) The degree of species saturation will depend on the successional stage of a community.

Niche differentiation is widely thought to promote both coexistence of many species within a trophic level, and higher total biomass of those species. However, the joint effects of changes in diversity within multiple trophic levels are unknown. The potential for niche differences to promote high diversity and biomass within a trophic level may depend on the diversity and composition of adjacent trophic levels. 2. Using a simple mechanistic model, I examine the joint consequences of changes in diversity on two adjacent trophic levels ('predators' and 'prey') for the total biomass of prey. Niche differences among prey reflect a trade-off between ability to compete for resources and ability to avoid/sustain predation. Niche differences among predators reflect differences in ability to consume different prey species. 3. Total prey biomass is a complex, joint function of prey and predator diversity. In particular, transgressive overyielding (when a diverse polyculture of prey outperforms any prey monoculture) can occur for some parameter values when a specialist predator mediates prey coexistence, and for a different set of parameter values when a specialist and a generalist predator together mediate prey coexistence, but is impossible when a generalist predator alone mediates prey coexistence. 4. Increased initial predator diversity tends to reduce total prey biomass even when predators cannot coexist, due to a 'selection' effect for the most effective predator. Predators coexist only in prey polycultures. Coexisting predators can, but do not necessarily, reduce total prey biomass to a lower level than could any predator alone. 5.

Public information, i.e. local reproductive performance of conspecifics, is expected to be a highly valuable cue for breeding habitat selection. However, the access to this cue may be spatially and temporally constrained. When public information is unavailable, individuals may use other integrative cues, such as the local density of breeders. 2. Departure decisions of collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) were shown previously to be related to both public information and breeding density, in a long-term correlative study of a fragmented population. Here, we tested whether flycatchers also use public information (number and condition of fledglings produced locally) and breeding density to make individual settlement decisions in the following year. 3. Immigration rates were computed to measure the degree of attractiveness of patches to new breeders. We investigated the relative influence of public information and breeding density on immigration rates of yearlings and older adults separately. The access to public information for settlement decisions may indeed be more limited for yearlings. 4. Immigration rate in a patch increased with mean fledgling number in the previous year for older adults but not for yearlings. Yearling immigration rate was correlated positively to mean fledgling condition when patch breeding density in the previous year was low, but negatively when density was high. 5. Immigration rates of both yearlings and older adults increased with breeding density in the previous year. Breeding density explained a larger part of the variance in immig-ration rate than patch reproductive success. 6. The proportion of yearlings among breeders decreased with increasing patch reproductive success and breeding density in the previous year, suggesting that local competition was high in attractive patches. 7. Our results thus suggest that public information is also used for immigration decisions. However, decisions of yearlings are more complex than those of older adults, due to their more limited access to public information and the higher impact of intraspecific competition. Conversely, all individuals seemed to cue on breeding density in a similar way. Density is correlated to patch reproductive success, and may be a more easily accessible cue. We discuss the potential advantages of using conspecific density over conspecific reproductive performance for future immigration decisions.",129,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Breeding habitat selection | Dispersal | Patch reproductive success | Social attraction | Spatial and temporal constraints in information gathering,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,100

I present a model of mutualistic interactions in a patchy landscape. The interaction is between two species that differ in their mobility. The landscape is spatially structured, with several localities interconnected by dispersal of the mobile mutualist. 2. Within a given locality, an Allee effect can occur such that the per capita growth rate of the non-mobile mutualist declines with its own abundance. The Allee effect arises in response to low abundances of the mobile mutualist, and causes extinction of both species once their numbers fall below a critical threshold. 3. Dispersal of the mobile mutualist can rescue such sink communities from extinction, provided there is at least one source community in which both species have abundances above the extinction threshold. Dispersal itself is density-independent, but induces negative density-dependence that counteracts the positive density-dependence due to the Allee effect. This negative feedback effect of dispersal has not previously been demonstrated in mutualism models. 4. Rescue of sink communities, however, depends on how dispersal influences the local dynamics of source communities. If dispersal involves surplus individuals the loss of whom does not affect the reproductive output of the source community, persistence of sink communities is guaranteed as long as the survivorship of long-distance dispersers exceeds a lower threshold. In contrast, if dispersal involves emigrants that constitute a fraction of the source community's reproductive output, persistence of sink communities additionally requires that emigration does not exceed an upper threshold. Too much emigration can cause a net loss of the mobile mutualist from the source community, resulting in landscape-wide extinction of the mutualistic interaction. 5. The effect of dispersal mode on the dynamics of mutualistic interactions has not been appreciated previously. If the benefit of the rescue effect to sinks is outweighed by the cost of dispersal to sources, mutualistic communities linked by dispersal may experience a greater loss of diversity than communities that are isolated.",55,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Allee effect | Coexistence | Emigration | Immigration | Metacommunity | Mutualism | Source-sink dynamics | Spatial heterogeneity,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,101

Many ant species preferred sugar solutions containing mixtures of amino acids over pure sugar solutions.

Preferences for single amino acids were also reduced when colonies fed extensively on the same compound prior to the experiment for 2 days. 5.

Groups from different clans showed different use of habitat and movement patterns. Off the Galapagos Islands, 'Plus-one' clan groups moved in relatively straight lines while 'Regular' clan groups had more convoluted tracks and a more inshore distribution, patterns which were consistent across years. 4. Groups from different clans had different defecation rates, indicating between-clan variation in feeding success. Off the Galapagos Islands, 'Plus-one' clan groups were more successful in the depauperate ENSO ('El Niño/Southern Oscillation') conditions of 1987. However, in the cooler conditions of 1989, groups of the 'Regular' clan had much higher feeding success than those of the 'Plus-one' clan. 5. Thus we suggest that cultural inheritance in sperm whales incorporates foraging strategy as well as vocal patterns, and that clan membership has fitness consequences. 6.

Only magpie and hooded crow territories were associated with an elevated risk of predation based on an artificial nest experiment with nests mimicking red-backed shrike nests. Predation risk on real red-backed shrike nests was also higher close to nests of hooded crow and magpie than elsewhere in the landscape. 4. Occupation frequency of known red-backed shrike territory sites during 3 years of study increased with increasing mean distance to the nearest magpie nest. 5. Changes in spatial distribution of corvids affected the spatial distribution of red-backed shrikes. Vacant red-backed shrike territory sites were more likely to become occupied in the next year when magpie and hooded crows had moved away from the site, while occupied sites were more likely to be abandoned in the next year when at least hooded crows had moved closer. 6. Our results suggest that breeding territories of nest predators may affect breeding habitat selection of prey species.

Game theoretic models of how animals manage predation risk have begun to describe predator responses to prey behaviour relatively recently. This is partly because our understanding of how terrestrial predators select vertebrate prey is often limited to numerical and functional responses to measures of prey abundance. Prey vulnerability, however, may improve our understanding of predation because predators could maximize foraging success by selecting prey on this basis. 2. We tested the hypothesis that sparrowhawks (Accipiter nisus L.), a typical generalist predator, hunt redshanks (Tringa totanus L.), a favoured prey species on coastal shores, primarily on the basis of their vulnerability rather than their abundance. 3. Five direct measures or indicators of redshank behaviour predicted sparrowhawk attack success in a multipredictor statistical model and therefore serve as measures of redshank vulnerability. 4. These and other vulnerability measures influenced whether sparrowhawks decided to hunt redshanks on saltmarsh habitat. A model that included most of these measures predicted correctly whether sparrowhawks hunted redshanks (attack decision) 90% of the time and accounted for up to 75% of variation. Prey abundance accounted for no additional variation. 5. Thus the hunting behaviour of some predators can only be predicted well by several highly dynamic and interacting factors related to prey vulnerability.

Social organization and dispersal of red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris L.) differ between sexes, and intrasexual competition is intense.

We studied the relative importance of within- and between-sex density-dependent factors and of density-independent factors (habitat type, food abundance, winter temperature) on different demographic parameters, in two populations in northern Belgium. 2.

The globeflower fly Chiastocheta presents a unique case of adaptive radiation, with at least six sister species co-developing in fruits of Trollius europaeux. These species all feed on seeds, and differ in their oviposition timing, one species ovipositing in 1 -day-old flowers (early species), while all the other species sequentially oviposit throughout the flower life span (late species). We evaluated the impact of conspecific and heterospecific larvae on larval installation success, and on larval fresh mass and area, for early and late species, in natural conditions. 3. None of the three larval traits measured was correlated with fruit size, and no fruit lost all seeds to predation, suggesting that seed availability was not a limiting factor for larval development. 4.

We experimentally manipulated connectivity in order to investigate the homogenisation effect on population size. The experimental design consisted of 16 patches of common lizard populations (Lacerta vivipara), half of which were connected by dispersal. The design allowed us to identify candidates for dispersal in unconnected patches. 3. We found that population sizes became spatially more and more homogeneous with time in connected patches, whereas extinctions or demographic explosions were observed in unconnected patches. Juvenile dispersal was density-dependent in connected patches but not in unconnected ones. These results suggest that the loss of connection modifies population functioning by influencing how dispersal is determined by local conditions. 4. Finally, population explosions in unconnected patches were followed by a sharp decrease in population size. So non-extinct, unconnected populations did not stabilize. This could be due to over-compensatory density dependence. 5.

The spatial distributions of individuals derived from these photos were used to describe how individual feeding performance may be affected by patch depletion caused by other members of the flock. This was assessed indirectly by estimating the variation in prior grazing time experienced by individuals. 2. The most successful foragers in a flock (i.e. those experiencing the least prior grazing time) are largely unaffected by depletion arising during the life span of the flock, while the least successful foragers experience very substantial depletion. Furthermore, for the less successful individuals, the average level of depletion increases continuously with both flock size and time spent in the flock. 3. Skew in depletion experienced could not be assessed accurately, although it is likely that there is moderate right skew, i.e. a few individuals do very badly, but more than half do better than the mean. 4. This study suggests that the degree of depletion experienced is related to position within the group, while previous studies of this system have shown that there is strong competition for the better positions. Dominance status is therefore likely to be a strong determinant of feeding performance. Subordinate individuals, being unable to obtain leading positions, may be forced to adopt alternative strategies to improve feeding performance, such as moving more frequently in order to maximize time in smaller or more recently formed groups.",35,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Barnacle geese | Costs of aggregation | Feeding competition | Individual variation | Social foraging,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,111

Litter production peaked in the spring and summer, but fewer females bred in the summer with grey squirrels present. In addition, fewer individual red squirrel females produced two litters per year in the sites with grey squirrels. Moreover, red squirrel recruitment rate and, in the mixed broadleaf sites, red squirrel juvenile residency, decreased with increasing grey squirrel density. 4. Fecundity of individual female red squirrels was lower in red-grey than in red-only sites because they had a lower body mass in sites with grey squirrels. 5. Overall, there was no significant effect of grey squirrels on residency of adult red squirrels or on population turnover rate.

The model suggests that the balance of coexistence between mite, virus and bee in the eastern honey bee, has been lost in the western bee host, not simply because of the new transmission route, but also because mite populations in western honey bee colonies has exceeded a critical epidemic threshold. We quantify the critical epidemic mite load for two well-studied bee viruses, acute paralysis virus and deformed wing virus, through the colony's yearly life cycle. 4.
