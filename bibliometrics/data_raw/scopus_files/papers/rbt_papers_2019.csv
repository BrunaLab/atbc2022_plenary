Objective: The current study represented the comprehensive screening of allelopathic activity of 73 weeds in Pakistan by the Sandwich method and dish pack method. To investigate the allelochemical compound in top most allelopathic weed. Methods: Allelopathic effects of selected weeds leaves leachate were determined through sandwich technique, while volatile allelopathic effects through dish pack techniques. Qualitative and quantitative phytochemical techniques were applied to investigate allelochemical potential of Melilotus indicus. The statistical analysis of the data described the allelopathic effect of 73 weed plants on lettuce seedling growth in terms of radicle and hypocotyl elongation. Results: Elongation percentage of radicle and hypocotyl ranged 0-74 % to 0-148 % and 0-75 % to 0-84 % respectively at 10 mg concentration of dry plant powder in sandwich method while it was 2-234 % and 7-150 % at in Dish Pack method. Among the plants screened for phytotoxic activity, M. indicus contained the strongest allelochemicals. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of M. indicus showed the presence of flavonoids and phenolic compound along with other allelochemical.

Until recently, it was considered that a representative population (billions) of sperm was made up of “equivalent” cells with a common goal: To be the one that could finally fertilize the oocyte. New data suggesting that a set of spermatozoa is grouped in distinct subpopulations, according to their kinematic and morphometric characteristics, has opened the way towards a more cooperative vision. In addition, recently, it has been estab­lished that the subpopulation distribution is different among males, which seems to indicate that there are different strategies that can be understood within another paradigm: Sperm competition between different ejaculates. These heterogeneous subpopulations of spermatozoa in the ejaculate, that show kinematics and morphometric patterns, has been widely known for a while, but the biological meaning of these different sperm subpopulations is still not clear. For this reason, the subjective evaluation of seminal quality is being displaced by objective assessment techniques using CASA technology (computer-assisted semen analysis). Also, the application of principal components (PC) and clustering methods to reveal subpopulations of spermatozoa are complementary tools used to characterize raw semen and processed cell suspensions. Despite the advances in such powerful tools, researchers are not well versed on such techniques and its advantages. For instance, PC analysis is a multivariate statistical method that reduces the number of variables used in subsequent calculations for describing the data. By integrating the original data into new complex mathematical variables, homogenous subpopulations of spermatozoa can define clearly. Furthermore, kinematic, morphometric, morphological or DNA integrity tests can be also applied to characterize and understand the reproductive biology of the spermatozoon. Although the role of the different subpopulations of spermatozoa remains unknown, the work should continue by implementing novel technologies and coordinated tools. In this review, we characterize the fertility evaluation with CASA technology and examine the main multivariate methods in the assessment of sperm subpopulations analyzed by CASA systems.",16,Journal,re,Review,100,4,4,Andrology | Motility | Multivariate analysis | Reproduction | Semen,13567,MICITT,undefined,Ministerio de Ciencia Tecnología y Telecomunicaciones,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,2

We evaluated these attributes in the endangered Baja California killifish (Fundulus lima) that inhabits the oases of Baja California Sur, Mexico, with the perspective of generating base information for the conservation of this endemic fish. Objective: To determine the age, somatic growth and population structure of F. lima in one of the most important hydrological basins of its distribution range. Methods: From October 2002 to July 2004 we sampled for F. lima in 3 sites of La Purisima river by using passive and active collection methods. Individuals were measured and weighed in the field, where subsamples were selected for analysis of age based on scales. All of the individuals were released alive to its original sites of capture. We assessed the age, length-weight and length-length relationships and population structure on the basis of 802 individuals examined by non-invasive techniques. Results: The somatic growth of F. lima was of positive allometric type (b > 3.0) in all the populations studied, with values of “b” ranging from 3.126 (Ojo de Agua) to 3.420 (El Pilón). Three age class (0, 1 and 2 years old) were recognized, of which the age 1 year was the most frequent (49 %). The polimodal method based on length-frequency data also identified three age classes. Back-calculated total lengths at previous ages based in increments of growth in scales were 38.61 and 68.81 mm for individuals of 1 and 2 years, respectively. Conclusions: Three age classes (0, 1 and 2 years old) were determined for the populations of F. lima in La Purisima river, based on the interpretation of annual growth rings in scales and in the modal distribution of observed length frequencies.

We evaluated whether a G. sanctum population in the Palo Verde National Park of Costa Rica is viable in the long term. Methods: Using two demographic studies, one in 1997 and the other in 2017, we estimated survival and fecundity rates for each tree age class, population growth rate (lambda), and vital rates elasticity, and we used a density-independent deterministic population model to project the long-term trend of that population. Results: The estimated vital rates during the last 20 years suggested that this population is rapidly decreasing. Although some age classes increased in abundance, seedlings are rare and the plants that recruited in 1997 have not yet reached reproductive maturity. Our results suggest that the current abundance of G. sanctum within the national park may not be a good indicator of its long-term con­servation status, and from our population viability analysis, we estimated that the population we studied would decrease to less than 1 % of its current size within the next 200 years. Conclusions: Landscape-scale ecosystem deterioration affecting the greater PVNP region, such as loss of seed dispersers and suppression of disturbances, may offset the passive protection of G. sanctum within park boundaries. Relying on the overall strict protection afforded by the location of the population within the Palo Verde National Park may not be sufficient to conserve this population of G. sanctum.

Objectives: To describe and analyze the ontogeny of sporangia and receptacle scales of Pleopeltis macrocarpa. Methods: During March and April of 2017, fertile fronds of P. macrocarpa were collected from tree stems located in the plant nursery “El Edén de las flores”, municipality of Rionegro, Antioquia, Colombia. The samples were fixed and processed according to the standard protocols for embedding and sectioning in paraffin and resin. Sections obtained in resin (0.5 μm) were stained with Toluidine blue. The additional descriptions of the anatomy and histochemistry required specific reagents, applied for the determination of primary walls, secondary walls, nuclei, lignin, polyphenols, polysaccharides, pectic substances and cellulose. The observations and photographic records were performed by photonic and epifluorescence microscopy. For the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique, the sori were dehydrated with 2,2- Dimethoxypropane, dried to critical point and coated with gold. Results: The sori are superficial, vascularized and have mixed development, covered by receptacle scales that detach as the sporangia reaches maturity. The leptosporangiate type sporangium have long stalks of primary walls, the annulus of the sporangia shows secondary walls with “U” shaped thickenings rich in lignin. The epidermal cells of the receptacle originate the sporangia and receptacle scales. The mitotic division events of these two structures are initially similar, but then diverge for the reproductive and vegetative differentiation of these two organs. Meiosis is simultaneous and the spore tetrads are arranged in a decussate or tetragonal shape. The cellular tapetum is initially unstratified but becomes bistratified by mitotic division. The inner layer of the tapetum cells break originating a plasmodial tapetum. During the sporoderm development, the first structure formed is the exospore, composed of sporopolenin, followed by the endospore composed of cellulose, pectin and carboxilated polysaccharides, and finally the perispore. The histochemistry and epifluorescence results indicate that both the sporangia and immature receptacle scales have cell walls of cellulosic. These structures as well as those of the sporangium wall cells maintain its composition during matu­ration. Whereas, the epidermal wall cells of the shields from the mature receptacle scales are characterized by thickened cuticle. The polyphenols are present during all the development stages of the sporangia and receptacle scales. Starch is abundant in the early stages of development of the receptacle cells and sporangial primordia. Conclusions: The ontogeny of the sporangia of P. macrocarpa is similar to the described for leptosporangiate ferns. The receptacle scales are mainly protective structures, its morphology and cell wall composition prevent desiccation or humidity loss of the sporangia during the labile stages of development.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the richness, abundance and composi­tion of macro-invertebrates in four contrasting agro-ecosystems: Two silvopastoral systems made of Leucaena leucocephala and associated pastures (i.e. Panicum maximum cv mombaza and Cynodon plectostachyus), a pasture of Brachiaria brizantha with scattered trees in low density and, a medium-statured tropical dry forest. In each system, an area of one hectare was delimited and a transect of 50 m in length was established in which five pit-fall traps were placed every 10 m. The sampling was carried out in February and May of 2018 and in each month five collections were made with five-day intervals. A total of 1 737 organisms belonging to 10 orders of the class Insecta and one of the class Gastropoda were collected. The medium-statured tropical dry forest (923 individuals) and the silvopastoral systems of L. leucocephala with C. Plectostachyus (354 individuals) show the highest abundance of macro-invertebrates. The most abundant genera were: Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Aracninae and Orthoptera. The higher macro-invertebrate diversity was found in the silvopastoral systems of L. leucocephala with P. maximum (H ‘= 1.58) and L. leucocephala with C. plectostachyus (H’ = 1.44).

Methods: We obtained historical and current records of both Heteromys species. Potential distribution models were generated using Maxent, including altitudes for each species and bioclimatic layers. We determined the Extent of Occurrence and Area of Occupancy for H. nelsoni according to the criteria of the IUCN in order to generate information about its risk status. Results: The altitude is not a variable that determines a shift in the distribution caused by climate change. In contrast, the temperature and precipitation are important for the potential distribution of both Heteromys species. The future changes in climatic conditions could reduce the area of suitable habitat for both species. Conclusions: The distribution surface is not greater than 33.44 km2 for H. nelsoni.

As an alternative, previous work has suggested that green fertilizers (fresh tissue from plants) are effective to preserve soil fertility, without affecting the ecological properties of invertebrate communities. Objective: This work aimed to evaluate how green fertilizers affect the ecological structure of an invertebrate community in an andisol from Southwestern Colombia. Methods: Fresh leaves from seven plant species locally sown and grown in March 2018 were used as the fertilizers by incorporating and mixing them with the soil in 24 experimental subplots. After 45 days of incorporation, the abundance, richness, biomass and diversity of soil invertebrates were measured in three replicate soil cores per subplot and at three depths. Results: Comparing against a control treatment with no fertilization, the richness and abundance of soil invertebrates were up to 14-fold higher in treatments with Alnus jorullensis and Brassica napus, and up to 5-fold higher in treatments with Vicia sativa, Lupinus mutabilis, Plantago lanceolata and Medicago sativa. Diversity indices showed a shift from high dominance by one or a few invertebrate families in the control treatment, to a high diversity and greater evenness in the A. jorullensis, P. lanceolata and M. sativa treatments. Biomass was negatively correlated with richness and abundance, sug­gesting a possible ecological trade-off worth to evaluate in further research. Conclusions: In general, our results demonstrate that the application of green fertilizers in this Andean environment can significantly improve the ecological status of soil invertebrate communities. These communities ultimately provide the ecological func­tions for soil dynamics; thus, agroecology practices should consider them as a valuable alternative to balance production and conservation.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Abundance | Diversity | Green manures | Macrofauna | Richness | Soil,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,17

The physicochemical variables showed that E3 was the most contaminated site. There were 9 orders, 23 families and 31 taxa. E3 had the lowest richness and in E2 Rhagovelia was dominant. The CCA showed that variables that have the greatest influence on the diversity of macroinvertebrates are oxygen, BOD5, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) and turbidity.

L.P. Queiroz. (Fabaceae), known as catingueira, is traditionally used in medicine to treat diarrhea, hepatitis and anemia. However, there are no studies on their toxicogenetic effects. Objective: The present study aimed to investigate the phytochemical profile as well as the mutagenic and antimutagenic potential of P. bracteosa aqueous bark extract in Allium cepa and Mus musculus. Methods: The extract from barks was diluted in distilled water to yield the four concentrations (2, 4, 8 and 16 mg/ml) used in the A. cepa bioassay and the three doses (10, 20 and 40 mg/Kg) administered to the mice (five animals per group). The phytochemical profile was performed by the colorimetric test to identify the main secondary metabolites in the bark extract. After treatment, five-thousand meristematic cells were analyzed to determine the mitotic index, the mean number of chromosome alterations and the percentage of damage reduction. For mice, after 24, 48 and 72 h, tail blood was collected from each animal for the preparation of two slides per animal. For each animal, 2 000 normochromatic erythrocytes per mice were evaluated to establish the number of micronuclei and the protective effect. Data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test (P < 0.05). Results: The phytochemical analysis of the extract detected reducing sugars and tannins. None of the concentrations of extract was cytotoxic and the cytoprotective effect was observed in A. cepa for all treatments (pre-, simultaneous and post-). The total mean of chromosome alterations in all concentrations indicated a non-mutagenic activity of the bark. The percentage of damage reduction was observed in the pre- (77.6 to 90.5 %), simultaneous (95.6 to 114.7 %) and post- (84.8 to 117.7 %) treatments. In mice, none of the dosages of extract presented mutagenic effect and the percentage of damage reduction varied from -21.16 to 78.63 % (pre-); from 27.51 to 101.28 % (simultaneous) and from 85.47 to 120.63 % (post-treatment). Conclusions: Probably, the phytochemicals in the extract did not interfere with the cell cycle (A. cepa) nor caused damage to the DNA (A. cepa and mice), and exhibited protective effect in both studied species.

Fourteen native euconulids, in three genera, have been reported from Costa Rica. Objective: In this paper I describe Tikoconus, a new genus of Euconulinae endemic to Costa Rica. Methods: I dissected alcohol-preserved euconulids collected in Costa Rica. I took photographs or electron micrographs or drew the shell, external anatomy, reproductive system, mantle cavity organs and radula. Results: The genus Tikoconus can be recognized by its semislug appearance and very thin and often flexible subglobose to subglobose-depressed external shell. Other distinctive features of the genus are a lack of black dots on the mantle and the presence of at least some dark blotches on the subpedal groove band. Internally, the urethra has a Z-shaped prolongation that almost reaches the mantle collar. The reproductive system has a distinctive external C-shaped penial gland that surrounds half of the penis circumference and is attached to the penis and to the penial caecum, but not connected to them by ducts. Also, there is an internal mono- or bi-lobulated extension in the penis. The epiphallus has a verge that enters into the penis. The penial sheath surrounds part of the penis, the epiphallus base and the penial retractor muscle insertion, but leaves the penial gland and the penis caecum free. The gametolytic gland is absent. I described two new subgenera: Tikoconus with six new species-T. (T.) costaricanus sp.n. (type species), T. (T.) onca sp.n., T. (T.) andresi sp.n., T. (T.) katyae sp.n., T. (T.) alosii sp.n., T. (T.) subsilvanus sp.n.; and Bribriconus with only one species-T. (B.) thompsoni sp.n. All species have restricted distributions and are endemic to particular watersheds, except for T. costaricanus which occurs nearly throughout the central mountains of Costa Rican. This genus inhabits very wet, little disturbed tropical forests from 400 to 2 500 masl on the Atlantic slope and from 760 to 2 500 masl on the Pacific slope. The genus Velifera, the other semislug euconulid reported from Costa Rica, is kept as a valid taxon and I choose the specimen ANSP 48765 as lectotype of Velifera gabbi with the purpose of clarifying the application of the name to a taxon.

Objetive: In this paper, I analyse the population dynamics of Tikoconus (Tikoconus) costaricanus Barrientos, an understory endemic euconulid. Methods: I compared T. costaricanus’ demography patterns in tropical montane forests in central Costa Rica in three habitats with different restoration techniques: A mature forest, a secondary forest and a Cuppressus lusitanica plantation. I collected data in three month periods during a year. I analysed population size in relation with habitat, sampling date, leaf litter humidity, depth and quantity; and specimen size in relation with habitat and sampling date. I also kept some specimens in terraria and described part of their natural history. Results: The species is more abundant in mature forest (Ø = 0.174 ind/m2). The number of specimens in each habitat was constant throughout the year (Kruskall-Wallis = 2.0118, p = 0.57, NS) and hatching occurs in the middle and last months of the rainy season (Kruskall-Wallis = 17.3061, P = 0.00061, **).

This relationship is explained by the high and stable humid environment provided by leaf litter. Some specimens migrate from foliage to leaf litter during the drier months. Eggs (Ø = 1mm) are laid on moss or soil and the young spend the first 2 or 3 weeks of their life on moss. Egg masses are small (Ø = 4 eggs), and shells look bubbly. Egg development time (20 days) was longer than in other tropical species. Adult pigmentation appears around two months after hatch. In the only case observed, egg laying began 5 months after hatching and the specimen lived 9 months.

The aim of this work was to determine how the reproductive, recruitment and post-reproductive periods influences, as well as the effect of sex and snout-vent length on the thermoregulation of Liolaemus chacoensis. Individuals were captured by hand in the Southern sector of Valle Fertil, San Juan province, Argentina. A total of 44 individuals were captured during the months of November 2014, February 2015 and March 2015. Body (Tb), substrate (Ts) and air (Ta) temperatures were recorded. Also, biophysical models were used to record operative temperatures. Later selected temperatures (Tsel) were evaluated at the laboratory. Finally, thermoregulatory efficiency index was calculated. Results indicated that L. chacoensis Tb was positively related to Ta, presenting a heliothermic behavior that was maintained during periods and sex. Also, Tb was higher in reproductive and recruitment periods than in post-reproductive period. In particular, only sex had an effect on Tsel, however for the interquartile range of Tsel both the period of reproductive cycle and sex had an effect. The thermoregulatory efficiency index indicated that L. chacoensis is an absolute thermoconformist. However, in the reproductive period both males and females change towards active thermoregulation. These results show that thermophysiological parameters vary in different periods of reproductive cycle and the active microsite selection would be a mechanism in maintenance of body temperature of this species.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Ectotherms | Effectiveness of thermoregulation | Reproductive cycle | Temperature | Thermal quality,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,24

Objective: To analyze the genetic variation of an insular population of Atta cephalotes in a larger regional context in Central and South America. Methods: The Cytochrome Oxidase I gene of A. cephalotes was sequenced for the Gorgona Island and mainland popu­lations in order to conduct an analysis of molecular variance, gene flow, and to calculate divergence time of haplogroups occurring in the island. An individual assignment test was conducted to estimate the spatial genetic connectivity and the distribution for this ant in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. Results: A total of 33 samples from the island and the Colombian mainland were compared to 389 Genebank accessions of A. cephalotes from Central and South America. This leaf-cutter ant in the Gorgona Island is closely related to the Colombian mainland, despite that the separation between the island and the mainland likely constitute a barrier to gene flow. It is likely that two of the most common haplogroups on the continent arrived on the island recently. Therefore, the anthropogenic influence in the process of colonization of the island by this leaf-cutting ant cannot be excluded. A map of connectivity shows that this population has geographic limits that largely overlap with a biogeographic region within the Eastern Tropical Pacific. This trans-andean population accumulates 23 % of the maternally inherited diversity of the A. cephalotes.

In this study, we compared the successional trajectory of tree plantations to that of secondary forests that were between 8 and 23 years old. Censuses of woody plants (≥ 2 cm dbh [diameter at breast height]) in seven tree plantation plots and seven secondary forest plots (30 × 30 m) were conducted over three years (May 2013-July 2016) in a lowland tropical forest. Secondary forests were naturally regenerating from abandoned cattle pastures. Tree plantations were monocultures of two different native species (Vochysia guatemalensis and Hieronyma alchorneoides), planted for carbon sequestration. We measured the change in stem density, basal area, species density, rarefied species richness, and relative abundance of different growth forms and regeneration guilds. We found that differences in stem density and basal area between these two forest types were declining. Nevertheless, we did not find evidence for differences between forest types in the rate of accu­mulation of species richness when accounting for sample size. On the other hand, even though the successional trajectory in tree plantations was very similar to secondary forests, there were differences between forest types in species composition. The rate of change in relative abundance of different growth forms and regeneration guilds was similar in both forest types.

In the latter case, organ­isms are exposed to diverse environmental conditions which have an influence on their biological processes and can be seen reflected in the morphological adaptations of species. Indeed, Reef Corridor in the Southwest Gulf of Mexico (CASGM, in its Spanish acronym) is constituted of geographically separated reefs that are exposed to different large-scale oceanographic factors and show their own attributes with multiple environmental variables. Therefore, this can stimulate morphological variations of species populations that are distributed in this corridor. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the morphological variation of the Aristotle’s lantern of the sea urchin Eucidaris tribuloides along CASGM. Methods: The allometric relation between height of the Aristotle’s lantern and diameter of the test of 104 specimens was analyzed, and we also used a covariance analysis to detect allometric differences between groups. Apart from that, the variation of the shape of a rotule and a demi-pyramid for each sea urchin were analyzed using geometric morphometry. Results: There are allometric differences among reef systems in the north, center and south of Veracruz. The shape of rotula and demi-pyramid of sea urchins of the north zone are different from the central and south area. However, there were no differences in shape between the center and the South area. The centroid size of rotula and demi-pyramid of the sea urchins of the North are larger than those in the center and the South. Conclusions: Along the Corridor of the Southwest of the Gulf of Mexico, specimens of E. tribuloides showed a morphological variation in their ana­lyzed structures, these results can be explained by the geographical and environmental gradients of the CASGM, in addition to the feeding habits of E. tribuloides and the availability of the food resource in the habitat where they are established. As a stimulus to the morphological variation found in this research, the distance among the reef systems and the marine currents patterns are also considered.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Aristotle’s lantern | Geometric morphometric | Gulf of Mexico | Reefs | Sea urchin,13567,NOAA,undefined,National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,27

Although different organisms have the ability to induce galls in plants, insect-induced galls are the most elaborate and diverse. Some hypotheses have been proposed to explain the induction mechanism of plant galls by insects. The most general hypothesis suggests that gall formation is triggered by the action of chemical substances secreted by the gall inducer, including plant growth regulators such as auxins, cytokinins, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), and other types of compounds. However, the mode of action of these chemical substances and the general mechanism by which the insect could control and manipulate plant development and physiology is still not known. Moreover, resulting from the complexity of the induction process and development of insect galls, the chemical hypothesis is very unlikely a complete explanation of the mechanism of induction and morphogenesis of these structures. Previous and new highlights of insect gall systems with emphasis on the induction process were analyzed on the basis of the author’s integrated point of view to propose a different perspective of gall induction, which is provided in this article. Due to the extraordinary diversity of shapes, colors, and complex structures present in insect galls, they are useful models for studying how form and structure are determined at the molecular level in plant systems. Furthermore, plant galls constitute an important source of material for the study and exploration of new chemical substances of interest to humans, due to their physiological and adaptive characteristics. Considering the finely tuned control of morphogenesis, structural complexity, and biochemical regulation of plant galls induced by insects, it is proposed that an induction mechanism mediated by the insertion of exogenous genetic elements into the genome of plant gall cells could be involved in the formation of this kind of structure through an endosymbiotic bacterium.",6,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Effectors | Induction mechanism | Inductor insect | Insect galls | Plant morphogenesis,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,28

Objective: To study temporal variation in regional bird species composition (i.e. set of species that make up the assemblage) and richness (i.e. species number) and the factors that drive it, and quantify the importance of temporal-beta diversity to sustain bird regional diversity, in the fluvial system of the Middle Paraná River in Argentina. Methods: We sampled birds on a regional scale by performing 16 repeated surveys roughly every 45 days across 2 years (2011-2013) at 60 point counts distributed along the fluvial system. Results: We recorded a total of 162 species and 12 738 detections, with a mean of 72.7 ± 1.9 species and 796.1 ± 41 individuals per survey. Temporal beta diversity accounted for 57 % of regional bird species richness. Bird composition varied seasonally because of the species turnover (and not nestedness) between non-breeding and breeding periods; migrant species contributed to this issue but did not account for all these differences. Difference in bird composition between years was associated primarily to species turnover within non-breeding periods and was related to changes in water levels. Temporal variation in availability of habitats across the regional extent of the fluvial system accounted for the highest proportion of temporal beta diversity. Species richness neither varies seasonally nor was it related to fluctuations in water level or habitats. Conclusions: The climatic seasonality and environmental dynamics of the fluvial system, as a function of water-level fluctuations and of variations in habitat availability, jointly influence regional composition of birds through temporal species turnover. These variations in regional composition were not related to variations in regional species richness.

Four of these sites were associated with xerophytic forests and eight with exotic pastures. The richness, composition and capture rate recorded in both ecosystems were determined. We compared the richness and composition of birds detected by camera traps with those obtained through auditory and visual methods. Through camera trapping, 74 species of birds were recorded, belonging to 30 families and 16 orders. The xerophytic forest and the exotic pasture have a 52.7 % similarity in species composition. With regard to capture rates, the most frequently recorded species were: Leptotila verreauxi (16.14 %), Ortalis canicollis (14.28 %) and Furnarius cristatus (11.39 %). The camera traps were effective in detecting 33% of the species identified in the area based on direct and auditory observation sampling techniques, and added two species not detected by direct methods.

This causes the harmful accumulation of nitrogen compounds altering the chemistry of the substrate and causing defoliation and death of vegetation. The impact of these colonies on the mangroves in Cuba has not been evaluated, due to the logistical difficulties involved and the complexity of their processes. Objective: Mathematical modeling is a useful tool in these situations, so in this work the estimation of the quantities of biomass, energy and nutrients mobilized in a colony of herons was carried out, through a bioenergetic model of system dynamics. Methods: We used 29 primary variables, 3 bioenergetic equations and the postnatal growth equation of this species, implemented in the STELLA 9.1.3 program. From the interaction of these variables, the energy required by the reproduction cycle, the biomass consumed and the nutrients deposited in the colony were obtained. A sensitivity analysis and an uncertainty analysis were carried out to explore the variables that have the most influence on the results. The model was validated by the consistency in the units, the test of extreme values and the comparison with values recorded in the literature. Finally, disturbances scenarios that can affect a real colony were simulated. Results: According to the model, each nestling require 10 219.2 kcal to growth. The colony must totally invest 6.71x106 kcal, which represents consumption close to 2.2 tons of dams. Due to this consumption, the nutrients deposited in the colony by the excreta were 49 kg of nitrogen, 7 kg of phosphorus and 56 kg of calcium. According to the sensitivity analysis, the variables that produce the strongest changes in the result are the number of adults in the colony and the average clutch size.

We made 10 transects (100*5 m), we recorded types of growth such as trees, shrubs, herbaceous, palmoid, liana, epiphyte, hemiepiphyte, parasite, tree fern and morphological data. We assessed families and genera composition using diversity, dominance, equitability and similarity indexes; IVI, IPF, IVF and frequency distribution (altitude, coverage, DAP). We recorded 102 families, 257 genera and 483 species, with 73 dicotyledons (72 %), 13 monocotyledons (13 %) and 15 pteridophytes (15 %). Families with the highest genera and species number were: Rubiaceae (15 genera/29 species), Piperacae (2/25), Gesneriaceae (11/19), Melastomataceae (8/19), Solanaceae (4/16) Araceae and Urticaeceae (7/15 each one). Genera with the highest species number were: Piper (16 species), Miconia (10), Ficus, Peperonia and Solanum (9) Anthurium and Passiflora, Siparuna, Pilea and Zanthoxylum (6). Dominance and diversity indicated species uniformity, supported in the forest equitability. The similitude between transects is 24 % denoting a high species turnover. The herbaceous growth was the better represented with 56 families and 166 species.

Objective: To evaluate the influence of seasonal upwelling over the Panama Bight on the structure of the water column and mesozooplankton communities in a tropical cove of the ETP. Methods: Hydrographic data and mesozooplankton samples were collected during four field campaigns in Ensenada de Utría (December 2011, February 2012, October 2013, and February 2013), an estuary located in the Northern Pacific coast of Colombia. Non-parametric and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate seasonal differences in the environmental and biotic variables. Results: Surface waters were warm (> 25 °C) and presented low salinities (< 30) throughout the study period. In contrast, subsurface waters were colder (< 20 °C), saltier (> 33), and presented low dissolved oxygen concentrations (< 2.0 ml l-1) during the dry season (January-March), whereas the water column was homogeneous during the rainy season (April-December). Despite the seasonal changes in the environmental conditions, the expected enhancement in the productivity of the system during the dry season (i.e., higher biomass and abundance of the mesozooplankton) only occurred in February 2012. Contrary to expectations, ichthyoplankton abundance was higher during the rainy season, when the assemblage was dominated by the larvae of anchovy (Cetengraulis mysticetus) and an unidentified Gobiidae. Conclusions: The entrance of upwelled waters into Ensenada de Utría is an important factor modulating the seasonal changes observed in the water column. However, there is high interannual variability in the response of mesozooplankton communities to the upwelling events. Because upwelled waters are oxygen-depleted and more acidic, the entrance of upwelled waters into Ensenada de Utría could be causing physiological stress to the benthic and pelagic organisms inhabiting the deepest zones of the cove. This condition may worsen in the future given the predicted increase of deoxygenation and ocean acidi-fication due to climate change.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Colombia | Eastern Tropical Pacific | Hypoxia | Ichthyoplankton | Mesozooplankton,13567,Univalle,021-11,Universidad del Valle,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,41

Opportunistic sightings and systematic surveys from the beach and at sea were carried out along 40 km of coast, accounting for 917.2 km of tracking by car from land and 707.4 km of boat tracking by sea. Average group size was 5.31 dolphins/group (SD = 1.97, range 1-10), with no significant changes throughout the study period. From land, however, the group size was underestimated 32 % on the average. This small bottlenose dolphin community currently has only nine individuals, including six adults, one immature and two calves, and is the smallest community within the Gulf of Guayaquil. The encounter rate ranged between 0.03 dolphins/km in the northwestern part and 0.32 dolphins/km in the South, where dolphins concentrate their activities, possibly because human activities are less intense there. Dolphins were generally distributed in the first 200 m from the shore, reaching up to 1 200 m in the Northern shallower part and where port and tourist activities concentrate. The dolphins’ speed was significantly higher when they were followed from a boat at close range (5.87 km/h) than when they were monitored from the beach (2.9 km/h) (P < 0.01), which suggests that boat tracking had an effect on dolphin´s movements. Pairwise cluster analysis showed that animals from this community show high rates of association among each other (average 0.67, range 0.01-1.0), indicating that is a highly cohesive community. Dolphins also showed high level of residence (average occurrence index = 0.62). During the study, two main threats were identified, a gillnet fishery in the Southwestern part and an intense fishing boat traffic in the Northwestern. Most of the study area is currently part of a coastal-marine protected area created in 2008, which offers an opportunity for the recovery and conservation of this dolphin community. Given its fragility, we recommend the environmental authorities to address potential threats for this dolphin community by eliminating gillnets, implementing an exclusion zone for fishing gear and boat traffic of 1 km width from the shore, and limit the speed of any type of vessel to 10 knots within the reserve.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Anthropogenic threats | Behavior | Bottlenose dolphin | Conservation and management | Ecology | Ecuador | Tursiops truncatus,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,42

Natural products such as essential oils are made up of active ingredients with wide application in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Thus, this study evaluates the essential oils from Mentha viridis and Mentha pulegium on coagulation, fibrinogenolysis and degradation of azocasein, induced by Bothrops sp and Lachesis muta muta venoms. These oils were achieved by hydrodistillation and presented, respectively, as the main constituents linalool (40.70 %), carvone (13.52 %) and α-terpinene (8.56 %); pulegone (50.01 %), menthol (31.90 %) and menthone (16.56 %). The essential oils were previously incubated with Bothrops alternatus venom, for two different times, then plasma was added and time was recorded. The M. viridis oil presented greater anticlotting potential. Meanwhile, the M. pulegium oil presented anticlotting or proclotting activity dependent on the dose tested. The incubation time also influenced the effect of the oils on the coagulation time. At azocaseinolytic assay, the oil from M. pulegium reduced the activity for all evaluated venoms.

Their rapid growth, along with their abilities to control erosion and maintain water at soil level, as well as provide nutrients by litterfall decomposition, make them a valuable group for recovery of degraded areas and in productive restoration of ecosystems, in particular via agroforestry systems. Agroforestry approaches can combine different bamboo species with other crops, to meet human needs while generating benefits for ecosystems. Similarly, bamboo forests or plantations together with mixed agroforestry systems can act as stepping-stones and biological corridors, in very fragmented landscapes by providing shelter and food for a wide diversity of organisms.

The Formicidae family is abundant in these ecosystems, plays a fundamental role in soil functions and is also considered a good indicator of land use changes. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the impact of riparian forest successional stages on the Formicidae richness, frequency, and composition. Sampling was performed during both dry and wet seasons using the TSBF method. Collected organisms were identified as morphospecies. Also, species-accumulation curves were created. Linear mixed models were used to evaluate the effects of seasonal, local, and successional stage on ant richness and frequency. Polynomial regression models were applied to investigate the relationship between ant richness and frequency with canopy cover and vegetation height. Lastly, the species composition was represented by the Jaccard similarity index. In total, we observed 1 940 individuals grouped into 86 morphospecies. We obtained more than 80 % of the probable species richness. Ant frequency and richness increased significantly, following the successional stage, with low values in the open areas, especially during the dry season. Canopy cover and vegetation height seemed to affect partially both Formicidae richness and frequency during the dry season. Intermediate and advanced successional areas presented similar species composition (with 50-shared species), followed by the areas of early succession (43) and anthropic use (34). We concluded that the elimination of riparian forests produces a considerable effect on the richness and frequency of the Formicidae family, mainly affecting them in open areas during the dry season, thus resulting in losses of 41 % in richness and 56 % in frequency in forest areas when they were transformed into agricultural systems. Nevertheless, succession restores forest structure and functions, thus favoring re-colonization of ant species.

The estuary is presently under the increasing impact of local, regional and global stressors. The expeditions on board the Skimmer (1979-1980) and Victor Hensen (1993-1994) research vessels provided multidisciplinary data on the estuary in support of management policies. However, updated information is still needed. Objectives: To update the published lists of fish species from both expeditions and make suggestions for new research areas for future evaluations of the ecosystem. Methods: The fish collections by the Skimmer covered a depth range of 10 to 50 m using an otter trawl net, and those aboard the Victor Hensen were made between 10 to 228 m depth using otter and beam trawl nets. The identification of most of the fish species and the measurement of its lenghts were made on board of both vessels. The species names were updated based on recent literature and the web page World Register of Marine Species (WORMS). The list of species identified in recent years based on voucher specimens from the estuary and deposited in the Ichthyology Collection of the Museum of Zoology, University of Costa Rica, was also included. Results: The total number of identified species from both vessels is 268. A new species of Pontinus is under description. Of the total, 19 are cartilaginous fishes and 249 are bony fishes. The Sciaenidae and the flatfishes were represented by 31 and 32 species, respectivley. The flatfish genus Symphurus was the most diverse, with 11 species. Eighteen species were identified after the publication of the original lists. Eight species were described based on specimens collected during the expeditions: Gymnothorax phalarus, Notarius biffi, N. cookei, Ophicthus mecoptera, O. melope, Sphoeroides rosenblatti, Trinectes xan-thurus and Urotrygon cimar. The five longer specimens collected by both vessels, were: the longtail sting ray Hypanus longus (117 cm), the pike conger Cynoponticus coniceps (103 cm), the brown sea catfish Sciades dowii (87 cm), the electric ray Narcine brancroftii (80 cm), and the queen corvina Cynoscion albus (75 cm). Conclusions: In view of the increasing number of users of the estuarine resources, it is urgent a multidisciplinary evaluation of the ecosystem in support of new management policies. The expected results may facilitate updating the Gulf of Nicoya Trophic Model, a management tool available for the estuary since 1998 and based mainly on information gathered during both expeditions. Ecosystem stressors, such as the extraction of resources, the input of pollutants and its possible link to endocrine disruption, as well as the presence of natural barriers such as hypoxia at deeper waters at the mouth of the estuary must be taken into account in a future evaluation.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Benthos | estuarine fish | Fish lengths | Fisheries | Porichthys | Prionotus | Symphurus | Trawl nets,13567,ZMT,undefined,Leibniz-Zentrum für Marine Tropenforschung,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,48

Cerasiform (Solanaceae) in its center of origin (south America) and domestication (Mexico).,Délices G.,Revista de Biologia Tropical,00347744,22152075,67,4,1023-1036,2019-09-01,September 2019,10.15517/rbt.v67i4.33754,"The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is one of the main horticultural crops in the world because of the important economic benefits that its commercialization generates. Even though the species is widely cultivated in the world, it is susceptible to pests, diseases, and environmental stresses due to the loss of its genetic diversity. There is a wild form called S. l. var ceraciforme that is distributed from South America (its center of origin) to Mexico (its area of domestication), specifically on the slope of the Gulf of Mexico in Veracruz. Due to the large genetic diversity of these wild tomatoes, it is important to improve its crop. The objective of this investigation was to identify patterns of environmental diversification of the tomato, infer the processes of adaptation of the populations in the area of domestication with respect to their center of origin and propose measures of conservation and variation of S. l. var. cerasiforme. We generated two ecological niche models (MNE) with Maxent version 3.4.1 (evaluated with AUC and partial-ROC) to determine the suitability of environmental conditions including their respective projections from the domestication center to the area of origin and vice versa. We used eight variables of temperature and precipitation. Additionally, we included tomato records from bibliographical sources and fieldwork. We also used the niche comparison test (equivalency and similarity) proposed by Broennimann et al. (2012) to evaluate the similarity of environmental conditions in both regions. Subsequently, we carried out an analysis of variance followed by a mean comparison test (Tukey, P ≤ 0.05) with all environmental variables measured. The values of AUC (0.93 and 0.80) and partial-ROC (1.86 and 1.71, P = 0.0001) of the MNE showed that they were good predictive models. We observed that, in the center of Mexico, there are environmental conditions similar to those of the center of origin, unlike the slope of the Gulf of Mexico where they are different. The equivalency test showed that the environmental comparison between both regions is less similar than expected by chance (P = 0.003). The similarity test indicated that the existing similarity between both regions can also be obtained by chance (P = 0.683). We also found significant differences in three temperature and precipitation variables. In conclusion, we determined that the center of origin and domestication of S. l. var. cerasiforme has similar environmental characteristics despite the geographic distance; nevertheless, there are geographical zones (the Gulf of Mexico in Veracruz) in the area of domestication with different environmental conditions. Those places have the potential to contain valuable germplasms.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Center of origin | Comparison of ecological niche | Distribution | Domestication area | Ecological niche modeling | Environmental predictors,13567,CONACYT,undefined,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,49

The aim of this paper was to identify carbon stocks in the kikuyu grass in its different compartments, above-ground biomass (AB) and below-ground biomass (BB) at 20 and 40 cm soil depth, under the traditional and silvopastoral systems in different reliefs. Six successive samplings (M) were taken according to the grazing system (traditional and silvopastoral system), and the geoform of the terrain (concave flank (CCF), convex flank (CXF), rectilinear flank (RF) and flat relief (FR)). The above-ground biomass and below-ground biomass were sampled. The statistical method used was a design in incomplete randomized blocks, two treatments were evaluated (T) (T1: traditional system and T2: silvopastoral system) with four blocks (B) in each one (B1: CCF, B2: CXF, B3: RF, B4: FR). This experiment was done from June 2016 to June 2017 in San Pedro de los Milagros, Antioquia, Colombia. The results allowed to determine that the roots at 20 cm depth, the dead creeping stems, and the leaves were the compartments with the highest carbon stocks (4.52, 3.58 and 1.9 ton of C ha-1, respectively). Differences were found (P < 0.05) between flat and rectilinear reliefs for the biomass of leaves, and between the flat relief with the other reliefs evaluated for the variable thick roots at 20 cm depth. The biomass produced by the plant is directly proportional to the incorporated carbon. The root biomass, both fine and thick roots, contributes to capture on average 2 820 kg and 655 kg of carbon per hectare at of 20 and 40 cm depth respectively. Kikuyu grass contributes to keep carbon reserves in the grasslands. Due to the high production of below-ground biomass and creeping stems, and its high capacity of regrowth under adverse conditions, this grass plays an important role in the reduction of GHG and the conservation of high tropical soils under specialized dairy systems.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Carbon capture | Creeping stems | Greenhouse gases | Pastures | Stoloniferous roots,13567,UdeA,undefined,Universidad de Antioquia,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,50

Despite the fact that this population has been studied since the 1950s, research has been rather punctual and fragmentary. Before 2010, there are only a few surveys conducted simultaneously in all rookeries, thus there is no reliable information on key aspects of life cycle, population trend and potential threats. In the present work we conducted a review of California sea lion life history and environmental changes in the Gulf of California thorough a collation of survey data encompassing the last 37 years. Objective: Our aim was focused on identifying short-and long-term processes potentially acting on the population, and hopefully improve knowledge about the population trend and status using different points of view. Methods: We collected and analyzed population survey data from different sources since the 1970s to 2018: published papers, master’s and doctoral thesis, in addition to technical reports. The survey data are organized in sections corresponding with crucial population life history events. Results: Considering a long-time period the population size appears to be stable with zero growth. Cyclic interannual fluctuation seem to denote a certain dependence with climatic factors, not directly with El Niño, but with sea surface temperature anomalies that determine prey availability. However, many doubts persist about the incidence of different local environmental factors on gender and age, particularly related with juvenile recruitment and female survival rate. Conclusions: In conclusion, more information is required based on seasonal surveys, life cycle, regional environmental variation. Statistical errors need to be assessed and monitoring methods should be standardized and must be considered to ascertain short-and long-term population and colony spatial-temporal patterns.",3,Journal,re,Review,100,4,4,Climate change | Gulf of California | Population trend | Review | Zalophus californianus,13567,INAPESCA,undefined,Instituto Nacional de Pesca y Acuacultura,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,51

Objective: We investigate the interaction between the orange tree and wild boar, both of which share Asian origins and have been introduced to the Americas (i.e. the overseas). Methods: Specifically, we assessed whether i) wild boars consume orange (Citrus sinensis) fruits and seeds in orchards adjacent to a remnant of the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, ii) the orange seeds are viable after passing through boar’s digestive tract and iii) whether the orange tree may naturalise in the forest remnant assisted by wild boars. Results: Our camera surveys indicated that wild boar was by far the most frequent consumer of orange fruits (40.5 % of camera trap-days). A considerable proportion of sown orange seeds extracted from fresh boar feces emerged seedlings (27.8 %, N = 386) under controlled greenhouse conditions. Further, 37.6 % of sown seeds (N = 500) in the forest remnant emerged seedlings in July 2015; however, after ~4 years (March 2019) only 9 seedlings survived (i.e. 4.8 %, N = 188). Finally, 52 sweet orange seedlings were found during surveys within the forest remnant which is intensively used by wild boars. This study indicates a high potential of boars to act as effective seed dispersers of the sweet orange. However, harsh competition with native vegetation and the incidence of lethal diseases, which quickly kill sweet orange trees under non-agricultural conditions, could seriously limit orange tree establishment in the forest. Conclusions: Our results have important implications not only because the wild boar could be a vector of potential invasive species, but also because they disperse seeds of some native species (e.g. the queen palm, Syagrus romanzofiana) in defaunated forests, where large native seed dispersers are missing; thus, wild boars could exert critical ecological functions lost due to human activity.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Agroecosystems | Citrus | Frugivory | Invasions | Naturalization | Novel interactions | Seed dispersal | Sus scrofa,13567,FCT,IF/00728/2013,Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,52

Those interactions have strong impacts on local salinity conditions and availability of water and nutrients at local level, and on mangrove structure and composition. Based on the analysis of aerial photographs, field sampling and statistical multivariate analysis, floristic composition and structure of the mangroves present in the Sanguaré Natural Reserve were analyzed. Three types of forests were identified according to the physiographic classification of mangroves. A fridge mangrove dominated by Rhizophora mangle L. in a juvenile state, with low structural development, and two types of inland or basin mangroves dominated by Avicennia germinans (L.) L. The first of them, located behind the fridge mangrove, showed high salinity in the soil and in the interstitial water, predominance of sandy sediments, and low values of height and diameter at breast height (DBH) average of the trees. The second, with a low number of adult trees in all diameter categories, high basal area, low natural regeneration potential, and high concentrations of Fe and Cu in the soil, probably associated with contamination by domestic spills. The location of the first inner mangrove behind the fridge mangrove reveals the typical zonation of many mangroves in the world. The floristic composition, structure and distribution of the mangroves in the Sanguaré Reserve are the result of the interaction of local environmental variables such as salinity and soil texture, as well as the anthropic intervention prior to the establishment of the reserve and the current human presence being very close to the mangroves.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Conservation | Contamination | Mangrove | Natural variability | Regeneration,13567,UN,undefined,Universidad Nacional de Colombia,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,53

This study aims to expand the knowledge of modern, Neotropical freshwater ostracode fauna, across an altitudinal gradient from the karst lakes in the lowlands of El Petén, Guatemala (100-500 m.a.s.l.), to the mid-elevation lakes of the Lacandón forest (500-1 000 m.a.s.l.), to the higher-altitude lakes of Montebello, Chiapas, Mexico (1 000-1 500 m.a.s.l.). Eighteen ostracode species were identified in 24 lakes. Ostracodes were absent in Lakes Amarillo and Lacandón (mid-altitude), and San Diego (lowlands); probably explained by a structural difference of habitats and species interactions. Statistical analysis indicated that the most abundant species, Cypridopsis vidua (O.F. Müller, 1776), Cytheridella ilosvayi Daday, 1905, Pseudocandona antilliana Broodbakker, 1983, and Darwinula stevensoni (Brady & Robertson, 1870) have a continuous distribution along the entire altitudinal gradient. Some species display more restricted distributions, determined by temperature, precipitation and conductivity. For example, Eucypris sp. is restricted to the lowlands, Vestalenula sp. and Cypria sp. were found only at middle elevations. Species diversity is slightly greater in lakes at middle altitudes (Haverage = 1.09) than in water bodies in the lowlands (Haverage = 0.94) and in cooler lakes in the highlands (Haverage = 0.94), suggesting that mid-elevation lakes have a high potential for harboring microrefugia. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS regres-sions) provided ecological preference information for the four most frequent and widely distributed species, with respect to temperature, conductivity, bicarbonate (HCO3-) concentration, precipitation, and pH. Darwinula stevensoni suggest an association more to cooler temperatures and lower conductivities proving its high tolerance range. Cypridopsis vidua is associated with warm and low-rainfall environments, such as recorded in the lowlands of Guatemala, and can be used as a paleobioindicator of vegetated littoral zones, because we found it always associated to this section of lakes. Cytheridella ilosvayi show preferences for warm and humid conditions, whereas P. antilliana prefer colder and humid environments. Such quantitative-ecological information will improve ostracode-based paleoenvironmental reconstructions in Southern Mexico and Northern Guatemala. In addition, our approach serves as a model for future paleoecological studies that employ other aquatic bioindicators, such as testate amoebae, cladocerans, and chironomids.",5,Journal,ar,Article,100,10,10,Diversity | Ecology | Neotropic | Non-marine ostracodes,13567,UF,CONACYT,University of Florida,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,54

Mercury is considered one of the most dangerous heavy metals, causing chromosomal breakage (clastogenic event) or spindle dysfunction (aneugenic event), that can lead to the formation of encapsulated chromatin into a separate smaller nucleus, generally referred to as a micronucleus. We evaluated the sensitivity of the micronucleus test in the neotropical cichlid Andinoacara rivulatus (Günther 1860). The fish were divided into four groups of 16 individuals, and each group was placed in separate aquaria (140 L) provided with filtered water and constant aeration. Fish were exposed to mercury chloride (HgCl2) at doses 0.1, 0.25, and 0.50 mg/kg body weight, administered by intraperitoneal (IP) injection. Fish from the control group were injected with a physiologic solution. The following erythrocyte anomalies were identified: erythrocytes with micronuclei varying to some extent in size and position in the cytoplasm, blebbed nucleus, binucleated cell, nuclei showing a deep invagination toward the center (notched nuclei). Examination of blood smears demonstrated a higher level of micronucleus and notched erythrocytes in fish injected with HgCl2 than in the controls. There were significant differences in the frequency of micronucleated and notched erythrocytes among the groups exposed to mercury. Linear regression analysis revealed a positive relationship between the frequency of micronucleated and notched erythrocytes (P< 0.0001), with a moderately strong correlation coefficient (R= 0.737). We propose that, in addition to the two so far known mechanisms of micronucleus formation (spindle apparatus damage and chromosomal ruptures), chromatin fragmentation in notched nuclei resulting from a combination of the cytotoxic effects of mercury and mechanical stress, may be a third mechanism of micronuclei genesis.",4,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,DNA damage | Erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities | Fish | Heavy metal | micronuclei,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,55

Numerous management strategies and regulations have been developed to monitor and reduce population declines. In Puerto Rico, an administrative order of 1999, regulates a closed season, prohibited the capture of crabs through the year from NPA’s and below a minimum size for capture (64 mm). The goal of this research was to monitor spatial-temporal dynamics of crab captures after the implementation of the administrative order. Crabs captured in the Jobos Bay Estuary (JBE) were studied over a 15-year period. The size (carapace width) (CW), sex, and color were documented for 1 531 crabs from 31 crab hunters. Significant temporal difference in crab size was observed (Kruskal Wallis = 46.82, P < 6.187e-9), the smallest crabs were captured in 2004 and the largest crabs were captured in 2013. Crab size varied by color (Kruskal Wallis = 86.54, P < 2.2e-16), larger crabs were blue, medium sized crabs were brown and smallest crabs were orange. Since color is related to development stage and market value, color can be used as an educational and enforcement tool. There was significant spatial difference in the size of crabs captured (Kruskal Wallis = 252.54, P < 2.2e-16), smaller crabs were captured in smaller hunting areas. Only three percent of crabs captured from 2009 to 2018 were below the legal-size limit.

A trial with 40 clones produced by grafting was planted in Veracruz, Mexico. Heritability, genetic correlations and genetic gain of clones were estimated with data at two years-old. The survival rate of the trial was of 97 % (466 living ramets in total), 2.84 m in total high and 2.32 cm of average normal diameter. Aditionally, 9.9 % of the ramets did not present attacks, indication of evasion, and 0.6 percent without response to attack. With response to attack 89.5 % of the ramets (several degrees of tolerance): 29 % with a single shoot, 14.2 % with several shoots and 46.3 % with a dominant shoot of several shoots formed. The clonal heritability of normal diameter, height, volume, stem taper index, number of attacks and response to the attack was H2c = 0.81, 0.80, 0.81, 0.61, 0.34, and 0.26. The genetic correlations between height, diameter and volume were ≥ 0.95, and the correlation of the volume with the incidence and the response to the attack was rg= -0.31 and rg=0.62, that is a decrease in number of attacks and moderate increase in tolerance. With a selection intensity of 10 %, selecting the four clones with higher volume will produce a genetic gain of 82 % for volume, a decrease of 10.9 % of number of attacks and 6.3 % of better recovery from damage; this is more tolerance to the insect attack.

Small ectotherms with specialized diets are highly susceptible to environmental change, as their life cycle is largely affected by temperature and by the presence of specific resources. This study focuses on two species of rolled-leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae), both present at two different elevations in Costa Rica: Cephaloleia belti Baly, a diet-generalist, and Chelobasis bicolor Gray, a diet-specialist. Body size, energetic condition (lipid storage), muscle mass and immune condition (melanization response) were compared in beetle populations from a tropical rainforest (50 m elevation) and a tropical montane forest (2 000 m elevation). These measurements reflect current and past nutritional condition and hence are good estimators of individual fitness. We analyzed a total of 172 individuals from both species, sexes and elevations.We predicted that beetles at higher elevation would display larger body size, higher energeticcondition and lower immune response associated with metabolic requirements and parasitic pressure in colder temperatures. In general, beetles at high altitude were larger, had more lipids and muscle and showed stronger melanization (i.e., immune response) than beetles at low altitudes. Such differences among populations at different elevations may reflect local adaptation to altitude or phenotypic plasticity. However, the effect of elevation was not equivalent amongst species or sex.

In order to generate scientific information to support decisions and more appropriate fisheries management and conservation policies, the variability and genetic structure of M. incilis along the Caribbean coast of Colombia was evaluated. Six coastal systems were selected, including three coastal lagoon systems with open access to fishing (Ciénaga La Virgen, Ciénaga La Caimanera and Bahía de Cispatá) and three coastal lagoons belonging to fauna and flora sanctuaries of the network of National Natural Parks of Colombia (Los Flamencos, Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta and El Corchal). Seven microsatellite loci were used, which revealed 94 alleles with an average of 11.6 alleles per locus. The values of genetic variability in all sampling sites were low (Ho = 0.108-0.402), although they showed a high genetic potential (He = 0.772-0.868). All the loci presented departures from the Hardy-Weinberg expectations due to a deficiency of heterozygotes. This was in agreement with the events of recent bottlenecks that were determined in all the lagoons and the causes could be overfishing and the presence of null alleles. The analysis of genetic structuring revealed the existence of two populations, one formed by the localities located from La Guajira to Sucre; a second in Bahía de Cispatá and the third one in Ciénaga La Caimanera.

Their vector, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae), often reached unprecedented huge populations in agricultural areas. This elicited a serious production crisis worldwide, that caused losses of millions of dollars for farmers in many countries, including the Mesoamerican region. Fortunately, in Costa Rica, some local research centers, with the collaboration of foreign specialists, have been able to study the causes of this phenomenon, in the search for solutions based on solid epidemiological information. In addition to the previously reported native Bemisiatabaci species, New World (NW), two exotic species, - Mediterranean (MED) and Middle East-Asia Minor 1 (MEAM1) - were found.

Apparently collective apprehension influences, which animals are perceived as part of the environment. Our results suggest that the jaguar is not conceived as part of the (direct) environment, but is conceived as dangerous animal in the area.

Despite the variation in skull morphometrics and echolocation calls among populations, Gorgona population was more similar to S. leptura than to S. bilineata. Besides, evolutionary allometry was significant, but size explained a small proportion of shape differences among populations. Finally, roosting association of Gorgona population suggests a monogamous mating system such as in S. leptura. We conclude that Saccopteryx from Gorgona corresponds to S. leptura.

Microclimate is among the first modified factors after vegetation loss, effects of such disturbances are critical for species performance. However, both secondary succession and seasonality provoke further modifications in abiotic environment after disturbances. Although microclimate patterns during succession are well studied for several ecosystems, they are practically unknown for low thorn forests. In Northern Mexico, this is an endangered ecosystem characterized by harboring a high percentage of endemics. Measurement of microclimatic factors is crucial for understanding possible consequences of post-disturbance time on species inhabiting this ecosystem. This work aimed to assess seasonal variation of microclimatic patterns in a succession gradient of four categories (conserved areas, 31, 17 and four years of succession). The study area was delimited using Landsat satellite images (1973, 1986, 2000, 2005, and 2013) in a fragment of low thorn forest in Northeastern Mexico. For microclimate characterization we studied wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, heat index, dew point, and evapotranspiration. Variables were measured monthly on eight plots, in each of the four successional categories, during two different seasons: wet (May through October 2016) and dry season (November 2016 through April 2017). A multivariate discriminant function analysis showed that microclimate differs among successional stages. In the wet season, early succession areas were characterized by higher values of heat index and wind speed, contrary to conserved areas. In the dry season, successional differences were attributed to wind speed and relative humidity. Moreover, microclimate differences between categories and importance of variables measured were both higher only during the dry season. Our results show that seasonality influences greatly microclimatic patterns during secondary succession. In addition, each one of the successional categories exhibited unique microclimatic conditions. Remarkably, four, 17, and even 31 years succession categories differed from conserved areas. This work provides evidence on the great relevance of seasonality and microclimate for studying secondary succession.

These have shown different types of biological activities, mainly cytotoxic, bactericidal and antioxidant. In this research the marine sponge Iotrochota birotulata collected in Punta Bello-Córdoba in the Colombian Caribbean was studied, and its lipid profile from the analysis of the corresponding mass spectra of its constituent compounds was determined, 19 fatty acids were identified, which are reported for the first time for this specie, besides 10 sterols were identified. Fatty acids with carbon chains between C15 and C27 were found, showing a wide structural diversity, which is characteristic of the porifera phylum. The sterols showed structures mainly with nucleus Δ 5 and Δ 7 , which are the most abundant in sponges. Moderate antioxidant activity was found in the stabilization of the radical cation ABTS+• and low activity in the stabilization of the radical DPPH•, the highest inhibition value was found in the aqueous extract with an IC 50 de 43.9 µg/ml against the radical cation ABTS+•, showing that I. birotulata can produce compounds with moderate antioxidant activity. In the insecticidal activity test, larval affectation was found in methanolic and aqueous extracts at all concentrations and at all times of exposure evaluated against Spodoptera frugiperda, it was also determined that these extracts induce an antifeedant effect on the larvae as part of the mechanism insecticide.

The immature stages of mosquitoes occur in a wide range of natural or human-made aquatic habitats. On this basis, some anthropogenic places such as cemeteries, usually serve as thrive and productive artificial-breeding habitats for mosquitoes. Despite being important foci for vector species, urban cemeteries are frequently overlooked in control and surveillance programs. This study evaluates the association of ecological variables and attributes (type of material, presence of flowers, water availability and height from the ground) of the breeding sites with the levels of infestation of mosquito immature stages. In 2017, an entire urban cemetery in Jarabacoa (Dominican Republic) was sampled at two different climatic periods (March: dry and August: rainy) for the characterization of the artificial breeding-sites, collection of immature stages of culicids and subsequent laboratory rearing for species identification. In total 968 containers were studied, containing 7 758 immature stages in 203 (21.0 %) water-filled containers which accounted for four species: Culex quinquefasciatus (50.5 %), Aedes aegypti (47.1 %), Aedes albopictus (1.9 %) and Culex nigripalpus (0.4 %). The mean of A. aegypti immatures in infested containers was roughly two times higher compared to C. quinquefasciatus and significantly lower compared to A. albopictus. The total Container Index (CI) was 20.9 %, and among the type of materials, those made from rock (cement, ceramic, and mud) and plastic had the highest CI = 25.9 % and 23.4 %, respectively. Almost 95 % of the total infested water-filled containers were made of plastic or rock. No association was found between the type of material of the containers and the density of mosquitoes. However, overall, greater densities of immature stages were found at ground than at higher levels. A weak positive correlation between water volume and density was found in some species of immature stages. Significantly higher number of C. quinquefasciatus were recorded in containers with flowers and large water volume. In contrast, A. aegypti immature stages were more frequent in containers without flowers. A weak negative association between water volume and infestations was found for A. albopictus immatures. As reflected of their opportunistic behaviour and broad ecological plasticity, Culex spp. and Aedes spp. mosquitoes were abundant pests in cemetery habitats where were able to breed in almost any kind of water-filled container regardless the type of material.

The Odonata order have been indicated by several authors as relevant bioindicators for assessing and monitoring environmental conditions of specific locations. The main objective of this study was to conduct an inventory of the Odonata diversity in the Pampa Biome, of the Southern region of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The species survey was conducted between November 2014 and October 2015. Adult insects were collected in Capão do Leão, Pelotas and Rio Grande cities. Each location was visited nine times, totalizing 54 samplings. Entomological nets were used for capturing adult insects, which were then kept in entomological envelopes. The identification of the specimens was carried out with taxonomic keys of Lencioni and Heckman. In addition, Chao-1, the Shannon-Wiener and Jackknife indexes were associated with the sampling areas. During the species survey a total of 2 680 Odonata specimens were collected, representing 45 species encompassed in 22 genera and six families. The Libellulidae and Coenagrionidae families were registered in 60 and 30 % of the specimens sampled, followed of the Aeshnidae, Calopterygidae, Gomphidae and Lestidae, of reduced occurrence. The genera Erythrodiplax, Micrathyria and Ischnura were found at least once in all the visited sites. The study resulted in the registration for the first time of the following species: Progomphus complicatus Selys, Lestes minutus Selys, Homeoura ambigua Ris, and Tauriphila xiphea Ris. These species were not previously reported in any Odonata study of the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. In regard to Odonata diversity in the Southern region of Rio Grande do Sul, Libellulidae and Coenagrionidae are the families more abundants. Erythrodiplax and Micrathyria are the most common genera.

Despite their importance for assessment of ecological services and for intrinsic ecological value, comparative studies of paired native montane forest and conifer plantation are scarce along the Northern Andean Cordillera. Additionally, extrapolations are challenging because each pair of communities is highly site specific due to environmental setting, age and density of plantation, and reforestation species. Here, we assess and compare structure, biogeochemistry and ecosystem services provided by closely positioned native forest and pine plantation from a protected montane area in Venezuela. Soil nutrients and soil carbon content were 60 and 54 % respectively higher in the forest. As consequence of pine’ growth form and leaf biochemistry, aboveground biomass and litter mass, as well as nutrient content and carbon stocks, were higher in the plantation. This results in the plantation storing 30 % more MgC ha -1 than the nearby forest. Canopy structure and litter properties influence the hydrology of both ecosystems through differences in rain throughfall. Most of the ecosystem services itemized are superior in the native forest, with exception that the younger plantation sequesters more carbon.

One of the main negative factors for profitable business is the lack of knowledge about, among other things, the basic elements to formulate well-balanced diets and to provide the fish with their basic nutritional requirements for an optimal development.

Further, concerning the Mammalian class, bats are one of the best represented taxa in the region, nevertheless their ecology is poorly studied. This study, evaluates the influence of environmental factors such as the climate season, temperature (maximum and minimum), relative humidity and lunar phase on the activity patterns (abundance and trophic guilds) of an assemblage of bats in the Brazilian central Amazon. This study was carry out in two municipalities of the state of Rondônia using eight mist nets during 62 nights of sampling, covering humid and dry periods. A total of 2 499 individuals of 58 species were captured. The best represented family was the Phyllostomidae, while the species that recorded the highest frequency of captures was Carollia perspicillata (N = 859), followed by C. brevicauda (N = 209). There were no significant differences between the structure of the assemblage considering the climatic season (rain-dry). However, during the dry season a greater number of species and individuals was recorded (57 species, N = 1 597) than in the rainy season (44 species, N = 902). The abundance of bats was influenced mainly by relative humidity (P = 0.00) and minimal temperature (P = 0.04), while the species responded differentially to the lunar phase. These results show the influence of environmental factors on the activity patterns of a bat assemblage in the Amazon, where the factors that influence them depends on the ecology of each species.

These production systems, as well as social and economic influences, have created diverse landscapes-mosaics composed of varied elements of vegetation cover (forests, crops, pastures, barren fields) that are distributed across spaces in different ways. In this investigation, we determine the distribution patterns of the richness, abundance and diversity of the bird community within the configuration and composition of agroforestry and silvopastoral landscapes. We observed 262 bird species, 6 720 individuals, 23 orders and 54 families within 39 production system mosaics. None of the species accumulation curves in the production systems reached their asymptote, and the calculated estimators predicted a greater number of species than those observed during the survey. In general terms, richness, diversity and equitability indices were highest in the mosaics of agroforestry systems, while abundance and dominance indices were highest in the mosaics associated with silvopastoral and traditional livestock systems. Variables that describe vegetation cover in mosaics have different and independent effects on the diversity of bird assemblages and on the association of land use groups within the mosaics. The positive extreme of the first component contributes to the variance in the model of richness and diversity indices-both the structural components of landscapes and biological components of the assemblages. The area and disposition of different types of elements in the mosaics of the production system landscapes reflect the systematic management of covers, which affects the implications of landscape conservation and restoration practices. Different landscape elements serve as points of contact in the dispersion and distribution of species within these landscapes. The priority of conservation efforts and the first step for the restoration and connectivity of landscapes in the Andean Amazon of Colombia should be the management and protection of covers like old stubble or BFG and BRP. Another approach is the design of landscapes for entire communities of species with respect to certain quantities of habitats in the landscape and the isolation of patches.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Agroforestry | Birds | Diversity | Heterogeneity | Landscape | Richness | Silvopastoral,13567,UN,undefined,Universidad Nacional de Colombia,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,101

Data in this study are based on the expeditions of the RV Skimmer (20 stations, 1979-1980) and RV Victor Hensen (1993-1994, 12 stations) in the Gulf of Nicoya estuary. The crustaceans were collected by means of an Otter trawl (Skimmer, mesh 3.5 cm) and by Otter and Beam trawls (V. Hensen, mesh 2.5 cm and 1.0 cm, respectively) at depths from 10 m to 228 m. Data from two later studies were also included, one from an intertidal flat in the upper Gulf and the other from stations at the mouth of the estuary, which expand the depth range from 0 to 350 m. The list of species in the original publications were updated and 32 corrections were made based on recent literature and the web page, World Register of Marine Species (WORMS). The total number of species for both surveys was 131, of which 119 were decapods and 12 were stomatopods. Data from the other two studies and from the crustacean collection deposited at the University of Costa Rica Zoology Museum added 43 records for a total of 174 species collected in sediments from the estuary. For the Skimmer, the minimum number of species found in one station was four (three stations) and the maximum was 27, with an average of 12.3 species / station. For the V. Hensen, the minimum of species found in one station was eight, with a maximm of 27 and an average of 17 species / station. The species present in 50 % or more of the 20 stations of the Skimmer expedition, were: Callinectes arcuatus, Rimapenaeus faoe, Penaeus brevirostris, Achelous asper and Hepatus kossmanni. For the V.

Orthoptera predominated in terms of number, volume, frequency of occurrence, and relative importance. Males consumed smaller prey items relative to females. Although both sexes consumed similar numbers of prey, we found a significant effect of interaction of sex and size of frogs on this variable, with small females consuming more prey than the large ones, whereas in males the opposite occurred. High consumption of orthopterans (at least in volume) is a common phenomenon within Craugastoridae and is possibly related to the success of some species in the ecosystems where they live.

Methods: Potential distribution models were generated with presence data, anthropic and bioclimatic variables using the maximum entropy algorithm (Maxent). Results: The potential distribution models showed spatial segregation between both species. The presence of feral pigs was positively influenced by palm oil crops (Elaeis guineensis) proximity and seasonal rainfall; the potential distribution of collared peccaries was positively correlated with temperature and canopy coverage. Evidence of feral pigs presence was confirmed in Escárcega, Carmen, Candelaria and Palizada in Campeche state and in Balancán and Jonuta in Tabasco state. Our models predicted potential areas for feral pigs in Pantanos de Centla Biosphere Reserve in Tabasco and in areas near the Guatemalan border.

Two sections in particular, Brathys and Trygynobrathys are an integral part of the Paramo flora. Hypericum genus has a wide variety of metabolites that are associated with multiple pharmacological activities, and specifically in H. juniperinum antidepressant properties related to the presence of flavonoids and phenolic compounds have been reported. The objective of this research is to relate the anatomical structures with the metabolites detected by histochemical methods present in the vegetative and reproductive organs of Hypericum juniperinum collected in the Colombian Paramo. The aerial organs (stems, leaves and flowers) of Hypericum juniperinum were collected in the village Arbolocos of the municipality of Cuitiva, Boyacá (voucher code No. 589611, COL). For the anatomical analysis, the organs of H. juniperinum were processed with fixation techniques, incorporation in paraffin, cutting in microtome and staining with Astra-blue and basic fuchsin; for the histochemical analysis freehand cuts were made with specific stains for lipids, phenol compounds, alkaloids and pectins. The anatomy of the organs of H. juniperinum should be understood in the context of the living conditions of the Paramo. Leaves are highly xeromorphic as they are chartaceous, rosette-shaped, convolute and upright, with parenchyma in bistratified palisade, thickened walls, thick cuticle and epicuticular wax in both foliar epidermis, stomata on the abaxial side and with epidermal chamber. However, it has some mesomorphic characteristics such as parenchymatic bundle sheath and loose spongy parenchyma. Hypericum juniperinum has translucent glands in leaves, calyx and gynoecium, and lacks black glands typical of the Hypericum section belonging to the medicinal plant Hypericum perforatum. Histochemical analysis showed lipids in leaf canals, radial parenchyma of the stem and in some floral structures. Phenolic compounds were detected along the leaf, in the phloem of the stem and in the anthers. Hypericum juniperinum lacks alkaloids and presents pectins in the parenchyma of the sheath surrounding the vascular bundle of the leaf. The present work contributes by relating the metabolites with their distribution in the tissues of this native species.

The laboratory culture of this species-complex allows its use as a test species in toxicity bioassays and reproduction studies. Objective: It is pretended to observe mortality under two temperature and salinity ranges as optimal conditions to culture Capitella sp. in the laboratory. Metodology: Polychaetes were collected in Callao Province, Peru, during November 2016 and January 2017. A bioassay was carried out to observe mortality under different temperature and salinity ranges using two treatments: treatment 1, with polychaetes collected during January 2017, which were subjected to conditions similar to the collection site (temperature: 20-22° C, salinity: 30-32 psu); treatment 2, with the organisms collected during November 2016, with temperature (24-26 °C) and salinity (32 a 34 ups) selected according to bibliographic data. Results: The increase of temperature and time significantly influenced polychaete mortality of the two treatments (Spearman correlation), while salinity and dissolved oxygen did not show correlation with mortality. Significant effect of time was observed on mortality, with more deaths from the second half of the experiment. Organisms from treatment 1, with environmental conditions similar to those of their habitat survived more than worms from treatment 2. These results were also observed in the porcentual varibility of the variation coefficient among days in each treatment. The cumulative mortality curve did not show differences between treatments. Conclusion: The optimal ranges to culture Capitella sp. in the laboratory are those from their habitat. In addition to temperature and time, other posible causes of the observed mortality can be worms age, health or maturity, and probably the bad quality of the water used during the bioassay.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Bioassay | Dissolved oxygen | Polychaetes | Salinity | Survivorship | Temperature,13567,NA,undefined,Total,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,114

It comprises three basins: western (close to Río Lagartos fishermen village), middle (Las Coloradas) and eastern (close to El Cuyo fishermen vil-lage), that communicate through very narrow natural channels. Despite several studies have been performed on the vertebrate fauna, the aquatic invertebrates, and especially polychaetes, remain largely unknown. Objective: The objective of this study is to describe the composition and distribution of the benthic polychaete community, and to analyse potential environmental drivers. Methods: The biological material was collected in 16 stations distributed along the lagoon during the rainy season (September 2017). Two replicates per station were obtained using a Ponar standard dredge or cores (6” diameter). Environmental variables such as grain size, organic carbon content in the sediments, and salinity, among others, were measured. Results: A total of 827 specimens belonging to 26 species and 16 families were identified. Of these, 23 species are new records for the Río Lagartos lagoon. Community composition changed between the different basins associated with strong gradients in salinity, subaquatic vegetation (algae and seagrasses) proportions in the samples and grain size. No polychaetes were recorded at the easternmost basin (El Cuyo basin), where salinity was between 67-80 psu. In the rest of the lagoon, the distribution of polychaetes was heterogeneous, especially near the mouth (western basin), where the highest and lowest density, species richness and diversity were recorded. The highest density was found at station 6, where dense algal mats of the genus Avrainvillea dominated. The families Syllidae and Nereididae were the most abundant and widely distributed families in the lagoon. The species Syllis lagunae and Nereis pelagica dominated the western basin and Prionospio heterobranchia and Sphaerosyllis taylori dominated the middle basin. Conclusions: The salinity records associated with some species were well above the top limits previously reported, establishing the euryhaline character of many species in the region.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Annelida | Estuarine systems | Macrobenthos | Salinity gradients | Yucatán,13567,CONACYT,0249795,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,115

It comprises three different management areas: the central one (“core”, strict protection, only control and monitoring activities), surrounded by a “buffer” area (authorized activities, e.g. scientific research) and an external “transition” area (productive and extractive activities contemplated in the Management Plan). Beyond the transition area, only the southern shelf-break is protected, after the creation of the “Namuncurá II” MPA in December 2018. Objective: provide the inventory of polychaetes collected during 2016 and 2017 at the core (98 m depth), buffer (128 m depth), transition (133 m-189 m depth) areas of the Namuncurá I MPA, together with slope areas (220 m-798 m depth). Methods: taken with a trawl net used to characterize the faunal assemblages and to compare results with other Magellan areas. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Cluster Analysis (CA) were applied to a Bray-Curtis similarity index to assess polychaete assemblages in the NMPA-BB slope and Magellan region respectively; SIMPER (Similarity Percentage Analyses) and ANOSIM (Analysis of Similarities) were performed. Results: A total of 918 individuals, which correspond to 39 taxa distributed in 22 families, were recorded in samples from NMPA and BB slope, mainly epibenthic or associated with the large corals collected.

They may host a great diversity of marine invertebrates, among which polychaetes are conspicuous and diversified representatives. Rhodolith beds are notwithstanding vulnerable to several human activities (e.g. exploitation of commercial species associated with rhodoliths, petroleum exploration, fishing activities, effluent discharges, and tourism), which may compromise that diversity. Tourism is presently increasing its impact on rhodolith beds. Global warming and ocean acidification are also determinant factors in faunal change. Objective: to analyse the polychaete assemblages associated with rhodolith beds subject to different intensities of touristic pressure at Seixas Beach (NE Brazil), where tourism is gradually increasing over time. Methods: Effects were evaluated at two depths, 1.5 m and 4.0 m. Sampling was done every two months during 2015, encompassing the two marked seasons of the year in the region (rainy and dry). Quadrats of 15 x 15 cm were placed in each depth during sampling. All rhodoliths present within the quadrat were collected (usually four to five rhodoliths). Our hypothesis was that the deeper depth and the samples from the dry season months would be increasingly subject to the impact of tourism. Results: Overall, 49 species were found (from 21 different families), and a total of 733 individuals were collected. The most abundant species was Eunice wasinensis (280 individuals, 38.2% of total abundance). The species Eurythoe complanata, Eunice biannulata, E. wasinensis, Lysidice ninetta, Oxydromus pugettensis and Ceratonereis (Ceratonereis) singularis appeared in all months. The study detected a tendency for higher diversity to occur at the depth of 1.5 m for all indices, but only the Shannon-Wiener values were significantly higher there (p < 0.05). No clear differences were found regarding months or season. Conclusions: These results suggest that a higher potential pressure due to tourism may occur at 4.0 m due to more intense craft shipping activities (traffic of catamaran boats transporting tourists to and from the reefs) in that area.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Annelida | Catamarans | Disturbance | Hard substrate | Tropical coast,13567,CAPES,undefined,Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,118

This polychaete was usually collected within its U tubes, typical of infaunal habit. During 2007, a surprising massive settlement of worms on scallops was observed. Objective: Our objectives is to report the variability of life habits of C. antarcticus in scallop grounds distributed between 37º S and 40º S in Argentinean waters. Methods: The presence of the parchment tube worms on Z. patagonica was analyzed in 892 scallops coming from three samples collected in September (previously obtained for other purposes) and November 2007 and April 2008, between 99-106 m depth in Management Unit B (16.186 km2, 38º S-39º 52’ S). Polychaetes were identified and quantified on both valves. In addition, both epibiont and infaunal worms were registered through time. The settlement of C. antarcticus on scallops was monitored during the period 2007-2015 and the presence of free tubes, both empty and inhabited by worms, were registered during the period 2008-2015 from a total of 374 representative subsamples (10 l) collected with trawling tools between 37º S and 40º S. Results: Scallops collected in 2007 and 2008 showed that 468 (> 50 %) specimens were encrusted; in 66 % (311 specimens) of them C. antarcticus was settled. The temporal analysis showed that the spatial distribution of epibiotic worms decreased in 2009, 2010 and 2012, with its total absence in 2013, 2014 and 2015 in the study area.

The gall surveys were carried out between November 2013 and December 2016. We also cross-checked our plant list with the previous gall records from elsewhere in the country and searched for galls on herbarium specimens of dicots reported from the reserve. In total, we recorded 143 families and 1174 plant species, of which 401 were hosts of galls. Plant hosts of galls were found in the following non-mutually exclusive categories: 209 in our field sampling, 257 from previous records, and 158 in herbarium specimens. Of our field records of galls, 77 were new for the country, 77 were also found in the herbarium and 110 had been previously recorded in the country.

Plant family size was related to number of gall hosts, but most dicot families have similar proportions of gall host species. We concluded that more than a third of the native plants in the reserve are gall hosts, but this number increased to 44.93 % when only dicots were considered.

This study uses data gathered in opportunistic manner when studying the behavior of Stenolemus giraffa, an assassin bug that preys almost exclusively on web-building spiders. Stenolemus giraffa approach orb spiders on foot, and usually capture the spiders at the hub region of the web. When pursuing spiders, S. giraffa routinely tap the web with their antennae, and also tap the spiders prior to attacking them. The observations available from this study suggest that S. giraffa got “distracted” momentarily by the decorations in the webs of Purumitra sp. (Uloboridae) and Argiope katherina (Araneidae). In some instances, the assassin bugs tapped these structures for several seconds or minutes instead of tapping the adjacent spiders. In interactions with A. katherina, S. giraffa was more successful at capturing the spiders when the webs lacked decorations; however, sample sizes are small (this could not be tested for Purumitra sp. because only one web lacked decorations). Finally, some of the spiders detected S. giraffa tapping the decorations or that had begun tapping the spiders and that had interrupted this behavior to tap the decorations. The data available suggest that, for S. giraffa, the decorations in these webs interfered with the process of locating the spiders.

Our objective in this study is to determine whether the wing morphology (shape and dimensions) of six dove species is associated to their flying capability. We predict that the long-distance fliers Patagioenas flavirostris and P. nigrirostris will have long and sharp wings; while the very short-distance flier Geotrygon montana will have broad and rounded wings. Other species (e.g., Leptotila verreauxi, L. cassini and Zenaida asiatica) whose flying capability fits in between these two will have wings with intermediate morphological features. We measured the wing disc loading, shape ratio, the ratio of mean to maximum wing chord, relative wing length, and wing area for each species. We conducted a discriminant function analysis to compare which variables explain better the differences in wing morphology across the six species, and used a binomial test to evaluate the power of the model. The model correctly classified 57 % of individuals within their own species. The flying capability is associated with the wing morphology of the six Columbidae species; with a wing design for long-distance fliers in P. flavirostris and P. nigrirostris, wing design for maneuvering in dense habitats in G. montana, and wings with an intermediate design in L. verreauxi, L. cassini and Z. asiatica.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Aerodynamic parameters | Flight behavior | Habitat effect | Pigeons | Wing shape,13567,NA,undefined,NA,0,FALSE,NA,NA,135

Window strike casualties’ frequencies differed by species, trophic guild and migratory status. Most window victims were residents, small, insectivorous, considered common or fairly common, with declining population trends. The families with the most species represented were Parulidae (14 spp.), Trochilidae (13 spp.), Turdidae (10 spp.), and Tyrannidae (9 spp.). Most species were passerines (Order Passeriformes) (71 spp.). No hawks or vultures were found colliding with buildings. The three species most commonly killed by windows were frugivores: Swainson’s Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), Northern Emerald-Toucanet (Aulacorhynchus prasinus), and Black-faced Solitaire (Myadestes melanops). Among window-kills were five species whose status on the IUCN Red List are Near Threatened and one Vulnerable, including the Resplendent Quetzal (Pharomachrus mocinno) and the Three-wattled Bellbird (Procnias tricarunculatus).

However, emerging evidence has provided insights on the adaptive potential of multiple species to respond to illnesses and environmental pressures. In Costa Rica, the decline of amphibian populations is a remarkable example of these changes. Here we provide evidence of variation in the amphibian richness of a premontane forest of San Ramón (Costa Rica) across a ~30 year period. We also quantified changes in the composition and abundance of the leaf-litter frog community occurring in the same premontane forest, by comparing diversity data with a difference of ~18 years. We evaluated the similarity of species richness from 1980s to 2010s based on several sources, and the dissimilarity of species diversity in the site comparing 28 standardized surveys from 1994-1995 and 2011-2012. We compared the relative abundance of some frogs that inhabit the leaf-litter layer between these same periods. Our results show that there is more similarity in amphibian richness between 1980s and 2010s (~ 52 %) than between 1980s and 1990s (~ 40 %). Therichness of leaf-litter anurans was ~ 65 % similar between 1990s and 2010s. The diversity of leaf-litter anuran was clearly different between 1994-1995 and 2011-2012, and it was clustered among those periods. We determined that the amphibian community in this premontane forest drastically changed: many species have disappeared, or gradually declined through the decades (e.g. Pristimantis ridens, P. cruentus, Craugastor bransfordii) as in other well studied localities of CostaRica, while some few species flourished after being almost absent from the site in the 1990s (e.g. Craugastor crassidigitus, Lithobates warszewistchii). Currently dominant species such as C. crassidigitus would be using developed resistanceagainst Bd-fungus as an advantage (apparent competition) in the premontane forest where the disease is more virulent than in lowlands. Our analysis supports the hypothesis of individualized responses of anuran populations under distinct site and elevations.

The dry tropical forest tree Crescentia alata is a cultural and economical resource, but efforts to establish plantations, which could satisfy commercial production and avoid impact on natural populations, have been unsuccessful. So there is a need to generate biological information on this species for obtaining plants in greenhouses. The aim of this work was to evaluate the vigor and growth rate of C. alata seedlings born from seeds that were stored at different periods and temperatures, and to determine the effect of light intensity on the seedlings. Fruits were collected in Liberia (Guanacaste, Costa Rica) and seeds stored for 0, 4, 8, and 14 months at 5 °C, 15 °C, and ambient temperature (22-24 °C). Seedlings from seeds stored for 0, 4, 8 and 14 months were grown to evaluate growth after 8 days, 2 months, and 16 months, and in two different light conditions. Morphology of 8-day-seedlings changed according to storage time. Principal component analysis of 2-month evaluation indicates that the most significant variables were total dry biomass, dry biomass of leaves, root-shoot, stem, and root, while for the analysis of 16-month evaluation these variables were dry biomass of root, root-shoot, and leaves, also leaf number, and shoot length. Specific leaf area of 16-month plants from seeds stored for 14 months did not change with storage temperature. In addition, two different light conditions influence seedling height, stem diameter or leaf number. Seed storage at 5 °C and 15 °C favored development of seedling cotyledons, and length of both root and hypocotyl. Two month-seedlings from 0M and 8M allocated most biomass to roots and less to stems, enhancing this way water absorption. Sixteen-month-plants from non-stored seeds developed the highest leaf numbers, and those plants from 8M seeds at 5 °C and 15 °C showed shorter stems. Seeds stored up to 14 months kept viable, becoming healthy seedlings.

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed gene flow patterns in Symphonia globulifera, a tropical tree species with highly mobile pollinators and seed dispersers in the Osa Peninsula in southern Costa Rica. We used microsatellites to study genetic diversity and realized gene flow patterns between a continuous forest and a forest fragment. We found high levels of genetic diversity in adults and seedlings at both sites. Parentage analyses suggest near-neighbor matings and frequent long-distance gene flow events. Half the progeny beneath an adult was not sired by that tree and the majority of established seedlings were the result of long-distance gene dispersal. Gene flow from the forest into the fragment was more common than from the fragment into the continuous forests. Despite long distance gene flow events, seedling spatial genetic structure was stronger and extended further in the forest fragment likely due to limited seed dispersal.

It serves as a paradigm to understand the optimal allocation of limited resources under dynamic light regimes. I analyze how tropical rain forest succession influences the expression of ecophysiological mechanisms leading to shade tolerance, and identify future areas that will increase our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of this phenomenon. Shade tolerance is a multivariate, continuous functional trait reflecting the growthmortality trade-off of investing resources under limited light vs. exploiting high light conditions. I propose the life cycle successional trajectory model of Gómez-Pompa & Vázquez-Yanes as an integrative tool to understand tropical rain forest succession. This model shows how species distribute along the successional environmental gradient based on their degree of shade tolerance and represents a more integrative paradigm to understand the interface between different aspects of species diversity (ontogenetic variation and functional diversity) throughout succession. It proposes that different trait combinations determining shade tolerance are expressed at different stages of the life cycle, which affects how and when plants enter the successional trajectory. Models explaining the expression of shade tolerance (resource availability, carbon gain, CSR, resource competition) are based on whole-plant economics and are not mutually exclusive. The analysis of shade tolerance is biased towards tree seedlings in the understory of mature forests. Other life stages (juvenile and adult trees), life forms, and microhabitats throughout the forest profile are almost always excluded from these analyses. More integrative explanations based on the distribution of functional traits among species, ontogenetic stages, and the nature of the environmental gradient are being developed based on long-term data and chronosequence comparisons. In summary, shade-tolerance is a complex phenomenon, is determined by multiple characters that change ontogenetically over space and time and entails considerable plasticity. Current methods do not account for this plasticity. Understanding the nature of shade tolerance and its functional basis is critical to comprehending plant performance and improving the management, restoration and conservation of tropical rain forests given the combined threats of global warming and habitat loss.",4,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Environmental filtering | Functional traits | Gap phase | Leaf-economics spectrum | Niche differentiation | Ontogenetic niche shifts | Plant-economics spectrum | Regeneration niche | Secondary succession | Shade tolerance,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,142

To better represent the richness, individuals were also randomly collected for more than ten years, but the butterflies collected in this way were not included in the statistical analysis.

Through the cluster analysis, it was possible to determine that in relation to the diversity of skippers, both wet seasons are grouped significantly (P = 0.05). The dry seasons are also grouped significantly (P = 0.05). The reserve has connectivity with other green areas via a stream. During the wet season, plant growth increases connectivity, which could lead to the entry of new individuals of different species that are not permanent residents of RELO and establish small populations, increasing the richness and abundance of species.
