LC50 of Ni at 96 h was determined on Onchorynchus mykiss in the sytem water-sediment from the trout farm at equilibrium time. In the same system the sublethal toxicity of Ni was evaluated by the determination of metallotioneine (MT) levels, o-demethylase activity (OD) and protein concentration. The results showed a significant increment in the three-biochemical parameters. A linear relation was observed between Ni concentration and MT, OD and protein concentration, so these damage biomarkers are recommended in order to evaluate Ni toxicity. Probably these effects were due to the physicochemical characteristics of the sediments, which may give a high capacity to store metal in it.

This project is being developed within Parque Nacional Palo Verde and Reserva Biológica Lomas Barbudal, both of which form part of the only remaining tropical dry forests in Mesoamerica. To determine the short-term effects of cattle grazing on the natural vegetation, we compared the floristic composition within Palo Verde in an area under intermittent cattle grazing with an area that has not been grazed. There were significantly fewer plant species in the area with intermittent cattle grazing compared to the area with no grazing. Floristic composition of these two habitats was different as reflected by both Fisher's alpha values and the Shannon index of diversity, both of which were significantly higher in the ungrazed site. The ungrazed area contained more plant species and was more similar to mature forest. The structure of the vegetation was significantly different between the intermittently grazed and ungrazed sites with more small stems (1-5 cm dbh) and fewer large stems (>5 cm dbh) in the intermittently grazed habitat. These results indicate that cattle grazing has an impact on the dry forest by reducing the relative abundance and density of larger tree species and by changing the species composition and structure of the community. The current management plan implemented in Palo Verde and Lomas Barbudal is not appropriate because of the impact that cattle have on the structure of the natural vegetation and should not be considered a viable alternative in other protected areas of dry forest in the Neotropics.

Subsequently the pollen grains were identified, counted and photographed. A total of 206 pollen load samples were collected at Palmas and St. Teresa during two years. The most frequent species in the pollen load samples from European and Africanized honeybees were Cecropia peltata, Metopium brownei, Lonchocarpus sp. 2, Viguiera dentata, Eragrostis sp. 1. Bursera simaruba and Eupatorium albicaule. Both types of honey bees show a high reliance on pollen from only a few species, the first five named above comprised around 50% of all the mean percentage frequencies. Families that contributed with the largest number of pollen species were Fabaceae. Asteraceae, Boraginaceae, Convolvulaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Sapindaceae, Poaceae, Myrtaceae, Sapotaceae and Tiliaceae. C. peltata, Trema micrantha, B. simaruba, Eugenia sp. 1, Thouinia canesceras, Pouteria sp. 1, Mimosa bahamensis and V. dentata, were the pollen species with the largest percentages of occurrence in both European and Africanized bee pollen load samples, and also represent a ""long-term"" food resources during the year.",32,12947587,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Africanized honeybee | Apis mellifera | European honeybee | Foraging behaviour | Polliniferous plants | Yucatán Peninsula,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,20

The main research questions addressed, as well as the potential and limits of each approach, are summarized and discussed and it is shown how the concept of ecosystem has changed over time. Aquatic biomas spectra (derived from the theory of pelagic ecosystems) can give insight into the trophic structure of different systems, and can show how organism sizes are distributed within the system and how different size groups participate in the system's metabolism and production. Compartment/network models allow for a more detailed description of the trophic structure of ecosystems and of the energy/biomass fluxes through the explicit modelling of P/B-and food consumption rates and biomasses for each system compartment. Moreover, system indices for a characterization and comparison with other systems can be obtained such as average trophic efficiency, energy throughput, and degree of connectivity, degree of maturity, and others. Recent dynamic extensions of trophic network models allow for exploring past and future impacts of fishing and environmental disturbances as well as to explore policies such as marine protected areas. Mesocosm experiments address a multitude of questions related to aquatic processes (i.e. primary production, grazing, predation, energy transfer between trophic levels etc.) and the behaviour of organisms (i.e. growth, migration, response to contaminants etc.) under semi-natural conditions. As processes within mesocosms often differ in rate and magnitude from those occurring in nature, mesocosms should be viewed as large in vitro experiments designed to test selected components of the ecosystem and not as an attempt to enclose a multitude of interacting processes. Models that use individual organisms as units can provide insight into the causes of natural variability within populations (growth, phenotype, behaviour) and into the role of intraspecific variation for interspecific processes, succession, and feedback mechanisms. In biological oceanography, interdisciplinary research is increasingly using ""Virtual Ecosystems"" to simulate non-linear interactions between the dynamics of fluctuating ocean circulation, the physics of air-sea interaction, turbulence and optics, biogeochemistry, and the physiology and behaviour of plankton, which can be compared with real observations. The different approaches available for the analysis of aquatic ecosystems should be seen as complementary ways for the description and understanding of ecosystems. The modern view of marine ecosystems, as has emerged from ecosystem analysis over the last decades, is that of a composite of loosely coupled subsystems of desynchron dynamics which through their combined action maintain the fundamental structure and function of the whole.",11,12298274,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Concepts | Ecosystem analysis | Marine | Models | Tropics,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,40

This, and the tolerance of high irradiation and sediment deposition allow C. latiloba to form large monospecific stands on open sites, and thus the first closed canopy which represents the initial phase of a successional sequence which leads to highly diverse forest. This tree is extremely well adapted to the adverse growth conditions in Amazonian floodplains with prolongued periods of flooding and seedling submergence.

Although it belongs to the most often cited species under aspects of taxonomy, species distribution and general descriptions of the ecosystem, little has been published about its ecology. In the present paper the ecological, physiological and phenological characteristics nof C. latiloba are described. It is an evergreen species which constantly produces new leaves. With flooding, leaf production is reduces but new leaves are flushed also with prolongued flooding. The peak of flowering and fruiting are in the flooded period. When mature, the fruits are dispersed mainly by water and fish. Seed germination occurs, without dormancy, within 5-13 days after water retreat. In the 7 months before the first flooded period seedlings reach 1 m of height, and height growth increases until 15-20 m are achieved. Photosynthetic assimilation is high, with values of up to 21 μmol CO2m-2s-1.

The biological significance of such polymorphism has been little studied, but the presence of large and small males in a species is presumed to indicate some form of male/male competition for resources; this is particularly common in fungus feeding species. Amongst phytophagous species, the recognition of the host plants on which thrips actually breed is a prerequisite to understanding patterns of diversity, some thrips lineages being associated with particular groups of plants whereas others exploit a diverse range of plants.

Such behavior may function instead as a test of the male in order to favor some males over others, or to induce the male to desist. Thus, male persistence and forcefulness may sometimes be better described as persuasion rather than coercion. Under the persuasion hypothesis, the male only gains intromission due to an active response of the female. Under the coercion hypothesis, male and female are opposed in a physical battle which the female loses if copulation occurs. In species in which males are morphologically incapable of forcing intromission without active female cooperation (I argue here that this is probably a very common situation), data on the behavioral and ecological context in which resistance occurs can distinguish between the two possibilities. Partially congruent functions of resistance, seen from the female point of view, are female resistance to screen (male persuasion), and female resistance to avoid males non-selectively (male coercion). Sepsid flies illustrate these ideas. Females often struggle energetically in apparent attempts to dislodge mounted males and to prevent intromission, and males grasp females with powerful species-specific structures on their front legs and genitalia. This suggests the possibility of coerced intromission. But behavioral and morphological evidence demonstrate that active female cooperation occurs at the moment of intromission, and that males are probably dependent on this cooperation because they are not morphologically equipped to force their genitalia into those of an uncooperative female. Despite the impression from previous publications, male insects in general may seldom be able to achieve intromission by genitalic force. The species-specific forms of the grasping genitalia of male sepsids are probably not the result of an evolutionary arms race between coercive males and unselectively resistant females.",86,12298280,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Cryptic female choice | Male-female conflict | Sepsidae | Sexual selection,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,56

Classical physiological work involving tropical plants, such as the discovery of C4 photosynthesis in sugarcane, is invoked to exemplify the historical and current importance of physiological research in the tropics, and its applications in agriculture, forestry and conservation. An historical background describing the early and more recent development of a tradition on the physiological study of tropical plants is followed by a summary of the research conducted on the physiology of tropical crops. Common areas of interest and influence between the fields of crop physiology and plant ecophysiology are identified and exemplified with problems on the environmental physiology of crops like coffee and cassava. The physiology of tropical forest plants is discussed in terms of its contributions to general plant physiological knowledge in areas such as photosynthetic metabolism and plant water relations. Despite the impressive technical advances achieved during the past decade, the importance of continuous development of appropriate instrumentation to study and measure the physiology of plants in situ is stressed. Although the basic metabolic processes that underlie the mechanisms of plant responses to the environment are probably highly conserved and qualitatively similar among tropical and temperate plants, it is also apparent that tropical plants exhibit metabolic peculiarities. These include aspects of photosynthetic metabolism, phloem transport physiology, sensitivity to low temperatures, reproduction, responses to climatic seasonality, and a large variety of biotic interactions.

During the spring of 1991 and 1992 samples were taken from the upper and middle levels of the intertidal zone in Vargas Lozano, Braithwaite, Blanca SW, Blanca NE, Binners, Grayson, Academia and Norte bays. The 161 species found belong to Porifera, Cnidaria, Platyhelmintha, Nemertina, Sipunculida, Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda and Echinodermata. Crustaceans and mollusks were the richest groups in both years, as in other rocky shores. Highest total density was found in Blanca NE bay in both samplings, with 281 orgs./m2 in the first and 172 orgs./m2 in the second. Most frequently found species were Isognomon janus (Mollusca, Pelecypoda), Littorina pullata (Mollusca, Gastropoda), Hipponix panamensis (Mollusca, Gastropoda), Pachygrapsus transversus (Crustacea, Grapsoidea) and Turbo funiculosus (Mollusca, Gastropoda). Because of the complexity of the habitat structure, Vargas Lozano was the bay with the highest specific richness (83 species), greatest diversity (4.7 bits/individual) and lowest dominance (0.065). Most species were classified as accidentals with the Dajoz's frequency classification, while the dominant species were accessories and only I. janus, in the spring 1991, was a constant species. Two kinds of bays were distinguished: those with some dominant species (density) and those in which there was no evident dominance by a particular species. Consequently, the diversity and evenness values were set apart: homogeneous communities (Vargas Lozano and Binners) and heterogeneous communities (Grayson bay and others), characterized by intermediate evenness values. The Jaccard similarity index identified two regions: one formed by bays found mainly in the southwest part of the island (Binners, Vargas Lozano, Braithwaite, Grayson and Blanca SW) and the other found in the northern region that included Blanca NE, Academia and Norte; however. Blanca NE had the most diverse species composition because of its physiographic particularities and because the sediment retained by the filamentous algae on the flat stones allow many species to settle down. Isognomon janus, Mitrella baccata (Mollusca, Gastropoda), P. transversus and Xanthodius cooksoni (Crustacea, Xanthoidea) were the most common species in all bays in both expeditions.

The study was conducted between March 1997 and March 1998. The region is known by its sustained economic development and one of the highest population growth rates in the country (4% per year). The objective of this work was the assessment of organic pollution spatial gradients in both rivers, as a function of the hydrological regime (a long period of drought from May to October and floodings the rest of the year). Three groups of biotic indices were applied to characterize the level of organic pollution and were based on planktonic microalgae to evaluate water quality. The relative performance of these indices was then compared for use to biomonitoring programs. The diversity indices: Shannon-Weaver and Whilm-Dorris were not highly sensible to detect moderate pollution. The saprobity indices (Pantle and Buck and Diatom Assemblage Index of Watanabe et al.), were useful to detect intermediate levels of organic load, but their sensitivity dropped at high pollution levels. The second index precisely discriminated the most deteriorated part of river Rosario, with values between 0.3-0.7 (extreme poli-saprobity). Raw sewage discharges along the most polluted sector of river Arias-Arenales were assigned a value between 10 and 11 in both periods of the hydrological regime. Both saprobity indices consider the same indicator pollution value of species. The first one is based on the relative abundance of the species while the second one is calculated with the species relative frequency. The second index is better than the first one in considering non-dominant species that were constant in each particular environmental condition. The principal component analysis allowed a representation of time and space pollution patterns and showed the specific microalgae assemblage for all the sampling stations and for both periods in the hydrological cycle.

These species are of great economical, cultural and ichthyological interest for local populations, and their management practices are controversial. We investigated the morphometric, meristic and allozyme variations of the seven species (13 populations) and related the variations with life history, habitat and management procedures. Nineteen morphometric variables, eight meristic variables (by multivariate analysis) and 23 allozyme loci of the seven species and populations of Chirostoma were compared. Principal component analysis (PC) of morphometric and meristic data indicate that both sets of data provided information to differentiate among the seven species. The variables that accounted for most of this differentiation were head length (HL), predorsal 1 length (P1L) and length of pelvic fin base (PfbL). PC and Discriminant Analysis (DA) with morphometric data also suggested the differentiation of populations within C. grandocule (83% correctly classified organisms), whereas PC and DA with meristic data differentiated populations of C. humboldtianum (80% correctly classified organisms). The most important morphometric variables for the differentiation were anal fin height (AfH), length of anal fin base (AfbL) and predorsal 2 length (P2L) and the meristic variables D2fR, PdS and AfR. The genetic variability data indicate changes in values of some of the species in relation to previously reported data.

(Formicinae) ants is poorly investigated, even though the small understory tree is surrounded by a conspicuos zone almost devoid of vegetation. As to the cause of these barely vegetated ""Devil's Gardens"", two alternative interpretations exist in the literature: the pruning activity of ants and allelopathy. We investigated the mutualistic Duroia-Myrmelachista system in the Ecuadorian Amazon, focusing on the phenomenon of the areas of reduced vegetation, as well as on the natural history of the associated ants. We conducted planting experiments and behavioral studies, including coccoids, the third partner in this mutualism. Because the well-studied Triplaris americana (Polygonaceae) possesses analogous vegetation free surroundings created by the assiduous mechanical pruning of its mutualistic ant partner (Pseudomyrmex sp.), parallel comparative investigations of this ant-plant association were conducted. The two systems are not equivalent; it was demonstrated that the remarkably inactive Myrmelachista ants are not responsible for the bare areas around Duroia plants. Instead, we regard allelopathy as the causative agent for the clear zones.",6,12298256,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Allelopathy | Ant-plant interaction | Duroia hirsuta | Ecuadorian Amazon | Mutualism | Myrmecophyte | Myrmelachista sp | Scale insects,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,98

Venoms from Brazil (C. d. terrificus) and from newborn specimens of C. d. durissus presented an electrophoretic pattern characterized by the predominance of bands with molecular mass of 36 and 15 kDa, whereas those of adult specimens of C. d. durissus from Guatemala and Costa Rica, and C. d. cumanensis from Venezuela, showed a conspicuous band of 62 kDa, and additional bands of 36, 29 and 15 kDa. Moreover, venoms from C. d. terrificus and C. d. cumanensis showed a prominent band of < 10 kDa that probably corresponds to crotamine, since a 'crotamine-like' activity was detected in these venoms upon intraperitoneal injection in mice. Venoms of C. d. terrificus, C. d cumanensis and newborn C. d. durissus induced higher lethal and myotoxic effects than those of adult C. d. durissus. In contrast, adult C. d. durissus and C. d. cumanensis venoms induced hemorrhage, whereas venoms of C. d. terrificus and newborn C. d. durissus lacked this effect. All venoms showed coagulant effect in plasma, the high-est activity being observed in the venom of newborn C. d. durissus. An anti-crotalic antivenom produced by Instituto Butantan (Brazil), using C. d. terrificus venom as antigen, was effective in the neutralization of lethal, myotoxic and coagulant effects of all venoms studied, being ineffective in the neutralization of hemorrhagic activity of the venoms of C. d. cumanensis and C. d. durissus. On the other hand, a polyvalent antivenom produced by Institut Clodomiro Picado (Costa Rica), using the venoms of C.d. durissus. Bothrops asper and Lachesis stenophrys as antigens, was able to neutralize lethal, myotoxic, coagulant and hemorrhagic effects of C. d. durissus venom, but was ineffective in the neutralization of lethality and myotoxicity of C. d. terrificus, C. d. cumanensis and newborn C. d. durissus venom. The high toxicity of South American and newborn C. d. durissus venoms is related to the presence of high concentrations of the neurotoxic phospholipase A2 complex 'crotoxin'. Accordingly, antivenom from Institute Butantan has a much higher titer of anti-crotoxin antibodies than antivenom from Instituto Clodomiro Picado.

A common garden experiment was established with seedlings from 63 families of ten populations from two habitat types (mesic and dry), distributed throughout Costa Rica, to examine the relationships between quantitative variation and site of population origin. Seedlings from dry areas tended to be distinct from those from mesic areas, with climatic grouping of provenance explaining a mean of 52% of the total variance and 80% of the genetic variance. Cluster analysis for seedling traits showed two natural groupings of families, which corresponded for the most part with the regional population groupings into mesic (Atlantic and South Pacific) and dry (North Pacific) groups. Cluster analysis based on seed weight and size also separated populations into mesic and dry climatic groups. Seeds from populations in dry areas were 43% heavier, and seedlings were 61% taller, 117% greater in diameter, and with leaflets 39% longer and 81% wider These differences may be related to fast growth in the dry zone for taking advantage of early life cycle moisture availability.
