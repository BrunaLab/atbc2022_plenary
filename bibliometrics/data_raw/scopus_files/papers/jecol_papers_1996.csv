An experiment was designed to quantify the impact of grazing on various components of plant fitness in the growing season that may contribute to this reduction. Height, tiller number, survival and reproduction of marked plants were monitored throughout two growing seasons in paired grazed and protected plots and in recently defoliated and undefoliated plants in grazed plots. 2 Plant survival in the vegetative stage was similarly high in grazed and protected plots in 1990-91, but in 1991-92 it was 14% higher in protected plots. Plants in protected plots were 60-172% taller than those in grazed plots, but plants in grazed plots had 44-107% more live tillers at the end of the vegetative stage. Tiller initiation was enhanced in undefoliated as well as defoliated plants within grazed plots, suggesting that the increase may have been a response to the modified radiation environment in the grazed community. 3 The proportion of plants that produced mature inflorescences was 51-59% greater in protected than in grazed plots, and within grazed plots it was much lower among plants that had been grazed in the last month of the season. The number of mature inflorescences per fertile plant was not consistently different between treatments, but the number of immature inflorescences was greater in grazed plots. Apparently, following removal of inflorescences late in the growing season, insufficient resources remained for maturation of secondary inflorescences. Spikelet number per inflorescence was 21-42% greater in protected than in grazed plots, which may reflect effects of grazing in the vegetative stage on inflorescence development. Seed number and weight per spikelet were not significantly affected by grazing. 4 The number of mature spikelets or seeds produced per seedling (an estimate of fitness throughout the growing season) was reduced by about 50% in grazed compared to protected plots in both years. The largest consistent components of reduction were due to removal of maturing inflorescences in the late reproductive stage. 5 Deferment of grazing during the reproductive stage may be sufficient to maintain abundant populations of wild wheat, while grazing during the remainder of the year will limit their suppressive effects on other annual species.",29,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Annual grass | Defoliation | Demography | Herbivory | Mediterranean grassland | Reproduction | Tillering | Triticum dicoccoides,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

All of the white pine, which dominated recruitment during the first 40 years due to more rapid height growth, recruited in this period. Low levels of hemlock recruitment continued until 1900. Most of the younger trees comprised several northern hardwood species. No trees were less than 50 years old and the forest was devoid of an understorey due to intense deer browsing. 3 Radial growth chronologies were determined for 27 cores across all species and age classes. These exhibited 1-11 major and/or moderate releases (indicative of disturbance) in most decades between 1730 and 1990. Peak releases were recorded in the 1950s when a series of severe windstorms impacted the site. Species recruitment patterns were related to earlier growth releases observed in the oldest cores. 4 White pine exhibited a degree of plasticity in initial radial growth (1-5 mm year-1) depending on the time of establishment, as well as the ability to survive through prolonged periods of depressed growth (< 0.5 mm year-1) followed by growth releases. Hemlock was less plastic in its initial growth rates but did have dramatic growth releases (up to 8.8 mm year-1) in several older trees. Thus, both species exhibited some unexpected dendroecological as well as successional attributes. 5 The future of this stand is uncertain due to the impacts of deer and insect outbreaks that plague the region, as well as fortuitous natural disturbances, e.g. wind and fire. Nonetheless, the dendroecological approach elucidated disturbance history, stand development and mechanisms of coexistence of two ecologically contrasting tree species, and should be used to further understanding of the complex ecology of other mixed-species forests and the successional role of various tree species.",108,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Age structure | Dendrochronology | Pennsylvania | Stand dynamics | Succession | Tree rings,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,4,NA,NA

The structure of allelic variation within the populations suggests that sexual reproduction has played a significant role in these C. bigelowii populations, despite present lack of seedling recruitment. The study was carried out in moss-heath communities on Icelandic lava-fields. Two adjacent populations were studied at one site, while a third population was studied at a second site, 35 km away from the first two populations. 2 The number of genets detected in each population, among 85-88 analysed ramets, ranged from 41 to 55 (minimum estimate). Samples were taken every 4 m along transects in the populations. Ramets with the same allozyme genotype were often spatially aggregated. No seedlings have been observed in the populations during five years of demographic studies. 3 All the populations studied showed a diploid expression of allozymes and high levels of allelic variation, with on average 49% polymorphic loci (P), 1.77 alleles per locus (A) and an allelic diversity (HS) of 0.167. Similar levels of within-population variability are found in many wind-pollinated and outcrossing plant species. 4 The difference between observed and expected heterozygosity was small in all populations, suggesting high levels of outbreeding. 5 Comparisons with other Carex taxa show that the levels of and structuring of allozyme diversity in C. bigelowii is similar to that in other outbreeding species (usually rhizomatous), and much higher than in inbreeding species (which are usually caespitose). 6 Only 5% of the total allelic diversity was explained by differences between the two study sites (GST = 0.055), suggesting extensive recent or historic gene-flow.",91,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Breeding system | Clone size | Genetic diversity | Genotypic diversity | Isozyme,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,6,NA,NA

While conventional metapopulation theory involves species with frequent population turnover, limited migration and random extinction, it is likely that metapopulation dynamics, broadly defined as the product of local population dynamics and dispersal, is a feature of all species. 2 Theoretical metapopulation models of single species make three critical insights. First, metapopulations will consist of a shifting mosaic of local populations linked through migration with only a fraction of the available habitat patches occupied at one time. Secondly, there is a threshold number of habitats available, below which the species cannot persist because extinction exceeds colonization. Thirdly, the antagonism between selective forces acting during recolonization and population growth can influence the evolution of phenotypic traits. Unfortunately, little empirical data is available to evaluate these ideas for plants or to address the broader issue of whether processes at a regional scale add anything to our understanding of population dynamics. 3 Plants may seem particularly appropriate for metapopulation analyses as a result of their immobility, strong spatial structure and restricted dispersal. However, a review of the literature revealed a paucity of studies that explicitly adopted a metapopulation approach, particularly in terms of testing theoretical models. We argue that this is because of the difficulty of measuring parameters such as extinction, colonization and migration that are central to most metapopulation models. 4 Plants possess a number of special features that present both challenges and opportunities for the development of new insights into the biology of metapopulations. Three particular characteristics, seed dormancy, restricted dispersal and local adaptation, need to be incorporated into existing theoretical models so they more accurately reflect the dynamics of plant metapopulations. Finally, more effort is needed to incorporate the explicit spatial structure of individuals within metapopulations and to investigate the effect that dispersion has on their growth and reproduction.",238,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Colonization | Demography | Extinction | Local adaptation | Metapopulation | Migration | Plants | Population genetics | Seed dormancy,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,7,NA,NA

Net increases in the biomass and vegetative spread of clones attributable to resource sharing have been amply demonstrated in artificial environments, but little tested in natural ones. This study examines nutrient sharing in the stoloniferous perennial herb Fragaria chiloensis in a natural population on coastal sand dunes in California. The main questions asked were: (1) How extensive is nutrient sharing? (2) Do patterns of nutrient sharing change in response to nutrient patchiness? (3) Does nutrient sharing increase growth? 2 Three experiments were conducted, using clonal fragments in situ. Experiment 1 examined the extent of nutrient sharing when nutrient patchiness was minimal for the habitat, by tracing the movement of 15N within fragments that had all their ramets in low-nutrient microsites. Experiment 2 compared the extent of nutrient sharing when patchiness was maximal, by measuring the biomass and size of clonal fragments when a high-nutrient patch was artificially created around one of the ramets. Experiment 3 examined the effects of nutrient uptake without sharing, by measuring the growth of single ramets in high-nutrient patches. 3 Nitrogen was shared between all the ramets along a stolon, but large net transfers took place only from older to younger ramets. There was no evidence that these patterns changed in response to the degree of nutrient patchiness. Apparent effects of nutrient sharing on growth included a significant increase in the total biomass of younger ramets, a possible decrease in the biomass of some older ramets, and an increase in allocation to new stolons in ramets that imported nutrients. 4 These effects of nutrient sharing seem likely to speed the growth of fragments away from high-nutrient patches, and so, at first sight, may appear disadvantageous. However, the long term effect of accelerated spread away from good patches must be tested in relation to natural patterns of resource patch dynamics.",142,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Clonal growth | Coastal sand dunes | Physiological integration | Resource patchiness,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,9,NA,NA

Increased tiller and leaf numbers per plant for H. lanatus, but not for D. glomerata, suggested that enhanced biomass was a result of greater tiller and leaf production in Holcus, but to increased tiller weight in Dactylis. Increased competition reduced shoot biomass, tiller number and leaf number in both species. 3 Although the response was variable, mycorrhizal infection generally enhanced shoot biomass of both species in mixed cultures. Tiller production in D. glomerata was generally unaffected by infection but reductions in leaf number were observed in mycorrhizal stands. In contrast to its effects on monocultures, infection had no effect on tiller production when H. lanatus was in mixture. 4 Relative yield totals (RYT) calculated for grasses grown in mixture suggest that, overall, mycorrhizal infection resulted in a reduction of resource complementarity, i.e. it increased the level of competition for the same resources. This was reflected in the relative yields which showed that the shoot biomass for each species in mixture was lower than that expected from growth in monoculture. 5 Aggressivity indices suggested that H. lanatus was more aggressive than D. glomerata when present in equal or greater numbers. Mycorrhizal infection altered the degree of aggressivity in favour of the already more aggressive plant within the combination, although, at very low densities, D. glomerata was more aggressive than H. lanatus when mycorrhizal.",69,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Competition | Dactylis glomerata (Cock's Foot) | Holcus lanatus (Yorkshire Fog) | Mycorrhizas,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,10,NA,NA

Within each plot, control and treatments of nitrogen, phosphorus, and N + P were randomly assigned to subplots. Addition of N produced increases in total soil N, ammonium, and nitrate in the open plots, but not in the edge plots. Addition of P produced increases in extractable P in both sets of plots. 3 Biomass of the pioneer species responded significantly to both N and P. Biomass of the nonpioneer species responded only to added N. The effect of location (open vs. edge) on growth was variable. 4 For the pioneer species, the concentration of foliar P was increased by P fertilization, but foliar N did not increase significantly in response to fertilization. For the nonpioneer species, both foliar N and P increased in response to fertilization by N and P, respectively. 5 Light-saturated photosynthetic rate (Amax) of C. schreberiana increased in response to N fertilization in the open plots. In contrast, photosynthesis of P. riparia and M. bidentata in the open plots was unaffected by fertilization. Amax of P. rivinoides was also unaffected, but sample sizes were very small due to mortality from an outbreak of lepidopteran larvae. 6 There was no effect of fertilization on photoinhibition as assayed by chlorophyll fluorescence. P. riparia may have experienced moderate photoinhibition in the open zone, as shown by reduced growth as well as reduced ratios of variable to maximum fluorescence. 7 Availability of nitrogen appeared to limit growth of pioneer and nonpioneer species on the landslide. Availability of phosphorus appeared to limit growth of pioneer species, perhaps because they were nonmycorrhizal (P. rivinoides) or weakly facultatively mycorrhizal (C. schreberiana).

These relationships were also demonstrated when taxonomic relatedness was accounted for. 4 The data supported the hypothesis that differentiation, as seen among functional groups of species in terms of leaf habit and life-form, corresponded with differentiation in mean RGR and other seedling attributes. For instance, deciduous species grew consistently faster than evergreens. 5 When SLA was split into its two components, specific saturated leaf area (SSLA, total leaf area/total saturated leaf weight) and leaf saturated weight/dry weight ratio (SW/DW), it was found that SSLA was consistently smaller in evergreens than in deciduous species, both for sclerophyllous and succulent leaves. Among species of the same leaf habit, variation in SLA among life-forms could be explained by variation in leaf SW/DW. 6 SSLA and leaf SW/DW, both easy to measure, together could help to categorize growth rate within the evergreen or deciduous species. This may be useful in vegetation monitoring. 7 The data may provide useful predictive tools to infer potential growth rates and nutrient conservation strategies of real vegetation from the functional attributes and composition of its functional species groups.",311,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Climber | Deciduous | Evergreen | LAR | Life-form | RGR | Shrub | SLA | Tree | Water content,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,17,NA,NA

Inverse yield-density models also described cumulative above-ground dry matter production for each species at each source pasture age. 3 Significant interactions in the yield-density models, indicated that intra and inter-specific interference in each species changed with time of harvest and age of the source pasture. 4 Substitution rates, measuring the impact on a species of replacing one of its members by a member of the other species, indicated that Lolium was consistently less affected by Trifolium than by members of its own species. In addition, the impact of Trifolium on Lolium declined during the growing season and with increasing source pasture age. 5 In Trifolium, substitution rates varied widely. In the youngest pastures there was evidence that the presence of Lolium was beneficial to Trifolium, but at intermediate source pasture ages Trifolium was adversely affected by Lolium to a greater extent than by members of its own species. 6 Lolium-Trifolium mixtures used resources more effectively than their corresponding pure stands.

Most of the data used originated from studies with evergreen and deciduous shrubs and trees. 2 Combining all data, mean nutrient resorption efficiency was 50% for N (n = 287) and 52% for P (n = 226). N resorption efficiency of evergreen shrubs and trees (47%) was significantly lower than in deciduous shrubs and trees (54%), whereas P resorption efficiency did not differ significantly between these growth-forms (51 and 50%, respectively). Although nutrient resorption is an important nutrient conservation mechanism at the species level, it does not differ strongly between growth-forms. 3 Mean N and P concentrations in leaves of deciduous shrubs and trees were about 60% higher than in evergreen species. There were only small differences in mean resorption efficiency and nutrient concentrations in leaf litter of deciduous species were therefore much higher than in evergreens. This implies that, in comparison with deciduous species, the low nutrient concentrations in mature leaves of evergreens contribute far more to nutrient conservation than does nutrient resorption. 4 Relations between leaf nutrient status and leaf nutrient resorption were absent or very weak. Assuming that leaf nutrient status reflects nutrient availability, this implies that nutrient resorption is only weakly controlled by nutrient availability. 5 At the intraspecific level, nutrient resorption was not very responsive to increased nutrient availability. There was no response in 63% of the experiments analysed (covering 60 spp.), whereas in 32% there was a decrease in N resorption in response to increased nutrient availability. For P (37 species analysed) there was no response in 57% of the cases and in 35% of the cases P resorption decreased upon enhanced nutrient supply. Evergreen shrubs and trees showed especially low responsiveness. 6 This review shows that there are no clear nutritional controls on nutrient resorption efficiency.

The effect of disturbance type (lethal or nonlethal fire), time-since-fire and different fire regimes on the serotiny of jack pine (Pinus banksiana), was evaluated in populations from two adjacent landscapes in the southern part of the Canadian boreal forest. The island landscape (Lake Duparquet) has a complex fire regime of small fires of variable intensity, whereas the adjacent mainland has a fire regime characterized by large intense fires. 2 Twenty-four jack pine populations (11 island and 13 mainland) on xeric sites were sampled for the degree of serotiny of trees. Fire history and age structure were reconstructed for each population using the fire scar method. For each tree, recruitment was categorized as after a lethal fire, after a nonlethal fire or in the absence of fire. 3 Likelihood chi-square tests were used to investigate the variation in serotiny at individual, population and landscape levels. 4 At the individual level, the results support our prediction that the occurrence of lethal fires favours trees with high serotiny while low serotiny trees are favoured by other types of disturbances. 5 At the population level, the frequency of low serotiny trees increases with time since stand initiation, as a result of higher establishment opportunities after disturbances other than lethal fires. The proportion of low serotiny trees also increases with the occurrence of nonlethal fires. 6 Significant differences were found between the two landscapes. On the mainland, serotinous trees were more abundant, whereas on the islands where nonlethal fires were recorded, low serotiny trees were more frequent.

An investigation in relation to soil resources and successional trends,Wilson J.,Journal of Ecology,00220477,84,4,527-538,1996-01-01,1996,10.2307/2261475,"1 The distribution of relative abundances between the species of a plant community has been remarkably little analysed. We examine differences in relative abundance distribution (RAD) between different soil fertility levels, and trends through time in the development of a community, using data from three grassland experiments: Monks Wood grassland restoration, Park Grass long-term fertilizer trial and Compton grassland restoration. 2 Comparing plots with different fertilizer treatments, the evenness of plant species abundance was higher where phosphorus had been applied; other effects of soil fertility on evenness were inconsistent. There were no consistent effects of soil fertility on the relative fit of the Geometric, General Lognormal and Zipf-Mandelbrot models of RAD, contrary to previous theories. However, the Broken Stick model fitted relatively better, though still poorly in absolute terms, in plots with high species richness and where phosphorus had been applied. Parameter γ of the General Log-normal distribution was higher in the high-nitrogen and species-poor plots, disproving the theory that γ should be constant. Parameter β of the Zipf-Mandelbrot model was higher in more species-rich and in highphosphorus plots, a result not predicted in the literature. The variation in γ and β seems to be largely a reflection of the variation in evenness and in species dominance. The consistency in species dominance across space (rank consistency) was higher in plots with phosphorus addition. It is concluded that resource availability had little effect on which model of community assembly fitted. However, under high phosphorus conditions the community was more spatially consistent, and there was less dominance. 3 Through time, the evenness of species abundances increased, consistently between two separate experiments. Examining the shape of the abundance distribution at a more detailed level, there were no time trends in which relative abundance model fitted best, except that the fit of the Broken Stick model became less poor. However, the shape of the General Log-normal and Zipf-Mandelbrot curves, as seen in indices γ and β, respectively, changed through time, consistently between two separate experiments, supporting the implication from increased evenness of increasing niche diversification. Rank consistency increased in the early years of succession, then decreased, supporting the Three-phase succession model of Gitay & Wilson (1995), in which a middle 'building' phase has higher rank consistency than the preceding 'pioneer' phase or the succeeding 'mature' phase.",92,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,Abundance | Assembly rules | Community structure | Dominance/diversity | Evenness | Grassland | Rank consistency | Succession | Vegetation restoration,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,22,NA,NA

A total of 610000 stems were identified to species and mapped to < 1 m accuracy. Mean species number and stem number were calculated in quadrats as small as 5 m × 5 m to as large as 1000 m × 500 m, for a variety of stem sizes above 10 mm in diameter. Species-area curves were generated by plotting species number as a function of quadrat size; species-individual curves were generated from the same data, but using stem number as the independent variable rather than area. 2 Species-area curves had different forms for stems of different diameters, but species-individual curves were nearly independent of diameter class. With < 104 stems, species-individual curves were concave downward on log-log plots, with curves from different forests diverging, but beyond about 104 stems, the log-log curves became nearly linear, with all three sites having a similar slope. This indicates an asymptotic difference in richness between forests: the Malaysian site had 2.7 times as many species as Panama, which in turn was 3.3 times as rich as India. 3 Other details of the species-accumulation relationship were remarkably similar between the three sites. Rectangular quadrats had 5-27% more species than square quadrats of the same area, with longer and narrower quadrats increasingly diverse. Random samples of stems drawn from the entire 50 ha had 10-30% more species than square quadrats with the same number of stems. At both Pasoh and BCI, but not Mudumalai, species richness was slightly higher among intermediate-sized stems (50-100 mm in diameter) than in either smaller or larger sizes. These patterns reflect aggregated distributions of individual species, plus weak density-dependent forces that tend to smooth the species abundance distribution and 'loosen' aggregations as stems grow. 4 The results provide support for the view that within each tree community, many species have their abundance and distribution guided more by random drift than deterministic interactions. The drift model predicts that the species-accumulation curve will have a declining slope on a log-log plot, reaching a slope of 0.1 in about 50 ha. No other model of community structure can make such a precise prediction. 5 The results demonstrate that diversity studies based on different stem diameters can be compared by sampling identical numbers of stems. Moreover, they indicate that stem counts < 1000 in tropical forests will underestimate the percentage difference in species richness between two diverse sites. Fortunately, standard diversity indices (Fisher's α, Shannon-Wiener) captured diversity differences in small stem samples more effectively than raw species richness, but both were sample size dependent.

Where this trend was reversed by occasional fires, the simulation indicated that trees would be patchily distributed in thickets that excluded fire. 4 For an intermediate range of fire, grazing and rainfall variables this strongly clumped distribution pattern of trees represented a stable tree-grass mixture for more than 20 000 simulated years. 5 The hypothesis is formulated that factors or processes other than competition for moisture, herbivory and fire are needed in addition to induce a long-term persistence of scattered trees. 6 By exploring the long-term and spatial consequences of altering the variables that were thought to be key determinants of savanna vegetation, this spatiotemporal model provides a novel insight into the understanding of savanna dynamics.",201,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Cellular automaton model | Coexistence | Large-scale disturbances | Pattern formation | Savanna,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,24,NA,NA

Ungrazed sites were rare, but four previously located small arcas were used as control sites. 3 For the shrub tundra, the lichen mat was absent in grazed sites and ground previously occupied by lichens was either bare, covered by fragments of dead lichens and mosses or recolonized by early succession lichen species. Ground cover of shrubs not eaten by caribou was lower in grazed sites than in ungrazed sites, and coverage of graminoids, forage shrubs and forbs did not differ significantly between grazed and ungrazed sites. 4 In stands of dwarf birch grazed by caribou, ground cover and leaf biomass of Betula glandulosa was significantly lower than in ungrazed sites. 5 Productivity of forage plant species over the summer range was estimated at 22.5 g m-2 year 1 in an ungrazed condition compared to 10.3 g m-2 year -1 when grazed. 6 At the landscape level, caribou have fragmented the distribution of their food resource by reducing biomass of shrub tundra and stands of dwarf birch to a very low level. 7 The serious negative impact of migratory ungulates on plant productivity of their summer range may be explained by characteristics of the vegetation and the high carrying capacity of winter compared to summer ranges.

In a previous paper, we outlined the physiological prerequisites for population oscillations between a grass and a nitrogen-fixing legume, such as clover. Here, we examine the field-scale consequences of patch-scale oscillations in legume content, using a cellular automaton with variable hierarchy between the two species. 2. We define cell states in the automaton by species content and soil N status. Grass legume oscillations at the patch scale are represented as an alternation between states of grass dominance (high N) and legume dominance (low N). To this physiologically based population oscillation, we add local extinctions of legume and state-dependent success in legume invasion. 3. Legume populations oscillate at the field scale, given arbitrary initial conditions. However, spatially random perturbations to the soil N status (e.g. urine) establishes u pasture structure that dampens the field scale oscillation. The stabilizing pasture structure comprises moving patches of legume dominance. This pattern was not predicted by our previous, purely physiological model. 4. The model highlights that a patchy species distribution does not in itself mean the species is dispersal limited. In this model, changing the dispersal ability of legumes plays only a limited role in determining their proportion in the mixture. Legume abundance depends as much on the rate at which favourable (low N) sites become available for invasion. 5. Seasonal disturbances that act uniformly across the field, such as winter (legume) mortality and/or springtime fertilizer application, can lead to sustained field scale variations in legume content that are only partly explained by the level of seasonal disturbance itself. Another large part is explained by previous years' legume contents. Pastures may therefore exhibit a 'memory' for legume performance which helps to explain the perceived 'unpredictability' of some grass legume associations. 6. We argue that legume dynamics in mixed pastures cannot be fully understood without combining ecological and physiological concepts of species interactions at three different scales: competitive interactions at the patch-scale, dispersal at the between-patch scale, and seasonality at the field-scale.",77,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,cellular automaton | metapopulation dynamics | pattern formation | population oscillations,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,29,NA,NA

It is widely assumed that grass legume associations offer a way to sustainable, low input land use, with reduced environmental impact. However, a combination of both ecological and physiological principles may be needed to understand the sustainability of species balances. 2. To increase understanding of grass legume dynamics, we developed a model that extends a recently proposed pasture model (Thornley, Bergelson and Parsons: Annals of Botany 1995, 75, 79-94) by including selective grazing and spatial considerations. Population oscillations were shown to stem from the way grasses can exploit leguminous N fixation. If the legume is a relatively good competitor for light, populations do not oscillate near equilibrium, but in the converse case, populations do oscillate. 3. Large amplitude oscillations can arise when there are sufficiently long time delays in the plant populations' responses to changes in the competitive environment. In the present model, these stem from variable internal substrate pools (of C and N), which uncouple biosynthesis from resource uptake, but other time delay mechanisms are easily envisaged. 4. Urine deposits prevent the establishment of equilibrium within patches, but spatially random urine deposition stabilizes population fluctuations at the field scale. This is because perturbations to local N cycles desynchronize patches with regard to the grass legume population cycle. 5. Differences in the soil N environment (fertilizer input, leaching rate) determine whether the species can coexist, but where coexistence is possible, species composition regulates soil mineral N. 6. Selective grazing (herbivory) does not essentially alter the grass legume interaction, but complex foraging trade-offs lead to herbivory effects that may seem counter-intuitive.

The consequences of investment in different long-shoot functions during one year for long-shoot growth the following season were studied in mountain birch in a subarctic environment in northern Sweden. Relationships between shoot length growth, axillary bud production (lateral meristems) and male catkin production of 'progeny' and 'parent' shoots were computed individually for 14 trees. 2. A cost of male reproduction was indicated by decreases in (1) the number of long-shoots produced per parent shoot, (2) the total length, and (3) bud number of these long-shoots. Furthermore the length and bud number of the individual long-shoots produced by a parent decreased with parent male-catkin number. 3. Parent shoots with a high number of buds tended to have short long-shoots the following season indicating a cost associated with bud production. However, such parent shoots also tended to produce more long-shoots. Thus the total long-shoot length and number of buds produced by a parent shoot increased with parent bud number up to a parent size of 6 buds. For higher parent bud numbers, all progeny characteristics declined. 4. Significant differences among trees were found for all shoot characteristics studied. Differences among trees in the influence of parent male-catkin production on current catkin production were correlated with variations between trees in their foliage losses due to herbivory: for trees with small herbivory losses male reproduction increased with the catkin number of parent shoots, whereas trees exposed to higher foliage losses (up to 40% of the leaf area) showed a cost of male reproduction manifested as reduced catkin production the following year.",26,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa | male reproduction | meristem production | reproductive costs | subarctic,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,31,NA,NA

The controls over above-ground primary productivity following hurricane damage were investigated in a lowland subtropical wet Forest (350-500 m altitude) and a lower montane elfin Forest (1050 m) in Puerto Rico. Responses of understorey and canopy vegetation to addition of a complete nutrient fertilizer (both altitudes) or hurricane debris removal (lowland only) were monitored for 47-50 months. Treatments were initiated 1-6 months after Hurricane Hugo severely damaged both forests (18 September 1989). 2. Fertilization stimulated leaf litter production in both forests, but the recovery to prehurricane levels occurred earlier in the lowland forest (20 months after initiation of treatment) than in the elfin forest (38 months). Debris removal also increased leaf litter production in the lowland forest. 3. Tree diameter growth was 10-fold greater at low than at high altitude but the only treatment effect was a time by treatment interaction in the lowland forest, indicating that diameters of trees in the debris removal treatment did not increase as rapidly as in the control or fertilizer treatments. 4. Fertilization altered understorey biomass in the elfin forest (graminoids increased 10-fold, bryophytes decreased three-fold) but not in the lowland Forest. Debris removal had no effect on understorey biomass in the lowland forest although woody seedling densities were highest in the debris removal plots. In control plots, under-storey biomass was 12-fold greater at high than at low altitude. Saplings of a pioneer tree, Cecropia schreberiana were three- to five-fold denser in fertilized plots than in control or debris removal plots in the lowland forest. 5. The study showed that establishment of woody species by seeds was more important to posthurricane regeneration in the lowland than in the elfin forest and that the recovery of forest productivity was less responsive to increased nutrient availability in the elfin forest. Opportunistic, rapid responses to nutrient addition by Cecropia (low altitude) or graminoids (both high and low altitude) contrasted with the relatively slow responses of mature forest trees. These results suggest that factors regulating primary productivity following disturbance are influenced not only by the physical characteristics of the site but also by the range of potential species-specific responses represented in the flora.",56,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Cecropia | disturbance | elfin forest | litter | tropical forests,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,32,NA,NA

We report growth and photosynthetic characteristics of seedlings of two contrasting climax tree species (Shorea leprosula Miq. and Dryobalanops lanceolata Burck., Dipterocarpaceae) growing in three differing forest light environments (ranging from 2.4-21.8 mol photon m-2 day-1) in lowland rain forest in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. 2. Our aim was to determine whether interspecific differences in seedling ecology reflected differences in the ability of the photosynthetic apparatus to acclimate to light (assessed by measuring photosynthetic light response curves in the field). 3. S. leprosula has been described as a fast growing light-demander whose seedlings will not survive in deep shade whereas D. lanceolata is slower growing with seedlings that can survive a range of light conditions from deep shade to large canopy gaps. 4. Light environments were characterized by analysis of hemispherical photographs taken in the position of each leaf used for photosynthesis measurements, such that we could analyse both within and between site variation. Growth, seedling architecture and mortality were recorded. 5. D. lanceolata showed a greater ability to acclimate to shade, where it had the greater net carbon assimilation rate of the two species at low instantaneous photon flux densities (PFD). Conversely, S. leprosula had a greater ability to acclimate to high light and had greater assimilation rates at high instantaneous PFDs in all environments. 6. Photosynthetic performance, growth and light availability showed strong correlation across environments. Although there were small interspecific differences in photosynthesis within each forest environment, differences in growth and survival were more clearly related to the differing carbon allocation patterns of the two species. 7. D. lanceolata showed an increasing allometric shift in low light in favour of the growth of long branches which are likely to increase sunfleck interception. S. leprosula maximizes height growth and thus has a competitive advantage in more open sites. 8.

Seedlings of 10 European tall-shrub species and the shade-tolerant tree Fagus sylvatica were grown at 0.3, 1.6, 11, and 63% daylight for 110 days on chalk grassland soil, and on a more nutrient-rich soil developed under Crataegus monogyna. 2. Crataegus monogyna, Fagus, Juniperus communis, Cornus sanguinea, Ligustrum vulgare and Rosa canina suffered high mortality in 0.3% daylight, but only the first three had losses in 1.6%. Overall mortality in deep shade (0.3, 1.6%) was considerably lower in Euonymus europaeus, Rhamnus catharticus, Viburnum lantana and V. opulus. Average mortality in deep shade on grassland soil was negatively correlated with embryo-cum-endosperm dry mass (EEM). Overall mortality in deep shade was significantly greater with higher nutrient supply. 3. In 63% daylight relative growth rate (RGR) was negatively correlated with log EEM, and positively with specific leaf area (SLA, leaf area/leaf dry mass) at time of planting but not at final harvest, i.e. differences in RGR were determined more by unit leaf rate (rate of dry mass gain/leaf area) in the latter part of the experiment. 4. The responses of the species to irradiance and nutrient supply were appreciably different. Cornus, Ligustrum, Prunus spinosa, Rhamnus, and Rosa increased yield strongly under high irradiance on nutrient-poor soil, and responded also markedly to nutrients. Viburnum lantana and Euonymus grew relatively slowly in all treatments, but the former was responsive to nutrients, even in deep shade. Viburnum opulus was more responsive to irradiance but responded to nutrients only in 11% daylight. Crataegus grew more slowly on its 'own' soil than on grassland soil. Juniperus differed consistently from the other species, growing slowly, and responding strongly to irradiance. Fagus responded moderately to irradiance and not to nutrient supply. 5. In shade allocation to roots decreased, while allocation to stem and to leaves increased generally.

We used the Barber Cushman model of nutrient uptake to simulate the importance of soil heterogeneity and root plasticity for nitrate (NO3) and phosphate (P) uptake. Model inputs included root physiological parameters and soil characteristics obtained from live years of field studies in the sagebrush steppe. At an intensively sampled field site the average variation in soil P and NO3 around individual plants was 3-fold and 12-fold (3x and 12x, respectively), the range of soil variability used in our simulations. 2. In soil patches three-fold enriched in P (3x), simulated P uptake was three to four times greater than in soil of background P concentrations (1x). The importance of soil heterogeneity and root plasticity was even more pronounced for NO3. In 12x soil patches, NO3 uptake was 7-20 times greater than at 1x, depending on simulation conditions. Plasticity (root proliferation and increased uptake kinetics) accounted for up to 75% of NO3 and over 50% of P acquired from enriched soil patches. Even without plasticity, nutrient uptake increased substantially in enriched patches because of higher soil-solution concentrations. 3. Using the same model we simulated P and NO3 uptake for an actual 0.25-m2 still area in the field. Plant acquisition of P in this area was 28% higher with root plasticity than without, equally attributable to root proliferation and increased uptake kinetics. Plant NO3 uptake was 61% greater with plasticity, due almost exclusively to increased uptake capacity of roots. 4. We also simulated P and NO3 uptake in hypothetical soil arrays containing an equivalent quantity of nutrient distributed homogeneously or heterogeneously. A plant without plasticity always acquired less P or NO3 in the heterogeneous arrays than in the homogeneous arrays. With plasticity, it acquired more nutrients in three of four cases compared to the homogeneous 'control'. 5.

This study integrates results of field experiments with historical data to determine the extent and circumstances under which regeneration of English yew (Taxus baccata L.), a long-lived tree, may be seed-, microsite- or herbivore-limited. 2. Native yew populations within Fraxinus-Acer woodlands in two coastal denes, (Castle Eden Dene and Hawthorn Dene) and two limestone gorges (Greta Gorge and Horsleyhope Ravine) all in County Durham, north-east England were selected for study. 3. The coastal denes reflect a unimodal age-distribution with peak regeneration occurring between 150 and 250 years ago. In contrast, the age-distribution of trees in Greta Gorge appeared to show low but relatively constant levels of regeneration over the last 550 years. Too few yews were found to provide comparable data for Horsleyhope Ravine. 4. The sites differed considerably in patterns of recent regeneration but patterns were consistent with the dynamics depicted by the age-distributions. Over 30% of individuals in Greta Gorge were saplings, while in Hawthorn Dene this figure was only 8% and no saplings were found in either of the two remaining sites. Yew seedlings were only found in the coastal denes. Comparison with other tree species in these sites reveal yew to be the only species which suffers consistently poor seedling recruitment. 5. Rates of seed predation were similarly high across all four sites. However, there was significant variation between microsites with seed predation twice as intense beneath shrubs as in the open. 6. Examination of the age-distribution revealed regeneration to become increasingly microsite limited as the yew population developed. Therefore, although sites with the highest rates of seed predation had fewest yew seedlings, these were also the oldest sites and the pattern could be better explained by limitation of regeneration by microsites rather than herbivores. 7. A continuum was found to exist with sites where current regeneration is primarily herbivore-limited (Hawthorn Dene) to sites which were microsite limited (Greta Gorge) with regeneration in intermediate sites (Castle Eden Dene) being limited by both microsites and seed predators.

The response of plants to herbivory usually varies with the grazing regime experienced. We investigated (i) if the timing and frequency of grazing affected plant growth, (ii) if faeces deposition by herbivores stimulated plant growth, and (iii) if grazing affected the total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) reserves in the below-ground vegetation of two arctic graminoids, Dupontia fisheri and Eriophorum scheuchzeri. 2. This study was conducted in polygon fens exposed to intense summer grazing by greater snow geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica) on Bylot Island (73°N) in the Canadian High Arctic. We manipulated the frequency (once or three times) and the timing (early, mid or late in the season) of grazing and faeces deposition in controlled grazing trials using captive goslings. 3. Although ungrazed plants were taller than grazed ones at the end of the season, data on cumulative tiller elongation (net above-ground height production) showed that plants grazed once or three times produced new foliage after each defoliation in both species. However, neither grazing (presence or absence) nor its frequency affected the net above-ground primary production (NAPP) or the number of tillers at the end of the summer. Nitrogen concentration was highest in plants grazed three times, intermediate in those grazed once, and lowest in ungrazed plants. 4. Timing of grazing and presence of goose faeces with or without grazing had no effect on plant growth. 5. Eriophorum plants grazed three times had less TNC in their below-ground tissues than ungrazed plants, and the trend was similar in Dupontia. 6. Dupontia and Eriophorum were able to compensate for leaves lost to grazing and to maintain production at a level similar to ungrazed plants, but at some cost (reduced below-ground reserves).

Host plant density, population genetic structure, and pathogen inoculum source and quantity may also influence infection and were therefore held constant. 2 Plants growing in the presence of heterospecific neighbours were small and less likely to become infected after experimental inoculation than those grown in plots where heterospecifics were removed. Possible explanations for this result are that (1) plants experiencing strong competition were small and possessed inadequate resources to support the pathogen, (2) larger plants were bigger targets for natural inoculation in the second year, (3) infected plants grew larger, or (4) a matrix of heterospecifics may act as barriers to pathogen dispersal. 3 Microsite differences on the scale of metres strongly influenced whether a plant became infected. Since many pathogens are relatively nonmobile microorganisms, it is likely that they experience environmental patchiness on a very small scale. 4 Even though the same plant genotypes and pathogen inoculum were used in both sites, variation among plant genotypes in resistance to the mixture of pathogen spores was detected only in the mesic site (and only in the first year). The greater environmental heterogeneity of the xeric site may have overwhelmed any host genotype effect in that site. 5 The results indicate that field experiments on plant-pathogen interactions should consider a range of causal factors.

Five types of mires (herbaceous bog, forested bog, herbaceous rich-fen, river marginal fen and alder fen forest) were compared. 3 Inorganic N as well as P release were faster in the Dutch than in the Polish mires of the same type. Denitrification and nitrous oxide emission were also faster in the Dutch mires, with the exception of the Polish alder forest, where denitrification was high because of high N richness and a strongly falling water table. 4 Principal component analysis of 18 physical and chemical soil and interstitial water variables resulted in four components: I, 'soil redox status'; II, 'soil base status'; III, 'interstitial water nutrient richness'; IV, 'soil P richness'. In multiple regressions, N mineralization correlated positively with component III, P release with components III and IV, and cellulose decomposition with components II and IV. Both denitrification and nitrous oxide emission correlated positively with components I and II. 5 It was concluded that the lower P release rates in the Polish compared to the Dutch mires were due to higher calcium levels and lower summer water tables, which was partly attributed to the Polish continental climate.

Seedling survival was recorded for six months, and dry weight was determined for all seedlings that survived to the end of this period. 3 Comparisons of seedling survival and biomass revealed evidence for local adaptation, and the expression of local adaptation was affected very little by the presence of surrounding vegetation. Results for vegetation-removal quadrats closely paralleled those for unmanipulated quadrats. This result does not support the hypothesis that the two populations are differentiated with respect to performance in the presence of vegetation. 4 The detection of local adaptation depended strongly on the age of transplants.

These indicators proved not to be such good predictors of longevity under dense shade as was seed mass itself. 3 Seedlings were also grown in the light until five days after true leaves appeared, before being transferred to dense shade. The different behaviour of these true-leaf seedlings was consistent with the idea that extra resources in seeds are the direct cause of longer dense-shade survival.

We hypothesize that environmental change can affect a vital rate of a plant population through one of two mechanisms: by changing the population age structure (hypothesis 1), or by altering the age-dependent vital rates (hypothesis 2). 2 We determined which of these hypotheses best explained the effects of different grazing treatments, applied in a field experiment, on the population tiller production of two pasture grasses, Agrostis stolonifera and Lolium perenne. 3 Monthly censuses of mean per capita tiller production were carried out for two years and grazing effects were detected in a number of censuses. 4 Tiller production by individual tillers was age-dependent and increased linearly with tiller age. 5 Grazing treatments significantly changed both the age structures (nt) of the tiller populations in most censuses and the regression of tiller production on age (mt) in a number of censuses. 6 Treatment effects on population tiller production predicted according to hypothesis 1 were calculated using measured values for nt specific to each grazing treatment and the mean values for mt over all treatments. Conversely, effects predicted according to hypothesis 2 were calculated using mean values for nt and values for mt specific to each grazing treatment. 7 The grazing effects on tiller production predicted by hypothesis 2 fitted the field data significantly for both species in all grazing treatments whereas hypothesis 1 never gave a significant fit. Therefore, grazing effects on population tiller production arose solely through changes in the age-specific values for tillering and never through effects on the population age structures. 8 We discuss the reasons for these results and consider the mechanisms of the responses to grazing.

The phenology of tropical gynodioecious figs is important to vertebrates relying on fig fruit as a resource, and to understanding the evolution of gynodioecy in Ficus. 2 Gynodioecious fig species have hermaphrodite trees with closed, urn-shaped inflorescences bearing male and female flowers, and female trees with inflorescences bearing female flowers. Pollinators entering receptive inflorescences on hermaphrodite trees pollinate, lay eggs in female flowers, and die; weeks later, offspring emerge, mate and carry pollen from hermaphrodite trees to other trees. Wasps entering inflorescences on female trees pollinate female flowers but cannot lay eggs, and die without leaving offspring. Hermaphrodite ('male') trees produce pollen and wasps, and no seeds; female trees produce only seeds. 3 During 1991 and 1992, I observed the phenology of two gynodioecious fig tree species, Ficus exasperata and F. hispida, in a dry and a wet site in Coorg District, south India. 4 Ficus exasperata trees displayed a synchronous phenology very similar to that predicted by one hypothesis relating the evolution of gynodioecy to phenology. Female trees of F. exasperata produced seeds synchronously during the monsoon season and 'male' trees produced pollinator wasps and pollen synchronously during the peak period of female receptivity. Crop production occurred more frequently in the dry than in the wet site. Female trees bore mature fruit for longer periods than 'male' trees. 5 In contrast, several phenological traits of F. hispida departed strongly from prediction. This species displayed an asynchronous phenology at the population level. Receptivity and wasp or seed production in F. hispida occurred year-round, female trees produced more crops than 'male' trees, and there was considerable overlap in timing of 'male' and female inflorescence production. Durations of phenological phases were longer on female than on 'male' trees at the wet site. 6 An asynchronous phenology appears to be more advantageous in aseasonal than in seasonal environments. If the two phenological types observed in this study are found to be widespread, then the possibility that functional dioecy in Ficus evolved via more than one pathway must be considered.",42,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Dioecy | Evolution | Ficus | Flowering | Fruiting | Hymenoptera | India | Moraceae | Pollination | Tropics,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,46,NA,NA

We investigated scaling relationships among root and shoot modules, leaf life-span, effects of herbivores on module and whole plant growth, and differences in growth under different sedimentation regimes. 2 Production of new shoots and aerial roots occurred seasonally. Annual peaks in solar insolation occurred in May; relative rates of change in numbers of shoot meristems and leaves, and stem length peaked one month following. Relative rate of change in numbers of aerial roots peaked one month following this shoot flush, and roots elongated primarily during the dry season. 3 Increased water depth was positively correlated with the ratio of root length to shoot length in saplings. Mean shoot growth rate was significantly lower at cays exhibiting relatively low sedimentation rates, as well as at similar locales within cays. 4 Average leaf life-span was 9 months. During an outbreak of the mangrove skipper Phocides pigmalion, insect herbivores shortened leaf life-span by increasing leaf abscission rate. Insect folivores reduced above-ground net primary production available for export to adjacent marine ecosystems by 5-20%. Up to seven-fold increases in percentage of roots bored by isopods occurred concomitantly with annual peaks in new root production. Relative elongation rate of roots decreased five-fold following isopod attack. However, whilst both insects and isopods tracked production of and consumed new modules, neither consumer contributed significantly to variance in whole-plant growth. 5 Demographic growth analysis is a powerful tool with which to predict dynamic responses of module production and whole-plant growth in response to local environmental conditions. Our analyses illustrate that growth of mangroves are sensitive to seasonal patterns of insolation, to decreasing sedimentation and to increasing water depth.

Relatively little grazing occurs in more inland sites, where the same vegetation persists but tidal inundations are infrequent. At some sites geese have grubbed vegetation exposing sediments. 2. Feeding preferences of geese may be linked to the availability of nitrogen for plant growth in the different areas. Total soil nitrogen, exchangeable inorganic nitrogen, net mineralization of nitrogen, together with soil properties, were measured in inter-tidal and inland sites (both grazed and ungrazed), and in intertidal grubbed sites. Where applicable, rates of net mineralization of nitrogen were compared with aboveground biomass and with the nitrogen content of shoots of graminoids in both grazed and ungrazed (exclosed) swards. 3. All soils were regosolic static cryosols with a thin Ah humus horizon. Most graminoid roots were confined to the top 2 cm of soil, few penetrated deeper than 5 cm.

These results were not significantly different from the difference between measurements of methane efflux using chambers enclosing clipped and unclipped plots (12.0-27.9 mmol m-2 day-1). 3 We determined that methane transport through S. palustris contributed between 64 and 90% of the net methane efflux from the peatland, while the other peatland without plants capable of rapid methane transport had significantly lower methane efflux. The higher annual efflux from peat with aerenchymatous plants appears to be due to several factors, including increased substrate production which enhances methane production, reduction in methane oxidation, as well as easier methane transport from the site of production. 4 Plants capable of transporting methane regulated the methane pool in the saturated zone by depleting both dissolved methane in the pore-waters and the concentration of methane in gas bubbles trapped in the saturated peat. 5 Our experiments indicate that methane transport through S. palustris is due to molecular diffusion, and is not influenced by pressurization or stomatal aperture.",161,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Bog | Pore-water | Trace gas | Wetland,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,50,NA,NA

Geese may affect nutrient availability, interspecific light competition, and salinity. These variables were manipulated in order to identify interactive effects of interspecific competition and abiotic factors on arrowgrass size, biomass allocation and distribution, which are likely to be significant in relation to the effects of herbivory on arrowgrass abundance and distribution. 2 Arrowgrass individuals were transplanted from two slough levee communities to the same two communities and to the adjacent slough margin and wet Carex meadow communities. Geese were excluded and nutrient availability, light competition and salinity levels were manipulated. 3 When light levels were not manipulated, fertilization had a negative effect on plant biomass and allocation to bulbs. Under decreased competition for light, plant biomass of fertilized plants was not significantly different from that of control plants. Fertilization appears to have a negative effect on arrowgrass as a result of increased competition for light. 4 Plants in the slough margin habitat were smallest, had the lowest allocation to leaves and stolons, and the lowest N concentrations and total N mass. Results from the fertilization treatment suggest plants in this community are limited primarily by physical factors. 5 Plants in the Carex wet meadow had higher allocation to leaves than in other communities under unfertilized conditions, but decreased allocation to leaves under fertilization. Plants in this community appear light- and nutrient-limited under unfertilized conditions, and primarily light-limited under fertilization. 6 Our results suggest that the presence of geese may control arrowgrass distribution because (a) faeces deposition has a negative effect on arrowgrass, (b) this negative effect is ameliorated by consumption of neighbours, and (c) the combination of high light competition and highly selective foraging for arrowgrass limit expansion of arrowgrass into the Carex meadow community.

Seed number, biomass invested in growth, and vegetative propagation (gemmae production) were used as indices of resource allocation. Allocations to sexual reproduction, vegetative propagation and growth were analysed relative to allocation to the other two functions, plant size (winter bud mass), and site. 2 The effects of plant size on patterns of resource investment were not consistent. Allocation to growth varied negatively with plant size, particularly in large fruiting plants. In contrast, sexual reproduction and gemmae production varied positively with plant size: seed and fruit production increased allometrically, whereas allocation to gemmae was isometric. 3 In isolation from the effects of plant size, trade-offs occurred between sexual reproduction and vegetative functions (growth and gemmae production), whereas vegetative propagation and growth varied positively. Decreased gemmae production by fruiting plants, even after the effects of reproduction on growth had been accounted for, implied that: (1) reproduction affected vegetative propagation and growth independently; (2) growth was favoured over vegetative propagation; and (3) reproduction was more costly than indicated by simple trade-offs. Positive relations between growth and vegetative propagation probably arise because gemmae are in effect axillary buds on the over-wintering structure. 4 These allocation patterns, combined with threshold sizes for reproduction, suggest an emphasis on growth until a minimum size is reached. Beyond this threshold, resources not required to maintain size seem to be allocated to current reproduction. We suggest that resource allocation by P. vulgaris may reflect growth form and phenology as well as the relative probabilities of adult, gemmae and seedling survival.

Thus, ecotypic differentiation in plant resistance cannot explain lower densities of bittercress in the sun. 3 In the second experiment, protection of plants in the sun with insecticide resulted in growth and reproduction equivalent to plants in the shade. Thus, physiological adaptation to shade cannot explain lower densities of C. cordifolia in the sun. 4 The combined outcomes of these experiments suggest that chronic differential herbivory by adapted insects in the sun is a major factor in the shade habitat restriction of Cardamine cordifolia within its indigenous region, the central Rocky Mountains, USA. 5 Leaf toughness, thickness, and water deficits were greater for plants in the sun, whereas glucosinolate concentrations were lower.

The data used were collected annually from 10 sites in six different populations on up to seven occasions in the period 1987-93. 2 In general, temporal variation was higher in transition matrices than in elasticities, while between-site variation was high for both transition and elasticity matrices. 3 The relative contributions of three life-history transitions, progression (or growth, G), recruitment from seed (fecundity, F) and survival (retrogression plus stasis, L) to the finite rate of increase, λ, were also highly variable, between years within as well as between sites. The observed variation is very large in comparison with that previously observed either between or within other iteroparous herbs from open habitats, even showing some overlap with demographic patterns normally characteristic of woody plants. 4 A G-L-F ordination shows a long, narrow band across the entire diagram from matrices with a low elasticity for L and high elasticities for G and F at one end to matrices which have an elasticity of 1.00 for L on the other. 5 Correlations between the G-, L- and F-elasticities, λ, and the vegetation cover suggest that the band in the ordination diagram represents a successional pathway in wet heathlands from invasive to regressive populations. Elasticity matrices from regularly mown hay meadows are characteristic of stable populations, but represent senile, regressive populations after mowing has ceased. 6 Relationships between λ and the elasticities of G, L and F show that in matrices of stable or declining populations (λ ≤ 1) survival is most important. In growing populations (λ > 1) the contribution of progression and fecundity becomes larger. 7 Given their relatively large temporal and spatial variation, elasticities are useful in nature conservation and management only if the corresponding value of λ is taken into account. 8 Significant positive correlations between transition probabilities of different life stages were observed.

As trees grew up towards the canopy, individuals with the same d.b.h. were taller if they came from species with larger maximum height. This appeared to reflect a trade-off between height growth and lateral growth of crowns. Two canopy dominants continued to gain in d.b.h. after they had reached the canopy, while their height remained almost constant. 3 We examined size-specific patterns of relative growth rate of d.b.h. from a decade of field censuses.

In total, 4.9% of the standing basal area had been felled or damaged. 3 The major cause of tree-fall and tree damage is falling trees and limbs: 75% of the fallen and 83% of the damaged trees were felled or damaged by others ('domino-wise' felled or damaged trees). Of the remaining ('initiating') fallen trees, 38% were uprooted and 62% were snapped-off above the ground. Similar percentages were observed for domino-wise felled trees. 4 The spatial distribution of the 38 trees which initiated events was random. Preexisting canopy gaps did not increase the chances of surrounding trees to initiate a tree- or branch-fall. However, initiating tree- and branch-falls were found clustered at around 50 m from large gaps, while few gaps occurred at around 25 m from old gaps. 5 Some 35% of the fallen trees did not create canopy gaps, and 42% of the damaged trees were not involved in the creation of a canopy gap.

Soil salinity was inversely related to above-ground biomass and shoot density of Puccinellia phryganodes. Increased biomass led to reduced soil salinity at sites where exclosures were erected. 3 Plant growth, measured as the rate of leaf births on Puccinellia shoots, was reduced by high soil salinities at sites where exclosures were erected. 4 Leaf demography of transplanted experimental plants of Puccinellia differed in 1992, but not 1991, between plants transplanted into sites with different amounts of above-ground biomass.

Demographic information on 14 776 growing points was obtained by following 119 Norwegian boreal spruce forest populations for 5 years. The dry weight of each mature segment was estimated from morphological field measurements. 2 The mean size of mature segments was positively correlated with the density (cover) of the bryophyte layer; a density increase from 0 to 100% was associated with a doubling in mean size. This relationship is attributed to the improved moisture conditions, and hence to prolonged periods with positive net photosynthesis, in dense stands. Mean size was not significantly related to the density of Hylocomium splendens growing points, suggesting that interactions in bryophyte stands are mainly with neighbours regardless of species. 3 The frequency of regeneration declined with increasing density, notably when the effects of segment size were corrected for. Negative density-dependence of regeneration is considered to be due to reduction of light-induced bud initiation in dense stands. 4 The size-corrected mortality (termination and loss) rate was not related to density. Danger of burial in the moss carpet, causing about one tenth of all terminations and losses, increased strongly with density and affected c. 5% of all growing points at high densities. 5 At high densities, Hylocomium splendens populations are not regulated by a negative relationship between size and density, but by a combination of reduced branching (ramification and regeneration) and increased danger of burial in the bryophyte carpet. However, such high densities are infrequent in the forest floor (affecting less than 10% of the area investigated). It is suggested that differences in history due to fine-scale disturbance and microenvironmental variation are reflected in size differences of individual Hylocomium splendens segments, and that this is the major factor that keeps boreal forest bryophyte populations at low densities.",55,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Bryophyte | Density | Positive density-dependence | Regeneration | Size-dependence,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,67,NA,NA

Infructescences (cones) contained a mean of 12 follicles, holding two seeds of which 62% were estimated to be viable. 3 Cone (and seed) production increased with plant age to 15 years, but then fluctuated widely around a mean of 17 cones per year. By this time the average plant had an estimated canopy seed bank of 700 viable seeds comprising seeds 1-10 years old. 4 Seeds were lost from the canopy seed bank through spontaneous follicle rupture (i.e. in the absence of fire), granivory by insect larvae, and decay. Most follicles remained closed for at least 5 years and up to 50% of follicles were still closed after 10 years. Insect granivores destroyed 18% of seeds in 1-year-old cones, and continued to destroy seeds in older cones at a rate of 2-3% per year. 5 The seed bank model predicted continued seed accumulation in the canopy to at least age 25 years (1400 seeds), but by this time more viable seeds (≈ 2200) had been lost to spontaneous opening, granivory and decay than were then stored on the plant. 6 Shannon-Weiner diversity (H′) of seed ages in the canopy seed bank increased with plant age, while evenness (V′) decreased at first (to plant age 17 years) and then increased. 7 On a time-scale of many generations, the likelihood of successful recruitment of individuals in the next generation (on average), occurs for a fire frequency of 15-18 years.

These differences were not affected by the time of harvest, suggesting that they reflect host-dependent differences in fungal growth rates, rather than host-dependent timing of sporulation. 2 Spore counts in field soil and estimates from sorghum trap cultures showed that the association of AM fungi with particular host plants in the field was positively correlated with the sporulation rates observed on those hosts in the microcosm experiments. 3 The AM fungal species richness observed at the field site was high relative to estimates made in previous studies. 23 distinct species of AM fungi were found, seven of which have not been previously described. 4 The host-dependence of the relative growth rates of fungal populations may play an important role in the maintenance of fungal species diversity.",437,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Arbuscular mycorrhizae | Community ecology | Glomalean fungi | Microcosm | Population growth rates | Species diversity,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,73,NA,NA

This paper documents the same trend of reduced dispersal ability over the course of just a few generations in some weedy, short-lived and wind-dispersed plants of inshore islands in British Columbia, Canada. 2 We measured dispersal-related morphological characteristics of diaspores from island populations of known ages, and from mainland populations. In two of three species with sufficiently large sample sizes, older island populations show increasingly reduced dispersal potential relative to mainland populations or to young island populations. 3 These and other morphological differences are consistent with results expected from strong selection for reduced dispersal potential, and may be striking examples of short-term evolution in small and isolated natural populations.",251,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Anemochory | Dispersal | Evolution | Island plant populations,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,74,NA,NA

This experiment investigated the effect of beetle herbivory or rust infection, individually and when combined, on the growth of seedlings from August and also on regrowth the following spring. 2 Between August and October, the beetle alone removed up to 79% of leaf area. Rust infection was slow to develop, but caused a decrease of ≈50% in leaf area by October. The combination of herbivory and infection had an additive effect by October, causing a reduction in leaf area of 92% (R. crispus) and 88% (R. obtusifolius). 3 There was no plant mortality. At the harvest in February, previous herbivory reduced area and weight of regrowth by 78% in both species, but infection had a significant effect only on R. crispus. The combined effects of herbivory and infection were additive, leading to a 88% (R. crispus) and 84% (R. obtusifolius) reduction in shoot dry weight, and a 82% (R. crispus) and 72% (R. obtusifolius) reduction in root dry weight. 4 Herbivory and infection both led to a significant, additive, increase in the concentration of alcohol-soluble carbohydrates in the roots. Herbivory also had an effect on fructans, starch, and total nonstructural carbohydrate in the roots, reducing concentrations by up to 26%. 5 Overall, herbivory alone or combined with infection had a severe effect on regrowth capacity and root quantity and quality of both species, although infection alone had little effect on R. obtusifolius.

The study focused on the impact of herbivores on plant survival, above-ground biomass and root weight ratios of 21 plant species which were sown experimentally in a grassland and meadow. 2 Of the three herbivore groups studied, rodents exerted the greatest influence on plant performance, reducing plant biomass by as much as 50% and substantially increasing plant mortality. Molluscs significantly decreased plant numbers but plants appeared more able to compensate for biomass lost through grazing. By comparison, arthropods played only a minor role in determining either plant biomass or survival. 3 Positive correlations in the responses of plant species to herbivory by molluscs and rodents indicate that the major difference in the impact of these two guilds of herbivores on plant performance (survival, biomass and root weight ratio) is in the magnitude rather than the direction of the plant response. Legumes were more susceptible to herbivory than grasses, exhibiting both lower survival and greater loss of biomass. 4 Results indicate that where resources are limiting, as in the meadow, the direct influence of herbivores on plant numbers is minimal since herbivore induced mortality is only one component of naturally low plant survival. In contrast, the influence of herbivores on plant growth can be considerable since plants are often unable to compensate for tissue loss via regrowth. Thus, in the grassland, the overall influence of herbivores was on plant numbers whereas in the meadow their main impact was on mean plant biomass. 5 Although the majority of the variation in both plant survival and biomass occurred independently of the experimental treatments, with almost 50% attributable to intrinsic species effects, indirect evidence reveals herbivores to have an impact on plant community composition. Plants which suffer both high mortality and poor growth as a result of herbivory (e.g. Trifolium repens, T. pratense) are rare while those plants whose performance is little influenced by herbivores (e.g. Agrostis capillaris, Dactylis glomerata, Plantago lanceolata) are abundant in the grassland communities studied.",126,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,"Biomass | Compensation, exclosures | Grazing | Plant survival | Root weight ratio",29602,undefined,0,FALSE,76,NA,NA
