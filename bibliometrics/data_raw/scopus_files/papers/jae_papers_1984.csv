There is a limit, beyond which no further response to selection for increased fecundity occurs. Genotypes close to the limit experience sharply reduced fecundity irrespective of phenotypic size. So 2 butterflies, of the same weight, lay very different numbers of eggs, according to their genotypes. These mechanisms stabilize average size and fecundity at levels which are roughly optimal for the population in field conditions. The data contradict the current dogma that individual competitive advantages take precedence over the welfare of the population as a whole. The amount of genetic variation in pupal weight is limited by the ecological effects of high and low field temperatures on larval survival. -Author Division of Wildlife and Rangelands Research, C.S.I.R.O., P.O.Box 84, Lyneham, A.C.T. 2602, Australia.",17,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Stonechats were sallying specialists. Wheatears on average used lower perches than stonechats. The distributions of successful and unsuccessful search times for both species resemble log-normal distribution. Departures from both types of perches occurred independently of the time already spent on the perch. Stonechats generally stayed longer on perches, and had lower departure rates from them than wheatears. Capture probabilities were lower for stonechats. Giving-up times and successful search times increased with perch height, and were longer for stonechats at the same perch heights. This suggests that these birds were able to estimate how long it would take to search the area viewed from each perch, and that the height of the perch and probably the complexity of the area determine these giving-up times. The return-to-perch rate of stonechats was twice that of wheatears. The return rate was negatively correlated with search times preceding the previous sally for wheatears, but not for stonechats.

Four models of optimal Tp are discussed: 1) Maximize YIELD: energy collected per total round trip time (including time in the nest); 2) Maximize rate of DELIVERY: YIELD minus parent's metabolism; 3) Maximize FAMILY GAIN: DELIVERY minus brood's metabolism, considering the energy cost of begging by the chicks; 4) Maximize EFFICIENCY: YIELD/parent's metabolism - relevant when there is a cost in spending energy (eg due to constraints in maximum rate of heat dissipation).

Bracken extrafloral nectaries secrete sugars and amino acids at low and variable rates. Nectar production increased rapidly to a peak in mid-June, then declined slowly to zero in late August. Seasonal patterns of ant activity on bracken fronds usually mirrored nectar availability. Spatially, ants were often, but not always, randomly distributed among fronds within a patch. The maximum potential predation rates which ants might impose on bracken herbivores were measured. Calculated attack rates indicated a high potential impact of ants on bracken herbivore populations. Other insect species visiting extrafloral nectaries on bracken include potential natural enemies (both predators and parasitoids); 'robbers' that steal nectar; and 'robber-herbivores', with adults that feed on nectaries and larvae that are bracken-specific herbivores. The hypothesis that the nectaries facilitate a mutualistic association with ants, which in turn defend the plant against insect herbivores, is discussed. The bracken-extrafloral nectary-ant association closely resembles many other ant-extrafloral nectary systems independently evolved by other plants, where ants are known to have a defensive role.

The advantages of laying a small-sized first clutch were also seen in the case of the 1st brood itself compared with the enlarged broods, viz. few or none of the nestlings were lost (5% and 38% respectively), and body weights of the fledglings of the former broods were much greater, indicating that their survival rate, on leaving the nest, would be much higher. The breeding success of an attempted re-nesting thus depends on the degree of parental effort already involved in an initial attempt. -from Author",127,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,61,NA,NA

Prey included mosquito larvae, surface prey, and 3 species of zooplankton: Ceriodaphnia reticulata, Daphnia pulex and Moina sp. Notonecta's predatory behaviour was stereotyped: neither level of hunger nor previous diet significantly influenced preference. Attack rate increased exponentially, and handling time decreased exponentially, with temperature. In field experiments, Notonecta strongly influenced the structure and dynamics of the community. It drove mosquito larvae and D. pulex extinct and reduced the density of Moina sp., C. reticulata, and several other species. Notonecta either destabilized its prey populations, by driving them extinct, or did not affect the degree of temporal variability. -from Authors",97,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,62,NA,NA

When workers and soldiers from different colonies were placed together in laboratory tests, both castes fought and mortality was high. Workers and soldiers from different nests within a single colony combined without aggression. When contact between neighbouring colonies was stimulated by placing bridges across the edges of foraging areas, intercolony aggression involving groups of soldiers and workers resulted in the divergence of trails or in nest mortality.

There was no interspecific overlap in either cell size or mouth size. Both species are raptorial feeders, living principally on small (5-50 mu m) algae. L. magnus was dominant in Esthwaite where most algae were large and many were too large for L. striatus. In Priest Pot, large food particles were relatively scarce and there was considerable overlap in the spectra of particle sizes ingested by the two species. L. striatus was dominant chiefly because of its higher weight-specific feeding rate and population growth rate. Food resource partitioning appeared to be the chief mechanism facilitating coexistence of these two species. -from Authors",19,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,64,NA,NA

Shrubs provide feeding and mating habitats in late April and May following hibernation. Some oviposition may also occur. Adults disperse from mid-May to trees, particularly Tilia spp., which are the principal habitats for egg laying in many populations. At some sites in some years a substantial 2nd, late summer or autumn generation occurs. Reproduction probably tends to occur earlier inland than on the coast. There are differences in timing between years. Frequencies of melanics are 1-15% in the north-west and >50% inland in the south-east. Steep clines occur over part of the transition between these regions, possibly due to a partial barrier to gene flow. Frequency changes were probably more marked for the quadrimaculata than the sexpustulata melanic morph. Among the correlations between melanic frequency and climatic variables are negative ones with an index of oceanity, relative humidity and length of sunshine. The last is consistent with thermal melanism. -from Author",62,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,66,all,All Open Access

Mean size and growth rate of 1st year trout varied considerably between year-classes, were not related to egg or alevin density and were thus not density-dependent. Water temperature and alevin weight were the chief factors affecting growth; food was not a limiting factor in most year-classes. Individual variation around mean size was inversely related to initial density of eggs or alevins and was thus density-dependent. It was low for alevins, increased markedly during the first month of growth and remained fairly constant within each year-class during spring and summer. Biomass and production were related to egg or alevin density by a dome-shaped curve, but were also affected by variations in growth rate, especially towards the end of the summer. Their large variation between year-classes was thus determined by density-dependent mortality and to a lesser extent by density-independent growth.
