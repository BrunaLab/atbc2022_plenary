Low-latitude (tropical) populations had higher heterozygosity and less marked phylogeographic structure and lower subdivision among sites within regions (within Northern Territory [NT] and within North Queensland [NQ]) than did populations at higher latitudes (subtropical sites; central Queensland [CQ]), although sampling of geographically proximal breeding sites is unavoidably restricted for the latter.

The high level of population subdivision across the range of the ghost bat contrasts with evidence for high gene flow in other chiropteran species and may be due to narrow physiological tolerances and consequent limited availability of roosts for ghost bats, particularly across the subtropical and relatively arid regions. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the contraction of the species' range is associated with late Holocene climate change.

Banding of willow warblers, Phylloscopus trochilus, in Europe has demonstrated a migratory divide latitudinally across central Scandinavia. In autumn, southern birds migrate southwest to tropical West Africa, whereas northern birds migrate southeast to East and South Africa. The migratory divide is associated with concordant differences in size and plumage coloration. Based on morphology, we estimate the width of the transition zone between northern and southern willow warblers to be less than 350 km. We found indication of linkage disequilibria around the migratory divide, in that measures of body size were correlated with plumage coloration within the contact zone, but uncorrelated within the populations south or north of the contact zone. The presence of linkage disequilibria and the fact that several morphological clines occur together suggest that the hybrid zone is a result of secondary contact between populations that have differentiated in allopatry. This interpretation is in accord with the knowledge of the recolonization pattern of the Scandinavian peninsula after the last glaciation; animals and plants appeared to have colonized either from the south or from the north around the northern bay of the Baltic Sea. If northern and southern willow warblers resided in allopatric populations during late Pleistocene glaciations and the hybrid zone is a result of postglacial range expansions, we would expect some degree of genetic differentiation accumulated during the period in isolation. In contrast, northern and southern willow warblers are near panmictic in the frequencies of alleles of mitochondrial DNA and at two microsatellite loci. The observed pattern, clear morphological and behavioral differentiation without genetic differentiation at neutral loci, suggests either that the differences are maintained by strong selection on the expressed genes in combination with high levels of current gene flow or, in the case of weak gene flow, that the divergence in morphology and behavior is very recent.",Geographic variation | Hybrid zones | Microsatellites | Migration | Migratory divide | Mitochondrial DNA | Morphology | Orientation,NA,NA,NA,NA

In adapting to living with the new predator type, these lineages evolved much greater swimming speeds to avoid attacking dragonflies. In this paper, I test whether biochemical adaptations to fuel swimming arose in concert with previously identified morphological changes that increase swimming speed. I assayed the mass-specific enzyme activities of three enzymes involved in fueling strenuous activity: pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase (enzymes involved in glycolysis) and arginine kinase (the enzyme that recharges the ATP pool). Enzyme activities were determined for 14 Enallagma species from across the genus. Species that coexist with dragonfly predators had significantly higher mass-specific arginine kinase activities than species that coexist with fish, and the results of evolutionary contrasts analyses indicate that this difference between the two groups is the result of evolutionary change associated with the habitat shifts of lineages from fish lakes to dragonfly lakes. Although significant evolution was documented for lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase across the genus, evolutionary change in the activities of these enzymes was not consistent with adaptation to coexisting with dragonfly predators. Swimming bouts to avoid dragonfly predators last for only a few seconds, and the action of arginine kinase to phosphorylate ADP to make ATP will extend the duration of maximal exertion for swimming for a few seconds. However, much longer time periods (over 45 sec) are required to generate ATP via glycolysis. Therefore, selection may have favored adaptation only at the arginine kinase locus.",Adaptation | Arginine kinase | Enallagma | Enzyme activity | Metabolism | Odonata,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Using a phylogenetic framework to identify recently diverged taxa that have undergone a radical host shift, this study focuses on how reconstruction of the historical demography of a species, in conjunction with branching patterns between species, provides insight into mode of speciation. Analyses of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I sequences indicate that the leaf beetle Ophraella communa exhibits significant population structure, as shown by patterns of genealogical relationships among mitochondrial haplotypes and high F(ST)-values. However, the absence of regional localization of old clades of haplotypes, negative Tajima's D, and unimodal rather than bimodal frequency distribution of the number of pairwise differences between sequences suggests an absence of long-term barriers to gene flow. Furthermore, we found no evidence of isolation by distance. This pattern of genetic variation is consistent with episodes of gene flow on a large geographic scale, perhaps owing to Pleistocene changes in climate. Ophraella communa and its sister species O. bilineata diverged during the early Pleistocene. The evidence of dynamic population structure in O. communa, potentially including episodic but massive gene flow, suggests that reproductive isolation evolved quite rapidly on a localized geographic scale, because speciation would probably have been reversed by gene flow if the evolution of reproductive isolation had been prolonged. That is, gene flow occasioned by range shifts during the Pleistocene would likely have interrupted speciation unless it occurred very rapidly. Sequence diversity implies a large effective population size (> 106) in both O. communa and O. bilineata. However, a model based on a drastic bottleneck did not have a lower likelihood than a model with no bottleneck, simply because the time since speciation has been great enough for coalescence to a single ancestor that existed after the speciation event.

The border population had a relatively higher resistance to cold shock in postwinter collections, but there was no population differentiation for prewinter collections or for the other traits. The presence of variation among isofemale lines within the border populations suggests that genetic variation as measured in the laboratory is unlikely to limit range expansion. Population cages were used in the field to determine if D. serrata persisted over winter at borders. Although all cages yielded adult offspring at northern sites, only a few produced offspring at or just south of the border. In contrast, all cages with D. simulans produced adult offspring, suggesting that climatic factors limited D. serrata numbers. Offspring from surviving adults showed a phenotypic trade-off between fecundity and cold resistance. Comparisons of the cold resistance of field males and females with their laboratory-reared offspring provided evidence for heritable variation in field-reared flies.

For each pair of populations, three fitness components (hatching number, survivorship number, and metamorphosis number) were measured in up to 16 cohorts including parentals, reciprocal F1, F2, F3, and first-generation backcross hybrids. Comparisons of each set of cohorts allowed estimation of within- and between-locus gene interaction. Relative to parentals, F1 hybrids showed a trend toward increased fitness, with no correspondence with population divergence, and a decrease in variance, which in some cases correlated with population divergence. In sharp contrast, F2 hybrids had a decrease in fitness and an increase in variance that both corresponded to population divergence. Genetic interpretation of these patterns suggests that both the beneficial effects of dominance and the detrimental effects of breaking up coadaptation are magnified by increasing evolutionary distance between populations. Because there is no recombination in T. californicus females, effects of recombination can be assessed by comparing F1 hybrid males and females backcrossed to parentals. Both recombinant and nonrecombinant backcross hybrids showed a decline in fitness correlated with population divergence, indicating that segregation among chromosomes contributes to the breakup of coadaptation. Although there was no difference in mean fitness between the two backcross types, recombinational backcrosses showed greater variance for fitness than nonrecombinational backcrosses, suggesting that the breakup of parental gene combinations within chromosomes has both beneficial and detrimental effects.",Copepod | Fitness | Quantitative genetics | Speciation | Tigriopus californicus,NA,NA,NA,NA

The nonmigratory form of this species is restricted to coastal mangroves in Florida and is morphologically distinguishable from the typical, migratory form that occurs across the remainder of the eastern United States. Pairs of migratory populations exhibited little population subdivision (Φ(ST) ≤ 0.09), whereas pairs of migratory and nonmigratory populations are much more differentiated (Φ(ST) = 0.27 0.42). A phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes did not offer evidence of long-term isolation of migratory and nonmigratory populations. Together with the population genetic analysis, the phylogenetic relationship of haplotypes suggests that isolation between these forms must have arisen relatively recently in their history. Evidence for significant population structure is unexpected, given the geographic proximity of migratory and nonmigratory populations, the capacity for long-distance movements (e.g., migration) by prairie warblers, and several previous studies of population structure in North American birds.

Morphological variation and trophic and spatial niches are characterized and contrasted among 203 individuals. Genetic variation at six microsatellite loci is also analyzed to appraise the extent of genetic differentiation among these morphotypes. Ecomorphological data confirm the existence of four distinct morphotypes displaying various levels of trophic and depth niche overlap and specialization. However, ecological and morphological variations were not coupled as expected, suggesting that trophic morphology is not always predictive of ecology. Although extensive genetic variability was observed, little genetic differentiation was found among morphotypes, with only one morph being slightly but significantly differentiated. Contrasting patterns of morphological, ecological, and genetic polymorphisms did not support the hypothesis of ecological speciation: the most ecologically different forms were morphologically most similar, while the only genetically differentiated morph was the least ecologically specialized. The low levels of genetic differentiation and the congruence between 0 and φ estimates altogether suggest a recent (most likely postglacial) process of divergence and/or high gene flow among morphs A, C, and D, whereas higher φ estimates for comparison involving morph B suggest that this morph may be derived from another colonizing lineage exchanging little genes with the other morphs.

Under such circumstances, female fitness will be negatively frequency dependent and hermaphrodite fitness will be positively frequency dependent. Given local seed dispersal, a nonrandom clumped distribution of the genders is expected in gynodioecious populations due to the heritability of gender in gynodioecious species. If gender fitness is frequency dependent, such structure should favor hermaphrodites and select against females. To test this hypothesis, I quantified the distribution of the genders in terms of nearest neighbors and neighborhood sex ratio in two populations of gynodioecious Sidalcea malviflora malviflora.

(1) Some studies measure change over time within a population (allochronic) and others measure the difference between two populations that had a common ancestor in the past (synchronic). Allochronic studies can be used to estimate rates of 'evolution,' whereas synchronic studies more appropriately estimate rates of 'divergence.' Rates of divergence may range from a small fraction to many times the actual evolutionary rates in the component populations. (2) Some studies measure change using individuals captured from the wild, whereas others measure differences after rearing in a common environment. The first type of study can be used to specify 'phenotypic' rates and the later 'genetic' rates. (3) The most commonly used evolutionary rate metric, the darwin, has a number of theoretical shortcomings. Studies of microevolution would benefit from specifying rates in standard deviations per generation, the haldane. (4) Evolutionary rates are typically specified without an indication of their precision. Readily available methods for specifying confidence intervals and statistical significance (regression, bootstrapping, randomization) should be implemented. (5) Microevolutionists should strive to accumulate time series, which can reveal temporal shifts in the rate of evolution and can be used to identify evolutionary patterns. (6) Evolutionary rates provide a convenient way to compare the tempo of evolution across studies, traits, taxa, and time scales, but such comparisons are subject to varying degrees of confidence. Comparisons across different time scales are particularly tenuous. (7) A number of multivariate rate measures exist, but considerable theoretical development is required before their utility can be determined.

The association between survival and mean d2 differed between males and females. As predicted, outbred female calves (high mean d2) survived better than those that were inbred (low mean d2).

If inbreeding load is due largely to deleterious alleles of large effect, such as recessive lethals or steriles, then most of it is expected to be purged during brief periods of inbreeding. In contrast, if inbreeding depression is due to the cumulative effects of many deleterious alleles of small effect, then it will be maintained in the face of periodic inbreeding. Whether or not inbreeding depression can be purged with inbreeding in the short term has important implications for the evolution of mating systems and the probability that a small population will go extinct. In this paper I evaluate the extent to which the tremendous inbreeding load in a primarily outcrossing population of the wildflower, Mimulus guttatus, is due to alleles of large effect. To do this, I first constructed a large outbred 'ancestral' population by randomly mating plants collected as seeds from a natural population. From this population I formed 1200 lines that were maintained by self-fertilization and single seedling descent: after five generations of selfing, 335 lines had survived the inbreeding process. Selection during the line formation is expected to have largely purged alleles of large effect from the collection of highly inbred lines. Because alleles with minor effects on fitness should have been effectively neutral, the inbreeding depression due to this class of genes should have been unchanged. The inbred lines were intercrossed to form a large, outcrossed 'purged' population. Finally, I estimated the fitness of outbred and selfed progeny from the ancestral and purged populations to determine the contribution of major deleterious alleles on inbreeding depression. I found that although the average fitness of the outcrossed progeny nearly doubled following purging, the limited decline in inbreeding depression and limited increase in inbred fitness indicates that alleles of large effect are not the principle cause of inbreeding depression in this population. In aggregate, the data suggest that lethals and steriles make a minority contribution to inbreeding depression and that the increased outbred fitness is due primarily to adaptation to greenhouse conditions.",Deleterious mutations | Genetic load | Inbreeding depression | Mimulus | Outcrossing | Self-fertilization,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We tested three predictions of this hypothesis for the evolutionary divergence of rock ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus) during the Wisconsin glaciation of the late Pleistocene. To do this, we examined subspecies distributions, population genetic structure, and phylogenetic relationships in 26 populations across North America and the Bering Sea region. First, we analyzed sequence variation in the mitochondrial control region, in a nuclear intron (Gapdh), and in an internal transcribed spacer (ITS1). Control region sequences of 154 rock ptarmigan revealed strong population and phylogeographic structure. Variation in intron sequences of 114 rock ptarmigan also revealed significant population structure compatible with results for the control region. Rock ptarmigan were invariant for ITS1. Second, we show that five known Nearctic refugia and an Icelandic refugium are concordant with the current distribution of morphologically distinct subspecies; five of these six refugia are geographically concordant with the distribution of closely related control region haplotypes. Third, our estimates of the time since phylogenetic lineages diverged predated the last glacial maximum for all but two lineages. In addition, all lines of evidence suggest that two unknown refugia in the Bering Sea region supported rock ptarmigan during the Wisconsin glaciation. Overall, our results are most consistent with the hypothesis that isolated populations of rock ptarmigan diverged in multiple refugia during the Wisconsin and that geographic variation reflects patterns of recolonization of the Nearctic after the ice receded.

Several different processes could give rise to this effect, including diversifying selection in a new adaptive zone (or zones) and a reduced rate of extinction due to enhanced competitive abilities. I tested the generality of the hypothesis that imaging eyes increase net speciation by comparing extant species numbers of 12 groups that have such eyes (as categorized by Land and Fernald 1992) with those of their cladistic sister groups that lack such organs. Even assuming the published hypotheses of phylogenetic relationships that most favor increased net speciation of visual groups, these comparisons show no significant association between imaging eyes and species richness. Increased activity, as indicated by published accounts of locomotory speed, is significantly associated with the evolution of image-forming eyes. This suggests that a large 'visual adaptive zone' might be characterized by relatively high activity. However, when diversity comparisons are limited to eight cases in which the evolution of imaging eyes is associated with increased activity, there is still no significant association between such eyes and species richness. The fossil record indicates that the only visual groups that have undergone major evolutionary radiations evolved imaging eyes early in the history of metazoans (before the Silurian). The radiations of these early groups may have largely filled up niches for visual animals and thus prevented the subsequent proliferation of other groups with image-forming eyes. Alternatively, it may be that image-forming eyes have no exceptional effect on diversification or that their effects are obscured by other factors in the long run.",Adaptive radiation | Adaptive zone | Contingency | Diversification | Eyes | Key innovation | Sister-group tests,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Loss of use of the spermathecae has evolved at least 13 times; evolutionary regain of spermathecal function has rarely if ever occurred. Loss of use of the seminal receptacle has likely occurred only once; in this case, all descendant species possess unusually elaborate spermathecae. Data further indicate that the seminal receptacle is the primary sperm-storage organ in Drosophila. This organ exhibits a pattern of strong correlated evolution with the length of sperm. The evolution of multiple kinds of female sperm-storage organs and the rapidly divergent and correlated evolution of sperm and female reproductive tract morphology are discussed.",Cryptic female choice | Reproduction | Sexual selection | Sperm | Sperm competition | Spermatheca | Vestigial,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We present a method for measuring phenotypic selection that combines the potential for both environmental variation and phenotypic plasticity. The method uses path analysis and a measure of selection that is analogous to selection on breeding values. For individuals growing in alternative environments, paths are created that represent potential changes in the environment. The probabilities for these changes are then multiplied by the path coefficients to calculate selection coefficients. Selection on plasticity is measured as the difference in selection within each environment. We illustrate these methods using data on selection in an experimental population of Arabidopsis thaliana. Individuals from 36 families were grown in one of four environments, a factorial combination of shaded/open and early/late shading. For final height of the inflorescence, there was positive selection in both the open and shaded environments and negative selection on plasticity of height. For bolting time, there was also positive selection in both environments, but no selection on plasticity. We show how to use this information to examine how selection would change with changes in environmental frequencies and their transition probabilities. These methods can be expanded to encompass continuous traits and continuous environments as well as other complexities of natural selection.",Arabidopsis thaliana | Flowering | Natural selection | Path analysis | Phenotypic plasticity | Reaction norm,NA,NA,NA,NA

Natural selection is endogenous if hybrid genotypes are at a disadvantage relative to parental species independent of environment. Alternatively, relative fitness can vary in response to environmental variation (exogenous selection), and hybrid genotypes can possess fitness values equal to or greater than that of parental species. I investigated the nature of natural selection in a leopard frog hybrid system by rearing larvae of hybrid and parental genotypes between Rana blairi and R. sphenocephala in 1000-L outdoor experimental ponds. Three hybrid (F1, backcross1 [B1], backcross2 [B2]) and two parental (R. blairi [BB] and R. sphenocephala [SS]) larval genotypes were produced by artificial fertilizations using adult frogs from a natural population in central Missouri. Resultant larvae were reared in single-genotype populations and two-way mixtures at equal total numbers from hatching to metamorphosis. In single-genotype ponds, F1 hybrid larvae had highest survival and BB were largest at metamorphosis. When F1 and SS larvae were mixed together, F1 hybrids had reduced survival and both F1 and SS larvae metamorphosed at larger body masses than when reared separately. When mixed, both B1 and SS larvae had shorter larval period lengths than when reared alone. Higher proportion of B1 metamorphs were produced when larvae were mixed with either parental species than when reared alone. Larval fitness components as measured by survival, body mass at metamorphosis, proportion of survivors metamorphosing, and larval period length for B2 hybrid and BB larvae were similar in single-genotype populations and mixtures. Comparison of composite fitness component estimates indicated hybrid genotypes possess equivalent or higher larval fitness relative to both parental species for the life-history fitness components measured. Despite reduced survival of F1 hybrids in mixtures, backcross-generation hybrid genotypes demonstrated high levels of larval growth, survival, and metamorphosis in mixtures with parental species. Consequently, this study suggests natural hybridization and subsequent backcrossing between R. blairi and R. sphenocephala can produce novel and relatively fit hybrid genotypes capable of successful existence with parental species larvae. Thus, the evolutionary fate of hybrid and parental genotypes in this system may be influenced by exogenous selection mediated by genotypic composition of larval assemblages.",Amphibian | Endogenous selection | Exogenous selection | Fitness components | Hybridization | Larvae | Rana,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we investigated the adaptive significance of prior selfing in the polymorphic annual plant Arenaria uniflora (Caryophyllaceae), in which selfer populations occur only in areas of range overlap with congener A. glabra. To examine the hypothesis that secondary contact between the two species contributed to the evolution and maintenance of selfing, we used field competition experiments and controlled hand-pollinations to measure the female fitness consequences of pollinator-mediated interspecific interactions. Uniformly high fruit set by selfers in the naturally pollinated field arrays confirmed the reproductive assurance value of selfing, whereas substantial reductions in outcrosser fruit set (15%) and total seed production (20-35%) in the presence of A. glabra demonstrated that pollinator-mediated interactions can provide strong selection for self-pollination. Heterospecific pollen transfer, rather than competition for pollinator service, appears to be the primary mechanism of pollinator-mediated competition in Arenaria. Premating barriers to hybridization between outcrossers and A. glabra are extremely weak. The production of a few inviable hybrid seeds after heterospecific pollination and intermediate seed set after mixed pollinations indicates that A. glabra pollen can usurp A. uniflora ovules. Thus, any visit to A. uniflora by shared pollinators carries-a potential female fitness cost. Moreover, patterns of fruit set and seed set in the competition arrays relative to controls were consistent with the receipt of mixed pollen loads, rather than a lack of pollinator visits. Competition through pollen transfer favors preemptive self-pollination and may be responsible for the evolution of a highly reduced floral morphology in A. uniflora selfers as well as their current geographical distribution.",Arenaria | Hybridization | Mating system evolution | Reproductive character displacement | Self-pollination,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Backcross progeny were planted in the sites native to each population for two years and we quantified germination, survivorship, fruit production, vegetative biomass, and cumulative fitness. We found limited evidence for the contribution of either cytoplasmic or nuclear genes to local adaptation.

In Illinois local cytoplasm marginally enhanced fitness, whereas Maryland nuclear genes outperformed local nuclear genes. Interactions between cytoplasmic and nuclear genes influenced seed weight, vegetative biomass, and fitness and therefore may affect evolution of these characters. Genetic effects were stronger acting through seed size than directly on characters.

For its two sister species, C. punctatofasciatus and C. pelewensis, color pattern change has not resulted in assortative mating (based on laboratory pairing experiments and field observations) or in significant mtDNA or allozyme differentiation. In a contact zone on reefs in the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, hybridization between the two forms has nearly homogenized color pattern differences. Outside these areas, however, color pattern remains distinct. Genetic variation is homogeneous over a much larger geographic scale. Sequence variation in the tRNA-proline end of the mitochondrial control region and allozyme variation was distributed widely within C. punctatofasciatus and C. pelewensis, which suggests few constraints to mitochondrial or nuclear gene flow across the color pattern boundary. These contrasting patterns strongly suggest that selection is maintaining color pattern differences in allopatry in the face of potentially homogenizing levels of gene flow.

If the relative fitness of genotypes is dependent on habitat type, the Mpi polymorphism may be actively maintained by a Levene model of balancing selection (Levene 1953). Because barnacle larvae are produced in abundance each year and spend five to eight weeks dispersing in the water column, there is little opportunity for the accumulation of adaptive divergence over the environmental grain size relevant in intertidal habitats. The Mpi polymorphism may be an important component of a suite of traits involved in the adaptation of barnacles to heterogeneous environments. Due to the relatively high concentration of mannose in a variety of algal groups, the metabolism of mannose may substantially affect individual performance and fitness in this and other species that feed on algae and phytoplankton.

Unfortunately, the effective size of a hierarchically structured population is not, in general, equal to the sum of its parts. In particular, the inbreeding structure has a major influence on N(e). Here I link N(e) to Wright's hierarchical measures of inbreeding, M(IS) and F(ST), for an island-structured population (or metapopulation) of size N(T). The influence of F(ST) depends strongly on the degree to which island productivity is regulated. In the absence of local regulation (the interdemic model), interdemic genetic drift reduces N(E). When such drift is combined with local inbreeding under otherwise ideal conditions, the effects of F(IS) and F(ST) are identical: increasing inbreeding either within or between islands reduces N(e), with N(e) = N(T)/[(1 + F(IS))(1 + F(ST)) - 2F(IS)F(ST)]. However, if islands are all equally productive because of local density regulation (the traditional island model), then N(e) = N(T)/[(1 + F(IS))(1 F(ST))] and the effect of F(ST) is reversed. Under the interdemic model, random variation in the habitat quality (and hence productivity) of islands act to markedly decrease N(e). This variation has no effect under the island model because, by definition, all islands are equally productive. Even when no permanent island structure exists, spatial differences in habitat quality can significantly increase the overall variance in reproductive success of both males and females and hence lower N(e). Each of these basic results holds when other nonideal factors are added to the model. These factors, deviations from a 1:1 sex ratio, greater than Poisson variance in female reproductive success, and variation in male mating success due to polygynous mating systems, all act to lower N(e). The effects of male and female variance on N(e) have important differences because only females affect island productivity. Finally, it is noted that to use these relationships, F(IS) and F(ST) must be estimated according to Wright's definition (and corrected to have a zero expectation under the null model).

Here, we show a genetic correlation between a life-history trait (developmental period) and a behavioral trait (time of mating) that causes significant premating isolation in the melon fly, Bactrocera cucurbitae (Diptera: Tephritidae). Fly lines selected for short and long developmental periods differ in their preferred times of mating during the evening. This difference translates into significant prezygotic isolation, as measured by mate choice tests. If the time of mating between two populations differed more than one hour, the isolation index was significantly higher than zero. These indicate that premating isolation can be established if the developmental period is divergently selected for.

I first show a genetic influence on egg volume by dam-offspring regression. The existence of maternal effects is shown by comparing resemblances between average egg volumes of offspring to those of their paternal and maternal grandmothers. Path analysis shows that when controlling for the influence of maternal egg volume, the average volume of eggs produced in a lifetime is positively related to the body condition of a female measured while she is still at the nest. Thus, body condition at fledgling affects egg volume beyond the ability of maternal egg volume to predict offspring egg volume. Although there may be a persistent maternal effect of egg volume on itself or linked to a property correlated with egg volume, the maternal performance trait involved remains unknown, except for maternal egg volume itself. Given the effects that egg volume may have on reproductive success, which are partly determined prior to leaving the nest, maternal effects may have important consequences for lifetime fitness of offspring.",Condition | Egg size | Ficedula hypoleuca | Heritability | Life-history traits | Maternal effects | Ontogeny,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

As a result of the nonlinearity of the model, different genotypes differed in their sensitivity to developmental noise, even though the noise is completely random and independent of the genotype. The heritable component of FA can thus be understood as genetically modulated expression of variation that is itself entirely nongenetic. The loci responsible for this genetic variation of FA are the same that affect the left/right mean of the trait, showing that genetic variation for FA does not require genes that specifically control FA. Furthermore, the model offers alternative explanations for phenomena widely discussed in the literature on FA, for instance, the correlations between FA and heterozygosity and between FA and trait size.

Stochastic simulations of truncation selection demonstrate the accuracy of the SLM in predicting changes in the mean and variance of a quantitative trait over the full range of selfing rates. They also illustrate how complex interactions between selection and mating system determine the population distribution of inbreeding coefficients and also the amount of linkage disequilibrium. Changes in the genetic variance due to linkage disequilibria, which are commonly referred to as the 'Bulmer effect,' are greatly magnified by selfing.

Rather, both males and females appeared to exhibit choice on the basis of the size of potential mates, with males preferring females with long bodies and females preferring heavy males. Possible benefits from choice of large mates are discussed. The initial mating strikes (in which the male leaps onto the back of the female) did not appear to be targeted according to female morphology, and their frequency did not vary according to male morphology.

One potentially common mechanism by which females manipulate the phenotype of their progeny is egg size plasticity, in which females vary egg size in response to environmental cues. We describe an experiment in which we quantify genetic variation in egg size and egg size plasticity in a seed beetle, Stator limbatus, and measure the genetic constraints on the evolution of egg size plasticity, quantified as the genetic correlation between the size of eggs laid across host plants. We found that genetic variation is present within populations for the size of eggs laid on seeds of two host plants (Acacia greggii and Cercidium floridum; h2 ranged between 0.217 and 0.908), and that the heritability of egg size differed between populations and hosts (higher on A. greggii than on C. floridum). We also found that the evolution of egg size plasticity (the maternal effect) is in part constrained by a high genetic correlation across host plants (r(G) > 0.6). However, the cross-environment genetic correlation is less than 1.0, which indicates that the size of eggs laid on these two hosts can diverge in response to natural selection and that egg size plasticity is thus capable of evolving in response to natural selection.",Acacia greggii | Cercidium floridum | Genetic correlation | Heritability | Parental investment | Phenotypic plasticity | Stator limbatus,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We investigated this question by exposing experimental populations of the bacterium Escherichia coli to lethally high temperatures. We asked: (1) whether we could obtain thermotolerant mutants with an extended upper thermal limit by this selective screen; (2) whether the propensity to obtain thermotolerant mutants depended on the prior selective history of the progenitor genotypes; and (3) how the fitness properties of these mutants compared to those of their progenitors within the ancestral thermal niche. Specifically, we subjected 15 independent populations founded from each of six progenitors to 44°C; all of the progenitors had upper thermal limits between about 40°C and 42°C. Two of the progenitors were from populations that had previously adapted to 32°C, two were from populations adapted to 37°C, and two were from populations adapted to 41-42°C. All 90 populations were screened for mutants that could survive and grow at 44°C. We obtained three thermotolerant mutants, all derived from progenitors previously adapted to 41-42°C. In an earlier study, we serendipitously found one other thermotolerant mutant derived from a population that had previously adapted to 32°C. Thus, prior selection at an elevated but nonlethal temperature may predispose organisms to evolve more extreme thermotolerance, but this is not an absolute requirement. It is evidently possible to obtain mutants that tolerate more extreme temperatures, so why did they not become prevalent during prior selection at 41-42°C, near the upper limit of the thermal niche? To address this question, we measured the fitness of the thermotolerant mutants at high temperatures just within the ancestral niche. None of the four thermotolerant mutants had an advantage relative to their progenitor even very near the upper limit of the thermal niche; in fact, all of the mutants showed a noticeable loss of fitness around 41°C. Thus, the genetic adaptations that improve competitive fitness at high but nonlethal temperatures are distinct from those that permit tolerance of otherwise lethal temperatures.",Adaptation | Bacteria | Escherichia coli | Fitness | Mutation | Niche | Temperature | Thermotolerance,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

The average level of genetic subdivision for quantitative traits is essentially the same as that for nuclear markers, which superficially suggests that the life-history characters are diverging at the neutral rate. However, the existence of a strong correlation between the levels of population subdivision and broadsense heritabilities of individual traits argues against this interpretation, suggesting instead that the among-population divergence of some quantitative traits (most notably body size) is being driven by local adaptation to different environments. The fact that the mean phenotypes of the individual populations are also strongly correlated with local levels of homozygosity indicates that variation in local inbreeding plays a role in population differentiation. Rather than being a passive consequence of local founder effects, levels of homozygosity may be selected for directly for their effects on the phenotype (adaptive inbreeding depression). There is no relationship between the levels of variation within populations for molecular markers and quantitative characters, and this is explained by the fact that the average standing genetic variation for life-history characters in this species is equivalent to only 33 generations of variation generated by mutation.",Daphnia pulex | Genetic architecture | Life-history evolution | Microsatellite loci | Mitochondrial DNA | Quantitative genetics,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

This is in contrast to other pines, which often have three to five or more alleles at some loci and in which the distribution of allele frequencies is U-shaped, most alleles being present at frequencies less than 10% or greater than 90%. A population with only two alleles per locus and at intermediate frequencies could occur if the population had been reduced to an extreme bottleneck and then expanded rapidly before random drift modified allele frequencies.

The presence of disequilibrium is in agreement with an origin from an extreme bottleneck, perhaps even a single seed. Furthermore, it demands that the event be relatively recent.

Many factors have been proposed and discussed, but assessments of traits' salience to eusocial evolution have heretofore not been joined to phylogenetics. In the present analysis, cladograms of superfamilies and families of Hymenoptera and of the family Vespidae are used to ordinate the appearance of traits that play roles in vespid eusociality. Proximity of traits' first appearance to the origin of eusocial Vespidae is taken as one measure of traits' salience to vespid eusocial evolution. Traits that subtend only eusocial taxa and that are uniquely associated with eusociality have foundations in more general traits that subtend more inclusive taxa. No single trait is uniquely causative of vespid eusocial evolution. High-salience traits that closely subtend vespid eusociality include nesting, oviposition into an empty nest cell, progressive provisioning of larvae, adult nourishment during larval provision malaxation, and inequitable food distribution among nestmates. The threshold characteristic of Polistes-grade eusociality is life-long alloparental brood care by first female offspring who remain, uninseminated, at their natal nest. Traits directly associated with occurrence of such workers are larva-adult trophallaxis, which can foster relatively low larval nourishment early in a colony cycle, and protogyny and direct larval development, which combine to yield restricted mating opportunities for female offspring that are the first to emerge in the colony cycle.

Gametes of the three species are compatible despite estimated divergence times of 1-3 M.Y.B.P.; in several other marine invertebrates, divergence times of the same magnitude are associated with asymmetric or complete gamete incompatibility.

This was also confirmed by a neighbor-joining dendrogram, which showed a clear clustering of samples from individual rivers that covered a time span of up to 76 years. These results suggest that salmon populations evolve as semi-independent units connected by modest amounts of gene flow. Additionally, a clear association between geographic and genetic distance was found. This relationship has otherwise been difficult to establish in several recent studies. The discrepancy may be due tO impact of human activities on the genetic structure of present populations, whereas old samples represent populations in a more unaffected state.

The motivation for the study was to understand what factors may be influencing genetic connectedness among newly colonized populations within a regional metapopulation. By using experimental populations composed of genotypes homozygous at a diagnostic locus, it was possible to identify explicitly pollen movement into a focal patch as a function of flower number and distance to the nearest neighboring patch. Overall, the mean immigration rate (measured as the fraction of seeds sired by males outside the focal patch) at 20 m was just over 47%, whereas at 80 m immigration rates were less than 6%. In addition, by knowing the context in which each of these gene-flow events occurred, it was possible to understand some of the factors that influenced the exchange of genes. Both the number of flowers in the focal population (target) and in the neighboring populations (source) had a significant effect on the frequency of gene flow. Our experimental data also demonstrate that factors that influence gene flow at one spatial scale may not act in the same way at another. Specifically, the influence of target size and the relative size of the target and source patches on rates of gene flow depended on whether the patches were separated by 20 m or 80 m.

Male relative paternity success was repeatable across replicate females, showing that males differ consistently in their ability to achieve fertilizations. By analyzing shape variation in male genital morphology, we were able to demonstrate that the shape of male intromittent genitalia was related to relative paternity success. This is the first direct experimental support for the suggestion that male genitalia evolve by postmating sexual selection. A detailed analysis revealed that different components of male genitalia had different effects, some affecting male ability to achieve sperm precedence and others affecting male ability to avoid sperm precedence by subsequent males. Further, the effects of the shape of the male genitalia on paternity success was in part dependent on female morphology, suggesting that selection on male genitalia will depend on the frequency distribution of female phenotypes.

The species form a distinctive zone of parapatric distribution in the Near East by differing in their ecogeographical regimes. Senecio vernalis mainly thrives in the mesic Mediterranean life zone of Israel, whereas S. glaucus inhabits either xeric maritime or arid (semi-) desert sites. Significant differences in allozymic population subdivision among S. vernalis (θ(n) = 0.04; Nm(n) = 5.85) and S. glaucus (θ(n) = 0.12; Nm(n) = 1.85) largely resulted from topogeographical substructuring present within the latter species. Because of the similarity of within-region estimates of population structure for S. glaucus with those measured among populations of S. vernalis, it appears unlikely that ecological 'aridity' factors per se are important in influencing levels of population differentiation in these species. Based on hierarchical F-statistics and tests of isolation by distance, we further conclude that geographical topologies influence the level and mode of nuclear gene flow (via pollen and/or seed) among and within subsets of S. glaucus populations, although without providing a complete barrier to interregional dispersal (dNm(reg) = 2.16) and without promoting allopatric differentiation via drift. The allozymic data further suggested that S. vernalis and S. glaucus form a zone of secondary contact in the Near East, accompanied by an almost complete interspecific barrier to nuclear gene flow (dnNm(sp) = 0.253). However, to account for the considerable sharing of cpDNA haplotypes, both at the intra- and interspecific level, it is necessary to invoke either (1) selection acting against alien nuclear but not cytoplasmic DNA; or (2) the sporadic immigration of cpDNA via seed with large homogenizing effects on cytoplasmic population structure over time.",Allozymes | Aridity | Chloroplast DNA | Gene flow | Hybridization | Population structure | Senecio,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

This includes being one of only 20 pine species worldwide with wingless, bird-dispersed seeds; having the reputed capacity to reproduce vegetatively; and forming distinct growth morphologies at different elevations in this part of its natural range. Genetic differentiation, as measured with 21 allozyme loci, among the three studied watersheds is virtually negligible (F(ST) = 0.004). This is a surprising result because the upper-elevation sites vary somewhat in slope aspect; thus, aspect was confounded with watershed effect. Differentiation between the upper-elevation prostrate krummholz thickets and lower-elevation upright tree clump growth forms is modest (F(ST) = 0.051). Much stronger differentiation was measured among the individual thickets and clumps within their sample sites (F(ST) = 0.334). Within krummholz thickets, multiple individuals are present and genetic relationships often resemble half- to full-sibling family structure (mean r = 0.320). Canonical trend surface analysis in two intensively sampled thickets indicates greatest genotypic variation in the direction of the prevailing wind. At lower elevations, most (72%) of the tree clumps contained more than one genotype; the remaining clumps are probably multistemmed trees. Within tree clumps, family relationships are closer than those for krummholz thickets - commonly full-sibling to selfed structure (mean r = 0.597). Genetic structure is apparently profoundly influenced by the seed-caching behavior of Clark's nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana Wilson).

Therefore, given ancestral (diurnal) lizard physiology, nocturnality causes a substantial thermal handicap in locomotor performance. In prior studies, we hypothesized that a low minimum cost of locomotion (C(min)) in geckos was an adaptation that increased locomotor endurance capacity at low, nocturnal temperatures. However, C(min) is only part of an integrated system that, in conjunction with the maximum rate of oxygen consumption, sets the maximum speed that can be sustained aerobically (termed the maximum aerobic speed or MAS). We conducted the first phylogenetic analysis of MAS and V̇(O2max) in lizards and found that the greatest changes in MAS, C(min) and V̇(O2max) (at activity temperatures) in the evolutionary history of lizards all coincided with the evolution of nocturnality in geckos. Geckos active at 15-25°C did not become optimized for nocturnal temperatures, or fully offset the thermal effects of nocturnality by evolving maximal rates of oxygen consumption comparable to diurnal lizards active at 35°C. Geckos did evolve MAS twice that of diurnal lizards running at low temperatures by evolving a remarkably low C(min). Allometric analysis and phylogenetically independent contrasts of V̇(O2max), C(min), and MAS indicate a 72% evolutionary decrease in V̇(O2max) (at activity temperatures) and a 50% evolutionary decrease in C(min) concordant with the evolution of nocturnality in geckos. Experimental measurements show that decreased C(min) in six species of gecko increased MAS by 50-120% compared to diurnal lizards at low temperatures. Thus, geckos sufficiently overcame the near paralyzing effects of nocturnal temperatures, but only offset about 50% of the decrease in MAS resulting from the low maximum rate of oxygen consumption. Although the nocturnal environment remains severely suboptimal, the evolution of a low cost of locomotion in the ancestor of geckos was highly adaptive for nocturnality. We also present a generalized approach to ecophysiological evolution that integrates phylogeny with the causal relationships among environment, physiology, and performance capacity. With respect to a clade, two hypotheses are central to our integrative approach: (1) a change of an environmental variable (e.g., temperature) causes a performance handicap; and (2) evolution of a physiological variable (e.g., minimum cost of locomotion [C(min)]) increases performance in the derived environment. To test the hypothesis that evolution of a physiological variable is adaptive in nature, we suggest determining if individuals in nature perform at levels exceeding the performance capacity of their hypothetical ancestors and if this additional performance capacity is due to the evolution of the physiological variable in question.",Energetics | Exercise | Integrative biology | Lizard | Locomotion | Optimality | Physiology,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

In contrast to hybridization providing greater developmental stability through heterozygosity, these results suggest that complex, nonadditive interactions provided developmental stability and that developmental instability increased when coadapted gene complexes were disrupted through hybridization.

The driving force for this dynamic system is apparently the predominance of successful speciation involving relatively large populations with higher genetic diversity.

We have experimentally tested how variation in the time to transmission (early or late after infection) and exposure to adverse conditions outside the host (immediate or delayed contact with new host) interact to determine the success of the infection in the next host, using the trypanosome Crithidia bombi infecting its bumblebee host, Bombus terrestris. These two experimentally manageable steps mimic the processes of within- and among-host selection for the parasite. We found that early transmission led to higher infection success in the next host as did immediate contact with the new host. However, there was no interaction between the two parameters as would be expected if early-transmitted variants, resulting from rapid multiplication within the host, would be less adapted to the conditions encountered during the between-host transfer or infection of the next host. Furthermore, typing the genetic variability of the parasites with microsatellites showed that the four different transmission routes of our experiment selected for different degrees of allelic diversity of the infecting parasite populations. The results support the idea that variation in the transmission process selects for different genotypic variants of the parasite. At the same time, the relationship of allelic diversity with infection intensity suggested that the coinfection model of May and Nowak (1995) may be appropriate, where each parasite is able to infect and multiply independent of others within the same host.",Bombus terrestris | Crithidia bombi | Horizontal transmission | Host genotype | Parasite fitness | Trypanosomatidae,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we examine the patterns and processes of shape change in a model system - the gastropod radula. This system is a simple one having only two processes: initial secretion and postsecretional movement of teeth. However, it produces a tremendous amount of shape variability and fusion patterns. To determine both pattern and mechanism of shape change in an evolutionary context, we use three complementary approaches and datasets. First, we use a phylogenetic hypothesis to determine the polarity of developmental events. Second, we perform a morphometric analysis of shape change using relative warp analysis that allows us to locate and compare the direction and magnitude of ontogenetic and phylogenetic shape divergence. These comparisons are the basis for testing hypotheses of heterochrony and heterotopy, and we show how our results do not conform to expectations of pure heterochrony. The rejection of heterochrony as a hypothesis is based on empirically demonstrating (1) initial shape differs in each taxon; (2) a single dimension of shape variability does not simultaneously describe ontogenetic and evolutionary shape changes; and (3) a significantly different shape and size covariance between taxa. This rejection is probably based on spatial changes in initial conditions and not spatial changes caused by the process itself. Finally, we construct a mechanistic model that explains how shape change happens based on the sequence of events during ontogeny. By using the parameters in the model as characters in the phylogenetic dataset, we show that different parts of the system have arisen at different times and become co-opted into the process. By integrating our analyses together we show that spatial process parameters can be responsible for our nonspatial patterns and that different ontogenetic processes can create similar end morphologies.",Generative mechanisms | Heterochrony | Heterotopy | Homology | Mollusca | Ontogenetic trajectory | Patellogastropoda | Relative warps analysis,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

In the absence of herbivores, plants with glandular trichomes (sticky) produced 45% fewer viable seeds than plants with nonglandular trichomes (velvety). Although both plant types flowered with similar frequency, sticky plants matured fewer capsules and fewer of their seeds germinated. The fitness difference between the types in herbivore-free conditions was not mitigated by the addition of water, a potentially limiting resource for sticky plants. Under herbivore pressure, there was no significant fitness difference between the types, although the fitness of velvety plants was still higher than that of sticky plants. This occurred even though velvety plants sustained more herbivore damage than sticky plants and were more likely to be attacked by most herbivore species present. The fitness difference between the plant types was especially reduced when herbivore-attacked plants were watered, which indicates that sticky plants may have higher tolerance for damage than velvety plants when supplied with a potentially limiting resource. Yet, the maintenance of a fitness deficit (albeit small and nonsignificant) for sticky plants when attacked by herbivores indicates no net benefit associated with the production of glandular trichomes in this first year of our study.

Crossing experiments show that there is Y-linked, and probably autosomal, variation for suppression of drive. Y-linked suppressors of X-chromosome drive have now been described in several species of Diptera. I develop a simple model for the maintenance of Y-chromosome polymorphism in species polymorphic for X-linked meiotic drive. One interesting feature of this model is that, if there is a stable Y-chromosome polymorphism, then the equilibrium frequency of the standard and sex-ratio X chromosomes is determined solely by Y-chromosome parameters, not by the fitness effects of the different X chromosomes on their carriers.

Here, we test for host-plant dependent selection on larvae of apple (Malus pumila L.)- and hawthorn (Crataegus mollis L. spp.)-infesting races of Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh). Samples of larvae were reared in the field and under protective conditions in a garage. Our rationale was that the garage should slow rates of fruit rot relative to the field, relaxing selection pressures associated with declining fruit quality. Four findings emerged from the study. (1) Larvae suffered higher mortality in fruits in the field than the garage. (2) The increase in mortality was greater for larvae in haws. (3) Larvae possessing the alleles Me 100, Acon-2 95, and Mpi 37, three allozymes displaying host-related differentiation in R. pomonella that map to linkage group II in the fly, left fruits earlier than other genotypes. (4) Allele frequencies for Me 100, Acon-2 95, and Mpi 37 were significantly higher in both apple and haw larvae surviving the field versus the garage treatment. Our results suggested that field conditions favored larvae that rapidly developed and left rotting fruits. Since these individuals tended to possess the alleles Me 100, Acon-2 95, and Mpi 37, frequencies of these allozymes were higher in the field. Selection on larvae was directional for Me 100, Acon-2 95, and Mpi 37 (or linked genes) in both host races. We previously showed that these same alleles can be disfavored in the pupal stage, especially in the apple race, where they correlate with premature diapause termination. Fitness trade-offs in Rhagoletis may therefore be due as much to differences in the relative strengths of directional selection pressures acting on different life stages as to disruptive selection affecting any one particular stage.

We examined how the interaction of fluctuating selection, and emergence from long-term diapause, caused ongoing microevolutionary change over eight years in an important life-history trait (diapause timing) in the freshwater calanoid copepod Diaptomus sanguineus. Emergence from long-term diapause releases into the population lineages that did not experience the most recent bout of selection, thereby promoting the maintenance of the heritable trait variation that allows continual selection response. A mechanistic selection model was created on the basis of field and laboratory studies to predict how interannual variations in predation intensity generate year-to-year changes in mean diapause timing and in net reproductive success for alternate trait values. The predicted selection response and the estimated effect of emergence from diapause were both significantly correlated with observed changes in trait mean. A linear model combining selection response and emergence from diapause explained 59% of the variance in year-to-year changes in trait mean. According to this model, strong selection occurred in about half of the years studied, and the average annual contributions to changes in trait mean from selection and emergence were roughly equal. Thus, both fluctuating natural selection and emergence from prolonged diapause affect the expression of diapause timing by D. sanguineus.

This model predicts that inbreeding depression should be limited in regularly inbreeding populations because the deleterious alleles that cause inbreeding depression (i.e., the genetic load) should be purged by regularly exposing these alleles to natural selection. We indirectly test the partial dominance model using four highly inbred populations of an androdioecious crustacean, the clam shrimp Eulimnadia texana. These shrimp are comprised of males and hermaphrodites, the latter capable of either self-fertilizing or mating with a male (i.e., outcrossing between hermaphrodites is impossible). Hermaphrodites are further subdivided into monogenics (produced via self-fertilization) and amphigenics (produced via self-fertilization or outcrossing). Electrophoretic evidence suggests significant differences in heterozygosity among populations, but that selfing rates were not statistically different (average s = 0.67). Additional electrophoretic analyses reveal that three previously described sex-linked loci (Fum, Idh-1, and Idh-2) are all tightly linked to each other, with crossing over on the order of 1% per generation. Although selfing rates are clearly high, we present evidence that early inbreeding depression (hatching rates, juvenile survival, and age at sexual maturity) exists in all four populations. For all of these factors, inbreeding depression was inferred by the positive correlation of multilocus heterozygosity and fitness. Cumulative inbreeding depression (δ) is between 0.41 and 0.47 across all populations, which appears to be too low to limit the effects of purging via identity disequilibrium. Instead, we suggest that the maintenance of inbreeding depression in these populations is due to the observed linkage group, which we suggest contains a large number of genes including many related to fitness. Segregation of such a large linkage group would explain our observations of the predominance of amphigenic hermaphrodites in our field samples and of survival differences between monogenics and amphigenics within selfed clutches.

Sequential adaptive radiations occurred in different islands of the Bonin Islands and species occupying arboreal, semiarboreal, and terrestrial habitat arose independently in each island. Because of a close relationship between shell morphology and life habitat, independent evolution of the same life habitat in different islands created species possessing the same shell morphology in different islands and lineages.

The maximum level of sequence divergence at 16S and 12S ribosomal RNA sequence within Mandarina are 18.7% and 17.7%, respectively, and this suggests that evolution of mtDNA of Mandarina is extremely rapid, more than 20 times faster than the standard rate in other animals.

Between ages 6 and 12, the relative elongation rate (dm · dm-1 · yr-1) of Douglas-fir was significantly greater in the selfs than in the outcrosses. The response was not observed in noble fir. At final measurement, inbreeding depression in diameter relative to inbreeding depression in height was greater in Douglas-fir than in noble fir. At final measurement inbreeding depression in height was inversely related to inbreeding depression in survival.

The focus of this study was to test for increased variance, in inbred populations, in a behavioral character involved inadaptive diversification and probably speciation. We examined the effect of inbreeding on feeding responses of the leaf beetle Ophraella communa in a series of inbred lineages across a range of levels of inbreeding (f = 0.25, 0.375, 0.5). We measured the feeding response of inbred lineages of O. communa on its normal host, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, and on two novel plants, Chrysopsis villosa and Iva frutescens, that are the hosts of other Ophraella species. The results show that feeding responses on the different plants are not correlated, indicating that the feeding responses to the different plants are to some degree genetically independent. Despite apparent genetic variation in lineage feeding responses, we could not statistically demonstrate increases in phenotypic variance within the lineages.

Here we demonstrate a case of allozyme frequency-dependent selection. When olive fruit flies (Bactrocera oleae) are reared on an artificial larval medium, an allele at the alcohol dehydrogenase locus that is present in very low frequency in natural populations increases to about one-third in less than five generations. We show here that the time from the hatching of the egg to the eclosion of the adult is affected by the genotype composition of the larval population that grows in the same cup of food. Cultures consisting of one genotype only have the longest developmental time, and two-allele cultures in which the two homozygotes and the heterozygote occur in a 1:1:2 ratio show the shortest developmental time. Cultures with intermediate genotypic compositions show intermediate levels of developmental time. The results can be explained by assuming that the developmental time of a genotype depends on the frequency array of all genotypes in the larval population and is not merely a function of its own frequency. It is even possible that the developmental time of a genotype becomes longer as the genotype becomes rarer, yet the genotype will be favored because the developmental times of the competing genotypes become even longer owing to the associated increase of their frequencies. Given that developmental time is inversely related to fitness, this generates a frequency-dependent selection, with developmental times changing progressively until the population arrives at an equilibrium. One optimum population composition that provides a satisfactory fit to allele frequency changes in our experimental populations is when the two alleles occur in equal frequencies and genotypes are in Hardy-Weinberg proportions. We argue that this type of selection is consistent with the role of alcohol dehydrogenase as a detoxifying enzyme in a medium that undergoes continuous chemical changes during its use by the feeding larvae.",Alcohol dehydrogenase | Frequency-dependent selection | Olive fruit fly,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We studied local adaptation in the insect-transmitted fungal pathogen Microbotryum violaceum and its host plant Silene latifolia. Infection success was tested in sympatric (local) and allopatric (foreign) combinations of pathogen and host from 14 natural populations from a metapopulation. Seedlings from up to 10 seed families from each population were exposed to sporidial suspensions from each of four fungal strains derived from the same population, from a near-by population (< 10 km distance), and from two populations at an intermediate (< 30 km) and remote (< 170 km) distance, respectively. We obtained significant pathogen x plant interactions in infection success (proportion of diseased plants) at both fungal population and strain level. There was an overall pattern of local maladaptation of this pathogen: average fungal infection success was significantly lower on sympatric hosts (mean proportion of diseased plants = 0.32 ± 0.03 SE) than on allopatric hosts (0.40 ± 0.02). Five of the 14 fungal populations showed no strong reduction in infection success on sympatric hosts, and three even tended to perform better on sympatric hosts. This pattern is consistent with models of time-lagged cycles predicting patterns of local adaptation in host-parasite systems to emerge only on average. Several factors may restrict the evolutionary potential of this pathogen relative to that of its host. First, a predominantly selfing breeding system may limit its ability to generate new virulence types by sexual recombination, whereas the obligately outcrossing host S. latifolia may profit from rearrangement of resistance alleles by random mating. Second, populations often harbor only a few infected individuals, so virulence variation may be further reduced by drift. Third, migration rates among host plant populations are much higher than among pathogen populations, possibly because pollinators prefer healthy over diseased plants. Migration among partly isolated populations may therefore introduce novel host plant resistance variants more often than novel parasite virulence variants. That migration contributes to the coevolutionary dynamics in this system is supported by the geographic pattern of infectivity. Infection success increased over the first 10-km range of host-pathogen population distances, which is likely the natural range of gene exchange.",Caryophyllaceae | Coevolution | Gene flow | Host-parasite coevolution | Local adaptation | Ustilago,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

In this case, the genetic distance may be corrected for low variation in a population and tests to detect bottlenecks are advised. Third, statistically significant differences may not reflect biologically meaningful differences both because the patterns of adaptive loci may not be correlated with highly variable loci and statistical power with these markers is so high. As an example of this latter effect, the statistical power to detect a one-generation bottleneck of different sizes for different numbers of highly variable loci is discussed.

One possible mechanism to explain this nonindependence is pleiotropy: Multiple resistances are selected after exposure to a single colicin. This study, which was designed to address the role of pleiotropy in the generation of colicin resistance, revealed that 96% of colicin resistant mutants were resistant to two or more colicins. Mutational class was important because putative translocation mutants (Tol pathway mutants) resisted fewer colicins than putative receptor mutants. To determine whether colicin resistance is costly, the effects of colicin resistance mutations on maximal growth rate in a rich medium were also examined. Relative to the sensitive ancestor, translocation mutations lowered maximal growth rates by 17%, whereas putative receptor mutations did not significantly lower growth rates. Thus, when nutrients are abundant, the most advantageous forms of colicin resistance may not impose a cost. The ecological consequences of pleiotropic colicin resistance could involve population cycling between colicin sensitivity and resistance.

One of the most important parameters influencing the dynamics of these elements is the magnitude of their transmission advantage. In many systems, the mechanism of sex-ratio distortion is to abort X- or Y-bearing gametes. With this mechanism, the transmission advantage associated with sex-ratio distortion is diminished when the production of male gametes limits offspring production or when competition among the gametes of different males is intense. In this study, we analyzed the outcome of pollen competition between males that produced different sex ratios in the dioecious plant, Silene alba, and estimated how the sex-ratio bias influenced the transmission properties of the sex chromosomes. We varied the intensity of pollen competition by controlling the quantity of pollen used in crosses and used a combination of single-male pollinations and pollen mixtures to evaluate the effects of multiple paternity. Paternity in pollen mixtures was estimated using allozymes. Sex-ratio bias was directly influenced by the quantity of pollen, but the magnitude of this effect was small. The relative performance of pollen from different males varied substantially, especially when there was multiple paternity. Specifically, males with biased sex ratios sired far fewer offspring of either sex in pollen mixtures. In crosses involving single males, however, these 'sex-ratio' males produced the same number of offspring as other males, so the female bias caused a significant transmission advantage for X-linked genes.

Studies of a Spanish population of the pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca, and a Swedish population of the closely related collared flycatcher, F. albicollis, have indicated that the white forehead patch of males is a sexually selected trait. We studied the white forehead patch of male pied flycatchers (n = 487) in a Norwegian population over seven years. Males with large forehead patches were in general more brightly colored, but patch height was not correlated to body mass, body size, or parasite loads. Conditions during the nestling period did not seem to influence patch height as an adult. Patch height increased slightly from the first to the second year as adults, but then remained relatively constant at higher ages. Patch height was not related to survival. Year-to-year changes showed that males who increased in patch height also increased in body mass, suggesting that expression of the forehead patch may be partly condition dependent. However, changes in body mass explained only a small proportion of the variance in patch height between males. Thus, patch height would not be a good indicator of male quality. Furthermore, patch size was also not related to male ability to feed nestlings, indicating that females would not obtain direct benefits by choosing males with large patches. However, patch height could be a Fisher trait, but this requires heritability and there was no significant father-son resemblance in patch height. Comparisons of the males visited by each female during the mate sampling period indicated that chosen males did not have larger forehead patches than rejected males. Experimental manipulation of patch height did not affect male mating success. These results indicate that females do not use patch size as a mate choice cue. Finally, patch height did not predict the outcome of male contests for nestboxes, suggesting that the forehead patch is not an intrasexually selected cue of status. Norwegian pied flycatchers have smaller forehead patches than both Spanish pied flycatchers and Swedish collared flycatchers. We suggest that this pattern may be explained by the lack of sexual selection on the forehead patch in the Norwegian population as compared to the other populations, where the patch is apparently sexually selected.

Phylogeographic analyses indicate that the caroliniana morphotype has been present in north and central Florida since the early Pleistocene and that the viridis morphotype has immigrated into southern Florida much more recently. We examine the distribution of diagnostic morphological characters and nuclear genetic markers to assess the extent and patterns of introgression in this system. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that this hybrid zone has expanded north in recent history as viridis alleles have introgressed into regions that were previously occupied by populations of caroliniana. Genetic markers diagnostic for caroliniana have consistently high frequencies across the hybrid zone, whereas markers for viridis are extremely variable among populations with frequency reversals in adjacent populations. The latter pattern is probably the result of the combined stochastic effects of dispersal and drift on viridis alleles as they introgressed northward. Additional evidence for the recent expansion of this hybrid zone comes from patterns of variation for morphological and genetic markers. As expected for an expanding hybrid zone, within-population morphological variation was greatest toward the advancing front of introgression and levels of genetic variation for neutral diagnostic markers were greatest in the region of initial contact and lower in areas of recent expansion. The observed patterns of variation suggest that at least some hybrid genotypes have high fitnesses, which has led to the expansion of the hybrid zone via the displacement of parental genotypes in central Florida.",Hybrid zone | Hybridization | Introgression | Morphological variation | RAPDs,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Most previous studies of costs of plant defense focused on female fitness costs of constitutively expressed defenses. Consideration of alternative plant strategies, such as induced defenses and tolerance to herbivory, and multiple types of costs, including allocation to male reproductive function, may increase our ability to detect costs of plant defense against herbivores. In this study we measured male and female reproductive costs associated with induced responses and tolerance to herbivory in annual wild radish plants (Raphanus raphanistrum). We induced resistance in the plants by subjecting them to herbivory by Pieris rapae caterpillars. We also induced resistance in plants without leaf tissue removal using a natural chemical elicitor, jasmonic acid; in addition, we removed leaf tissue without inducing plant responses using manual clipping. Induced responses included increased concentrations of indole glucosinolates, which are putative defense compounds. Induced responses, in the absence of leaf tissue removal, reduced plant fitness when five fitness components were considered together; costs of induction were individually detected for time to first flower and number of pollen grains produced per flower. In this system, induced responses appear to impose a cost, although this cost may not have been detected had we only quantified the traditionally measured fitness components, growth and seed production. In the absence of induced responses, 50% leaf tissue removal, reduced plant fitness in three out of the five fitness components measured. Induced responses to herbivory and leaf tissue removal had additive effects on plant fitness. Although plant sibships varied greatly (49-136%) in their level of tolerance to herbivory, costs of tolerance were not detected, as we did not find a negative association between the ability to compensate for damage and plant fitness in the absence of damage. We suggest that consideration of alternative plant defense strategies and multiple costs will result in a broader understanding of the evolutionary ecology of plant defense.",Adaptive plasticity | Compensation | Herbivory | Induced defense | Male plant fitness | Overcompensation | Plant-insect interactions | Raphanus raphanistrum,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

This hypothesis has not yet been tested within a natural vertebrate population. Here we show that relatively inbred Soay sheep (Ovis aries), as assessed by microsatellite heterozygosity, are more susceptible to parasitism by gastrointestinal nematodes, with interactions indicating greatest susceptibility among adult sheep at high population density. During periods of high overwinter mortality on the island of Hirta, St. Kilda, Scotland, highly parasitised individuals were less likely to survive. More inbred individuals were also less likely to survive, which is due to their increased susceptibility to parasitism, because survival was random with respect to inbreeding among sheep that were experimentally cleared of their gastrointestinal parasite burden by anthelminthic treatment. As a consequence of this selection, average microsatellite heterozygosity increases with age in St. Kildan Soay sheep.

The first are often found to be poor dispersers, following isolation by distance or steppingstone theoretical predictions. The second are commonly associated with high-dispersal taxa and are best described by the island model. Deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems represent a good model for studying one-dimensional metapopulations. Whereas isolation by distance might be expected to be the rule in such a system for species with limited dispersal capabilities, a biological paradox can be observed: an apparent genetic homogeneity in some vent species with short-scale dispersal potential, in a one-dimensional fragmented habitat. This can be explained if one key assumption of the existing models is not met: gene flow between populations and genetic drift may not have the time to equilibrate. Geophysical models revealed that hydrothermal convection is intrinsically unstable, inducing processes of coalescence or splitting of venting areas in a chaotic manner. This is likely to generate frequent extinctions and recolonizations. Theoretical genetic predictions derived from extinctions/recolonizations cannot satisfactorily mode a situation where habitat shifts are frequent and constantly affect the metapopulation equilibrium. Because neither the island and the stepping-stone models nor the classical metapopulation models resemble the hydrothermal vent reality we present here a realistic model developed to provide a compromise between existing conceptual models and what is currently known of the biology and ecology of one of the most peculiar and best-studied vent species, the polychaete Alvinella pompejana. This model allows us to define the boundaries between which the metapopulation is evolutionary stable in an unstable context. Simulations show different patterns in which metapopulation size and recolonization vary but reach an equilibrium despite chaotic vent extinctions. In contrast, the model also shows that displacing habitat continuously affects the equilibrium between gene flow and drift. As a consequence, the time required to balance these evolutionary forces can never be attained, leading to chaotic fluctuations in F-statistics. Those fluctuations are mainly due to stochastic changes of the interpatch distance which affect migration rates. The shifting of active zone, of venting can episodically counterbalance differentiation and allow a long-term genetic homogenization at the ridge scale. These findings lead to a new concept in which the exchanges between populations would mainly depend on the habitat's movements along the ridge axis rather than the organism's dispersal. We therefore propose a new mode based on patch-network displacements in which transient contact zones allow low levels of gene flow throughout the metapopulation.",Alvinellid polychaetes | Deep-sea hydrothermal vents | Dispersal | Gene flow | Metapopulation | Simulations,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

To better understand effective breeding patterns in Y. filamentosa populations, 10 polymorphic allozyme loci were investigated to analyze the breeding structure of a natural Y. filamentosa population.

In a wide range of parameter values, the two locally optimal phenotypes will be realized by one of the homozygotes and the heterozygote, rather than by the two homozygotes.

Overall, flowers of autotetraploid plants were larger and shaped differently than those of diploids, had a different flowering phenology than that of diploids, and attracted different suites of floral visitors. In comparison with flowers of diploids, tetraploid floral morphology varied widely from pronounced differences between cytotypes in some populations to similar flower shapes and sizes between ploidal levels in other populations. Observations of floral visitors to diploids and autotetraploids in a natural sympatric population demonstrated that the cytotypes had different suites of floral visitors and six of the 15 common visitors preferentially visited one ploidy more frequently. Moreover, we also found that floral morphology differed among independent autotetraploid origins, but there was no consistent pattern of differentiation between genetically similar diploid and autotetraploid populations. Hence, the results suggest that the process of polyploidization creates the potential for attraction of different suites of floral visitors. Multiple origins of polyploidy also presents the opportunity for new or different plant-insect interactions among independent polyploid lineages.

Most perennial plants practice both sexual and clonal reproduction, and it has been hypothesized that populations with little sexual recruitment may lose the capacity for sexual reproduction by fixing mutations that disable one or more of the many processes involved in sex. The clonal, tristylous aquatic plant, Decodon verticillatus, exhibits marked geographical variation in sexual recruitment. Populations at the northern limit of the range are usually monomorphic for style length, consist of single genotypes, and produce almost no seed, due, in part, to environmental conditions that inhibit pollination, fertilization, and seed maturation. Controlled crosses in a greenhouse provided evidence for greatly reduced sexual capacity in an exclusively clonal, monomorphic population. Plants from this infertile population produced only 3-18% as many seeds per pollination as fertile populations. Observations of pollen tube growth indicated that infertility is due to severe reductions in pollen tube numbers both early after pollination and later when pollen tubes were traversing the ovary, due primarily to the inability of pistils to support normal tube growth. A three-year greenhouse experiment comparing fertility, survival, and growth of F1 progenies produced from reciprocal crosses between plants from the infertile population and those from nearby fertile populations suggested that the genetic basis for infertility is simple and may involve a single recessive mutation. In addition, the results did not reveal any association between infertility and other aspects of survival and vegetative vigor. The infertile genotype was likely fixed in the population through founder effect rather than indirect selection resulting from antagonistic pleiotropy or direct selection of advantages associated with reduced investment in sexual reproduction.

Populations varied somewhat in the stage at which infertility was expressed, however, pollen tube growth was impaired in all populations.

Using mtDNA (control region and ND1 gene) polymorphisms, we asked whether this recolonization occurred through bottlenecks and whether it was accompanied by population growth. Sequences of the second hypervariable domain of the control region were obtained from 364 noctule bats representing 18 colonies sampled across Europe. This yielded 108 haplotypes that were depicted on a minimum spanning tree that showed a starlike structure with two long branches. Additional sequences obtained from the ND1 gene confirmed that the different parts of the MST correspond to three clades which diverged before the Last Glacial Maximum (18,000 yrC14 BP), leading to the conclusion that the noctule bat survived in several isolated refugia. Partitioning populations into coherent geographical groups divided our samples (φ(CT) = 0.17; P = 0.01) into a group of highly variable nursing colonies from central and eastern Europe and less variable, isolated colonies from western and southern Europe. Demographic analyses suggest that populations of the former group underwent demographic expansions either after the Younger Dryas (11,000-10,000 yrC14 BP), assuming a fast mutation rate for HV II, or during the Pleistocene, assuming a conventional mutation rate. We discuss the fact that the high genetic variability (h = 0.69-0.96; π = 0.006-0.013) observed in nursing colonies that are located some distance from potential Pleistocene refugia is probably due to the combined effect of rapid evolution of the control region in growing populations and a range shift of noctule populations parallel to the recovery of forests in Europe after the last glaciations.",Bottleneck | Control region | Mitochondrial DNA | ND1 | Nyctalus noctula | Pleistocene | Population structure,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

In the laboratory common-garden experiment, first-instar larvae from two southern (Georgia, South Carolina) and two northern (Connecticut, Rhode Island) populations were reared in incubators under high- and low-food and high- and low-temperature: regimes. For all populations, high food increased final body mass and growth rate and decreased development time. Growth rates were higher at low temperatures, but temperature did not affect larval or adult body mass. Survivorship was highest in high-food and low-temperature treatments. Across all food and temperature treatments, northern populations exhibited a larger final body mass, shorter development time, faster growth rate, and greater survivorship than did southern populations. Results were similar for a field reciprocal-transplant experiment of third-instar larvae between populations in Connecticut and Oklahoma: Connecticut larvae grew faster than Oklahoma larvae, regardless of transplant site. Conversely, larvae transplanted to Oklahoma grew faster than larvae transplanted to Connecticut, regardless of population source. These results suggest that variation in food availability, not temperature, may account for differences in growth and body size of northern and southern ant lions. Although northern larvae grew faster and reached a larger body size in both experiments, northern environments should suppress growth because of reduced food availability and a limited growing season.

If defensive compounds are incorporated into floral structures or if they are sufficiently costly that fewer rewards are offered to pollinators, pollinators may discriminate against more defended plants. Here we consider whether directional selection for increased resistance to herbivores could be constrained by opposing selection through pollinator discrimination against more defended plants. We used artificial selection to create two populations of Brassica rapa plants that had high and low myrosinase concentrations and, consequently, high and low resistance to flea beetle herbivores. We measured changes in floral characters of plants in both damaged and undamaged states from these populations with different resistances to flea beetle attack. We also measured pollinator visitation to plants, including numbers of pollinators and measures of visit quality (numbers of flowers visited and time spent per flower). Damage from herbivores resulted in reduced petal size, as did selection for high resistance to herbivores later in the plant lifetime. In addition, floral display (number of open flowers) was also altered by an interaction between these two effects. Changes in floral traits translated into overall greater use of low-resistance, undamaged plants based on total amount of time pollinators spent foraging on plants. Total numbers of pollinators attracted to plants did not differ among treatments; however, pollinators spent significantly more time per flower on plants from the low-resistance population and tended to visit more flowers on these plants as well. Previous work by other investigators on the same pollinator taxa has shown that longer visit times are associated with greater male and female plant fitness. Because initial numbers of pollinators did not differ between selection regimes, palatability and/or amount of rewards offered by high- and low-resistance populations are likely to be responsible for these patterns. During periods of pollinator limitation, less defended plants may have a selective advantage and pollinator preferences may mediate directional selection imposed by herbivores. In addition, if pollinator preferences limit seed set in highly defended plants, then lower seed set previously attributed to allocation costs of defense may also reflect greater pollinator limitation in these plants relative to less defended plants.",Allocation costs | Brassica rapa | Costs of resistance | Ecological costs | Herbivores | Myrosinase | Pollinators,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Here we describe the PgiC genes in the tetraploid Clarkia gracilis and related diploid species, which are native from California to southern Washington. PgiC encodes the cytosolic isozyme of phosphoglucose isomerase (PGIC; EC 5.3.1.9). The gene was duplicated in the basal stock of Clarkia and now both genes, PgiC1 and PgiC2, are active in about half of the diploid species, whereas only PgiC1 is active in the others. Clarkia gracilis was found to have three PgiC genes: two PgiC1s and a PgiC2. Reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments, starting with mRNAs prepared from seedling leaves of C. gracilis, showed that the three genes are expressed. Analysis of their sequences showed they are evolving at similar rates to their homologues and that they have the same intron-exon structure. The presence of an expressed PgiC2 in C. gracilis was unexpected because all related diploid species, including one identified as a parent, have only active PgiC1s. The donor of the PgiC2 is now presumed extinct, but parsimony analysis identified its phylogenetic position. None of the PgiC genes that were active when C. gracilis arose were silenced. A possible example of gene conversion involving a 300-nucleotide region of one PgiC1 and PgiC2 was identified, but it probably occurred in the diploid parental species rather than in C. gracilis.

From this viewpoint, the main result of the present analysis is that the expression patterns of developmental control genes are reflected in the infraspecific correlation patterns of phenotypic characters in the adult stage. The study is based on 42 logarithmically scaled skeletal measurements of two avian clades, finches (43 species, n = 313) and pigeons (27 species, n = 219). First, for each clade an 'observed correlation matrix' was calculated by computing a bias-reduced pooled-species correlation matrix based on the clade-specific pooled within-species variance-covariance matrix between measurements. Second, the expression domains of diverse developmental control genes, that is, Hox, Msx, Pax, Mhox, Shh, Bmp, and Gdf, in characters were represented by 'theoretical matrices.' Finally, the observed and the theoretical matrices were compared by Mantel's test to test hypotheses about pattern similarities between phenotypic correlations and the expression of developmental control genes. Seventeen percent of the single matrix comparisons revealed significant (P ≤ 0.05) pattern correspondences in finches, whereas 63% were significant in pigeons. The multiple comparisons revealed correspondences at the highest significance level (P ≤ 0.001) in both clades and disclosed that 15% of the observed matrix patterns are explained in finches versus 22% in pigeons. Presumably, as finches have less pronounced correspondences between gene expression and phenotypic correlation, they are more derived than pigeons. Out of the significant single matrix comparisons, four correspondences are common to both clades: one of them is connected with the Gdf gene expression concerning limb length relations and also harmonizes with the dominant pattern within the infraspecific correlation matrices. The general implication is that the significant correspondences detected here between observed and theoretical matrices are based on a correspondence between phenotypic and genetic modules.

Hemolymph (blood) JHE activity was sixfold lower in nascent short-winged (SW) females, relative to nascent long-winged (LW) females, during the last juvenile stadium (stage). Morph-associated genetic variation for JHE activity had two causes, variation in loci: (1) regulating whole-organism enzyme activity; and (2) controlling the degree to which JHE is secreted into the blood. Reduced JHE activity in nascent SW-selected individuals was associated with reduced in vivo juvenile hormone catabolism. This suggests that variation in JHE activity during juvenile development may have important physiological consequences with respect to the regulation of blood levels of juvenile hormone and consequent specification of wing morph. This is the first definitive demonstration of genetic variation for hormonal metabolism in any insect and a genetic association between hormone metabolism and the subsequent expression of morphological variation (wing morph). However, we have not yet firmly established whether these associations represent causal relationships. In contrast to the clear association between JHE activity and wing morph development, we observed no evidence indicating that variation in JHE activity plays any direct or indirect role in causing the dramatic differences in ovarian growth between adult wing morphs. Variation in JHE activity also does not appear to be important in coordinating the development of wing morph with the subsequent expression of reproductive differences between adult morphs. Finally, genetic variation for the developmental profiles of JHE activity during juvenile and adult stages are remarkably similar in three Gryllus species.

However, much of the empirical evidence for the deleterious-mutation process derives from studies of Drosophila melanogaster, some of which have been called into question. We review a broad array of data that collectively support the hypothesis that deleterious mutations arise in flies at rate of about one per individual per generation, with the average mutation decreasing fitness by about only 2% in the heterozygous state. Empirical evidence from microbes, plants, and several other animal species provide further support for the idea that most mutations have only mildly deleterious effects on fitness, and several other species appear to have genomic mutation rates that are of the order of magnitude observed in Drosophila. However, there is mounting evidence that some organisms have genomic deleterious mutation rates that are substantially lower than one per individual per generation. These lower rates may be at least partially reconciled with the Drosophila data by taking into consideration the number of germline cell divisions per generation. To fully resolve the existing controversy over the properties of spontaneous mutations, a number of issues need to be clarified. These include the form of the distribution of mutational effects and the extent to which this is modified by the environmental and genetic background and the contribution of basic biological features such as generation length and genome size to interspecific differences in the genomic mutation rate.

Host populations in the mountains metapopulation were highly inbred, whereas those on the plains showed appreciable levels of outcrossing. Within each metapopulation there was significant variation among component populations in (1) levels of host resistance to individual pathogen isolates; (2) mean levels of resistance to all six isolates; (3) the number of resistance phenotypes present and the evenness of their distribution within the population; and (4) the average number of pathogen lines to which individual hosts were resistant. A more limited comparison of pathogen populations from the two metapopulations (two from each) found greater similarities in the structure of populations and particular virulence frequencies within, rather than among, the two metapopulations. Differences in host outcrossing rates between the two metapopulations are reflected in marked differences in the overall level of resistance, its partitioning within and among populations, the number and distribution of resistance phenotypes in the two areas, and the level of polymorphism for specific virulence factors in the pathogen, with the plains metapopulation showing consistently higher values. However, these differences were not significant.

In this paper we use both the infinite-alleles and the infinite-sites models to reframe Slatkin's propagule-pool and migrant-pool models in terms of mean within-deme and among-deme genetic diversity; the infinite-sites model is particularly relevant to DNA sequence data. Population turnover causes a major reduction in neutral genetic diversity within demes, π(S), and in the metapopulation as a whole, π(T). This effect is particularly strong for propagule-pool colonization, in which colonists are drawn from a single extant deme. Because metapopulation dynamics affect both within-deme and total metapopulation diversity similarly, comparisons between species with different ecologies on the basis of ratios such as F(ST) are difficult to interpret and absolute measures of divergence between populations should be used as well. Although the value of F(ST) in a metapopulation with local extinction depends strongly on the mode of colonization, this has almost no effect on the numerator of the F(ST) ratio, π(T) - π(S), so that F(ST) is influenced mainly by the effect of the colonization mode on the denominator (π(T)). Our results also indicate that it is inappropriate to use measures of average within-deme diversity in species with population turnover to estimate the scaled mutation rate, θ, because extinction can greatly reduce π(S).

Female fairy-wrens chose extra-group mates that molted earlier into breeding plumage. Males molted up to five months before the breeding season began, and only males that molted at least one month prior to its onset gained any extra-group fertilizations. This conclusion held after controlling statistically for the effect of age and social status on molt date. Once males acquired breeding plumage, they began courtship display to females on other territories. Thus, some males were displaying to females for several months before the breeding season began. This extraordinarily long period of advertisement by males may be facilitated by the long-term ownership of territories.

In particular, selection is thought to favor hermaphrodites during population establishment because that sex should be less prone to pollen limitation, especially if self-fertilization is possible. However, inbreeding depression could limit this advantage. In this experimental study of Silene vulgaris, a weedy gynodioecious plant, the fitness of females and hermaphrodites was estimated from seed production in both mixed-sex populations and for individuals isolated from these populations by 20, 40, 80, or 160 m. In mixed populations females display statistically significant greater per capita seed production owing to higher capsule production and higher rates of seed germination. The fitness of both sexes declines with increasing isolation, but at different rates, such that in the 160-m treatment hermaphrodites are by far the more fit sex. Allozyme studies suggest that this differential decline is because the selfing rate in hermaphrodites increases as a function of isolation, at least partially compensating for a decline in the availability of outcross pollen. Overall, the negative effects of pollen limitation on females far outweighs the negative effects of inbreeding depression following selfing in hermaphrodites.

In the present paper, we tested the potential for statistical power analysis to differentiate between hard and soft polytomies in molecular phylogenies. Classical power analysis typically is used a priori to determine the sample size required to detect a particular effect size at a particular level of significance (α) with a certain power (1 - β). A posteriori, power analysis is used to infer whether failure to reject a null hypothesis results from lack of an effect or from insufficient data (i.e., low power). We adapted this approach to molecular data to infer whether polytomies result from simultaneous branching events or from insufficient sequence information. We then used this approach to determine the amount of sequence data (sample size) required to detect a positive branch length (effect size). A worked example is provided based on the auklets (Charadriiformes: Alcidae), a group of seabirds among which relationships are represented by a polytomy, despite analyses of over 3000 bp of sequence data. We demonstrate the calculation of effect sizes and sample sizes from sequence data using a normal curve test for difference of a proportion from an expected value and a t-test for a difference of a mean from an expected value.

Larvae that coexist with fish tend to be lighter than larvae from streams that are fishless and ephemeral. Two approaches demonstrated that lightly pigmented salamander larvae better match the common background in relatively permanent streams and are less conspicuous to fish than dark larvae. First, using a model based on the spectral sensitivity of the fish and reflectance properties of salamanders and natural stream backgrounds, we showed that light larvae are three times more cryptic than dark larvae on rocks. Second, lighter larvae had higher survival than darker salamanders on rocks in a predator- choice experiment. It is not clear why larvae in ephemeral streams are darker. Larvae in ephemeral streams should be active to feed and develop rapidly and reach sufficient size to metamorphose before seasonal drying. Several hypotheses may explain why larvae tend to be darker in ephemeral streams, such as increased thermoregulatory ability, better screening of ultraviolet radiation (in these shallower streams), or better background matching to terrestrial predators. Among populations where salamander larvae coexist with fish, there are differences in relative crypsis. Larvae from populations with fish and relatively high gene flow from ephemeral populations (where larvae are dark) tend to be darker (with more melanophores) and more conspicuous to predators than those from more genetically isolated populations, where larvae are lighter and more cryptic.

These assumptions have not been adequately tested in wild species, although a few studies have detected either genetic variation in pollen and ovule production per flower or evidence of trade-offs between male and female investment at the whole plant level. It may also be argued, however, that in highly autogamous, perfect-flowered plant taxa that exhibit genetic variation in gamete production, strong stabilizing selection for an efficient pollen:ovule ratio should result in a positive correlation among genotypes with respect to mean ovule and mean pollen production per flower. Here we report the results of a three-generation artificial selection experiment conducted on a greenhouse population of the autogamous annual plant Spergularia marina. Starting with a base population of 1200 individuals, we conducted intense mass selection for two generations, creating four selected lines (high and low ovule production per flower; high and low anther production per flower) and a control line. By examining the direct and correlated responses of several floral traits to selection on gamete production per flower, we evaluated the expectations that primary sexual investment would exhibit heritable variation and that resource-sharing, variation in resource-garnering ability, or developmental constraints mold the genetic correlations expressed among floral organs. The observed direct and correlated responses to selection on male and female gamete production revealed significant heritabilities of both ovule and anther production per flower and a significant negative genetic correlation between them. When plants were selected for increased ovules per flower over two generations, ovule production increased and anther production declined relative to the control line. Among plants selected for decreased anthers per flower, we observed a decline in anther production and an increase in ovule production relative to the control line. In contrast, the lines selected for low ovules per flower and for high anthers per flower exhibited no evidence for significant genetic correlations between male and female primary investment. Correlated responses to selection also indicate a genetically based negative correlation between the production of normal versus developmentally abnormal anthers (staminoid organs); a positive correlation between the production of ovules versus staminoid organs; and a positive correlation between the production of anthers and petals. The negative relationship between male versus female primary investment supports classical sex allocation theory, although the asymmetrical correlated responses to selection indicate that this relationship is not always expressed.",Artificial selection | Gender | Pollen/ovule ratio | Sex allocation,NA,NA,NA,NA

One of the major theoretical models of parasite virulence postulates that this is because rapid within-host replication rates are necessary for successful transmission (parasite fitness) and that virulence (damage to the host) is an unavoidable consequence of this rapid replication. Two fundamental assumptions underlying this so-called evolutionary trade-off model have rarely been tested empirically: (1) that higher replication rates lead to higher levels of virulence; and (2) that higher replication rates lead to higher transmission. Both of these relationships must have a genetic basis for this evolutionary hypothesis to be relevant. These assumptions were tested in the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi, by examining genetic relationships between virulence and transmission traits across a population of eight parasite clones isolated from the wild. Each clone was injected into groups of inbred mice in a controlled laboratory environment, and replication rate (measured by maximum asexual parasitemia), virulence (measured by live-weight loss and degree of anemia in the mouse), and transmission (measured by density of sexual forms, gametocytes, in the blood and proportion of mosquitoes infected after taking a blood-meal from the mouse) were assessed. It was found that clones differed widely in these traits and these clone differences were repeatable over successive blood passages. Virulence traits were strongly phenotypically and genetically (i.e., across clones) correlated to maximum parasitemia thus supporting the first assumption that rapid replication causes higher virulence. Transmission traits were also positively phenotypically and genetically correlated to parasitemia, which supports the second assumption that rapid replication leads to higher transmission. Thus, two assumptions of the parasite-centered trade-off model of the evolution of virulence were shown to be justified in malaria parasites.",Malaria | Plasmodium chabaudi | Transmission | Virulence,NA,NA,NA,NA

A comparison of the distribution patterns for seven clades in this complex revealed very clear phylogeographic structuring. Most notably, pulicaria group lineages were restricted primarily to the Nearctic, with some colonization of formerly glaciated portions of northern Europe. This group was not detected from vast expanses of northern Eurasia, including the Beringian glacial refuge. In contrast, tenebrosa group haplotypes showed considerable intercontinental divergence between Eurasian and North American lineages, but were absent from Greenland and Iceland, as well as the Canadian arctic archipelago. Dispersal in Eurasia was primarily in a westerly direction from Beringia, whereas dispersal in the Nearctic followed proglacial drainage patterns. Long-distance dispersal of certain lineages was observed in both groups, and variation in haplotype richness and nucleotide diversity allowed us to make inferences about the positioning of putative glacial refugia. Overall, the phylogeographic pattern of diversification in this arctic complex is characterized by the apparently unique postglacial histories for each clade, indicating that even closely allied taxa can respond independently to the allopatric effects of glacial cycles.

We sequenced a 640-bp region of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene of mitochondrial DNA to determine whether this division of the genus into species was confirmed by molecular markers, to ascertain their phylogenetic relations, and to reconstruct the history of possible dispersal and vicariance events that led to present-day patterns of species distribution. We found that E. metularia split first from the rest of the extant species of the genus. If COI divergence is calibrated by the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama, the estimated date of the separation of the Indo-West Pacific species is 4.7-6.4 million years ago. This date suggests that the last available route of genetic contact between the Indo-Pacific and the rest of the tropics was from west to east through the Eastern Pacific Barrier, rather than through the Tethyan Sea or around the southern tip of Africa. The second cladogenic event was the separation of eastern Pacific and Atlantic populations by the Isthmus of Panama. Eucidaris at the outer eastern Pacific islands (Galapagos, Isla del Coco, Clipperton Atoll) belong to a separate clade, so distinct from mainland E. thouarsi as to suggest that this is a different species, for which the name E. galapagensis is revived from the older taxonomic literature. Complete lack of shared alleles in three allozyme loci between island and mainland populations support their separate specific status. Eucidaris galapagensis and E. thouarsi are estimated from their COI divergence to have split at about the same time that E. thouarsi and E. tribuloides were being separated by the Isthmus of Panama. Even though currents could easily convey larvae between the eastern Pacific islands and the American mainland, the two species do not appear to have invaded each other's ranges. Conversely, the central Atlantic E. clavata at St. Helena and Ascension is genetically similar to E. tribuloides from the American and African coasts. Populations on these islands are either genetically connected to the coasts of the Atlantic or have been colonized by extant mitochondrial DNA lineages of Eucidaris within the last 200,000 years. Although it is hard to explain how larvae can cross the entire width of the Atlantic within their competent lifetimes, COI sequences of Eucidaris from the west coast of Africa are very similar to those of E. tribuloides from the Caribbean. F(ST) statistics indicate that gene flow between E. metularia from the Indian Ocean and from the western and central Pacific is restricted. Low gene flow is also evident between populations of E. clavata from Ascension and St. Helena. Rates of intraspecific exchange of genes in E. thouarsi, E. galapagensis, and E. tribuloides, on the other hand, are high. The phylogeny of Eucidaris confirms Ernst Mayr's conclusions that major barriers to the dispersal of tropical echinoids have been the wide stretch of deep water between central and eastern Pacific, the cold water off the southwest coast of Africa, and the Isthmus of Panama. It also suggests that a colonization event in the eastern Pacific has led to speciation between mainland and island populations.",Biogeography | Cytochrome oxidase | Gene flow | Islands | Mitochondrial DNA | Ocean currents | Sea urchins,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We present data on the rejection behavior of magpies (Pica pica), the main European host of the great spotted cuckoo (Clamator glandarius), in 15 populations (nine sympatric, six allopatric) across their distribution range in Europe. Rejection rates of mimetic and nonmimetic model eggs were significantly higher in sympatric than in allopatric magpie populations, although differences in rejection rate of both mimetic and nonmimetic model eggs between magpie populations were significantly correlated even after controlling for phylogenetic effects, with differences between sympatric and allopatric magpie populations being larger for mimetic than for nonmimetic model eggs. Differences in rejection of mimetic model eggs were related to both genetic and geographic distances between populations, but differences in rejection rate of nonmimetic model eggs were unrelated to these distances. However, when comparing only sympatric populations, differences in rejection rate of both mimetic and nonmimetic model eggs were related to geographic distances. A multiple autocorrelation analysis revealed that differences among populations in rejection rates of mimetic model eggs had a strong geographic component, whereas the main component of rejection rate of nonmimetic model eggs was genetic rather than geographic. These results support the rejecter-gene flow hypothesis.

Pollen removal alone was not a good measure of male reproductive success. The aim of the current study is to elucidate the mechanism underlying the selection on corolla width in C. punctata. Multiple regression analysis of male reproductive success in experimental populations revealed that the advantage of a wide corolla to the male is independent of the corolla width of pollen recipients, indicating that the position of pollen deposited on Bombus may not be an important factor for selection. However, the number of pollen grains that fell on the petal or off the flower and were lost at the first visit of Bombus (pollen fall) decreased with increasing corolla width, so that most pollen grains removed from a wide flower were deposited onto the pollinator. In a narrow flower, a greater proportion of the pollen removed was wasted through pollen fall. Pollen removal does not reflect male reproductive success, at least in part because of the loss of pollen in some flowers through pollen fall. The positive relationship between wider corollas and reduced loss of pollen through pollen fall is likely to lead to greater male reproductive success of wider flowers under repeated visits of pollinators. Decreased pollen fall, probably due to more gentle contact between pollen and bees in flowers with wider corollas, may be one of the mechanisms underlying the selection on corolla width of C. punctata.",Bombus diversus | Campanula punctata | Corolla width | Male reproductive success | Pollen fall | Pollen removal,NA,NA,NA,NA

The finding that the heterogametic sex (male) is more adversely affected in interspecific crosses than the homogametic sex is consistent with Haldane's rule, which predicts that hybrid dysfunction should emerge as an indirect byproduct of divergent adaptation to differing environments. If so, environmental effects and genotype-by-environment interactions (GEI) should characterize the expression of Haldane's rule and interspecific hybrid traits in general. We used two wild-collected populations of T. castaneum (from Infantes, Spain, and Madagascar) to investigate the effects of environmental variation on the expression of Haldane's rule. Males from each population were mated to several T. freemani females and the half-sibling hybrid progenies were reared across a series of temperature regimes. For both populations, we found that hybrids raised at higher temperatures exhibited a more extreme expression of Haldane's rule: The hybrid sex ratios were more biased toward females and hybrid males had a much higher incidence of morphological abnormalities. The average response to temperature, the norm of reaction for Haldane's rule, varied between the two populations, and we found considerable and significant GEI for both hybrid traits within both populations.

This competition can result in either cooperative fusion or aggressive rejection between colonies, and some species have evolved highly polymorphic genetic systems that mediate the outcome of these interactions. Here we demonstrate the potential for interactions among close kin as the basis for the evolutionary maintenance of a genetically polymorphic allorecognition system in the colonial hydroid Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, which lives on gastropod shells occupied by hermit crabs. Fusion between hydroids in the laboratory is restricted mainly to encounters between full siblings, whereas other encounters result in aggressive rejection. Natural selection acting on the costs or benefits of fusion between colonies could be responsible for the present maintenance of such a highly specific behavioral response, but only if encounters between fusible colonies still occur in contemporary populations. The large size of these hydroid populations and the mobility of the crabs should limit the potential for interactions among closely related hydroids on the same shell. However, RAPD polymorphisms among a large sample of hydroids from a population off the coast of Massachusetts indicate that genetically similar colonies are often found together on the same shell. Some genetic distances between colonies on the same shell were low relative to genetic distances between colonies on different shells or genetic distances between known full siblings from laboratory matings. We conservatively estimate that 2-18% of co-occurring colonies may be full sibling pairs. These observations suggest that encounters between genetically similar hydroids are common, despite the mobile nature of their habitat, and these encounters may provide frequent opportunities for natural selection to influence the evolution of cooperative and agonistic behaviors and their polymorphic genetic basis.",Allorecognition | Genetic polymorphism | Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus | Hydrozoa | Population structure | RAPDs,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Open-pollinated and self-fertilized progeny of 23 maternal trees, originating from a natural stand in southern Finland, were grown at two sites. We observed significant inbreeding depression in two of the four life stages measured. Inbreeding depression was largest for seed maturation (δ = 0.74), where seedset in open-pollinated strobili (70.9%) was about four times higher than in selfed strobili (18.3%). Inbreeding depression in postgermination survival (up to an age of 23 years) was also high (δ = 0.62-0.75). No significant differences in height (δ = 0.05) or flowering (δ = 0.14) of the trees after 23 years were observed. Cumulative inbreeding depression was high (δ = 0.90-0.94) and differed significantly among maternal families (range 0.45-1.00). The magnitude of inbreeding depression among the 23 maternal parents was not significantly correlated between early (seed maturation) and later (postgermination survival) life stages, suggesting that its genetic basis varies across the life cycle. Size differences among the progeny types diminished in time due to nonrandom size-specific mortality, causing a decrease in the inbreeding depression estimates for height over time. Our results indicate that Scots pine exhibits high levels of inbreeding depression during both early and later stages of the life cycle. It is argued that self-fertilization in Scots pine is inefficient in purging the genetic load caused by highly deleterious mutations because of the nearly complete loss of selfed individuals over time.

However, in the wild males choose different microhabitats and parental females tend to be found in the same habitats as conspecific males. This sets up the opportunity for sexual selection against male hybrids because they must compete with parental males for access to parental females. To test for sexual selection against adult F1 hybrid males, we examined their mating success in enclosures in their preferred habitat (open, unvegetated substrate) where limnetic males and females also predominate. We found significantly reduced mating success in F1 hybrid males compared with limnetic males.

Introgression was primarily from west to east, the direction of the prevailing wind, for both organelles, but introgression of cpDNA far exceeded that of mtDNA.

Sympatric populations of pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum Harris, Homoptera: Aphididae) on alfalfa and red clover are highly genetically divergent and locally adapted. Here, hierarchical estimates of population structure based on F(st) suggest that gene exchange between closely adjacent aphid populations on the two hosts is highly restricted relative to that among fields of the same host plant. Although these host-associated races are presently considered to be the same subspecies, they appear to be significantly reproductively isolated, suggesting incipient speciation. Habitat (host) choice was investigated as the first in a temporal series of factors that could reduce gene exchange between these sympatric populations. Field studies of winged colonists to newly planted fields of each host suggest pronounced habitat fidelity. This result was verified using replicated observations of the host choice behavior of different aphid genotypes for which the relative demographic performance on each host was known. These laboratory observations of behavior revealed a strong genetic correlation between habitat choice (or acceptance) and the relative performance in each habitat. Because mating occurs on the host plant, habitat choice in this system leads to assortative mating and is therefore a major cause of reproductive isolation between the sympatric pea aphid populations on alfalfa and clover. However, the extent of dispersal between hosts estimated from the field study of winged colonists (911%) is too great to be consistent with the genetic divergence estimated between the races. This suggests that barriers to gene flow other than host choice also exist, such as selection against migrants or hybrids in the parental environments, hybrid sterility, or hybrid breakdown.",Aphids | Ecological specialization | Habitat choice | Insect-plant interactions | Reproductive isolation | Speciation,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Inbred lines derived from open and woodland populations were grown under low density, high density, and high density with selective removal of FR wavelengths to block phytochrome-mediated perception of neighbor proximity. Genetic variation in plasticity to density and to the R:FR cue was detected for several traits.

Stem elongation responses to density were suppressed when phytochrome perception was blocked at high density. For these phytochrome-mediated traits, a genotype's plasticity to density was strongly correlated with its response to R:FR. Phytochrome-mediated traits were tightly correlated with one another, regardless of the density environment. However, the responses to density of meristem allocation to branching and leaf traits were less strongly phytochrome-mediated. These traits differed in patterns of plasticity, and their genetic correlations often differed across environments. In particular, genetic trade-offs involving meristem allocation to branching were expressed only at low density. The observed density dependence of phenotypic and genetic correlations implies that indirect selection and the potential for correlated response to selection will depend upon the competitive environment.

If populations of specialized herbivorous insects are structured by their host plants such that populations on different hosts are genetically differentiated, then the traits affecting insect-parasitoid interactions may exhibit an associated structure. The pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) is a herbivorous insect species comprised of genetically distinct groups that are specialized on different host plants (Via 1991a, 1994). Here, we examine how the genetic differentiation of pea aphid populations on different host plants affects their interaction with a parasitoid wasp, Aphidius ervi. We performed four experiments. (1) By exposing pea aphids from both alfalfa and clover to parasitoids from both crops, we demonstrate that pea aphid populations that are specialized on alfalfa are successfully parasitized less often than are populations specialized on clover. This difference in parasitism rate does not depend upon whether the wasps were collected from alfalfa or clover fields. (2) When we controlled for potential differences in aphid and parasitoid behavior between the two host plants and ensured that aphids were attacked, we found that pea aphids from alfalfa were still parasitized less often than pea aphids from clover. Thus, the difference in parasitism rates is not due to behavior of either aphids or wasps, but appears to be a physiologically based difference in resistance to parasitism. (3) Replicates of pea aphid clones reared on their own host plant and on a common host plant, fava bean, exhibited the same pattern of resistance as above. Thus, there do not appear to be nutritional or secondary chemical effects on the level of physiological resistance in the aphids due to feeding on clover or alfalfa, and therefore the difference in resistance on the two crops appears to be genetically based. (4) We assayed for genetic variation in resistance among individual pea aphid clones collected from clover fields and found no detectable genetic variation for resistance to parasitism within two populations sampled from clover. This is in contrast to Henter and Via's (1995) report of abundant genetic variation in resistance to this parasitoid within a pea aphid population on alfalfa. Low levels of genetic variation may be one factor that constrains the evolution of resistance to parasitism in the populations of pea aphids from clover, leading them to remain more susceptible than populations of the same species from alfalfa.",Coevolution | Evolution of resistance | Herbivore | Parasitoid | Pea aphid | Population structure | Tritrophic interactions,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We developed a computer simulation model designed to test whether the outcome of reinforcing selection differs in a mosaic and a clinal hybrid zone. Our model was a one-dimensional stepping-stone model. The mosaic and clinal hybrid zones that we modeled were, respectively, a mosaic maintained by differential fitness of the interacting taxa in patchy habitats and a tension zone. We modeled changes in gene frequency at two biallelic loci, A and B. Hybrids at the A locus were selected against. An allele at the B locus caused assortative mating at the A locus, which promoted reinforcement; there was a selective cost to this allele. In a mosaic hybrid zone, spatial variation in the fitness of A-locus homozygotes in different patches caused gene and genotype frequencies at the A and B loci to differ greatly from those in a tension zone. Compared to a tension zone, a mosaic hybrid zone had a broader region in which hybrids could be formed and, thus, a broader region in which the assortative-mating allele provided a net selective advantage (via decreased production of the less fit A-locus hybrids). This caused the assortative-mating allele to be favored under a broader set of conditions in a mosaic hybrid zone than in a tension zone. In mosaic and tension hybrid zones, both low and high levels of migration could prevent the establishment of the allele that promoted reinforcement, but the allele could establish under a wider range of migration rates in a mosaic than in a tension zone. In a tension zone, both low and high levels of selection against A-locus hybrids could prevent the establishment of the assortative-mating allele. In a mosaic hybrid zone, the assortative-mating allele established under lower levels of selection against hybrids than in a tension zone, and high levels of selection did not impede the establishment of this allele.

Past solutions to the problem of G-matrix comparison have dealt with this problem, with varying success, but have tested a single null hypothesis (matrix equality or matrix dissimilarity). Because matrices can differ in many ways, several hypotheses are of interest in matrix comparisons. Flury (1988) has provided an approach to matrix comparison in which a variety of hypotheses are tested, including the two extreme hypotheses prevalent in the evolutionary literature. The hypotheses are arranged in a hierarchy and involve comparisons of both the principal components (eigenvectors) and eigenvalues of the matrix.

However, when examined separately, a negative association was found between selfing rates and ID; plants with large ASD (low-selfing-rate genotypes) tended to have higher ID than ones with small ASD (high-selfing-rate genotypes). Furthermore, the overall lifetime ID for male (12.5%) and female (24%) components of fitness, averaged across two ASD groups, were lower than what is necessary for ID to maintain an evolutionarily stable mixed mating system.

Later components of fitness, flowering, and root and aboveground biomass were also measured. Marker genotypes of young seedlings were scored for 11 enzyme loci and three microsatellite markers. We found a high proportion (about 70%) of families with chlorophyll-deficient seedlings, indicating a high mutational load. We found six significant deviations from 1:2:1 ratio at marker loci of 60 tests in seedlings, with three of these significant at the experimentwide level. Deviations from the expected ratio were assumed to be due to linked viability loci. A graphical and a Bayesian method were used to distinguish between the overdominance and dominance hypotheses.

Results indicated that 52% of the genetic variance was explained by differences among drainages, 43% by differences among continents, but only 5% by differences within drainages, thus supporting geographic patterns of invasions inferred from the phylogeny.

Using a bioassay of resistance to tetrodotoxin (TTX), the primary toxin in the prey, we examined phenotypic evolution in the genus Thamnophis. Reconstruction of ancestral character states suggests that the entire genus Thamnophis, and possibly natricine snakes in general, has slightly elevated TTX resistance compared to other lineages of snakes. While this suggests that T. sirtalis is indeed predisposed to evolving TTX resistance, it also indicates that the potential exists in sympatric congeners not expressing elevated levels of TTX resistance. We also detected significant family level variation for TTX resistance in a species of Thamnophis that does not exhibit elaborated levels of the trait. This finding suggests that evolutionary response in other taxa is not limited by genetic variability.

We used a nested design to analyze the differences in asymmetry at several sampling levels: individual leaves and flowers, individual trees, and genotypes. The clonal repeatability of developmental stability was not significantly different from zero, thus suggesting the absence of heritability of the asymmetry for leaves and flowers under these environmental conditions. No relationship between asymmetry and individual heterozygosity was found, but leaf fluctuating asymmetry was significantly related to particular isozymic genes. Petal and leaf size showed a phenotypically plastic response to the exposure zone of the tree (mainly due to light). Leaf fluctuating asymmetry also showed such a plastic response. No significant correlation was found between asymmetry and any pomological characters (some of these being fitness related). Finally, the hybrid species (atemoya) did not show larger developmental instability than did the parental species (cherimoya). All these data show that cherimoya asymmetry reveals the random nature of developmental noise, with developmental stability for leaves being possibly related to specific chromosome regions, but with weak evidence for genotypic differences in developmental stability.",Annona cherimola | Developmental stability | Fluctuating asymmetry | Heritability | Heterozygosity | Phenotypic quality | Plant plasticity,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

To begin to assess the relative roles of dispersal and vicariance in the establishment of avifaunas, especially intercontinental avifaunas, I applied a test for clocklike behavior in molecular data, as well as a program that infers ancestral areas and dispersal events, to a phylogeny of a speciose, cosmopolitan avian genus (Anthus; Motacillidae). Daughter-lineages above just 25 of 40 nodes in the Anthus phylogeny are evolving in a clocklike manner and are thus dateable by a molecular clock. Dating the applicable nodes suggests that Anthus arose nearly 7 million yr ago, probably in eastern Asia, and that between 6 and 5 million yr ago, Anthus species were present in Africa, the Palearctic, and North and South America. Speciation rates have been high throughout the Pliocene and quite low during the Pleistocene; further evidence that the Pleistocene may have had little effect in generating modern species. Intercontinental movements since 5 million yr ago have been few and largely restricted to interchange between Eurasia and Africa. Species swarms on North America, Africa, and Eurasia (but not South America or Australia) are the product of multiple invasions, rather than being solely the result of within-continent speciation.

If the same forces driving phenotypic divergence are also responsible for speciation, one would predict a correlation between the extent of trophic specialization (reflecting variable intensity of divergent natural selection) and that of reproductive isolation being reached in a given environment. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the extent of morphological and genetic differentiation between sympatric dwarf and normal whitefish ecotypes (Coregonus sp.) from six lakes of the St. John River basin (eastern Canada and northern Maine). Eight meristic variables, 19 morphometric variables, and six microsatellite loci were used to quantify morphological and genetic differentiation, respectively. Dwarf and normal ecotypes in each lake differed primarily by traits related to trophic specialization, but the extent of differentiation varied among lakes. Significant but variable genetic divergence between ecotypes within lakes was also observed. A negative correlation was observed between the extent of gene flow between ecotypes within a lake and that of their morphological differentiation in trophic-related traits. The extent of reproductive isolation reached between dwarf and normal whitefish ecotypes appears to be driven by the potential for occupying distinct trophic niches and, thus, by the same selective forces driving tropic specialization in each lake. These results therefore support the hypothesis of ecological speciation.",Coregonus | Ecotypes | Gasterosteus | Microsatellite | Morphology | Reproductive isolation | Speciation | Sympatry,NA,NA,NA,NA

The model reveals that unpredictability of the selection an individual actually faces leads to the evolutionarily stable bet-hedging reaction norm constituting a compromise between the phenotypic optima in the different patches. We also examine the effect of local density regulation before selection, in the patches in which the individuals develop, and after selection, in the patches in which they are selected. Density regulation before selection has a much lower influence on the evolution of the reaction norm than density regulation after selection. The source-sink structure of the environment caused by differential productivity of patches strongly affects how the compromise bet-hedging strategy weighs the different phenotypic optima and might compromise the local evolutionary stability of the evolved reaction norm. If the strength and variability among patches of density regulation after selection is sufficiently large, no single reaction norm is evolutionary stable. Polymorphic reaction norms constitute the evolutionarily stable population. We also show that a polymorphic reaction norm is more likely to be observed in a less productive habitat.

Most colonies apparently specialize in producing one reproductive sex throughout their life. Allozyme analyses show that relatedness does not differ within male-specialist and female-specialist colonies and they do not appear to differ in available resources. In the population, workers are nearly three times more closely related to females than males; however, the investment sex ratio is near equal (1.01, female/male), which is consistent with queen control. Selection should be strong on workers to increase investment in reproductive females, so why do workers in male-specialist colonies produce only (or nearly only) males? One hypothesis is that queens in male-specialist colonies prevent the occurrence of reproductive females, perhaps by producing worker-biased female eggs. An earlier simulation study of genetic evolution of sex ratios in social Hymenoptera (Pamilo 1982b) predicts that such mechanisms can result in the evolution of bimodal colony sex ratios and queen control.

In this study, I investigated whether the estimated heritability of a condition-dependent secondary sexual character (i.e., the white forehead badge) in the collared flycatcher varied depending on environmental conditions experienced during offspring growth. The data were collected over a period of 14 years making it possible to exploit natural variation in natal conditions. In addition, natal conditions were experimentally altered through brood size manipulations. During unfavorable conditions caused by generally poor weather or experimentally enlarged brood size, no significant heritability based on father-sons regressions could be demonstrated (0.19 ≤ h2 ≤ 0.27). In contrast, sons reared during years with favorable weather or in experimentally reduced broods significantly resembled their fathers (0.44 ≤ h2 ≤ 0.65). In addition, the heritability estimates declined with increasing maternal age. The strong effect of natal environmental condition on the estimated heritability of forehead badge size suggests that the potential genetic benefit from mate choice vary according to environmental conditions (e.g., the benefit is reduced during unfavorable rearing conditions). Because sons reared during poor conditions have probably experienced a natal environment different from that experienced by their fathers, the low heritability estimates obtained under poor conditions seem to be caused by low additive genetic variation expressed in such environments and/or a low genetic correlation between the expression of the trait in the two different environments (i.e., good vs. bad). Both of these explanations imply the presence of genotype-by-environment interactions.

Such findings have been used to argue that Wolbachia have played an important role in insect speciation. Theoretical models, however, indicate that Wolbachia alone are unlikely to lead to stable reproductive isolation between two formerly conspecific populations. Here we analyze the components of reproductive isolation between Drosophila recens, which is infected with Wolbachia, and its uninfected sister species Drosophila subquinaria. Laboratory pairings demonstrated that gene flow via matings between D. recens females and D. subquinaria males is hindered by behavioral isolation. Matings readily occurred in the reciprocal cross (D. quinaria females x D. recens males), but very few viable progeny were produced. The production of viable hybrids via this route was restored by antibiotic curing of D. recens of their Wolbachia symbionts, indicating that hybrid offspring production is greatly reduced by cytoplasmic incompatibility in the crosses involving infected D. recens males. Thus, behavioral isolation and Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility act as complementary asymmetrical isolating mechanisms between these two species. In accordance with Haldane's rule, hybrid females were fertile, whereas hybrid males invariably were sterile. Levels of mtDNA variation in D. recens are much lower than in either D. subquinaria or D. falleni, neither of which is infected with Wolbachia. The low haplotype diversity in D: recens is likely due to an mtDNA sweep associated with the spread of Wolbachia. Nevertheless, the existence of several mtDNA haplotypes in this species indicates that Wolbachia have been present as a potential isolating mechanism for a substantial period of evolutionary time. Finally, we argue that although Wolbachia by themselves are unlikely to bring about speciation, they can increase the rate of speciation in insects.",Behavioral isolation | Cytoplasmic incompatibility | Drosophila | Gene flow | Haldane's rule | mtDNA | Nucleotide diversity | Reproductive isolation | Speciation | Wolbachia,all,All Open Access,NA,NA
