There is a consensus that climate and soil fertility affect understory density and diversity at large scales, but few studies addressed the mechanisms controlling density and diversity locally. Here, I examine patterns of abundance and diversity of three understory herb groups along gradients of soil nutrients and topography at the mesoscale (64 km2) in a wet tropical forest, and possible factors causing them. Herb richness, diversity, density, and cover were measured in fifty-nine 250 x 2 m plots systematically distributed over Reserva Ducke, Manaus. Herb groups responded differently to environmental gradients. Whereas density and cover of pteridophytes increased with altitude and slope, Marantaceae density and cover decreased. Density of sedges increased with altitude, but did not vary with slope. Density and cover of Marantaceae and sedges but not pteridophytes increased with the soil cation content. Pteridophyte richness increased with slope whereas Marantaceae richness decreased, richness of both groups increased with cation content. Diversity increased with altitude for Marantaceae and decreased for pteridophytes. Some of these patterns agree with what is expected from herbs, such as the greater abundance of Marantaceae and sedges in flat and low altitude plots, where water availability is higher and probably also light, and the greater richness of Marantaceae and pteridophytes in higher nutrient plots. The unexpected results of higher abundance and richness of pteridophytes in slopes, instead of in bottomlands, suggest that biotic or litter-mediated controls may be important to set these patterns. © 2006 The Author(s).",Amazon | Competition | Environmental gradients | Establishment windows | Marantaceae | Pteridophytes | Tropical wet forest | Understory plants,NA,NA,NA,NA

The existence of females of two sizes may be the result of alternative female reproductive strategies, intracolony competition for resources, or an incipient caste system in this species.

In this study we characterize the roosting ecology of four sympatric species of Cynopterus in peninsular Malaysia and use these data to address two main questions. (1) Do all four species use modified roosts and, in those that do, is tent-roosting obligate or opportunistic? (2) Do species pairs overlap in roost preferences and roosting habitat and, if so, is there evidence for interspecific interactions in relation to these resources? We radio-tracked bats at two floristically distinct sites and located a total of 249 roosts. Interspecific roost niche overlap was minimal at both sites and we found no evidence for interspecific competition for roost resources at the local level. Species differences in roosting ecology were defined primarily by spatial separation of roosting habitats and secondarily by within-habitat differences in roost selection.

The three parts of the islands did not differ in total number of seeds. Three genera (Byrsonima, Ficus, and Piper) contributed the most seeds to the seed rain. We found differences in the abundance of dispersed seeds probably because of the variation related with the disturbance line, where the savanna matrix interacts with the forest islands.

We determined stable-isotope composition ( 13C/12C and 15N/14N) in whole blood of 14 resident avian species in a tropical dry forest to quantify the origin of their assimilated protein. We used a probabilistic approach (IsoSource) to estimate the relative contribution of C3 plants, CAM-C4 plants, C3 insects, and CAM-C4 insects during the dry and rainy seasons. IsoSource iteratively creates each possible combination of source contribution and produces a distribution of all feasible combinations that adequately predict the observed isotopic signature of the consumer. Granivore-frugivores and granivore-frugivore-insectivores were modeled as predominantly dependent upon plants whereas insectivorous birds were modeled to derive protein almost exclusively from insects. Between these extremes there were several species using mixed diets such as insectivore-frugivores or insectivore-granivores. In most species, virtually all assimilated food was of C3 origin with the exception of Ruddy Ground-Doves (Columbina talpacoti) in which CAM or C4 plants contributed significantly. Seasonal changes in relative food source contribution were followed in eight species of birds. Of these species, White-tipped Doves (Leptotila verreauxi), Grayish Saltators (Saltator coerulescens), and Social Flycatchers (Myiozetetes similis) increased their use of insects in the rainy season, in contrast to Great Kiskadees (Pitangus sulphuratus), which decreased their use of insects.

We selected the 15 most abundant species <10 cm DBH to assess percent survivorship and sprouting responses post fire. Changes in seedling densities for these 15 most abundant species and the 15 least abundant species were analyzed using a repeated measure ANOVA.

We found three major fire-coping strategies among common dry forests plants: resisters (low fire-induced mortality), resprouters (vigorous sprouting), and recruiters (increased seeding post-fire). While survivorship was generally high relative to tropical moist forest species, those species with lower survivorship used either seeding or sprouting as an alternative strategy for persisting in the forest community. Seed dispersal mechanisms, particularly wind dispersal, appear to be an important factor in recruitment success post-fire.

Only 43 trees ≥10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) of 19 species showed signs of consumption at the study site; five of these species were confirmed by direct sighting to be consumed by painted ringtails. We sought to determine if bark of these trees contained important dietary minerals.

On average, eaten trees showed 4.7 and 2.2 times the amount of these minerals, respectively, as found in uneaten trees. Adult males were more likely than adult females or juvenile males to be captured at eaten trees than away from them. Two species of Syzygium and one species of Sloanea were highly selected for bark consumption, but not all trees of a species were eaten; rather, particular individuals of these species were preferred.

Using greenhouse and field experiments, we determined that net photosynthesis, growth rates, and size increased more with light at low than high salinity. At high salinity, the ratio of leaf respiration to assimilation increased fourfold, suggesting that salinity may have contributed to declines in net photosynthesis. Stomatal conductance, leaf-level transpiration, and internal CO2 concentrations were lower at high salinity. Ratios of root mass to leaf mass were higher at high salinity. Stomatal limitations and increased respiratory costs may explain why at high salinity, the seedlings did not respond to increased light availability with increased net photosynthesis. Increased root mass relative to leaf mass suggests that at high salinity, either water or nutrient limitations may have prevented the seedlings from increasing growth with increasing light availability. At both low- and high-salinity zones in the field, seedling survivorship increased with light availability, and the effect of light was stronger at low salinity. However, at low light, survivorship was higher at high than low salinity, indicating that there may be a trade-off between survivorship and growth. The interactive effects observed in the greenhouse were robust in the field, despite the presence of other factors in the field such as inundation and nutrient gradients and herbivory.

Frugivores may be limited by food quality since fruits, unlike leaves, are typically low in protein and minerals. Understanding the factors influencing frugivore population dynamics is particularly important due to rapid habitat loss and the need to construct informed management plans. Therefore, this study used redtail monkeys in Kibale National Park, Uganda as a model frugivore to (1) compare nutrient intake, reproduction, and habitat use patterns for three redtail groups in an unlogged and heavily logged area; and (2) examine relationships between nutrient intake and redtail population densities across five habitats. Feeding time and intake of crude protein, lipids, and minerals were higher in diets consumed by groups in unlogged areas than heavily logged areas. Intake of both copper and sodium intake was below NRC requirement levels suggested for macaques. Food availability in the unlogged areas was 3.5 times higher than the heavily logged area. Across five study sites, absorbable copper and the ratio of copper to caloric intake in redtail diets were significantly related to redtail population density. These results suggest that food quality is an important factor determining frugivore population density in anthropogenically disturbed frugivore habitats. Copper deficiency, which has been associated with population declines of wild herbivores, has the potential to be a key factor limiting densities of frugivores in tropical habitats. © 2006 The Author(s).",Copper | Frugivores | Functional response | Minerals | Primates,NA,NA,NA,NA

Multistoried carton shelves support brood inside culms, and larvae are nourished by honeydew of coccids (Cryptostigma guadua). Constructing a system of stem holes and wicks, C. mirabilis modifies occupied stems in ways that produce passive water evacuation. Nocturnally foraging workers gather both prey and wood fiber, a component of wicks. Diurnally, they boil aggressively from agitated stems, and are attacked by parasitic phorid flies (Diptera: Phoridae). Culms housing C. mirabilis are stouter and more erect than are unoccupied stems but are opened regularly by capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) searching for brood and perhaps reproductive castes. Damaged by monkeys, weak-walled Guadua stems frequently collapse and are abandoned by ants. Breakdown of brood shelves leaves nutrient-rich carton suspended in water within basal internodes, but isotopic analyses fail to show that occupied culms utilize either nitrogen from carton or carbon respired by ants or decomposing debris. Lower foliar nitrogen concentration in occupied than in control stems suggests that coccids and ants parasitize host resources.

Nonetheless, escape from significant vertebrate and invertebrate seed predation plays a prominent role in most hypotheses. The seeds of Pentaclethra macroloba (Fabaceae: Mimosoideae) have long been thought to be virtually immune to predation, contributing to its local dominance in the canopy of some Mesoamerican forests. Here, we describe herbivory by the larvae of Carmenta surinamensis (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) on the seeds of P. macroloba, and report the results of studies designed to clarify how this interaction influences germination, seedling growth, and mortality. To this end, we collected P. macroloba seeds at 30-d intervals for 5 mo along a rain forest transect in Costa Rica. The seeds were monitored in a shade house for 30 d. Adult moths were reared from 43.6 percent of seeds, and significantly affected germination and mortality, and all measures of growth (number of leaves, seedling height, seed and seedling mass at 30 d, and 30-d change in seed and seedling mass). Based on these observations, we conclude that seed boring by C. surinamensis is a potentially important factor influencing population dynamics in P. macroloba, and warrants further investigation for its prospective role in regulating local abundance in this locally dominant and ecologically significant tree. © 2006 The Author(s).",Carmenta surinamensis | Costa Rica | Dominance | Germination | Growth | Mortality | Pentaclethra macroloba | Rain forest | Seed predation | Seedling mortality,NA,NA,NA,NA

Species diversity in a second-growth forest fragment surrounded by timber plantations and second-growth forest was also compared to that of a stand surrounded by old growth forest. The results show that the overall diversity of hypocrealean fungi was inversely proportional to the age of the forest stand, and each family showed different successional trends. Clavicipitaceae was more diverse in the old-growth forest and was positively related to the age of the forest stand. Nectriaceae was highly diverse in the 1- to 2-yr-old stand and less diverse in the old-growth stand. Saprobic and plant pathogenic fungal species were more diverse in the 1- to 2-yr-old stand and their diversity was inversely proportional to the age of the forest stand. The diversity of insect pathogens was positively related to the age of the forest stand. The 20- to 22-yr-old forest fragment had the lowest number of species overall.

Yet, our estimates of annual net nitrogen (N) mineralization showed higher rates in these savannas than in the unburned woodlands, rates that appear to greatly exceed annual N demand by the vegetation. We therefore hypothesized that N should not be limited to the plants growing in these sites. We tested this hypothesis with a 2-yr fertilization experiment. At peak biomass, we found a 30 percent increase in live biomass in plots with N added and no increase in production with only phosphorus (P) added. N and P together were synergistic, suggesting that co-limitation or P limitation becomes important when N is more available. Plants responded to added N by increasing individual leaf area and shoot length by over 50 percent. Tissue N was higher with added N; hence, biomass N was substantially higher. Tissue P concentrations declined with N addition but were elevated by P addition despite lack of a growth response to P alone. Overall, N limitation exists despite high annual rates of net N mineralization, and co-limitation of production by P may occur when N is abundant.

Tree species composition varied among land-use history areas, and our observations suggested that this variation might be influencing the local distribution of W. calcarata. We also measured leaf litter biomass and identified the leaves of litter in areas with and without the orchid. Litter with a high proportion of Buchenavia tetraphylla leaves had more orchids.

Nine salticid species were found to be associated with up to 23 bromeliad species in cerrados (savanna-like vegetation), semideciduous and seasonal forests, coastal sand dune vegetation, restingas, inselbergs, highland forests, chacos, and rain forests at 47 localities in Brazil, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Argentina.

The regional availability of bromeliad species among habitats may explain this pattern of host plant use. More jumping spiders were found on bromeliads in open areas than on bromeliads in the interior of forests.

Focusing on the mountains of Mexico and Central America (M-CA), we estimated the contribution of landsliding to land-cover change at two scales. At the scale of M-CA, we classified the terrain into major landforms and entered in a GIS historical data on earthquake- and rainfall-triggered landslides. At the scale of the Sierra de Las Minas of Guatemala, we investigated Landsat TM data to map rainfall-triggered landslides. During the past 110 yr, >136,200 ha of land in the mountains of M-CA have been affected by landslides, which translates into disturbance rates exceeding 0.317 percent/century. In Sierra de Las Minas, rainfall associated with hurricane Mitch affected 1765 ha of forest, or equivalently, landslides triggered by storms of this magnitude transformed between 0.196 (return time of 500 yr) and 1.290 (return time of 75 yr) percent of forest/century. Although landsliding results in smaller rates of land-cover change than deforestation, we hypothesize that it has a stronger impact on ecosystems, both in qualitative and quantitative terms, given its influence on vegetation and soil. Moreover, interactions between landsliding and deforestation may be altering the expression of this complex process such that the few protected areas in the mountains of M-CA may represent the only possibility for the conservation of this process. © 2006 The Author(s).",Central America | Land-cover change | Landslides | Mexico | Tropical mountains,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Our objective was to assess the long-term effects of previous land use on this forest - i.e., its species composition, structure, and functioning. Previous land-use types included houses, farmlands, and charcoal pits. Stands with these land uses were compared with a nearby mature forest stand. The speed and path of forest recovery after deforestation and land-use abandonment depended on the conditions of the land. Study areas where land uses had removed the forest canopy and altered soil conditions (houses and farmlands) required a longer time to recover and had a different species composition than study areas where land uses retained a forest canopy (charcoal pits). Different forest attributes recovered at different rates. Crown area index, stem density, and litterfall rate recovered faster than stemwood and root, biomass, tree height, and basal area. Where previous land uses removed the canopy, Leucaena leucocephala, a naturalized alien pioneer species, dominated the regrowth. Native species dominated abandoned charcoal pits and mature forest. The change in species composition, including the invasion of alien species, appears to be the most significant long-term effect of human use and modification of the landscape. © 2006 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.","Alien species | Biomass | Caribbean forests | Disturbances | Dry forests | Land-use change, litterfall | Plant diversity | Puerto Rico | Rehabilitation | Secondary succession | Subtropical forests",NA,NA,NA,NA

The destruction levels were estimated by analysis of the distribution of diameter at breast heights of the bigger trees in the inland zones. Variations in species dominance among sites and zones could be explained by interactions of various factors.

Current human demographic trends, including slowing population growth and intense urbanization, give reason to hope that deforestation will slow, natural forest regeneration through secondary succession will accelerate, and the widely anticipated mass extinction of tropical forest species will be avoided. Here, we show that the proportion of potential forest cover remaining is closely correlated with human population density among countries, in both the tropics and the temperate zone. We use United Nations population projections and continent-specific relationships between both total and rural population density and forest remaining today to project future tropical forest cover. Our projections suggest that deforestation rates will decrease as population growth slows, and that a much larger area will continue to be forested than previous studies suggest. Tropical forests retracted to smaller areas during repeated Pleistocene glacial events in Africa and more recently in selected areas that supported large prehistoric human populations. Despite many caveats, these projections and observations provide hope that many tropical forest species will be able to survive the current wave of deforestation and human population growth. A strategy to preserve tropical biodiversity might include policies to improve conditions in tropical urban settings to hasten urbanization and preemptive conservation efforts in countries with large areas of extant forest and large projected rates of future human population growth.

We assessed the extent to which the removal of vegetation in understory plantations of Chamaedorea hooperiana Hodel (Arecaceae) alters understory light conditions. We also examined how any changes in light availability may be reflected by changes in the composition of canopy tree seedlings regenerating in understory plantations. We employed a blocked design consisting of four C. hooperiana plantation sites; each site was paired with an adjacent, unmanaged forest site. Hemispherical canopy photographs were taken and canopy tree seedlings were identified and measured within 12 3 × 2 m randomly placed plots in each site for a total of 96 plots (4 blocks × 2 sites × 12 plots). Plantation management did not affect canopy openness or direct light availability but understory plantations had a higher frequency of plots with greater total and diffuse light availability than unmanaged forest. Comparisons of canopy tree seedling composition between understory plantations and unmanaged forest sites were less conclusive but suggest that management practices have the potential to increase the proportion of shade-intolerant species of tree seedlings establishing in plantations. Given the importance of advanced regeneration in gap-phase forest dynamics, these changes may have implications for future patterns of succession in the areas of forest where NTFPs are cultivated. © 2006 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.","Advanced regeneration | Chamaedorea hooperiana | Enrichment planting | Hemispherical photographs | Los Tuxtlas, Mexico | Non-timber forest products | Seedling composition",NA,NA,NA,NA

I decoupled the relationships among litter depth, food abundance, and nest availability in a 4-mo manipulation of food and leaf litter in a community of litter-nesting ants in a lowland wet forest in Costa Rica. Over 4 mo, 290 1 m2 treatment and control plots were sampled without replacement. Nest densities doubled in response to food supplementation, but did not decrease in response to litter removal or stress (from litter trampling). The supplementation of food increased the utilization of less favored nesting materials. In response to food supplementation and litter trampling, arboreal ants established nests in the litter, and growth rates of the most common ants (Pheidole spp.) increased. Colony growth was independent of colony size and growth rates of the most abundant ants. In general, I conclude that litter-nesting ant density is driven primarily by food limitation, that nest relocation behavior significantly affects access to resource and the demographic structure of this community, and that nest fission may be a method to break the growth-reproduction trade-off. © 2006 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.",Competition | Costa Rica | Density | Leaf litter | Nest relocation | Pheidole | Resource limitation | Solenopsis | Tropical rain forest,NA,NA,NA,NA

Twenty-eight fallows, stratified by four successional stages (early = 1-5 yr, intermediate = 6-10 yr, advanced = 12-20 yr, and older = 22-36 yr), and ten stands of mature forests were sampled. The overstory (plants ≥5 cm diameter at breast height [DBH]) was sampled using a 20 x 50 m plot and the understory (plants <5 cm DBH) in three nested 2 x 5 m subplots. Semistructured interviews provided information on fallow management. Canopy height, basal area, and liana density of the overstory increased with secondary forest age. The early stage had the lowest species density and diversity in the overstory, but the highest diversity in the understory. Species composition and abundance differentiated mature forests and early successional stage from other successional stages; however, species showed individualistic responses across the temporal gradient.

Fruit production rates were low by three logged and one unlogged populations compared to reports from other regions. Commercial-sized trees (>60 cm diameter) were more fecund than noncommercial trees (30-60 cm diameter) at two sites, averaging 14.5 vs. 3.9 fruits/tree/year, respectively, at Marajoara, a logged site, over 8 yr.

Species richness did not differ significantly between control (92 species) and cut (85) forest based on rarefaction to 1200 captures. Fifty-six percent of all species were shared between control and cut forest, compared to the 64 percent shared between control blocks. Higher captures of nectarivores and frugivores in cut forest likely occurred as a consequence of postharvest resource blooms. Higher captures of some insectivores in cut as compared to control forest were unexpected, attributable to increased wandering or shifts from association with midstory to understory as a consequence of habitat alteration. Logging influenced capture rates for 21 species, either consistently, or via positive interaction with physiognomy or time (13 species higher in cut forest and 8 species higher in control forest). Cut understory sites had lower diversity (H′) and scaled dominance than understory and gap sites in control forest. Temporal changes in captures may have resulted from successional dynamics in cut forest: two guilds and three species increased in abundance. Increases in abundances of guilds and particular species were more prevalent in control than in cut forest, suggesting that logging displaced birds to control forest.

Herbaceous plants appeared as important components of the community in all habitats. The removal of low vegetation increased total plant recruitment in all habitats. Considering each growth form, the absence of vegetation increased recruitment in primary forests for herbs, in secondary forests for epiphytes and hemi-epiphytes, in old-fields for trees, and for lianas in primary forests and old-fields. In vegetation removal plots, recruitment of species was greater in pastures, lower in secondary forest, and similar in primary forest with respect to control plots.

The study was carried out in a semideciduous forest fragment of Fazenda Barreiro Rico, southeastern Brazil. Through behavioral sampling of frugivory and defecation events as well as analyses of fecal samples, I determined that A. guariba dispersed fewer species and produced a lower proportion of dung with intact seeds than B. arachnoides. There was no difference between the number of seeds in fecal samples of A. guariba and B. arachnoides. These primates affected to a similar degree both germination percentage and latency to germination of seeds they ingested or removed the pulp from. Howlers and muriquis were also similar in carrying seeds away from the parent trees. Contrary to muriquis, howlers defecated seeds under the canopy of conspecific lianas, where seeds are expected to suffer high mortality rates, and voided seeds predominantly in a clumped pattern. B. arachnoides was a more effective seed disperser when compared to A. guariba in some attributes evaluated, but not in others.

The relative proportions of these three sugars in nectar and fruit in relation to the sugar preferences of pollinators and seed dispersers have received considerable attention. Based on the research of Herbert and Irene Baker and their collaborators, a dichotomy between sucrose-dominant hummingbird-pollinated flowers and hexose-dominant passerine flowers and fruits was proposed. Data on sugar preferences of several hummingbird species (which prefer sucrose) vs. a smaller sample of passerines (which prefer hexoses) neatly fitted this apparent dichotomy. This hummingbird-passerine dichotomy was strongly emphasized until the discovery of South African plants with sucrose-dominant nectars, which are pollinated by passerines that are able to digest, and prefer sucrose. Now we know that, with the exception of two clades, most passerines are able to assimilate sucrose. Most sugar preference studies have been conducted using a single, relatively high, sugar concentration in the nectar (ca 20%). Thus, we lack information about the role that sugar concentration might play in sugar selection. Because many digestive traits are strongly affected not only by sugar composition, but also by sugar concentration, we suggest that preferences for different sugar compositions are concentration-dependent. Indeed, recent studies on several unrelated nectar-feeding birds have found a distinct switch from hexose preference at low concentrations to sucrose preference at higher concentrations. Finally, we present some hypotheses about the role that birds could have played in molding the sugar composition of plant rewards. © 2005 The Author(s).",Digestion | Fruit-eating birds | Hummingbirds | Nectar-feeding birds | Passerines | Physiology | Sucrose | Sugar selection | Sunbirds,NA,NA,NA,NA

Leaves degraded into fragments over a period of 3 mo. Two methods were applied, a direct observational method and a particle filtration protocol. Using a direct method, 104 species were observed, while 53 sporulating taxa and 100 sterile morphotaxa were isolated by particle filtration. Overall patterns of succession were confirmed by both methods, but the relative abundance of species detected differed between the two methods. Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling identified at least four successional stages and suggested that microfungal communities increased in similarity with advancing decay. Data collected by the direct method indicated a slow but steady decline of diversity with advancing decay, whereas an increase in diversity was detected by particle filtration. Synecological succession studies provide a useful tool to identify patterns and generate hypotheses. Understanding the underlying causes of successional patterns will require further autecological studies. © 2005 The Author(s).",Australia | Decomposition | Direct method | Fungal ecology | Particle filtration | Tropical microfungi | Tropical rain forest,NA,NA,NA,NA

We tested the feasibility of tracking bat-dispersed seeds in a Philippine lowland rain forest with the help of fluorescent pigment. The powder was mixed with acetone and sprayed to ripe fruits of fig trees, i.e., Ficus septica and F. variegata. During nightly monitoring using a hand-held ultraviolet lamp bat deposits (seed-containing spat outs and feces) could successfully be detected. Distances and directions of deposit sites to the focal trees were recorded and seed shadow areas were analyzed. Bats dispersed most of the seeds less than 50 m away from the parent plants resulting in seed shadow areas < 0.30 ha in size. An in situ fruit preference experiment showed that fluorescent powder is unlikely to deter bats from feeding on ripe figs. In conclusion, the technique is simple, inexpensive, noninvasive, applicable to different fields of research and allows one to follow the fate of seeds from known sources. © 2005 The Author(s).",Ficus septica | Ficus variegata | Fluorescent pigment | Frugivore | Fruit bats | Lowland rain forest | Philippines | Seed dispersal | Seed shadow | Seed tracking,NA,NA,NA,NA

Activity of four males and five females equipped with radio-transmitters were monitored for 4-7 entire nights each between April and July 2002. Bats exhibited maximum activity around dusk and high activity during the night. Males and females foraged for equal amounts of time in continuous flight (mean: 7 min, maximum 1 h) with interspersed resting phases (mean: 15 min, maximum 3 h). Activity of M. macrophyllum was sensitive to several factors. Time of emergence and return to day roost were correlated with time of sunset and sunrise, respectively. Maximum bat activity coincided with high abundance of aerial insects. Finally, heavy rain caused bats to reduce or cease flight activity. Direct observations and field video recordings support the assumption that M. macrophyllum employs two distinct foraging modes: trawling of insects from and capture of aerial insects at low heights above water. Combination of foraging modes gives M. macrophyllum high flexibility and efficiency in prey search. Activity, foraging mode, and morphology, which are similar to trawling bats from other families, distinguish M. macrophyllum from all other phyllostomid species and grant it access to open habitat above water, a habitat no other phyllostomid bat has conquered. © 2005 The Author(s).",Barro Colorado Island | Chiroptera | Convergent evolution | Foraging behavior | Foraging habitat | Insectivory | Seasonal lowland semideciduous forest | Telemetry,NA,NA,NA,NA

Asplundia alata and R. wendlandii also had the highest frequency of leaves modified per plant. Fidelity of bats to tents was low, although bats used several tents intermittently within a restricted area. Males generally were more faithful to tents than females, although not significantly so. This observation, along with indirect evidence of leaf modification, suggests that males are primarily responsible for tent construction. The two study sites differed in the plants used for roosting and in tent fidelity. Bats in Corcovado used a greater variety of plant species for tent roosting, whereas bats in Golfito were more faithful, suggesting that roosting resources were scarcer at the latter site. © 2005 The Author(s).",Artibeus watsoni | Corcovado | Costa Rica | Golfito | Roosting ecology | Tent fidelity | Tent-making,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition, we assessed vertical partitioning of these assemblages by comparing the ground and lower vegetation strata within each habitat. Ants attracted to sardine baits were collected along transects in 39 savanna and 34 forest sites scattered over a 16 km × 16 km landscape. There were about twice as many species in the forest as in the savanna, and within both habitats, we collected more species on the ground than in the vegetation. Similar results were obtained when analyzing data at the level of individual transects, indicating that ant species richness is affected by both habitat and strata. About two-thirds of the species recorded in the savanna were also found in the forest. Within both habitats, a large proportion of the species found in the least species-rich stratum (vegetation) were also found in the richer one (ground). However, ordination analysis, using data from individual transects, revealed that different habitats and strata can be clearly discriminated from each other in terms of their ant species composition. Each habitat and stratum had a number of characteristic (indicator) species which, although generally not exclusive to that particular habitat and stratum, predominated there. Our findings indicate that habitat and strata specialization is an important factor governing the organization of ant communities in Amazonia. © 2005 The Author(s).",Amazon | Ants | Beta diversity | Brazil | Coexistence | Community structure | Indicator species | Species richness | Stratification,NA,NA,NA,NA
