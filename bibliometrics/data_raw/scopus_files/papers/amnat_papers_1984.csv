Removal of Katharina from 2 large areas resulted (over 3yr) in a dramatic rise in macroalgal cover and the disappearance of limpets. Artificially increased densities of Katharina at another site led to greater limpet abundances and increased reproductive output of both limpets and chitons. The probable mechanism for these changes is the ability of macroalgae to outcompete microalgae and monopolize the substratum, removing both the food and the habitat of the limpets. The specialist limpets thus depend on the generalist chiton to remove macroalgae and allow diatom growth. However, the hierarchical nature of the prey-prey competition and the ability of Katharina to consume the dominant prey prevents this dependence from being reciprocal.

The transition is abrupt for protozoa swimming at low Reynolds number, but it is more gradual for fish swimming at high Reynolds number. Consideration of fluid mechanics leads to the conclusion that filter feeding with reciprocating appendages is suboptimal for large animals (eg vertebrates) that operate at high Reynolds number. Optimal size of a foraging animal depends on the environmental density of the animal's food, on its swimming efficiency and on its metabolic efficiency. At high food sensities small animals have the greatest potential growth rate; at low food densities small animals will starve while larger animals are still able to grow. Increased swimming efficiency or metabolic efficiency will increase the optimal size at low density. Under exploitative competition for food, larger animals will exclude smaller animals under all food conditions, but since predation seems to be the dominant structuring agent in open-water communities, competitive interactions rarely proceed to exclusion. We may thus expect that the distribution of body sizes of groups of aquatic organisms reflect the general abundance of food, expressed as the productivity of the habitat.

Altmann and Wagner (1978) formulated this energy-maximization goal as a problem in linear optimization (""linear programming').

On the near island, however, Microtus is restricted to its typical habitat (grasslands) by Blarina, which appears to prey most heavily on the juvenile voles. The primary means of immigration of mammals in the Thousand Island Region is across the river's ice cover in winter. Consistent with the immigrant selection hypothesis, winter track surveys revealed that Microtus utilized the ice more frequently, traveled further, and dispersed over a greater range of air temperatures than did Blarina. As predicted by the immigrant selection hypothesis, insular body size of Microtus and Blarina increases with isolation. Predatory exclusion of Microtus by Blarina was evidenced by an inverse correlation between Microtus and Blarina densities on both insular and mainland sites. Introductions of Blarina onto islands inhabited by Microtus resulted in declines in Microtus densities, extinction of Microtus on one island, and a drastic reduction in juvenile survivorship. Thus, because of its broad niche and superior immigration abilities, Microtus is an excellent colonizer of depauperate (small or isolated) islands.

When a high-ranked regular disappears during the winter, it is rapidly replaced not by the flock's next highest regular, but by the dominant local switcher of the appropriate sex. A young bird entering the flock system as it forms in early fall must choose to be a regular in one flock, or to be a flock switcher. When flocks form, high-ranked regular slots will probably be filled first, followed by top-ranked switcher positions; only later will the lowest regular slots be filled. The present mixed strategy of the study population, with c20% switchers and 80% regulars, is evolutionarily stable.-from Author",80,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,46,NA,NA

Patterns of covariation are strongly influenced by classwide correlations with a single trait, average adult female length; they are further influenced by the effects of family and genus, but the differences between the 2 orders of reptiles analyzed are entirely accounted for by the correlations with size. Thus, much of the tendency for traits to covary in the pattern originally thought to have been produced by r- and K-selection can be explained by selection on size alone followed by coadaptive shifts in life history traits. However, the pattern described here is also consistent with an adaptationist interpretation that would assert that both size and life history traits have been shaped by the same environmental conditions. In the residual variation, following the removal of correlations with size, there are significant effects of higher taxonomic levels, suggesting that lineage-specific differences in life histories, either constrained by or coadapted with morphological differences, can explain some of the tendency for life histories to be found in certain patterns.-from Author",72,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,47,NA,NA

This 'age-specific component' of niche width is analyzed for a desert scorpion Paruroctonus mesaensis, whose populations exhibit both instars and discrete year classes. Another purpose of this paper is to evaluate if instars or year classes function as 'ecological species' by showing the same differences in morphology and resource use as exists between biological species. Successive instars exhibited growth ratios (Dyar's constant), greater than Hutchinson's Santa Rosalio ratio and were significantly different in the size of prey eaten. Differences in actual prey eaten, however, were less than the differences that exist between most species. The 3 year-classes are fairly distinct in patterns of prey size and use: differences are well within the range of interspecific differences. Young and adults are less similar in all parameters of size and resource use than are the majority of species pairs. The differences between young and intermediate year-classes are typical of the differences observed between many species. Under conditions of reduced interspecific competition, there is selective pressure for age groups to diverge in resource use.

This suggests proportionately greater losses from broods of larger adults and supports the allometry hypothesis for the association of small adult size and brooding. Allocation to reproductive effort as a male is low in A. phylactica. Production of eggs is the same as in nonbrooding asterinids. The lower reproductive effort as males is possibly a result of self-fertilization and also some breeding in pairs. These observations suggest that gain from increased production of male gametes is more limited than gain from increased production of female gametes, and the hypothesis that simultaneous hermaphroditism is associated with brooding because of limited capacity to brood offspring is rejected. An alternative hypothesis for the association of brooding and hermaphroditism is prompted by the observation that when simultaneous hermaphroditism occurs in echinoderm species with separate sexes, there is no block to self fertilization. Self-fertilizing viability from breeding are both low. Inbreeding depression from selfing should be lowest in populations with no dispersal phase, as is the case for many brooders, because these animals are already inbred even when there are separate sexes.

Different types of variation, such as intraclutch and interclutch variation in egg size are distinguished. Evidence suggests that, as an adaptation to an unpredictable offspring environment, a single female may produce a seemingly maladaptive egg as a result of selection operating to maintain developmental plasticity in the vitellogenic process. The developmental mechanisms which generate such seemingly stochastic variation are called 'adaptive coin-flipping'. The properties of the developmental 'coin' (which can be two-sided or many-sided, fair or weighted) can evolve as a result of differences among individuals in sensitivities of vitellogenesis to environmental variation or as a result of individual differences in unresolvable developmental noise.

Nonoptimal habitat selection or interference between predators makes prey that have either low intrinsic growth rates or high rates of predator attack vulnerable to density reductions or extinction, as a result of predator 'spillover' between patches. 2) If prey are spatially segregated, the predator population may be broken into 2, partially independent subpopulations coupled by random predator movement. If each prey grows exponentially in the absence of predation, the permissible difference in their sensitivities to predation is bounded by a measure of spatial coupling.

A minimum critical distance effect occurs because of 100% progeny mortality within a given distance of adults. Data describing the spacing dynamics of Dipteryx panamensis support both hypotheses. From 7 mo to 2 yr postgermination, seedling survival was positively correlated with distance to adult and negatively correlated with local conspecific seedling density. Partial correlation was used to separate the effects of density and distance. Seedling density was the only significant factor in this case. No seedlings or juveniles survived within 8 m of an adult bole. A review of 24 data sets on tropical woody plants showed that most evidence indicates either density-dependence or distance-dependence in progeny mortality. Some positive evidence also exists for the minimum critical distance effect for tropical trees. -from Authors",424,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,94,NA,NA

Thus, evolution of insects generally follows that of the plants (""sequential evolution'). Because the selection pressure exerted by insect attacks is weak or lacking, they could not have been the main cause of the appearance and maintenance of allelochemicals in plants. Nevertheless, these compounds basically determine the plants 'biochemical profile' by which the insects distinguish between host and nonhost plants. Interspecific competition is largely lacking among phytophagous insects in natural communities, so it could not have evoked stenophagy (ie resource partitioning) in the insects. The dominance of stenophagous forms can be explained by 1) the adaptive advantages of stenophagy over euryphagy; 2) the emergence of new stenophagous forms from similar or euryphagous forms; and 3) the evolutionary irreversibility of developing stenophagy. Thus, plants have not become resistant to insects, but the insect species have become, or were ever since their emergence, particular in food selection. Host plant selection is mainly a behavioral process which is governed primarily by chemoreception. Therefore, the emergence of specific insect/host plant relationships most likely results from evolutionary changes in the insects' chemosensory systems. Adaptation to the nutritional quality of the new host plant is a secondary process.-Author",317,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,95,NA,NA

Current models of optimal territoriality, however, do not directly address this fact. The model developed in this paper, which treats prey density and intruder pressure as random variables rather than constants, indicates that some territorial strategies suggested by current models may do poorly in terms of the probability of starvation. The deterministic energy maximizer strategy, however, may often lead to a rough approximation of that territory size which minimizes the probability of starvation. Qualitative predictions derived from the stochastic approach and its current, deterministic analogues, such as an inverse relationship between prey density and territory size, are often in agreement. The prediction that a nonbreeding territory owner will spend much of its time inactive and defend excess, uneaten food is unique to the stochastic approach, and appears to be supported by much of the evidence available in the current literature. -Author",18,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,98,NA,NA

A new polyploid may persist by replacing its diploid parent as a result of the combination of a very small diploid population, the existence of an unstable equilibrium between the 2 cytotypes, and chance events (probably the most common route); by coexisting with it as the result of niche separation; or by outcompeting and replacing it (probably very rare). However, the conditions for all of these possibilities are quite restrictive.

Later-leafing trees are characterized by having distinctly larger-diameter xylem vessels produced in their early, spring wood (ring-porous wood anatomy) and/or, especially in diffuse-porous species, relatively high numbers of vessels per unit wood volume. Both these traits contribute to greater maximum potential water conduction capacity. Among diffuse-porous species earlier leafing is also associated with greater indeterminancy of shoot growth; the earliest-leafing taxa initially flush only a few early leaves followed by a series of individual morphologically distinct late leaves on some shoots through the summer (heterophylly).
