In all the groups each rat received 50 L3. The highest rates of infection (51.5%) were obtained by the intraperitoneal route, followed by oral inoculation (47.1%). Poor results were observed (10.5%) subcutaneously.",2,615323,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,1

C. pipiens showed only low intestinal infections and R. prolixus did not permit development of the parasite. It is postulated that, in addition to the transmission of T. rotatorium by leeches, batrachophilic mosquitoes may transmit the parasite to frogs of more terrestrial habits by being ingested by these anurans.",10,615322,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,2

Quantitative study,Aragón F.,Revista de biologia tropical,00347744,25,2,171-178,1977-12-01,December 1977,"The venom of the Central American Bothrops asper, previously classified as B. atrox, is very rich in carbohydrates, both in the free state and forming a part of glycoproteins. It also contains neutral sugars (hexoses), methylpentoses, hexosamines and sialic acid. There is a significant difference in the quantity of carbohydrates in the venom of B. asper as compared to that of the South American B. atrox, thus further documenting the different taxonomic position of these two species.",2,615321,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,3

Condition of the mollusk recently collected",Fernández B.,Revista de biologia tropical,00347744,25,1,101-107,1977-07-01,July 1977,"During the first six months of 1970 we collected 16 lots of the bivalve Anadara tuberculosa from two areas within the Gulf of Nicoya, Costa Rica. These were examined bacteriologically and the coliform levels found in all of them were such that they had to be graded as not satisfactory for human consumption, according to generally accepted norms. The source of these coliforms is attributed to the sewage discharge of the city of Puntarenas into its estuary.",3,335460,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,4
