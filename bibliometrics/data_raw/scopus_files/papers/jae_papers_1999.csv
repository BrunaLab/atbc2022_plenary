Breeding habitat quality strongly affects fitness. Therefore, individuals are likely to select their breeding habitat after gathering information on quality of potential breeding patches. In the study reported in this paper, we investigated whether local reproductive success of conspecifics in a patch (patch reproductive success, PRS) could be used to assess habitat quality and make dispersal decisions in a non colonial, hole-nesting, passerine bird, the collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis). 2. Assumptions for such a breeding habitat selection mechanism were met: the habitat patches were of different quality, as measured by PRS, with relative quality varying between years, and PRS was autocorrelated in time. 3. As in many other species, breeding dispersal was related in both sexes to individual reproductive success before dispersal: unsuccessful individuals were more likely to disperse than successful ones. 4. Additively, PRS influenced both breeding and natal dispersal. This effect depended on sex. Dispersal was negatively related to PRS in females, and positively in males with low competitive ability (juvenile and unsuccessful adult males). 5. Breeding dispersal was positively related to flycatcher density in males, but negatively in females. Moreover, when included in the analyses, laying date of the previous breeding attempt (which should be correlated with competitive ability) replaced the effect of PRS in adult males. 6. The observed patterns can be explained by PRS (or another variable correlated with PRS) being used to assess different components of habitat quality in each sex, in relation to intraspecific competition pressure. We suggest that males of low competitive ability may either use PRS to assess the level of expected intraspecific competition the following year, and choose to disperse from high PRS woodlands, or be forced to disperse when PRS is high because of strong competition. Females might use PRS to assess the expected reproductive output if breeding in the patch the following year.",140,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Conspecific cues | Dispersal | Environment predictability | Habitat quality | Spatial scale,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,1

We present data on the temporal dynamics of six viruses that infect lions (Panthera leo) in the Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania. These populations have been studied continuously for the past 30 years, and previous research has documented their seroprevalence for feline herpesvirus, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline calicivirus, feline parvovirus, feline coronavirus and canine distemper virus (CDV). A seventh virus, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV), was absent from these animals. 2. Comprehensive analysis reveals that feline herpesvirus and FIV were consistently prevalent at high levels, indicating that they were endemic in the host populations. Feline calici-, parvo- and coronavirus, and CDV repeatedly showed a pattern of seroprevalence that was indicative of discrete disease epidemics: a brief period of high exposure for each virus was followed by declining seroprevalence. 3. The timing of viral invasion suggests that different epidemic viruses are associated with different minimum threshold densities of susceptible hosts. Furthermore, the proportion of susceptibles that became infected during disease outbreaks was positively correlated with the number of susceptible hosts at the beginning of each outbreak. 4. Examination of the relationship between disease outbreaks and host fitness suggest that these viruses do not affect birth and death rates in lions, with the exception of the 1994 outbreak of canine distemper virus. Although the endemic viruses (FHV and FIV) were too prevalent to measure precise health effects, there was no evidence that FIV infection reduced host longevity.",152,Journal,ar,Article,100,9,9,Epidemic | Population density | Seroprevalence | Susceptibles | Virulence,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,2

In the Aland islands of SW Finland, the parasitoid Cotesia melitaearum (Wilkonson) is a specialist on the Glanville fritillary butterfly, Melitaea cinxia (L.), which uses two host plants, Plantago lanceolata (L.) and Veronica spicata (L.). 2. Extensive survey data on the butterfly and parasitoid populations collected in 1994-97 were used to examine possible associations of parasitoid colonizations and extinctions, with host population isolation, host population size, and host diet (plant species). 3. The likelihoods of parasitoid colonization and host patch occupancy were found to increase with decreasing isolation from other parasitoid populations, increasing host population size and an increasing fraction of host larvae on V. spicata. The likelihood of parasitoid population extinction increased with decreasing host population size and decreasing fraction of hosts on V. spicata. The pattern of association was exceptional in one area of high-density parasitoid populations as well as during a year of many extinctions but few colonizations. 4. Among host populations occupied by C. melitaearum, the fraction of host larval groups parasitized was higher in host populations using the more rare host plant, V. spicata. If host larval groups were present on both host plant species within one host population, then the larval groups on V. spicata were more likely to be parasitized. 5. The large-scale population dynamics of the parasitoid wasp are influenced by the distribution of the two host plants of the butterfly, by host-plant-dependent parasitoid behaviour and by host butterfly oviposition preference. 6. Possible explanations for the apparent superiority of V. spicata for C. melitaearum as the host butterfly's host plant are discussed. These include host larval group size, larval web structure, plant spatial aggregation, plant chemistry, and host larval physiology and phenology.",43,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Cotesia melitaearum | Foraging behaviour | Population dynamics | Population extinction | Tritrophic,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,4

We tested the condition-dependent hypothesis of sexual advertisement in house sparrows (Passer domesticus). Male house sparrows have a bib of black feathers which serves as both a badge of social status and as a cue for female choice. We manipulated environmental conditions during the premoult period of juvenile house sparrows kept in outdoor aviaries. Birds were assigned to two treatments differing in the amount of dietary proteins, which are known to affect the expression of immune response in birds. We tested whether birds in the protein-rich group had better immune responses and developed larger bibs than birds reared on a protein-poor diet. We also checked whether immune response was a predictor of survival and parasite resistance. 2. Individuals with higher cellular immune response at capture had greater probability to survive during the 3 months of the experiment, and they had a higher probability to recover from infection with Haemoproteus sp. (a blood parasite). Conversely, birds with high immunoglobulin concentrations at capture had a higher probability of mortality. 3. Birds on the protein-rich diet had a higher cellular immune response compared to birds in the protein-poor treatment. Humoral immune response showed the opposite pattern, being higher for birds in the protein-poor treatment. We did not find any effect of food quality on the development of the badge, assessed as the size of the trait and its colour properties. 4. In conclusion, our results support the view that immune defences are important for survival and parasite resistance in natural populations, and that they might be costly to produce. On the other hand, we did not find support for the condition-dependent hypothesis of sexual advertisement, suggesting that the badge may not be a costly trait to produce. However, badge size could reflect other aspects of condition. The kind of pigments involved in colour signals may be the key factor determining the production costs of such traits.",193,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Immune response | Immunoglobulins | Parasite resistance | Sexual signals | Survival | T-cell response,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,5

The gypsy moth is one of many early spring-feeding Lepidoptera that have outbreaks. Previous work has revealed that mortality from natural enemies varied between egg hatch dates separated by only a few weeks. However, this phenology effect was confounded with density differences caused by differential dispersal and early larval survival of the releases. 2. Five different densities of larvae were released at two different times in early spring, and monitored for the causes and amount of mortality in the field. We thus sought to separate the effects of timing and density on mortality. 3. Mortality in the larval stages due to parasitoids, disease and physiological causes was density-dependent for both release date treatments, but the slope of the mortality vs. density line was much steeper for the early release. Total mortality over the entire generation, which included additionally mortality from predation, was density-dependent for the early release but not for the late release. 4. The timing of egg hatch thus affects fecundity, mortality from natural enemies and the form of the relationship between density and mortality. These compounding effects may help explain why spring-feeding insects are liable to have outbreaks.",18,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Density dependence | Parasitoids | Population dynamics,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,6

Foraging behaviour, diet and interference competition were examined for two morphologically similar charrs, Salvelinus malma (Dolly Varden) and S. leucomaenis (white-spotted charr), under varying food resource conditions over four summers in a Japanese mountain stream. Data were used to test predictions from a mechanistic model of resource partitioning developed from an earlier field experiment. 2. The charrs adopted one of two distinct foraging modes, ambushing drifting invertebrates from relatively fixed foraging positions or actively searching for benthic prey over large areas. The proportion of benthos foragers increased markedly when drifting prey declined, and was much greater in S. malma than S. leucomaenis when drift was lean, upholding predictions made from our earlier experiment. 3. For drift foragers of both species, frequency of foraging attempts decreased as drift rate declined, and aggressive encounters increased. In contrast, for benthos foragers of both species the frequency of foraging attempts was essentially constant across the range of benthos biomass measured, and aggressive encounters remained low. 4. Salvelinus leucomaenis ate larger drifting prey than S. malma, even though the former charr were smaller. In contrast, S. malma foraged on benthic prey at a higher rate than S. leucomaenis, although there was no difference in prey mass. Thus, the optimal point to shift to benthic foraging is at a higher drift threshold for S. malma than S, leucomaenis, most probably due to differences in jaw morphology. Moreover, because dominance for favourable drift foraging positions was based on size alone, S. malma shifted to benthos foraging at a larger size than S. leucomaenis, as predicted by a simple model. 5. Charr consumed distinct prey types according to their foraging mode. Drift foragers primarily ate terrestrial invertebrates, whereas benthos foragers ate mainly chironomid larvae. Consequently, diet overlap was high when drift was abundant and both species were drift foragers, but declined as drift declined and S. malma shifted to benthos foraging. Therefore, species-specific differences in foraging mode shifts across the resource gradient explained the flexible resource partitioning we observed, and probably account for the coexistence of these congeneric charrs in zones of sympatry in northern Japan.",156,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Behavioural mechanisms of interference competition | Foraging mode shifts | Mechanistic approach | Resource partitioning | Stream salmonids,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,7

A reduction in forest area should result in a reduction of its number of species and, moreover, do so in a characteristic way according to the familiar species-area relationship. Brooks, Pimm and Collar (1997) applied this formula to the losses in forest area in the Philippines and Indonesia. Independently derived totals of the number of endemic bird species that are threatened with extinction broadly agree with these predicted losses. In some cases, however, predicted losses overestimate or underestimate the actual numbers of threatened species. 2. Within an island, the proportionate deforestation to date might be most extensive where there are many endemic species, or where there are few. To test this possibility, we obtained recent forest cover data for the region. We separated lowland (< 1000 m a.s.l.) from montane (> 1000 m a.s.l.) forest cover by overlaying topographic maps. From these data, we predict separately the numbers of montane and lowland endemic bird species likely to become extinct as a result of deforestation. We then compared these totals with the numbers considered threatened in the latest Red List. 3. Our predictions based on deforestation closely match the numbers of threatened endemic birds in the lowlands, but underestimate them in montane regions. 4. Our predictions based on deforestation underestimate the number of threatened montane mammal species even more seriously. 5.

Common frogs (Rana temporaria) breed readily in small pools and thus expose their offspring to catastrophic mortality by desiccation. Amphibian larvae exhibit considerable phenotypic plasticity in metamorphic traits, and some species respond to environmental uncertainty by metamorphosing earlier and at smaller size. In a factorial laboratory experiment, we studied whether common frog tadpoles possess this ability. 2. We also studied the interaction between pool drying and predation risk, because in a previous study the presence of a predatory dragonfly larva delayed metamorphosis of the tadpoles. 3. We gradually removed water from half the experimental containers, while in the other half the water volume was kept constant. In the laboratory it was possible to remove the effect of increased water temperature in the decreasing volume treatment by using fluorescent lights. Tadpoles responded to decreasing volume by metamorphosing earlier and at smaller size. A greater proportion of the tadpoles metamorphosed in the decreasing volume treatment. 4. Tadpoles were less active at decreasing water level and there were significant positive correlations between activity late in the experiment and metamorphic size. This suggests that the metamorphic response to habitat drying is behaviourally mediated. 6. Early in the experiment, tadpoles developed slower in the presence of predators. At metamorphosis presence of a dragonfly larva had no effect in the whole data set, but when the constant volume treatment was analysed separately, larval period was longer in the presence of a predator. 7. Our results indicate that common frog larvae are able to respond to pond-drying adaptively by speeding up their development, and that temperature advantage is not needed to induce this adaptive plasticity. Furthermore, pond-drying seems to be a more important determinant of development rate than the presence of odonate predators.",153,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Adaptive plasticity | Amphibians | Desiccation risk | Metamorphosis | Temperature,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,11

Body size is commonly tied to major life history traits in many animals. The main problem with studies on this topic is that the range of body sizes within species is generally too small to produce enough variation in traits for quantitative analysis. The snow petrel shows considerable differences in body size with structural body size varying by ≃ 1.6-fold. This high variability in size provides a good opportunity for examining how life history traits are related to body size intraspecifically. 2. We studied the breeding phenology, foraging parameters and chick growth in relation to body size in two populations of snow petrel in Antarctica. We also investigated the relationship between body size and distance separating colony from the edge of the pack ice using morphometric data from 16 breeding stations. 3. The largest snow petrels laid eggs ≃ 2-fold larger and hatched hatchlings ≃ 1.9-fold heavier than smallest ones. During the chick rearing period the smallest adults made longer foraging trips (≃ 70 h) and fed their chick less frequently than the largest ones (≃ 40 h). Meal size was positively related to adult body size. 4. Chicks raised by large parents grew more rapidly, reached higher peak mass and asymptotic size than chicks raised by small parents. Chick body size at fledging was correlated to the size of their biological parents. A sample of 20 chicks from parents that differed in body size were swapped. Body size of swapped chicks at fledging was not correlated to their foster parent size. Swapped chicks tended to resemble their biological parents in size but no significant relationship was found. 5. These results provide evidence of intraspecific variability in several ecological variables and life history traits linked to body size. The difference in foraging trip duration between large and small birds was not only because of a lower flight speed or a higher metabolic rate per mass unit of smaller birds and suggests that small birds had lower feeding efficiency or fed on more distant areas. This was reinforced at the population level by a negative correlation obtained between body size and distance between colony and the edge of the pack ice for 16 breeding stations. 6.

The migratory wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus (Burchell)) population of Serengeti has been monitored for 40 years (1958-1998). The population increased from 1963 to 1977, stabilized from 1977 to 1993 and declined during drought in 1993-94. These changes provided a significant contrast in densities and the opportunity to determine the life history stages where survival was density dependent and their causes. 2. There was a delay in age of maturity and a decline of both yearling and adult pregnancy rates at higher densities. Changes in yearling pregnancy had minimal effect on number of calves born. Adult pregnancy rate dropped from 95% to 88% 3. The greatest absolute mortality occurred in newborn calves (0-4 months old). The most variable survival was in dry-season calf mortality (5-11 months old). 4. Density dependence was clearly present in adult mortality and this appeared to be the regulating life stage. Density dependence was also found in dry-season calf mortality. The drop in pregnancy rate was only weakly density dependent. 5. The main cause of mortality (75% of cases) was undernutrition. Bone marrow condition showed that more animals died in extremely poor condition as the population increased and predators did not cause these deaths. 6. Predation played only a minor role in limiting the wildebeest population. Predators caught animals in moderate condition during the increase phase and increasingly healthy condition during years of high population density. The main predators were lion [Panthera leo (Linnaeus)] and hyaena (Crocuta crocuta Erxleben). 7. Adult mortality was significantly negatively related to food per capita. This could be viewed either as curvilinear density dependence, or as two phases of mortality. The first phase was during population increase when mortality was inversely density dependent and may have been caused by a constant predation rate. The second was during stability and decline and comprised the additive effects of undernutrition and predation. 8. Rainfall in the dry season was the most important extrinsic determinant of food supply for the wildebeest population but food was related to mortality only when population density was incorporated. 9. At present the wildebeest population appears regulated by natural causes through food supply. Human-caused mortality appears to be a minor factor. However, if the number of wildebeest killed by humans increases as human population increases, then there could be a permanent decline in wildebeest, and a major change in the whole ecosystem, because wildebeest are the keystone species.

We analysed the relationships between species richness, island area, and habitat diversity for birds, bats, butterflies, and reptiles and amphibians on 19 islands in the Lesser Antilles. Habitat diversity was quantified by Simpson's index based on the total areas of five vegetation types on each island. Island area varied over two orders of magnitude (13-1510 km2) and habitat diversity varied between 1 and 3.7 equivalents of equally abundant habitat types. 2. Because the Lesser Antilles consist of an inner arc of high, volcanic islands and an outer arc of low-lying islands formed of uplifted marine sediments, correlations between area and elevation (r2 = 0.32) and between area and habitat diversity (r2 = 0.40) were weak. Habitat diversity was, however, strongly correlated with maximum island elevation (r2 = 0.85). 3. Simple correlations of species richness with island area were significant for all four faunal groups, and simple correlations of species richness with elevation and habitat were significant for all groups except bats. In multiple regressions of species richness on area and habitat diversity together, area was a significant effect for birds and bats, and habitat diversity was a significant effect for birds, butterflies, and reptiles and amphibians. 4. These results suggest that the four Lesser Antillean taxonomic groups differ in their responses to area and habitat diversity. For butterflies and for reptiles and amphibians, the relationship of species richness to area is probably a fortuitous consequence of a relationship between habitat diversity and area. Bird species richness responds independently to both habitat diversity and area, and bat species richness is influenced by area but not by habitat diversity. 5. We suggest that this variation is related to differences in several biological traits of the different faunal groups. Strong habitat-diversity effects are likely in taxa with high degrees of habitat specialization, populations large enough to have a low probability of stochastic extinction, life-cycles that include a resistant resting stage that reduces vulnerability to catastrophic extinction, or a combination of these traits. In contrast, strong area effects are likely in taxa with weak habitat specialization, low population density, or both. 6. At least in Lesser Antillean birds, it is unlikely that immigration depends on island size. Therefore, the species-area relationship for birds is probably generated by island-size-dependent extinction. Among the four taxonomic groups we studied, only butterflies are likely to show a 'rescue effect' stemming from frequent between-island movement of individuals, as only butterflies exhibited low levels of endemism and lacked a unique area effect for species richness. 7. Considered in concert, these taxon-specific differences demonstrate that both biological characteristics of organisms and geographical features of island groups mediate the relative contribution of island area and habitat diversity to variation in species richness.",353,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Area effects | Habitat diversity | Island biogeography | Lesser Antilles | Species-area relationship,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,14

The differences in the shapes of these responses can be explained by the fact that bite size declines with decreasing algal biomass. 3. There was little interference between the geese; the rate of aggression was only weakly related to goose density, and time spent feeding decreased only slightly with increasing density. 4.

The observed pattern of aggregation was weaker than that predicted by the ideal free distribution with a low value of interference. 6.

Organisms are continuously faced with the problem of making decisions about allocation of limiting resources to maintenance and reproduction. This paradigmatic principle leads to the prediction that each individual will have to trade competing activities affecting fitness, with natural selection favouring the evolution of optimal life-history strategies. 2. In the present study we tested for the existence of a trade-off between parental survival and progeny quality and number in the biparental barn swallow (Hirundo rustica, Linnaeus) by recording survival from one breeding season to the next of adults, whose first brood size had been either increased or reduced by one nestling. 3. Quality of offspring was expressed as body mass, body size and the ability to mount a T-lymphocyte cell-mediated immune response, in vivo, to a mitogenic stimulus, mimicking the reaction to an antigenic challenge to the immune system. 4. Both adult male and female barn swallows were less likely to survive when their offspring had greater immunocompetence. Adult females were also less likely to survive when offspring had larger body size but smaller body mass. Brood enlargement reduced survival of adult males and had a differentially larger negative effect on survival of double-brooded than single-brooded adult females. Double-broodedness did not covary with adult male survival but had a differentially larger effect on survival of adult females with enlarged compared to reduced broods. Males with relatively long ornamental tail feathers were more likely to survive than those with short tails. 5. We conclude that parent barn swallows trade their own survival against features of nestlings that affect their probability of recruitment.

It is widely accepted that the arrival order of migratory birds is correlated with the condition of the birds, which leads to high quality individuals occupying prime sites. However, the theoretical backgrounds for this argument have been lacking. A simple game-theoretic model of arrival timing is provided which investigates the evolutionary stability of condition-dependent arrival order in territorial migrant birds. 2. Competition for territories or other priority-dependent benefits can lead to arrival dates far preceding the cost-minimizing date (the optimum date in the absence of competition) for all but the weakest individuals. Increasing the number of competitors can generate a 'cascading' competition for early arrival, which advances arrival dates further apart from the individual optimum dates for the onset of breeding. 3. At equilibrium, arrival order corresponds strictly to condition order only if marginal costs of advancing arrival are always larger for individuals in lower condition. If spring mortality vacates territories for later-arriving birds, the criterion for 'honest' arrival order becomes still stricter: differential survival costs should exist, but survival differences among individuals (or, alternatively, territory quality differences) should not be very large. 4. If the habitat is saturated so that there is a risk of not obtaining a territory at all, or if worst territories are of much lower value than the rest, competition may lead to the majority of the population arriving within a fairly short interval, followed by a much later floating fraction. This synchrony in the arrival of breeders imposes an increasing cost for the lesser fit breeding birds. Thus, arrival costs paid are not necessarily highest for earliest arriving individuals, but for those who have the most to lose if they drop a few steps in the arrival order. 5. Competition for high quality territories can also lead to partial migration, in which case birds in good condition are expected to be most likely to remain resident.",557,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Floating | Partial migration | Protandry | Seasonal optimization | Territory acquisition,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,17

Gyrfalcon predation on ptarmigan during the breeding season was studied in north-east Iceland 1981-97. The ptarmigan population went through a complete 10-year cycle of numbers with a 4.3-fold difference in density between high and low years. The yearly number of occupied gyrfalcon territories was correlated with ptarmigan density with a 3-year time-lag. Total falcon numbers in late summer (territorial adults - fledglings) showed a 2-year lag with ptarmigan numbers. Variability in falcon density was significantly less than that of ptarmigan. It is suggested that the factors contributing to the time-lag between the two populations are the year-round residency of falcons on nesting territories, and late maturity (2 to 4-year-old). Mean brood size and the proportion of the territorial falcon population breeding successfully showed no relation to ptarmigan numbers. 2. Ptarmigan density in spring was an important factor determining composition and variability in the diet of gyrfalcons during the breeding season. Alternative prey for falcons included waterfowl, alcids and waders. Adult ptarmigan featured highly in gyrfalcon diet in all years. The functional response curve to changes in ptarmigan density was slightly convex or close to linear and showed relatively little change in the average number of ptarmigan killed per individual predator over the range of ptarmigan densities observed. 3. The impact of gyrfalcon predation on the ptarmigan population and ptarmigan density was in opposite phases, and the predation rate peaked during the decline and the low phase of the ptarmigan cycle. This suggests that gyrfalcons accelerate decline, accentuate the amplitude and affect the length of the low phase of the ptarmigan cycle. The following factors seem to promote the destabilizing effects of predation by gyrfalcons: they are resident specialist predators, they show a delayed numerical response to changes in ptarmigan density and a high utilization of this prey at all phases of the ptarmigan cycle.",67,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,10-year cycles | Falco rusticolus | Lagopus mutus | Predator-prey relationships | Resident specialist predator | Time-lags,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,18

Comparisons with recaptures and recoveries of 238 ringed juveniles without radio-tags detected no marking bias among hawks radio-tagged at nests, nor survival bias from tag impacts or signal-loss effects, but disproportionate adult deaths within a month of trapping. 3. Among 63 dead hawks found by radio-tagging, 35% were killed by humans and 65% died from natural causes, mainly starvation. Ring recoveries over-represented killing by humans. 4. Radio-tagging estimated first-year male survival rates of 0.49-0.54 to the next spring, lower than estimates of 0.69-0.71 for females; combined survival was higher than in contemporary ringing records. Excluding first-month data from trapped adults, second-year survival was 0.59 for males, 0.71 for females, and 0.79-0.83 for both sexes thereafter. 5.

The 34 species of birds that have been successfully introduced to New Zealand offer a unique opportunity to study patterns of variation in geographical range sizes, and to test mechanisms that may be responsible for that variation, because the New Zealand range sizes have established within the last 160 years and because there are data on the starting conditions, including the year of first recorded release and the subsequent effort put into the introduction of each species. 2. We collated data on geographical range sizes, life history traits, dates of introduction and initial introduction effort for the birds successfully introduced to New Zealand. To test whether range size-life history correlations show a consistent pattern between regions, we collated further data on geographical range sizes and life history traits for British breeding birds. 3. The geographical range sizes of birds introduced to New Zealand did not depend on the length of time since they were introduced. Instead, large geographical ranges were exhibited by species whose preferred habitat is widespread in New Zealand, species with life history traits associated with higher rates of population growth (high fecundity, fast development and small body size), species that are partial migrants in part of their natural range, and species that were initially introduced more often and in greater numbers to New Zealand. 4. The strength and direction of geographical range size-life history correlations in introduced New Zealand and British breeding birds were very similar. There was also a strong positive correlation between the geographical range sizes of the species introduced to New Zealand from Britain and their geographical range sizes in Britain. However, the similarity of the correlations between life history traits and geographical range sizes in both regions was not a simple consequence of this; the similarity persisted when species introduced from Britain were excluded from the New Zealand data. 5.

Several species of microsporidian parasites use a mixture of vertical and horizontal transmission among their respective mosquito host species. These relationships vary in how hosts are exploited for either vertical or horizontal transmission. An important factor is that only females can provide vertical transmission. Two types of relationship have particularly been contrasted; those where vertically infected larvae of both sexes are killed late in their development and contribute towards the parasite's horizontal transmission, and those where only male larvae are killed while females experience benign infections, become adults, and contribute towards the parasite's vertical transmission success. The selective killing of males in these latter relationships leads to female-biased adult sex ratios. These differences among relationships have been suggested to depend on the environmental conditions they experience and on the relative efficiency of vertical or horizontal transmission. 2. The transmission behaviour of the microsporidian parasite Edhazardia aedis (Becnel, Fukuda and Sprague) following vertical transmission was studied as a function of larval food availability to its host, the mosquito Aedes aegypti (L.). The number of vertically infected mosquitoes dying before reaching adulthood increased as larval food availability became less. However, proportionately more females died as food availability decreased and adult mosquito populations became increasingly male-biased. 3. The fate of vertically infected mosquitoes was closely related to their larval growth rate. As food availability decreased and larval growth rates slowed, the parasite's infection had more time to produce its spores and induce the host's mortality before emergence. This disproportionately affected female mosquitoes as they pupate later than males, especially as larval growth rates slow. As late ages at pupation are associated with smaller adult size (≃ lower fecundity), the potential vertical transmission offered by slowly growing female larvae is limited and more success may be gained by exploiting them for horizontal transmission. 4. Our results indicate that the relative reproductive value of vertical or horizontal transmission altered with an ecological parameter (larval food availability). Constraints in the life-history traits of each organism helped to explain why the observed sex ratio was biased towards males rather than females.",15,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Horizontal transmission | Host | Life cycles | Life-history traits | Mosquito,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,22

Individual variation in the competitive ability of foraging animals arises from variation in their intrinsic foraging efficiency and in their susceptibility to interference from competitors. Empirical and theoretical studies have concentrated on quantifying the latter and examining its role in determining the distribution and dynamics of animal populations, but have seldom considered the role of variation in foraging efficiency. Using the frequency of occurrence of oystercatchers in supplementary feeding habitats as an index of their competitive ability, we assessed the relative importance of foraging efficiency and susceptibility to interference in determining the overall competitive ability of an individual. 2. Individual mussel-feeding oystercatchers varied in their tendency to supplement their low-tide intake by feeding on other prey on upshore tidal flats and in fields. Individuals that opened mussels by stabbing occurred on upshore flats more often than birds which hammered mussels, whereas young birds were more likely to visit the fields than older birds. This difference between habitats emphasized the need to understand the individual differences underlying these class effects. 3. Foraging efficiency increased with age and differed between feeding methods. Dominance also increased with age, but did not differ between feeding methods. An individual's foraging efficiency was not related to its dominance. 4. Individual variation in the usage of either upshore flats or fields, and of each habitat separately, was related to individual variation in foraging efficiency, but not to variation in dominance. Individuals of poor intrinsic foraging ability made greater use of supplementary feeding habitats than did more efficient foragers. 5. Our results show that, even in an interference-prone system and across a wide range of circumstances, individual variation in foraging efficiency is the major determinant of overall competitive ability. We believe, therefore, that this source of individual variation is of greater importance in determining variation in mortality risk within a population than the effort invested in its study hitherto would suggest. We suggest that a modelling approach is necessary to establish the competitive conditions under which susceptibility to interference might become the more important determinant of competitive ability and, hence, whether such conditions are ever likely to occur in natural populations.

We tested the hypothesis that in territorial, sex-role reversed birds the distribution of resources may determine the dispersion of males, which may, in turn, determine the dispersion of females (i.e. the converse of the classical view of breeding systems in most species). 2. Bronze-winged jacana (Metopidius indicus) territories were exclusive within the sexes, and female territories encompassed 1-4 male territories. The breeding density was limited by both habitat availability (floaters settled when new habitat flooded) and competition for territories (floaters filled natural and experimental vacancies). 3. Territory vacancies created by removal experiments were filled quickly either by floaters, neighbours, or male co-mates that expanded their territories. Changes in male territories had a significantly greater impact on female territories than vice versa, in terms of size and overlap before and after the experiment. Female dispersion was therefore influenced by the dispersion of males. However, males also played an active part in mate changes through occasional territory adjustments, and sexual interactions with females. 4. There was no evidence for a relationship between dispersion of resources and male territory size, but heavier males defended larger territories. Both neighbouring males and co-mates constrained the size of male territories. There was no evidence that polyandry arose through males settling on and subdividing female territories, but rather males competed for space, and female territories were superimposed on the mosaic of male territories. 5. Female territory size was positively correlated with harem size, but seemed to be unrelated to habitat quality.

We examined direct and indirect behavioural responses of grazing mayfly nymphs (Baetis rhodani) to predation risk from a drift-feeding fish (European minnow; odour manipulated), and two types of invertebrate predators, Diura bicaudata (stonefly) and Rhyacophila nubila (caddis larva). We also assessed the direct responses of the invertebrate predators to fish chemicals. 2. Based on diet gut content periodicity, D. bicaudata nymphs were strongly nocturnal foragers. R. nubila was also nocturnal, but only in a fish stream; in a stream lacking fish, their gut contents did not vary significantly on a diet basis. In the laboratory, Diura was nocturnal even in the absence of fish and almost ceased moving when fish was present. Rhyacophila shifted from aperiodic to nocturnal foraging in the presence of fish. 3. The contrasting behaviours of the two predators may be explained by their respective field distributions: D. bicaudata always co-occurs with fish, whereas R. nubila is also found in streams without fish. Therefore, a capacity for plastic antifish responses is beneficial for R. nubila, but not for D. bicaudata. 4. Drift of large Baetis nymphs was aperiodic when Rhyacophila was present, but nocturnal in all other treatments. Drift rate was highest when both Diura and fish were present and lowest in treatments with Rhyacophila. Predatory stoneflies, but not the caddis larva, induced a night-time peak in the drift of both Baetis size-classes. In the absence of predators, small Baetis drifted aperiodically. Interaction terms in three-way ANOVAS testing for the indirect effects of fish and invertebrate predators on mayfly drift periodicity and drift rate were all non-significant, indicating that the response of Baetis to one type of predator was not modified by the other predator. 5. Our results indicate that the drift periodicity of lotic mayflies may be fine-tuned to variations in the multi-predator environment and that prey responses are size-specific.

Several authors have proposed that inter-specific variation in parasitoid life histories can be classified according to a dichotomy of development modes: ectoparasitoids and idiobionts with one suite of traits, and endoparasitoids and koinobionts with an opposing set of traits. 2. The factual evidence for such a dichotomy is presently scant. Here, 10 predictions of the dichotomous hypothesis are assessed using life history data from 474 species of parasitoid Hymenoptera. 3. A degree of support for the dichotomy is found. As predicted, koinobiosis is associated with endoparasitism, and idiobiosis with ectoparasitism. Endoparasitism and/or koinobiosis are also associated with a shorter adult lifespan, a shorter window for parasitism, smaller eggs, a longer pre-adult lifespan and, in larval parasitoids, a greater oviposition rate and fecundity than ectoparasitism/idiobiosis. 4. However, several predictions are not upheld by the data. No significant relationship is found between development mode and either body size, the degree of host concealment or the stage of host attacked. Some trends are only found amongst larval parasitoids, and others do not hold for both endoparasitism and koinobiosis. 5. We conclude that there is at least some merit to the dichotomous hypothesis, though the most extensive depictions go beyond the present data.

In many species of birds, the proportion of females that relays after losing their first clutch varies. Replacement clutches can make important contributions to an individual's lifetime reproductive success, so the decision on whether or not to relay may have significant consequences for fitness. 2. Many studies report that female birds of 'high quality' (e.g. older and more experienced) were more likely to relay following clutch loss, and that the proportion of females that relaid declined as the breeding season progressed. High quality females tend to nest early, and may be less likely to lose their clutches. As a result, it is unclear whether few females relay late in the season because there are prohibitive costs associated with late breeding, or because those females that lay and lose their eggs late are of low quality, and therefore incapable of relaying. 3. We examined the roles of date and quality in causing seasonal declines in replacement layings in Brunnich's guillemot [Uria lomvia (Linnaeus)], a long-lived, Arctic marine bird that lays a one-egg clutch. At two low-Arctic colonies in eastern Canada in 1996 and 1997, the single egg was experimentally removed from samples of early-laying pairs (presumably those of high quality) at 3-day intervals beginning on the median laying date and ending 12 days later. 4. In the general population, the proportion of pairs that relaid following natural egg loss declined with the date of loss. In contrast, the proportion of experimental pairs that relaid remained high irrespective of the date their egg was removed. These results support the quality hypothesis, but not the date hypothesis. We conclude that seasonal declines in replacement layings occurred primarily because increasing proportions of low quality females lost eggs as the season advanced. 5. The experimental pairs also suffered no overt reduction in reproductive success as a result of the delay, at least up to the time that their chicks departed to sea. This suggests that timing of breeding had little effect on the immediate success of more capable pairs. 6. Our results may have important implications about the seasonality of low-Arctic marine environments, and the life histories of birds that inhabit them.",51,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Breeding success | Egg loss | Female quality | Renesting | Timing of breeding,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,28

We examined published studies relating resting oxygen consumption to body mass and temperature in post-larval teleost fish. The resulting database comprised 138 studies of 69 species (representing 28 families and 12 orders) living over a temperature range of c. 40°C. 2. Resting metabolic rate (R(b); mmol oxygen gas h-1) was related to body mass (M; wet mass, g) by R(b) = aMb, where a is a constant and b the scaling exponent. The model was fitted by least squares linear regression after logarithmic transformation of both variables. The mean value of scaling exponent, b, for the 69 individual species was 0.79 (SE 0.11). The general equation for all teleost fish was lnR(b) = 0.80(lnM) - 5.43. 3. The relationship between resting oxygen consumption and environmental temperature for a 50-g fish was curvilinear. A typical tropical fish at 30°C requires approximately six times as much oxygen for resting metabolism as does a polar fish at 0°C. This relationship could be fitted by several statistical models, of which the Arrhenius model is probably the most appropriate. The Arrhenius model for the resting metabolism of 69 species of teleost fish, corrected to a standard body mass of 50 g, was lnR(b) = 15.7-5.02. T-1, where T is absolute temperature (103 x K). 4. The Arrhenius model fitted to all 69 species exhibited a lower thermal sensitivity of resting metabolism (mean Q10 = 1.83 over the range 0-30°C) than typical within-species acclimation studies (median Q10 = 2.40, n = 14). This suggests that evolutionary adaptation has reduced the overall thermal sensitivity of resting metabolism across species. Analysis of covariance indicated that the relationships between resting metabolic rate and temperature for various taxa (orders) showed similar slopes but significantly different mean rates. 5. Analysis of the data for perciform fish provided no support for metabolic cold adaptation (the hypothesis that polar fish show a resting metabolic rate higher than predicted from the overall rate/temperature relationship established for temperate and tropical species). 6. Taxonomic variation in mean resting metabolic rate showed no relationship to phylogeny, although the robustness of this conclusion is constrained by our limited knowledge of fish evolutionary history.",909,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Body mass | Fish | Metabolic cold adaptation | Respiration | Scaling | Temperature,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,29

We used a factorial experimental design to test whether habitat fragmentation (two different fragment sizes) and connectivity (presence and absence of corridors between small fragments) affected population growth rate and two conventional measures of the demographic structure (proportion of reproductive adults and sex ratio) in 12 enclosed populations of root voles. 2. Because the matriline has been suggested to be a functional entity affecting the demography of Microtus populations, we employed a study protocol (including laboratory-raised founder animals and intensive live trapping combined with fluorescent powder techniques), which enabled us to track the matrilineal genealogy in the populations. Thus, the effect of habitat structure on the matrilineal structure of the populations, quantified by the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, could be tested for the first time. 3. Population growth rate was density dependent, but neither this population parameter nor sex ratio and proportion of reproductive adults differed between the habitat treatments. This was unexpected since the presumed determinants of Microtus demography, such as individual space use, dispersal distances and spatiosocial organization had earlier been found to differ between the treatments. 4. The matrilineal structure (diversity) of the populations changed in response to the experimental habitat manipulations. In corridor-connected systems, some matrilines became numerically dominant, which lead to reduced matrilineal diversity compared to systems with isolated habitat fragments. We hypothesize that some matrilines were able to colonize and exploit corridor-connected fragments better than other matrilines. Matrilineal diversity was not related to any other demographic attribute (growth rate, sex ratio and functional stage structure) at the population level. 5. Our results suggest that fragmentation-induced changes of individual and matrilineal level attributes do not necessarily propagate into population level differences in vital rates. The notion that matrilines may be a functional entity in Microtus populations could not be supported. 6. Our experimental results suggest that population genetics, more than population demography, may be sensitive to habitat fragmentation and connectivity, within the specific temporal and spatial extent explored. In particular, the effect of corridors on matrilineal diversity imply that population genetic studies based on mtDNA markers should consider habitat connectivity when analysing genetic diversity.",42,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Demography | Density dependence | Habitat corridors | Habitat fragmentation | Matriline diversity,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,31

The empirical relationships among body size, species richness and number of individuals may give insight into the factors controlling species diversity and the relative abundances of species.

Specimens were identified, enumerated and measured to determine body size. 2. Both overall and within abundant taxonomic orders, species richness and numbers of individuals peaked at body sizes intermediate for each group. Evolution could create unimodal diversity patterns by random diversification around an ancestral body size or from size-dependent fitness differences. Local processes such as competition or predation could also create unimodal diversity distributions. 3. The average body size of a species depended significantly on its taxonomic order, but on contemporary trophic role only within the context of taxonomic order. 4.

In social mammals where group members cooperate to detect predators and raise young, members of small groups commonly show higher mortality or lower breeding success than members of large ones. It is generally assumed that this is because large group size allows individuals to detect or repel predators more effectively but other benefits of group size may also be involved, including reduced costs of raising young and more effective competition for resources with neighbouring groups. 2. To investigate the extent to which predation rate affects survival, we compared mortality rates in two populations of suricates (Suricata suricatta), one living in an area of high predator density (Kalahari Gemsbok Park) and one living in an area of relatively low predator density (neighbouring ranchland). Most aspects of feeding ecology and growth (including time spent feeding, daily weight gain, growth, adult body weight, breeding frequency and neonatal mortality) were similar in the two populations. In contrast, mortality of animals over 3 months old was 1.7 times higher in the Park than on ranchland. 3. Mortality of juveniles between emergence from the natal burrow and 6 months of age was higher in small groups than large ones in the Park but significantly lower in small groups than large ones on ranchland. Adult mortality declined in larger groups in both areas. 4. The tendency for survival to be low in small groups had far-reaching consequences for the risk of group extinction. During a year of low rainfall in the Park, all groups of less than nine animals became extinct and population density declined to around a third of its initial level.

Studies of the spatio-temporal dynamics and structure of populations have identified many categories of population type. However, recognized categories intergrade, making it difficult to assign empirical population systems to single categories. 2. We suggest that most population categories can be arranged along two axes that combine per capita birth (B), death (D), emigration (E) and immigration (I) rates. The 'Compensation Axis' describes the source-sink component of population structure, with source populations exporting individuals (B > D, E > I) and sinks and pseudosinks consuming individuals (B < D, E < I). The 'Mobility Axis' describes the involvement of a local population in regional (I + E) rather than local (B + D) processes, running from separate populations, through metapopulations, to patchy populations. 3. Each sample area within a spatially structured population system can potentially be assigned to a position along each of these axes, with individual sample areas weighted by local population size. The positions of these sample areas and their relative weightings allow the relative importance of different types of process to be judged. A worked exampled is provided, using the butterfly Hesperia comma. This approach shifts the emphasis from pattern (categories that real population systems do not fit) onto process. 4. In many systems, continuous variation in habitat quality and demographic parameters make clear distinctions between 'habitat' and 'non-habitat' difficult to sustain. In such cases, we advocate the use of a spatial grid system, with effects of patch size and isolation combined into a single, weighted distance function (neighbourhood). 5. The relative importance of different processes depends on the spatial scale at which the system is observed. This again emphasizes the value of a process-based approach.",291,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Dispersal | Foraging | Metapopulations | Population dynamics | Sinks | Sources,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,38

Recent theoretical and empirical research has shown that habitat isolation can have strong effects on patterns of abundance and population dynamics of animals. Effects of habitat patch isolation may be particularly strong in taxa such as amphibians, which may have limited dispersal abilities and yet rely on breeding habitats that are variable in space and time. 2. We manipulated the distribution of replicated artificial ponds in order to determine the effects of breeding pond isolation on the spatial and temporal dynamics of pond use by the tungara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus Lynch), on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. Our principal objectives were to determine whether pond isolation affects if, when, and how much a pond will be used, and to determine the spatial scale over which isolation effects are likely to be important. 3. We used three sets of experimental ponds: ponds placed at distances from 1 to 200 m from active natural breeding sites; ponds placed at these same distances from recently abandoned breeding sites; and ponds placed among different terrestrial habitat types and at least 200 m from any known breeding sites ('sampling ponds'). 4. We found that time to pond use increased with pond isolation, and that ponds near active sites were used more quickly than ponds near abandoned sites. The number of egg masses per pond decreased with pond isolation and was significantly lower near abandoned sites. Ponds near active breeding sites were more likely to be used by tungara frogs than both ponds near abandoned sites and sampling ponds. 5. Used sampling ponds were clumped at spatial scales less than 200 m, and mark-recapture data suggest that tungara frogs routinely move between ponds over these distances. 6. We conclude that breeding pond isolation is a primary determinant of the temporal and spatial dynamics of pond use by tungara frogs, and can result in spatial patterns in pond use that are independent of pond quality. These isolation effects are, however, unrelated to metapopulation processes, as most turnover in pond use is probably a result of dispersal and breeding site selection by individuals, and not resulting from the extinction of local populations.",66,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Amphibians | Dispersal | Habitat isolation | Metapopulation | Spatial structure,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,40

New techniques for identifying the average taxonomic range of species assemblages were applied to an extensive dataset of bottom-dwelling fish in the coastal waters of NW Europe.

Unlike standard measures of species richness and diversity, the mean value of these statistics is independent of sampling effort, and this allows objective comparisons to be made between samples from studies where sampling effort is not standardized. 2. A reduction in the average taxonomic range between the fauna of western waters of the UK and that of the southern North Sea was consistent with the general decline in species richness observed between these regions, and suggests that these two factors may be spatially positively correlated. Indices calculated for individual samples of fish on a local scale, however, did not all fit this trend. 3. Much of the variability in taxonomic diversity within the coastal waters of NW Europe was caused by the variable geographical distribution of the elasmobranchs.

The ratio in October, taken as a measure of annual productivity, varied between 2.8 and 5.5 in different years. 3. In the Oxford area, egg-laying among bullfinches occurred between mid-April and late August, so that the last young of the year left the nest in late September/early October. However, not all pairs continued breeding this late in the year. Individual bullfinches started to moult when they finished breeding. The proportion of adults which started moult after 20 August (implying successful breeding from eggs laid after mid-July) varied between 7 and 68% in different years (or between 19 and 63% using a different method of estimation). Juveniles from these late nests, identified as those starting moult after 31 August, formed 24-61% of the total juvenile population in different years, the rest having been produced from clutches begun before mid-July. 4. In the 2 years when the greatest proportions of adults started to moult after 20 August and the greatest proportion of juveniles started after 31 August, the juvenile:adult ratios in October were highest. By implication, the two-fold variations in overall productivity between years were associated primarily with variations in the amount of late breeding. 5. This study, based on moults and age-ratios among netted birds, provided information on seasonal productivity that was practically impossible to obtain in this species by conventional nest finding. An implication was that an interaction between the seasonal pattern of breeding in particular years and a seasonal trend in predation on nest contents, had major effects on overall annual productivity.",23,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Breeding season | Breeding success | Bullfinch | Moult | Pyrrhula pyrrhula,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,42

Positive correlations between local abundance and distribution on a larger spatial scale are commonly observed among related species. 2. Within parasite species, the same relationship may be expected between prevalence and intensity of infection across host species used. Across parasite species, a positive relationship is expected between average abundance in a host population and the number of host species that can be exploited based on the resource breadth hypothesis. Trade-offs between the ability to exploit many host species and the potential for heavy infections, however, could result in a negative relationship. 3. Intraspecifically, using data on 51 helminth species parasitic in birds, prevalence and intensity of infection among host species used are generally only weakly correlated. Only in nematodes is there an overall positive relationship between prevalence and intensity. 4. A comparative analysis was performed on data from 389 species of cestodes, trematodes and nematodes parasitic in birds to determine how host specificity covaries interspecifically with abundance, measured both as prevalence and intensity of infection. 5. After controlling for phylogenetic influences and sampling effort, the number of host species used correlated positively with prevalence in all three parasite taxa, and with intensity of infection in trematodes only. 6. These results do not support the existence of a trade-off between abundance and the use of many host species, as has been found for fish parasites. Instead, whatever makes helminth parasites of birds abundant within a host population may facilitate their successful colonization of new host species.",39,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Comparative analysis | Host specificity | Intensity of infection | Phylogeny | Prevalence,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,43

Recently, a small predatory beetle, Trechisibus antarcticus (Carabidae), was accidentally introduced onto the island of South Georgia, sub-Antarctic. 2. From the presumed site of introduction the beetle is invading the coastal lowland area, building up high densities locally in the tussock-forming grass Parodiochloa flabellata. 3. In the coastal area the endemic detritivorous/herbivorous beetle Hydromedion sparsutum (Perimylopidae) is common, especially in and beneath the tussocks. 4. The first three, out of six, larval instars of H. sparsutum are easily taken prey by the carabid. 5. In sites colonized by the carabid, total abundance and the ratio between larval and adult numbers of H. sparsutum are far lower, and its adult body size clearly larger, than in comparable sites where the carabid is absent. 6. Two hypotheses are proposed for explaining the increase in adult body size of H. sparsutum: (i) the increase is a direct effect of predation: selection by the predator favours large hatchlings and/or larvae with a high growth rate; and (ii) the increase is an indirect effect of predation: by lowering the density of H. sparsutum, predation has increased its per capita food supply, enabling a higher growth rate and a larger adult body size. 7. A food addition experiment in a carabid-free site showed availability of high quality food to be insufficient for sustaining the initial larval population. 8. In the laboratory, females from the predator-infested sites produced larger eggs and hatchlings than females from the carabid-free sites, but mass specific growth rates of the larvae were not higher. 9.

We analysed the effect of prey density and size on the foraging performance of great and blue tit (Parus major L., P. caeruleus L.) parents, and its consequences for the growth and fledging weight of nestlings. Because fledging weight is a determinant of subsequent survival and therefore fitness, foraging decisions of the parents play a key role in the reproductive system of tits. The analysis quantifies (i) the rate at which energy is delivered to the nestlings in relation to prey size and abundance, and (ii) the growth rates of nestlings and the resulting fledging weight in relation to the rate of food delivery by the parents. 2. The searching time per prey item increased exponentially with decreasing prey biomass. During the peak abundance of caterpillars, the average searching time per item was 2.5-3 min instead of 5-6 min before and after the peak. Searching time was significantly reduced when the birds returned to the foraging site where the preceding prey was found. This accords with the clumped distribution of caterpillars within the canopy. 3. The foraging performance (in mg caterpillars per min) was maximal when caterpillars were both abundant and large, i.e. shortly before they left the trees for pupation. The high feeding frequency and the large prey then caused a peak energy flow rate to the nestlings of 4-5 times the rate before or after the caterpillar peak. This suggests that the foraging success and rate of food delivery by tit parents was primarily determined by the abundance and size of prey. 4. The growth rate of nestlings, as well as their fledging weight was correlated with the rate of food delivery. Low feeding performance of the parents resulted therefore in poor relative growth rates of only 0.3-0.6 of the rate achieved under optimal conditions and, as a consequence, in a low fledging weight. This indicates that tit parents have restricted options to adjust prey delivery rates according to the requirements of the brood. 5. The results give insight into the chain of causal mechanisms through which an environmental factor (availability of food) has a strong and immediate effect on fitness (growth, fledging weight and, thus, survival of the nestlings). The importance of caterpillar size for foraging success and prey delivery rates of parent tits makes clear, why the phase of best foraging conditions is shorter than the period during which caterpillars are available. The relationships we quantified give a proximate explanation for the great effects that temperature and caterpillar growth have on the between-year variation in selection intensity for laying date observed in other studies.",221,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Blue tit | Fledging weight | Foraging | Great tit | Nestling growth | Prey availability | Radio-tracking | Timing of breeding,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,46

In nature, various mechanisms that provide some refuges for inferior species to escape from competition act together to promote the species coexistence in a local community. We propose a method to evaluate simultaneously the relative importance of different mechanisms for the species coexistence, focusing on a mycophagous drosophilid community depending on a multispecies fungal host system, where two mechanisms - aggregation over patches of single fungal species and resource partitioning at the fungal species level - can act together. The data are based on the numbers of adult insects emerging from naturally occurring fungi collected from a temperate forest in northern Japan. 2. We confirm the finding of Sevenster and van Alphen (1996) that large patches are low-density refuges despite the large absolute numbers of competitors on them, and therefore adopt new measures for intra- and interspecific aggregations and the species-persistence criterion, which were developed by Sevenster (1996) to take account of variable patch sizes in calculating the aggregation measures. 3. The calculated measures are compared among three analyses for fungal resources: AR-analysis (the original data-set from multispecies fungal patches) in which both aggregation and resource partitioning can act together; R-analysis (combining the data for all patches of each fungal species) in which only resource partitioning at the fungal species level can act; and A-analysis (calculating the measures independently for each fungal species) in which only aggregation process can act as a coexistence mechanism. 4. Intraspecific aggregation over multispecies fungal patches is strengthened by both aggregation and resource partitioning processes. 5. We reconfirm the finding of Sevenster and van Alphen (1996) that interspecific associations are consistent over years, and support their claim that such consistent associations should be taken as real aspects of the community structure. 6. Measures for the persistence criterion (T), the 'relative effect of competitor aggregation', are less than unity, satisfying the necessary and sufficient condition for the species persistence, in most drosophilid species concerned; these tend to be smaller in AR-analysis than in R- or A-analysis, suggesting facilitation of the species coexistence by both aggregation and resource partitioning in the mycophagous drosophilid community studied. 7. Differences in T-value between AR- and R-analyses and between AR- and A-analyses may indicate relative contributions of aggregation and resource partitioning, respectively, to the species coexistence.

Fast-growing brown trout migrated to the lake earlier and at a smaller body size than slower-growing individuals. The 2+ migrants were significantly larger than those that remained 1 or more years longer in the stream. The 3+ migrants were significantly larger than the 2+ migrants. Some fast-growing males matured in the stream, whereas all females left the stream before maturing sexually. 3.

Total energy allocated to growth was also higher among migrants, and the total metabolic costs were five times higher among migrants than among resident fish. 4. The proportional energy allocation to growth among the 2+ migrants was much lower (about half) than that of those remaining longer in the stream. The reduction in the proportion of energy available for growth from age 1+ to 2+ was larger among migrants (88%) than among resident fish (68%). Reduction in the proportion of energy available for growth is a probable explanation for why migrations are initiated at age 2. 5.

We studied the effect of pupal predation on Epirrita autumnata populations within and outside the outbreak range, in northern and southern Finland, respectively. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the potential of pupal predation to contribute to the contrasting dynamics of northern and southern populations. In addition to overall pupal survival, we separately estimated the influence of small mammal and invertebrate predation. 2. Each summer for a period of 5 years, pupae inside their cocoons were buried in the ground. The pupae were re-collected before the flight season and checked for damage. Direct and delayed density dependence of pupal survival was tested using the current and the previous year larval density indices, respectively. 3. Annual survival of pupae from both small mammal and invertebrate predation was lower in the south. Daily survival rates did not differ between the south and the north indicating that the difference in annual pupal survival is most likely due to the longer pupal period in the south. 4. In the south, pupal survival was negatively density dependent and resulted from small mammal predation. The results indicate that small mammals may prevent E. autumnata populations from reaching high densities in the south. 5. In the northern study area with a current outbreak, total pupal survival was density independent. Also small mammal predation was density independent, most likely due to predator satiation. Moreover, there was no difference in pupal survival between northern areas with and without a current outbreak. The results indicate that pupal predation was not a significant factor in termination of the outbreak, nor is it likely to contribute to the maintenance of the cyclic density fluctuations. 6. We conclude that low pupal survival and its density dependence are likely to contribute to stability of E. autumnata populations in southern Fennoscandia. On the contrary, shorter pupal period and the lack of density dependent pupal predation may make northern populations more prone to outbreaks. The potential regulating effect of pupal predation in southern populations is due to small mammals being able to respond to changes in E. autumnata densities.",57,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Cyclicity | Density dependence | Insect herbivore | Population dynamics | Regulation,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,50

Ecomorphological studies have described local bat communities as densely-packed species assemblages arising from non-deterministic processes. Together with the observation that insectivorous bats readily exploit patchy, often unlimited trophic resources, this has even led to the claim that partitioning of niche space may be absent. However, the paucity of data on resource exploitation per se among bat guilds rarely allows these assertions to be verified. In particular, the mechanisms allowing the coexistence of similar species have proved difficult to determine. 2. As a subset of an insectivorous guild, the vespertilionid bats Myotis myotis and M. blythii offer an opportunity to examine this question. Genetically closely-related, they are morphologically almost identical. Yet, as established by faecal analysis, they exploit distinct trophic niches; preying upon ground- and grass-dwelling prey taxa, respectively. The distinct habitat requirements of their basic prey suggest that ecological segregation may stem primarily from a differential allocation of foraging space. 3. The present study tests the hypothesis that sympatric M. myotis and M. blythii segregate spatially to an extent which prevents competitive interference. I performed radio-tracking on Swiss sympatric populations. Using multivariate analyses and randomized contingency table procedures, I looked for (i) habitat overlap and overall inter-specific differences in habitat choice, and (ii) the habitat preferences exhibited by individuals when foraging within their own feeding areas. 4. Primary foraging habitats were largely species-specific. Not only were they spatially segregated, but they also differed structurally. All habitats selected by M. myotis offered a high accessibility to ground-dwelling prey (freshly-cut meadows, mown grass in intensively cultivated orchards, forests without undergrowth), whereas grassland predominated in all habitats of M. blythii (steppe, unmown meadows, pastures). This corroborates the predictions drawn from dietary niches. 5. This study shows that refined mechanisms of resource partitioning, not predictable by the study of morphological characters or echolocation alone, may still account for the organization of parts of insectivorous bat guilds. It also supports the view that habitat selection may prove to be a major mode of resource allocation amongst similar insectivorous bats, particularly for species exploiting limited food supplies.",149,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Chiroptera | Community ecology | Guild structure | Niche | Species evolution,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,51

In order to compare spatial and temporal variation in the demography of a metapopulation of house sparrows living on four islands off the coast of Northern Norway, we computed the asymptotic population growth rate (λ) for three transitions between years, using a projection matrix model. 2.

Even though the standard deviations of the estimates were large, λ was significantly greater than 1 on one island in 2 out of 3 years. In contrast, λ significantly less than 1 occurred on an island on five occasions. 4. Decomposition of the magnitude of the spatial and temporal components of λ showed that one year (1995) had a particularly negative impact on λ. In contrast, one island had a great positive effect. 5. These differences in λ were most closely related to variation in the juvenile survival rate and in the fecundity rate, which, in turn, was closely related to variation both in space and time in the proportion of the eggs that produced a fledgling. 6. As expected from the large spatio-temporal variation in λ, the sensitivities and the elasticities of λ to variation in the different elements in the projection-matrix also differed both in space and time. When λ was small, it was most influenced by variation in adult survival rate. In contrast, for large λ, it was most sensitive to variation in the recruitment rate. 7. We suggest that conditions during the breeding season determine whether a population acts as a source or sink in this temperate small passerine metapopulation, and that the ratio of juveniles to adults can be used to characterize populations as sources or sinks. 8.

This article compares generalist (parasite species found on two or more host species) and specialist (found on only one host species) monogenean parasite species of fish. The reduction of the host range - that is an increase in host specificity - may correspond with a better adaptation of the parasite to a more predictable host environment. A more predictable environment may allow the parasite species to develop specific adaptations. 2. We assume that the more predictable host environment can be evaluated by host body size, since numerous life-traits, such as longevity, are positively correlated with size. 3. We found that specialist parasites parasitize larger hosts species than generalist parasites. We also found a good relationship between host body size and parasite body size for specialist parasite species. 4. An adaptation to the mechanical problems encountered in the host's gill chamber may lead to an increase in parasite body size. The infection of a larger part of the host population in order to decrease the chances of local extinction due to fluctuations of host abundance may be another adaptive mechanism. 5. We found a negative correlation between parasite body size and prevalence for generalist parasite species. This relationship disappeared when using the comparative method controlling for phylogeny, which proved that it was a phylogenetic effect.",90,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Comparative analysis | Fish | Monogenean | Predictability | Specificity,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,56

An understanding of the links between life histories and responses to exploitation could provide the basis for predicting shifts in community structure by identifying susceptible species and linking life-history tactics with population dynamics. 2. We examined long-term trends in the abundance of species in the North Sea bottom-dwelling (demersal) fish community. Between 1925 and 1996 changes in species composition led to an increase in mean growth rate, while mean maximum size, age at maturity and size at maturity decreased. The demersal fish community was increasingly heavily fished during this period. 3. Trends in mean life-history characteristics of the community were linked to trends in abundance of component species. An approach based on phylogenetic comparisons was used to examine the differential effects of fishing on individual species with contrasting life histories. 4. Those species that decreased in abundance relative to their nearest relative, matured later at a greater size, grew more slowly towards a greater maximum size and had lower rates of potential population increase. The phylogenetically based analyses demonstrated that trends in community structure could be predicted from the differential responses of related species to fishing. 5. This is the first study to link exploitation responses of an entire community to the life histories of individual species. The results demonstrate that fishing has greater effects on slower growing, larger species with later maturity and lower rates of potential population increase.

Patch-leaving decisions are of utmost importance in determining parasitoid foraging success. Parasitoids are known to use both marks left by hosts (chemical or otherwise) and ovipositions to assess host availability and to decide when to leave a host patch. 2. Previous studies have shown that, depending on the species, ovipositions either increase (an incremental mechanism) or decrease (a decremental mechanism) the patch residence times of parasitoids. Reports in the literature conflict on which mechanism is used by Venturia canescens, a parasitoid of pyralid moth larvae. 3. We hypothesize that, as a consequence of saturation in the capacity of the parasitoid to discriminate between host densities at high host numbers, V. canescens uses a decremental mechanism at low host numbers and an incremental one at high host numbers. We call this a 'switching mechanism'. 4. Our experiments show that even if discrimination capacity saturates, V. canescens uses a decremental mechanism over a wide range of host densities. 5. The distribution of hosts in different fruits species under field conditions suggests a switching mechanism would not evolve in natural situations. 6. A model of patch departure in V. canescens is constructed and tested using an independent set of experiments. The model suggests that the patch leaving mechanism in V. canescens is a stochastic decremental one. As might be expected from Weber's Law, the initial leaving tendency is a convex decreasing function of kairomone concentration. The leaving tendency increases exponentially with the time spent in the patch without ovipositing. Ovipositions cause a sudden increase in leaving tendency 7. Simulations suggest that a decremental mechanism would be out-competed by either one indifferent to ovipositions or an incremental one, only when travel times are much larger than those that are likely to occur in the field.",94,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Count-down mechanism | Optimal foraging | Patch leaving decisions | Proportional hazards model | Venturia canescens,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,58

By identifying ecological factors specific to functional categories of individuals, it may be possible to understand the mechanisms underlying life-history evolution and population dynamics. While empirical analyses within the field of population biology have focused on changes in population size, theoretical models assuming differential sensitivities of population growth rate or fitness to demographic parameters have mostly been untested, particularly against data on small mammals. 2. Statistical modelling of capture-mark-recapture data on the multimammate rat (Mastomys natalensis) from Tanzania shows that: (i) females survive slightly better than males and subadults survive much better than adults; (ii) temporal variation of survival of all individuals is similarly related to the rainfall of the month; (iii) subadults exhibit a strongly density-dependent low persistence rate in the population immediately after their first capture; (iv) subadults survival in later months is, however, positively related to density; and (v) adult survival shows negative density-dependence. 3. Both density-dependent and density-independent factors simultaneously determine stage-dependent survival variation of the multimammate rat. Whereas environmental factors in this population seem to affect survival rates of all individuals in a similar manner, density-dependent relationships are more complex. 4. The patterns of survival variation in small mammals may be different from those observed in large mammals. 5. Further studies of demography in small mammals should aim at understanding how much of the variability in population growth rate is accounted for by the variability of the demographic rates resulting from limiting (density-independent) and regulating (density-dependent) factors, respectively.

The rocky habitat communities of Lake Malawi contain a high diversity of ecologically similar, predominantly herbivorous, cichlid fish species. How so many species can coexist is still unknown. 2. Adult males of the majority of these species hold permanent territories which form dense multispecies mosaics across the shores. 3. The study examined six coexisting species of cichlids from the rocky habitat where males are known to control access to the algal food resources within their territorial space. These included four sibling species of the Pseudotropheus (Tropheops) species complex, which are Specialized epilithic algal herbivores, and two sibling species of the trophically more generalist P. (Maylandia) species complex which feed upon both epilithic algae and plankton. 4. The hypotheses that both intraspecific and interspecific territoriality occur in these communities and that interspecific aggression initiated by territorial males is preferentially directed at species with the most similar diets to their own were tested. 5. It was found that males preferred to exclude conspecific intruders, while they tolerated intruders with different diets to their own. Also, male P. (Tropheops) preferentially excluded similar heterospecific dietary specialists, while male P. (Maylandia) tolerated similar heterospecific dietary generalists. 6. Based on this study, it is proposed that interspecific territoriality may be reducing competition between species with different diets and promoting their coexistence, while it may be enhancing competition between species with the same diet. Furthermore, it suggests that ecological generalism may be reducing the intensity of interspecific competition, while specializations for the same resources may be increasing competition.",52,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Competition | Feeding specializations | Interspecific territoriality | Intraspecific territoriality | Species coexistence,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,62

An important component of parasite diversity is the specificity for particular host taxa shown by many parasites. Specificity is often assumed to imply adaptive specialization by the parasite to its host, such that parasites are incapable of surviving and reproducing on 'foreign' hosts. 2. Specificity, however, need not be due to adaptation to particular hosts. Some parasites may be specific Simply because they are incapable of dispersing among host taxa. For example, 'permanent' parasites like chewing lice spend their entire lifecycle on the body of the host and require direct contact between hosts for dispersal. 3. The role of adaptive constraints in parasite host-specificity has seldom been tested in natural populations. We conducted such a test by comparing the relative fitness of host-specific lice experimentally transferred among closely related species of cave swiftlets in northern Borneo. 4. The survival of lice in most of these transfers was significantly reduced in proportion to the mean difference in feather barb size between the donor and recipient species of hostS. Thus, adaptation to a particular resource on the body of the host does appear to govern the specificity of swiftlet lice. 5. In transfers where lice survived, microhabitat shifting on the body of the host was observed, whereby the mean barb diameter of the feathers on which the lice occurred was held 'constant'.",79,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Apodidae | Bird | Host-specificity | Parasite | Phthiraptera,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,64

We examined the numerical dynamics in four natural populations of the least killifish [Heterandria formosa Agassiz (1855)]; to ascertain how those dynamics affected the expression of key life-history traits and, in turn, whether life-history variation among populations might be responsible for different dynamic properties. Populations were chosen from two types of communities, spring-fed rivers and lakes, to examine the relative influence of community characteristics on these relationships. 2. Populations in lakes had lower densities, more female-biased sex ratios and a smaller proportion of immature individuals than populations in rivers. Predator faunas differed between habitats and the ratio of predator to H. formosa density was higher in lakes than in rivers. 3. Females in lake populations were 35-40% larger than river females. Female size was positively correlated with the number of broods carried by a female at any given time and the number of offspring in a particular brood. These correlations and the larger body size of females in lake populations indicate that the reproductive output per female was higher in lake than river populations. 4. Female size was negatively correlated with population density in two of the four populations. After adjusting for the variation in female size, brood size and brood numbers were negatively correlated with population density in only the highest density population. 5. Average offspring size was negatively correlated with brood size in all of the populations, indicating a general trade-off between offspring size and number. The average offspring size in the highest density population was as much as 45% larger than that of all other populations, an effect independent of any phenotypic plasticity in offspring size with respect to female body size or density. 6. The effects of density on female body size are the major avenue for negative feedback of population density on the subsequent dynamics through life-history expression. Whether such an effect is stabilizing or destabilizing cannot yet be determined.

Many organisms rely upon stored energy reserves to support reproduction and do not initiate breeding until their reserves exceed some 'reproductive threshold'. However, the determinants of such thresholds are poorly understood; for example, we do not know if they are fixed (invariant) or respond dynamically to fluctuations in resource availability. 2. An 8-year field study on water pythons (Liasis fuscus Peters 1873) in tropical Australia shows that individual female pythons adjust their reproductive thresholds in response to annual variation in prey abundance. 3. In every year of the study, female pythons that reproduced were in better condition (mass relative to body length) than non-reproductive females. However, in years with low abundance of rats, female pythons reproduced despite being in relatively poor condition. Indeed, the mean condition of reproductive pythons in one particularly 'bad' year was as low as the mean condition of non-reproductive females in a 'good' year. 4. Clutch sizes were slightly reduced in a 'bad' year, but the main effect of the lowered threshold was greater emaciation of the females after laying. 5. Recapture records of marked snakes show that the annual variation in thresholds is due to flexibility of individual females, not to differential representation of cohorts with different reproductive thresholds. 6.

Comparisons were made both within and between study sites to assess host plant quality, and thereby the effect of delayed induced resistance (DIR). 3. In within-site comparisons, a set of experimental trees was defoliated by wild larvae in the peak year of the outbreak, whereas control trees were protected from defoliation by spraying with an insecticide. The effect of host plant quality was quantified in the following year by measuring the pupal mass of E. autumnata larvae reared in enclosures on these trees. 4. In between-site comparisons, the sizes of pheromone-trapped males were measured at both outbreak and low density sites during the progress of the outbreak. The size of trapped males was subsequently used to estimate the corresponding fecundity of females at the same sites. 5. Pupal mass of E. autumnata reared on trees defoliated in the previous year was 0-10% lower than on those trees protected from defoliation by the insecticide. Field-collected adults indicated a similar pattern: they were smaller at outbreak sites than at low-density sites, and the size reached its minimum in the post-peak year. However, the estimated loss of reproductive capacity of females resulting from DIR was too small to be the sole explanation for the termination of the outbreak. 6. Whether the weak DIR response in this system was a characteristic of the 1990s outbreak alone remains unclear, because different terminating agents may be important for different individual outbreak peaks.

A quantitative parasitoid web was constructed describing the trophic relationships between the community of aphids, parasitoids and secondary parasitoids in an abandoned field in southern England. Root aphids were omitted and secondary parasitoids were associated with aphids rather than primary parasitoids. All aphids, parasitoids and trophic links were expressed in the same units (m-2). Over a 2-year period, separate webs were constructed for every month that aphids and parasitoids were active in the field. 2. Twenty-six species of plants were attacked by 25 species of aphid which were parasitized by 18 species of primary parasitoids. The primary parasitoids were attacked by 28 species of secondary parasitoids, of which 18 directly attacked the still living aphid (hyperparasitoids) and 10 attacked the aphid after mummification (mummy parasitoids). The aphids were attended by three species of ants. 3. Eleven webs were constructed for the months May to September 1994 and May to October 1995. Aphids and primary parasitoids were most abundant and diverse in June, and secondary parasitoids one month later. 4. The ratios of the number of aphid species to the number of species of primary parasitoid and hyperparasitoid were relatively constant across webs, as was the ratio, of the number of links involving hyperparasitoids and mummy parasitoids. The ratio of the total number of links to the total number of species increased with web size. 5. The relative abundance of the species in the different webs was well described by a Dirichlet distribution with a common parameter. This implies a gamma distribution of aphid abundances in the field with few common and many rare species. 6. Predator (i.e. parasitoid) overlap graphs were constructed to assess the potential for indirect interactions between aphids. Mummy parasitoids were the most important group linking different aphids. A quantitative overlap diagram was developed to illustrate the potential strengths of indirect linkages. Common aphid species shared few strong, indirect links via primary parasitoids or hyperparasitoids, but could be strongly linked by mummy parasitoids. Symmetrical links were uncommon, and rare species were potentially strongly influenced by the presence of common aphids with which they shared parasitoids. 7. Ant-attended aphids were attacked by fewer species of primary parasitoids and hyperparasitoids than those species not attended by ants.

Density dependence may act at several stages in an organisms life-cycle (e.g. on mortality, fecundity, etc.), but not all density-dependent processes necessarily regulate population size. In this paper I use a density manipulation experiment to determine the effects of density on the transition rates between different size classes of the clonal zoanthid Palythoa caesia Dana 1846. I then formulate a density-dependent matrix model of population dynamics of Palythoa, and perform a series of sensitivity analyses on the model to determine at what stage in the life-cycle regulation acts. 2. Seven of the 16 transition probabilities decreased with density, most of them being shrinkage (due to loss of tissue or fission) and stasis (the self-self transition) of medium and large colonies. The only probability to increase was for the stasis of large colonies. Recruitment was quadratically dependent on density, peaking at intermediate densities. 3. Equilibrium cover in the model was 84% and was reached in ≃40 years. To determine which density-dependent transitions were involved in population regulation, the strength of density dependence was varied in each independently. This sensitivity analysis showed that only changes in the probabilities of large colonies remaining large and producing medium colonies, were regulating. 4. These results suggest that regulation is primarily acting on fission of large colonies to produce intermediate-sized colonies, in combination with size specific growth rates. Fission rates decrease greatly with density, resulting in a greater proportion of large colonies at high densities and large colonies grow more slowly than small. Overall, this behaviour is very similar to that of clonal plants which have a phalanx type life history.",22,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Clonal organisms | Demography | Density dependence | Matrix models | Population regulation,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,72

Much attention has been devoted to explaining the spatial distribution of foraging animals, but rather little to their temporal distribution (i.e. whether they are diurnal, nocturnal or crepuscular). Many animals face predictable diet cycles of food availability or predation risk, and so the approach of measuring the relative ratio of mortality risk to food gained (the 'minimize μ/f rule) can be applied equally as well to different time periods of the day as to alternative food patches or habitats. 2. This method is used here to investigate the diet activity patterns of juvenile Atlantic salmon, which have previously been shown to become increasingly biased towards nocturnal activity in winter, hiding for much of the day in streambed refuges. Calculations based on published data show that nocturnal foraging in winter is far safer per unit of food obtained than is diurnal, despite greatly reduced food capture efficiency at night-time light levels. 3. Using an automated activity monitoring system based on passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, this study shows that winter diel activity patterns in salmon are dependent on food availability. A change in food density led to a parallel change in time spent in the refuge, but (as predicted by the μ/f rule) the effect was greatest at the time of day with the least favourable ratio of predation cost to feeding benefit. Thus an experimental increase in food availability led to a 16% reduction in time spent in nocturnal foraging but a 98% reduction in time spent foraging by day, with fish spending only 0-6% of the daylight hours out of the refuge at the highest food density. 4. However, brief daytime foraging bouts had a major impact on growth rates (presumably because feeding efficiency was much greater in daylight), especially when food was scarce. Daytime feeding was thus profitable in terms of rapid food acquisition but normally suboptimal in terms of risk of predation. 5. Daily activity patterns are therefore suggested to be the result of a complex tradeoff between growth and survival, which takes account of diel fluctuations in food availability, food capture efficiency and predation risk; individual variation in the extent of diurnal feeding in salmon may result from state-dependent differences in the benefits of rapid feeding and growth.",208,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Antipredator behaviour | Atlantic salmon | Diet activity rhythms | Growth | Salmo salar,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,73

Although interference has been shown to occur between oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus L. feeding on mussels Mytilus edulis L., four previous studies have not detected interference between oystercatchers feeding on cockles Cerastoderma edule L. In contrast, this study detected interference between cockle-feeding oystercatchers in the Baie de Somme, France. Prey stealing (kleptoparasitism), one of the main causes of interference between mussel-feeders, also occurred between oystercatchers in the Baie de Somme. The kleptoparasitism rate was related to the natural variation in the food supply, tending to be higher when cockles were rare. Feeding rate was negatively related to competitor density, so providing evidence for interference, but, as in mussel-feeders, only above a threshold density of about 50-100 birds ha-1. The strength of interference at a fixed competitor density was related to the cockle food supply, usually being greater when cockles were rare. Previous studies probably failed to detect interference between cockle-feeders because competitor densities were too low, or cockles were too abundant, or because they were not conducted during late winter when interference is most intense.

The effect of habitat structure on the distribution of the number of species by body size classes was analysed for 277 Passeriformes of the Western Palearctic. 2. The evolutionary history of the group accounted for 68% of the interspecific variation in body mass (estimated with the phylogenetic autoregressive method). The phylogenetic effect decreased from the most recent taxonomic level towards the earlier phases of evolutionary history. In a more fine-grained study with a subset of 55 passerine species living in central Spain, phylogeny explained significant proportions of the interspecific variation in body mass (62%), habitat use (foraging on the ground vs. foraging in the foliage of scrub/trees; 27%) and structural complexity of preferred habitats (12%). 3. Throughout the evolutionary history there has been a considerable concentration of species around a body mass of 10-40 g (increase in kurtosis), and species with greater body masses have also appeared (increase in skewness). 4. When the effect of evolutionary history on present-day variation in body mass was removed (specific component of the phylogenetic autoregressive method), the distributions of body masses changed with the structural complexity of preferred habitats: species from woodland habitats were lighter (mainly because of the large frequency of small-sized species) and their body masses were less concentrated around the modal class than in species from open-country habitats. Results for the phylogenetic component (attributable to the phylogenetic relatedness of the species) were similar to those of the specific component. 5. Habitat use (i.e. the use of foraging substrata) was strongly correlated with body mass in a subset of 55 species living in central Spain: species foraging on the ground were heavier than those foraging in foliage and small branches of scrub/trees. This result was significant with both specific and phylogenetic components. Habitat use and structural complexity of preferred habitats were significantly correlated using both the specific and the phylogenetic components: species that mainly forage on the ground are mainly open-country species, while species that forage in pliable and slender substrata have mainly woodland habitats. Structural complexity of preferred habitats was negatively related to body mass, although this correlation was only significant using phylogenetic residuals (specific component). 6.

Three experiments were carried out to determine whether a trade-off between the benefit of increased nitrogen content of swards and risks of parasitism exists in a grazing situation for sheep (Ovis aries L.). The effect of level of feeding motivation and parasitic status on the grazing behaviour of sheep faced with this trade-off was also investigated. Animals were presented with pairs of experimental swards (36 x 21 cm), which varied in nitrogen content (high = N+; low = N-) and level of contamination with faeces from sheep infected with Ostertagia circumcincta (Ostertag) (20 g faeces per sward = F+; no faeces = F-), and allowed to graze for short periods. For this study, a 'high parasite risk' grazing strategy is defined as taking more bites from an N+F+ sward compared to an N-F- sward, when presented together as the trade-off choice. 2. Experiment 1 presented one choice (N+F- vs. N-F-) three times to 20 sheep divided into four animal treatment groups resulting from two levels of feeding motivation (high and moderate) and two parasitic states (parasitized by O. circumcincta and non-parasitized). Experiment 2 presented four choices (N+F+ vs. N-F-; N+F+ vs. N-F+; N+F- vs. N-F-; N+F- vs. N-F+) repeated three times to the same animals and treatments. 3. Experiment 3 presented the above four choices three times each to 24 sheep in four animal treatment groups created from two parasitic states (parasitized by O. circumcincta and non-parasitized) and two immune states (immune to O. circumcincta and naive). 4. All animals selected the high nitrogen sward over the low nitrogen sward in experiment 1. When presented the trade-off choice, animals with a high level of feeding motivation took greater parasitic risks, than moderately motivated animals in experiment 2. Both immune treatments took higher parasitic risks than both the naive treatments in experiment 3. Subclinical parasitism resulted in increased rejection of the N+F+ sward, reduced bite rates and grazing depths compared to non-parasitized animals, thereby reducing further risk of parasitism in experiments 2 and 3. Non-parasitized, moderately feeding motivated (control) animals in experiment 2 significantly rejected the N+F+ sward, adopting a low parasite risk strategy; non-parasitized, naive (control) animals in experiment 3 adopted a similar grazing strategy. In each of the remaining three choices in both experiments one sward held a clear nitrogen or faecal benefit (absence of faeces) which was selected for by all treatments. 5.

Reed warblers are not known to be parasitized by cuckoos in Wales, and are rarely parasitized in some English populations, despite the presence of cuckoos.

They are tested against national and international data from the BTO, RSPB and EURING, and data from four study sites. 2. The frequency of parasitism of reed warbler populations was found to be negatively correlated with habitat patch size. Thus the frequency of parasitism experienced by reed warblers and the number of cuckoos parasitizing a reed warbler population do not increase in direct proportion to host abundance. 3. Population sizes of two unparasitized (Llangorse Lake and Oxwich) and one rarely parasitized population of reed warblers (Pannel Valley) are neither too large nor too small to be suitable for parasitism by cuckoos. 4. Cuckoos are not excluded from these populations by lack of perches in the habitat, because of a lack of prey in the immediate area, or by territorial competition with cuckoos of other host preferences. 5. There has been no decline in frequency of parasitism of reed warblers in Britain since 1932. Thus, reed warbler cuckoos are probably not declining in numbers and contracting their range away from these three geographically marginal sites. 6. Cuckoos parasitizing reed warbler populations at Llangorse Lake, Oxwich and Pannel Valley would achieve reproductive success equal to or higher than that attained with other local hosts, so that any host switches away from reed warblers would be unprofitable. 7. Reed warbler cuckoos may have dispersed to all or most of these study populations in the past. However, the cuckoo populations would have been small and highly vulnerable to extinction. Cycles of increases, declines and extinctions of local populations could explain the variance in parasitism frequencies and number of cuckoos often observed. 8.

The response of post-dispersal seed predators to changes in the absolute and relative abundance of seeds of two tree species: ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and wych elm (Ulmus glabra) was studied in seminatural woodland in County Durham, UK. 2. Analysis examined two components of seed predation: seed encounter (the probability of at least one seed being removed) and seed exploitation (the proportion of seeds removed once encountered). Exclosure studies identified small mammals, particularly the woodmouse (Apodemus sylvaticus) as the principal post-dispersal seed predators and revealed a marked preference (almost four-fold difference in encounter) for seeds of Ulmus over Fraxinus. 3. For both Fraxinus and Ulmus, a linear regression model described the relationship between seed density and the number of seeds removed by rodents more successfully than non-linear models. These relationships were maintained whether the species were presented singly or together with neither the slopes of Fraxinus or Ulmus changing significantly. These results indicate that, over the range of seed densities used, rodents consumed a constant proportion of seeds irrespective of seed density or frequency. The high rates of exploitation for Ulmus seeds suggests the slope of the relationship primarily reflects rates of encounter, whereas for Fraxinus it is a result of both low encounter and exploitation. 4. Linear regression identified seed removal by rodents to be frequency-independent both over the woodland as a whole and within each of six micro-habitats. This appeared to be a result of the marked preference for Ulmus over Fraxinus which was not reversed even when Ulmus was rare. Frequency-dependent seed predation by rodents is predicted to be most likely when both prey have similar low palatabilities. 5. When encountered by rodents, patches of Ulmus seeds were exploited almost completely, irrespective of seed density or frequency which suggests rodents have the potential to cause local extinction of Ulmus seed populations.

Many species of altricial birds hatch their young asynchronously within broods. Although there are many potential benefits to parents, hatching asynchrony reduces the growth and often the survival of last-hatched nestlings. The consequences of hatching asynchrony on the growth, size at fledging and survival of male and female nestlings of an Australian parrot, the crimson rosella (Platycercus elegans) were examined. 2. Crimson rosella broods hatched over 1.5-7 days, creating mass hierarchies where first-hatched chicks were up to seven times larger than last-hatched chicks. Hatching asynchrony and mass hierarchies increased over the breeding season, but were not strongly correlated with brood size. 3. Male chicks grew faster and were larger at fledging than females. Growth rates did not differ between hatching ranks. Chicks of all ranks were of equal sizes at fledging, but last-hatched male chicks had lower fledging mass in pairwise analyses. Female mass at fledging did not decrease with hatching rank. Chick growth rates and size or mass at fledging were not related to hatching asynchrony, mass or size hierarchies in broods, brood size, laying date or year in mixed-model analyses. 4. Last-hatched chicks had the same post-fledging survival as other chicks, however, they were more likely to die during the nestling period. Increased mortality of last-hatched nestlings occurred only at hatching and chicks had equal mortality rates over the remainder of the nestling period. Early brood reduction was not associated with brood size or hatching asynchrony but increased over the breeding season, and in broods with high hatching success. 5. Hatching asynchrony in rosellas, unlike in most previous studies, did not lead to poor growth and subsequent survival of last-hatched chicks. This suggests that the costs of hatching asynchrony are low in this species and that selective feeding by parents may increase the growth and survival of last-hatched chicks. 6.

Introduced predators account for a large part of the extinction of endemic insular species, which constitutes a major component of the loss of biodiversity among vertebrates. Eradication of alien predators from these ecosystems is often considered the best solution. 2.

This process predicts that, once superpredators are suppressed, a burst of mesopredators may follow which leads their shared prey to extinction. 3. This process is studied through a mathematical model describing a three species system (prey-mesopredator-superpredator). Analysis of the model, with and without control of meso- and superpredators, shows that this process does indeed exist and can drive shared prey to rapid extinction. 4.

This sexual difference in moult-breeding overlap increased as the season progressed. 3. Females with moult-breeding overlap laid smaller clutches than non-moulting females. In addition to many other factors explaining the seasonal decline in clutch size that has been found for many bird species, it is possible that females adjust their clutch size according to their own risk of having to start moulting while still feeding the nestlings. 4. Nearly 24% of the females were deserted by their mate before the young fledged. Desertion imposed no fitness costs to males in terms of fledgling number or quality, suggesting that their females managed to adjust their care for the loss of male care. 5. Deserted females started moulting later than aided females, which may be a result of their increased reproductive investment. 6. Deserted females and females aided by moulting males had lower survival rate than females aided by non-moulting males. 7.

In mobile animals, two mechanisms for self-thinning have been proposed: (i) the space hypothesis predicts that maximum population density for a given body size is the inverse of territory size, and hence, the self-thinning slope is the negative of the slope of the allometric territory-size relationship; (ii) the energetic equivalence hypothesis predicts that the self-thinning slope is the negative of the slope of the allometric metabolic rate relationship, assuming a constant supply of energy for the cohort. 3. Both hypotheses were tested by monitoring body size, population density, food availability and habitat for young-of-the-year Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in Catamaran Brook, New Brunswick. The results were consistent with the predictions of the space hypothesis. Observed densities did not exceed the maximum densities predicted and the observed self-thinning slope of - 1.16 was not significantly different from the slope of - 1.12, predicted by the allometry of territory size for the population under study. 4. The observed self-thinning slope was significantly steeper than - 0.87, predicted by the allometry of metabolic rate, perhaps because of a gradual decline in food abundance over the study period. The decline in density was more rapid in very shallow sites and may have been partly caused by a seasonal change in water depth and an ontogenetic habitat shift rather than solely by competition for food or space. 5. The allometry of territory size may be a useful predictor of self-thinning in populations of mobile animals competing for food and space.",71,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Density dependence | Energetic equivalence | Intraspecific competition | Population density | Stream drift,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,83

The reproductive performance of individually marked mothers aged between 4 and 36 years breeding at the established grey seal colony of North Rona, Scotland was studied. Natality rate was between 0.805 and 0.975 for these females during 1979-95 and 57% of females produced 74% of the pups born. Mothers pupped successfully on N. Rona after absences of up to 5 years. 2. The average maternal postpartum mass (MPPM) of mothers was 190 ± 23 (SD) kg, larger than had been recorded from this colony previously. Although annual mean MPPM increased during the study, there were increases and decreases in individuals' MPPM between years. 3. Pup mass at birth and pup growth rate were related to MPPM and date of parturition. No evidence of differential postpartum expenditure in the sexes was found. Relative pup birth mass decreased with MPPM but relative pup weaning mass remained constant over the range of MPPM. 4. Maternal mass expenditure during lactation averaged 39% of MPPM, and the consequences for MPPM in the year following either high or low relative expenditure were inversely related to relative expenditure in the first year. However, mothers increased their mass after skipping breeding in a year. 5. General Linear Models and REML analyses indicated that expenditures were significantly different between mothers when other variables and factors had been taken into account. In general, maternal expenditure was greater for animals of larger masses and duration of lactation, but corrected maternal expenditure of longer individuals was less than expected. Pup mass at weaning was influenced by mother's identity and year and there was evidence that individual mothers which were longer for their weight raised smaller pups. 6.

Plots of local versus regional species richness are an exciting new tool for testing for species saturation in ecological communities. In this method, the local richness of a community is plotted as a function of its regional richness for different biogeographical regions. A proportional relationship between local and regional richness is interpreted as evidence for an unsaturated community, that is, a community with strong evolutionary limits to local richness. There will be no correlation between local and regional richness in a saturated community, that is, a community whose local species richness is limited largely by ecological processes. 2. Although at least 36 data sets have now been analysed using local-regional richness plots, there has not been much critical evaluation of the method. This paper provides such a critique, focusing on the selection of communities for comparison, the prevalence of pseudoreplication and multiple null models, and the effects of differing region size. 3. Local-regional richness plots are best suited for comparing similar habitats between different regions, not different habitats in a single region. In the latter, taxa effects and species pool effects are confounded. 4. Four very different types of local-regional richness plots have been published. Each type of plot has important underlying assumptions which are often not addressed by ecologists. 5. Of the 36 data sets reviewed in this paper, 13 were spatially pseudoreplicated, and 2 were temporally pseudoreplicated. Furthermore, ecologists differ in their choice of null model, with the result that the same local-regional plot could be interpreted as evidence for saturation by one ecologist, and for lack of saturation by another. 6. Differences in region size can result in pseudosaturation, the appearance of saturation by an unsaturated community. A simple model demonstrates this phenomenon. Other sources of error in estimating the regional species pool are also of concern. 7. In conclusion, local-regional richness plots are a potentially useful tool for distinguishing saturated from unsaturated communities, but should be used cautiously, and in conjunction with other supporting evidence (such as the presence or absence of competitive exclusion, resource limitation, density compensation and the effects of species invasions).",283,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Pseudoreplication | Region size | Species pool | Species richness | Unsaturated communities,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,86

We experimentally tested this assumption and investigated the effects of food availability on the ability of grazing sheep to compensate for restriction of available daily grazing time. 2. Foraging behaviour, intake and diet digestibility by sheep, were measured on grass pastures in a replicated 2 x 2 factorial experiment, in which overnight access to pasture was varied (restricted overnight and continuous access) on two sward heights (5.5 and 3.0 cm), representing high and low food availability. 3. Regardless of food availability, the overnight-restricted sheep fed for almost all of the available grazing time by grazing for fewer, longer foraging bouts, but still had much shorter total daily grazing time than the continuous access sheep. 4. In response to overnight penning, the sheep had a significantly higher instantaneous rate of intake achieved mainly via larger bites. The continuous access sheep were hence not maximizing their short-term rate of intake, whilst grazing according to the daily schedule considered normal for sheep. 5. The behavioural responses to overnight food restriction were able to counteract the reduction in daily grazing time only where food availability was high. In contrast on short swards overnight grazing restriction led to a reduction in total daily intake.

The dynamics of the population were influenced mainly by density-dependent harvesting, stochastic variation in climate and intrinsic variation in the age-structure of the female segment of the population. 3. A time delay in the assignment of hunting permits in relation to population size increased fluctuations in population size. 4. Selective harvesting of calves and yearlings increased the mean age of adult females in the population, and, because fecundity in moose is strongly age-specific, the number of calves per female concordantly increased.

This age-structure effect generated cycles in the rate of recruitment to the population and fluctuations introduced time-lags in the population dynamics. 5.

The intra-patch experience acquired by foraging parasitoid females has often been considered to have a strong influence on their tendency to leave a patch, and thus on their total patch residence time. Most studies that have been performed on this subject suggest that the patch-leaving rules observed are adaptive because they enable the females to adjust their patch residence time to local environmental conditions. 2. Considering a behavioural rule as being adaptive supposes that it has been progressively settled by natural selection, and thus that there is, in the population, genetic variation on which the natural selection could act. 3. Therefore, this study aimed to discover whether there was indeed genetic variability in the patch-leaving decision rules in a population of the egg parasitoid species Telenomus busseolae, which attacks patches of its hosts, the eggs of Sesamia nonagrioides. Different wasp families were compared using the isofemale lines method, and the behavioural records were analysed by means of a modified version of the Cox's proportional hazards model proposed by Haccou et al. (1991) and Hemerik, Driessen and Haccou (1993). 4. The results obtained show that T. busseolae females increase their tendency to leave the patch after each successful oviposition. Each host rejection also led to an increase in the tendency to leave the patch, but this effect was smaller when host rejections were observed between two ovipositions occurring in rapid succession. Subsequent visits to the patch also increased the patch-leaving tendency. 5. Genetic variability was found in both the global patch-leaving tendency and in the effect that successful ovipositions and host rejections have on this tendency. 6.

Numerous models of parasite-host coevolution have shown that parasitism could play a key role in a wide range of biological phenomena. One critical assumption underlying models of parasite-host coevolution is that natural selection acts on genetic variation for host susceptibility, but this assumption has rarely been tested in the wild. 2. Clonal hosts are particularly suitable for detecting associations between genotypes and parasitism, because multi-locus gene complexes are preserved during reproduction, and following clonal selection, hosts which differ at resistance loci may also show differences at neutral marker loci. In this study, allozymes were used to search for associations between multi-locus host genotypes (clones) and parasitism within 25 cyclically parthenogenetic populations of Daphnia. 3. Rates of parasitism were observed ranging from 0% to 48% of adult females, and infection by microparasites was found to significantly reduce host fecundity. 4. Significant differences were detected between the clonal composition of parasitized and healthy Daphnia in 12 populations, showing that the proportion of individuals infected varies among clones. Six populations were sampled repeatedly to determine whether this variation was associated with temporal changes in both host clonal frequencies and population genetic characteristics (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. genotypic linkage disequilibrium). Three of the six temporally sampled populations showed changes in genetic structure that were consistent with the expectations of parasite-mediated selection, while the other three did not. These latter three populations all had low parasite prevalence (indicating low selection intensities) and/or comprised primarily rare clones, thus limiting the statistical power of the study to detect parasite-mediated effects. 5. The results show the presence of genetic variation for the likelihood of contracting disease within Daphnia populations. These associations between infection and host genotype could result from genetic variation for parasite resistance or within-pond spatial arrangement of both host genotypes and parasite prevalences.

Interference among insect parasitoids leads to a reduction in the overall search rate (the population equivalent of searching efficiency) with increasing parasitoid population density. When this reduction is due to behavioural responses of individuals, to increased intraspecific competition, interference can serve as a stepping stone from individual behaviour to population phenomena. 2. Interference can take different forms: (1) a direct within-patch reduction of searching efficiency with parasitoid density (direct mutual interference); (2) a decrease in overall search rate with increasing parasitoid density if parasitoids have a non-uniform distribution over patches where this distribution remains unaltered with increasing density (pseudo-interference); (3a) a decrease in the time spent on patches by each individual, i.e. more or longer travelling at higher parasitoid densities; and (3b) a decrease in overall search rate due to a change in the distribution of parasitoid effort over patches with increasing parasitoid density. These last two forms arise from behavioural responses to increased parasitoid density and are forms of indirect mutual interference. 3. We present an expression for the overall search rate in a patchy environment where individual parasitoids travel between patches. We use this to show how the different forms of interference affect the overall search rate, contrasting environments with aggregated and uniform host distributions. 4. Using the data of Jones (1986) we explore the different forms of interference in a multipatch experiment. In these experiments, different numbers of parasitoids were introduced in an arena where the distribution of hosts over patches was either aggregated or uniform. We show that both pseudo-interference and indirect mutual interference play a role, and that they have an opposite effect for a uniform host distribution, but amplify one another for aggregated host distributions. 5. The indirect mutual interference arises from a shift towards a more uniform distribution of parasitoid effort over patches with increasing parasitoid densities. This shift is caused by a behavioural response to parasitoid density, and is likely due to changes in the parasitoids' patch arrival and departure decisions. These decisions underlie the distribution of time spent on patches, thereby linking individual behaviour to a phenomenon at the population level. 6. Finally, we put forward a more general framework for indirect mutual interference to also include behavioural responses in sex allocation, clutch size and host acceptance to parasitoid density as forms of interference.",30,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Interference | Overall search rate | Parasitoid | Population dynamics | Searching efficiency | Trybliographa rapae,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,94

Age-related patterns of reproduction in birds are often interpreted in terms of changing reproductive value with age: as residual reproductive value decreases with age birds have to increase their effort at younger age. In contrast, the 'state-based' approach to life history postulates that not age per se determines reproductive decisions, but the 'state', reflecting condition or quality that may differ considerably between individuals of the same age. In this respect, we investigated the stability of body condition, as well as individual quality differences in common terns Sterna hirundo and outline the role of parental quality and parental effort in reproductive performance. For lifetime identification we marked terns with passive transponders. Quality and effort were derived from body condition, which we monitored during the whole breeding season and every year for a period of up to 5 years. 2. Parameters of body condition and reproduction varied significantly between individuals, whereas intra-individual variation over years was very low. Hence, body condition is very stable and differs considerable between birds. 3. Among the factors number of chicks, year and parental body condition, the latter was the only significant factor influencing chick growth rates. Furthermore, high growth rates of chicks were correlated with good female condition, and breeding success was positively correlated with body condition of both parents during incubation and chick-rearing. 4. Parental effort increased significantly with increasing breeding success. The amount of expended effort depended on condition during incubation: mass loss was correlated with incubation mass, but not with mass during chick-rearing. 5. Age was not an important factor in terms of condition or quality and also in terms of reproduction. The age independent condition reflects bird quality, enabling high quality birds to invest high parental effort resulting in high reproductive success over years, yet without negative consequences on future reproduction. 6. We conclude that in the common tern condition is a stable and age-independent individual feature with substantial effects on reproduction. Hence, our data strongly support the 'state-based' approach to life history. The high constancy in condition within and great differences between birds may also result in differences in lifetime reproductive success and fitness.",135,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Body condition | Breeding success | Life history | Reproductive strategies | State-dependence,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,96

We examined positive associations and trade-offs of maternal and reproductive traits in a population of Columbian ground squirrels, Spermophilus columbianus. 2. Structural size, body condition, mother's personal allocation to body mass during reproduction, and timing of littering were estimated for live-trapped reproductive females that were observed during an 8-year period, and were compared to litter mass, litter size, and average pup mass using path analyses. 3. Mothers exhibited age-structured traits that influenced reproductive patterns. Yearling mothers were significantly smaller, bred later, and had smaller litters than older females. Mothers that gained more body mass during reproduction and older mothers in good body condition that were structurally large had larger litters. 4. Early seasonal timing of littering was an important positive influence on successful reproduction by older mothers only in early breeding seasons and in years when conditions for reproduction were good for all females. 5. The number of offspring that survived to 1 year of age was most strongly associated with litter mass and litter size; date of breeding was of secondary influence, with earlier litters exhibiting greater success. 6. In general, mothers that gained the most in body mass during reproduction were concurrently more successful in weaning large litters (perhaps due to better quality of foraging habitat). 7. In addition to expected reproductive trade-offs, reproduction by Columbian ground squirrels exhibited positive associations of life-history traits that may reflect evolutionary increasing returns.",81,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Increasing returns | Life history | Path analysis | Reproductive effort | Spermophilus,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,97

The foraging ecology of Brunnich's guillemots Uria lomvia was studied during the breeding season in south-eastern Svalbard. In the region of Storfjorden there are two large breeding colonies comprising a total of about 540 000 individuals. These birds forage in the western part of Storfjorden and further to the south. Their main prey: are polar cod Boreogadus saida, pelagic amphipods Parathemisto spp. and euphausiids Thysanoessa inermis. 2. A ship-based transect survey was used to record bird abundance and the acoustically determined biomass of presumed prey. The five transects were divided into 33 segments, each 8-11 km in length. The resolution of the survey was 150 m, and analyses of correlations between predators and prey were performed at length scales: from 150 m to 9 km. We differentiated acoustic signals into aggregated and dispersed categories according to the estimated horizontal distribution of presumed prey. 3. Foraging guillemots were consistently more strongly correlated with the aggregated prey than with dispersed prey over scales ranging from 150 m to 9 km. Correlations were weak at small scales (150 m - 1 km) and increased and stabilized at scales of 23 km. The spatial scale at which we obtained a shift from weak to strong correlations between guillemots and their prey was similar to the scale at which the spatial variances in both guillemot and prey abundance were high. 4. Guillemots showed low correlations with prey at low prey densities. Similarly, correlations between guillemots and prey were low at low bird densities. The data support the hypothesis that the birds associate with prey patches with densities above a certain threshold, and that 'regional' prey abundances affect local use of patches. 5. The numerical aggregative response curves between guillemot and prey density were classified as being neither hyperbolic (type II) or sigmoidal (type III) within the range of prey densities observed in this study. The aggregative response curves were sensitive to spatial scales, which suggest that studies of response curves should be conducted at a range of spatial scales.",44,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Aggregative response | Brunnich's guillemots | Foraging ecology | Scale dependence | Uria lomvia,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,98

The distribution of transmittable parasites in group-living host species has been investigated in a number of studies. However, little is known about the distribution of parasites with indirect life cycles in this context. This study investigates the relationship between parasitism and shoal composition by looking at the distribution of Crassiphiala bulboglossa (Haitsma), a trematode worm which uses fish as an intermediate host, within and between fish shoals in a lake. In particular, tests aimed at establishing whether the parasite distribution was affected by parasite-assortative shoaling behaviour, host group size, host habitat characteristics, and other factors (such as species identity and body length) that potentially covary with parasite infection. 2. Overall, 34 fish shoals were caught. For each shoal member, the fish species was identified, its standard body length measured and its parasites (C. bulboglossa) counted. Three habitat characteristics were also recorded for each shoal: water depth and distances to shore and to vegetation. 3. Crassiphiala bulboglossa prevalence and load varied with fish species. Only 6% of the golden shiners [Notemigonus crysoleucas (Mitchill)] were parasitized, whereas 24% of the killifish (Fundulus diaphanus (Lesueur)] and 98% of the white suckers [Catostomus commersoni (Lacepede)] were infected. Infected shiners and killifish had very low parasite loads, whereas suckers were heavily parasitized. Parasite prevalence within shoals was not correlated with the average body lengths of killifish and shiners in shoals (sample size was too small for testing in suckers). 4. Killifish shoals showed parasite prevalences significantly different from those expected under a null hypothesis that assumes assortment of fish between shoals by size and species but not by parasitism. In shiners and suckers, no evidence for nonrandom distribution of parasites among shoals was found, which may have been because of lack of statistical power. 5. Parasite prevalence was related to the number of conspecifics in a shoal for shiners but not for killifish. 6. There was no significant relationship between parasite prevalence and habitat characteristics in shiners and killifish.",17,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Fundulus diaphanus | Notemigonus crysoleucas | Parasite distribution | Shoal composition | Shoaling behaviour,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,99

Intraspecific aggregation at a single spatial scale can promote the coexistence of competitors. This paper demonstrates how this same mechanism can be applied to the many systems that are patchy at two scales, with patches nested within 'superpatches'. 2. Data are presented from a field study showing that insects living in rotting fruits have aggregated distributions in the fruits under a single tree, and that the mean density and degree of aggregation varies significantly among trees. Observations in this system motivate the following models. 3. A model of competition has been developed between two species which explicitly represents spatial variation at two scales. By integrating the probability distributions for each scale, the marginal distributions of competitors over all patches can be found and used to calculate coexistence criteria. This model assumes global movement of the competitors. 4. Although spatial variation at a single scale may not be sufficient for coexistence, the total variation over all patches can allow coexistence. Variation in mean densities among superpatches and variation in the degree of aggregation among superpatches both promote coexistence, but act in different ways. 5. A second model of competition between two species is described which incorporates the effects of limited movement among superpatches. Limited movement among superpatches generally promotes coexistence, and also leads to correlations among aggregation and the mean densities of competitors.",35,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Aggregation | Coexistence | Competition | Negative binomial | Nested spatial variation,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,100

The scale at which population dynamics are analysed is important, as results from analyses at different spatial scales can differ and affect interpretation. 2. In this study, detailed census data collected over a 10-year period from a population of Soay sheep (Ovis aries L.) on the Island of Hirta in the St Kilda archipelago, Scotland, is used, together with cluster analysis, to distinguish a temporally stable spatial substructure. 3. Structured demographic accounting of the variance in population change (SDA) is also used to analyse the dynamics of the whole population treated as (a) one unit; (b) one unit subdivided into three subunits; and (c) three independent units. 4. Differences in survival, recruitment and dispersal rates are demonstrated between divisions of the population, which are probably associated with variation in grazing quality. 5.

Habitat fragmentation is involved in the present extinction crisis and is known to influence many aspects of population dynamics. The level of connectivity between populations is one of its components. In an experimental study on the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara Jacquin), we analysed in two contrasting habitats the influence of connection on dispersal patterns, on differences between dispersing and philopatric individuals, on population size, survival rates, and reproduction. 2. The experimental design consisted of eight two-patch units. Half of them were connected by dispersal. We performed this treatment in a grassland and a wood clearance, two habitats with different resource availability (respectively called 'rich' and 'poor' habitat). 3. We expected that the loss of connection would modify juvenile dispersal patterns, have a different effect on dispersing and philopatric individuals, negatively affect survival rates and fecundity by modifying social interactions and would have different consequences in 'rich' habitats compared to 'poor' ones. 4. Connection modified dispersal patterns. Two dispersal periods occurred in unconnected units, but only one occurred in connected ones. Moreover, dispersers of the second dispersal period were morphologically similar to philopatric individuals. The loss of connection probably caused the late dispersal of individuals which would have remained philopatric in a connected context. Dispersers of the second period seemed to have lower winter survival rates than philopatric individuals, as expected if these individuals had been 'forced' to disperse. 5. We found that connection modified demography through juvenile winter survival rates and female reproduction depending on habitat type. Connection led to higher juvenile survival rates in 'rich' habitats, whereas it was not the case in 'poor' habitats. The loss of connection decreased female reproductive rate whatever the type of habitat. 6. This study suggests that connection can directly modify demographic parameters depending on habitat quality and involving behavioural mechanisms. It confirms that conservation management, like installation of dispersal corridors, must take into account habitat characteristics and behavioural features.",85,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Demographic parameters | Habitat fragmentation | Lacerta vivipara | Pattern and behaviour of dispersal | Two-patch system,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,102

The relative importance of density-dependent and -independent factors on interannual variation in over-winter survival was investigated in the fluctuating population of Soay sheep on St Kilda, Scotland, over the period 1985-96. 2. Population density had a negative effect on survival in lambs and adult males while adult female survival showed no evidence of density dependence over the observed range of population densities. 3. Climatic fluctuations associated with the winter North Atlantic oscillation index (NAO) also affected survival, which decreased in winters that were relatively warm, wet and windy. The effect was most pronounced in lambs. 4. Survival was modelled using logistic regression analysis with and without year fitted as a random effect. The former incorporated stochastic year to year variation in survival. Results from the two modelling approaches were similar in terms of the regression coefficients estimated. However, the standard errors of the year-dependent covariates, population size and NAO, were underestimated when the random year effect was ignored, leading to incorrect inferences about the relative significance of terms being made. 5. Using both modelling approaches, density dependence was found to have a greater influence on survival than the effect of NAO in lambs and adult males, whereas in adult females NAO was the more important. 6. Once random between-year effects were taken into account, the individually varying terms such as body weight and faecal egg count were the most significant factors explaining differences in survival.",145,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Density dependence | Density-independence | Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) | Logistic regression | North Atlantic oscillation | Over-winter mortality,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,103
