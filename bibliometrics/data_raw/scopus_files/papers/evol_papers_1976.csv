However, since increases in the rate of pulmonary ventilation just compensated for diminished uptake of oxygen by the gills, and since carbon dioxide could not be excreted efficiently across the skin, the transition from water breathing to air breathing may have been accompanied by gradual, obligatory increases in carbon dioxide tension of the blood. Thus, to preserve a given level of pH in the body fluids, simultaneous evolutionary increases in the concentration of blood bicarbonate may also have occurred. Consequently, by the time the gills of protoamphibians ceased to have a function in gas exchange, the concentration of bicarbonate ions in blood plasma may have increased to the point that the lungs could excrete the bulk of the carbon dioxide produced in intermediary metabolism without the animals experiencing an acidosis or increasing the rate of pulmonary ventilation beyond what was required to satisfy oxygen requirements."

This is accomplished by placing increased emphasis on phenotypic parameters. While it is not possible to be completely successful in describing evolution in purely phenotypic terms, it seems that in many circumstances appropriate for natural populations this can be done. In the first section, Simpson's concept of adaptive zones is clarified by the construction of an adaptive topography for phenotypes, similar to Wright's adaptive topography for gene frequencies. This shows that for most phenotypic characters under natural selection, the evolution of the average phenotype in a population is always toward an adaptive zone of high mean fitness (W) in the phenotype space. Frequency dependent selection may cause the average phenotype to evolve away from its adaptive zone, decreasing the mean fitness of individuals in the population; different types of frequency dependent selection are classified as to whether or not they lead to such maladaptive evolution. A simple formula for estimating the minimum selective mortality per generation necessary to explain observed rates of phenotypic evolution is derived (assuming that genetic drift was not involved). The minimum mortality rates needed to explain observed rates of evolution in tooth characters of Tertiary mammals are very small, typically about one selective death per million individuals per generation. This leads to consideration of the hypothesis that these changes were caused by random genetic drift. Using statistical tests, it is found that the observed evolution of these mammalian tooth characters could have occurred by random genetic drift in rather large populations, with effective sizes in the tens or hundreds of thousands. Such statistical tests would be most interesting in cases where the adaptive significance of an evolutionary event is uncertain. Other hypotheses are also examined, including the existence of a selective threshold between two adaptive zones which might have been crossed by random genetic drift. The models indicate that if stabilizing selection is weak and an adaptive threshold is not very far away, random genetic drift between adaptive zones may be an important mechanism of evolution in populations of effective size in the hundreds or thousands. These results support the contention that random genetic drift may play a significant role in phenotypic evolution."

Genetic variation was measured for 29 loci in 50 populations from 35 localities throughout the structured and potentially known distribution in eastern Australia. The average population was polymorphic for 15.3% (5% criterion) and 19.2% (1% criterion) of the loci sampled. The average individual was heterozygous at only 6.5% of the loci sampled. This low level of heterozygosity is considered in terms of founder effect, niche width and environmental grain, and it is suggested that the cactophilic species of the mulleri subgroup may show less genic variation than other Drosophila species. The low level of genetic variation appears not to be due to a founder effect associated with the species' introduction into Australia. For the five variable loci where tests were possible, heterozygote frequencies were generally less than expected, possibly due to the combined or individual effects of Wahlund's principle, extra inbreeding above that due to finite population size because of the mating of close relatives and diversifying selection. At least two of the localities sampled appear to be genetically isolated and it is argued that some form of balancing selection is operating to maintain variation."
