Here, we examine the relative balance of light and phosphorus in a set of freshwater pelagic ecosystems. We calculated a ratio of light : phosphorus by putting mixed-layer mean light in the numerator and total P concentration in the denominator. This light: phosphorus ratio was a good predictor of the C: P ratio of particulate matter (seston), with a positive correlation demonstrated between these two ratios. We argue that the balance between light and nutrients controls 'nutrient use efficiency' at the base of the food web in lakes. Thus, when light energy is high relative to nutrient availability, the base of the food web is carbon rich and phosphorus poor. In the opposite case, where light is relatively less available compared to nutrients, the base of the food web is relatively P rich. The significance of this relationship lies in the fact that the composition of sestonic material is known to influence a large number of ecosystem processes such as secondary production, nutrient cycling, and (we hypothesize) the relative strength of microbial versus grazing processes. Using the central result of increased C:P ratio with an increased light:phosphorus ratio, we make specific predictions of how ecosystem structure and process should vary with light and nutrient balance. Among these predictions, we suggest that lake ecosystems with low light:phosphorus ratios should have several trophic levels simultaneously carbon or energy limited, while ecosystems with high light:phosphorus ratios should have several trophic levels simultaneously limited by phosphorus. Our results provide an alternative perspective to the question of what determines nutrient use efficiency in ecosystems.",360,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

Dose-response experiments showed that larvae from a laboratory colony of gypsy moths are substantially less heterogeneous in their susceptibility to the virus than are larvae from feral populations, and field experiments showed that there is a more strongly nonlinear relationship between transmission and virus density for fetal larvae than for lab larvae. This nonlinearity in transmission changes the dynamics of the virus in natural populations so that a model incorporating host heterogeneity in susceptibility to the virus gives a much better fit to data on virus dynamics from large-scale field plots than does a classical model that ignores host heterogeneity.

One mechanism for larval aggregation is the laying of eggs in clutches by females traveling among patches to distribute their total fecundity. We use simulation models to explore the consequences, for coexistence of competitors, of larval aggregation that arises from clutch laying. Contrary to some previous treatments, we find that clutch laying can be strongly stabilizing and under certain conditions can be sufficient to allow competitors to coexist stably. We extend these models by considering clutch size as a variable that responds to the abundance of resource patches. Such a relationship might be expected because females should lay their eggs in fewer but larger clutches when the cost of travel among patches is high (because patches are rare). When females adjust clutch size in response to resource abundance, coexistence can be easiest when resource patches are scarce and most difficult when resources are abundant.",36,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,4,NA,NA

We present a model with three quantitative traits: male and female parental investment and a potential male indicator trait. In our model, the expression of the 'indicator' trait in offspring is affected by parental investment. These effects are referred to as maternal or paternal effects, or as 'indirect genetic effects' when parental investment is heritable. With genetic variation for degree of parental investment, offspring harbor genes for parental investment that are unexpressed before mating but will affect the investment that they provide when expressed.

By examining both the costs and the benefits, we show that harshness alone does not lessen the importance of species interactions or limit their role in community structure. Species coexistence requires niche differences, and harshness does not in itself make coexistence more likely. Fluctuations in environmental conditions (e.g., disturbance seasonal change, and weather variation) also have been regarded as decreasing species interactions and favoring coexistence, but we argue that coexistence can only be favored when fluctuations create spatial or temporal niche opportunities.

Perennials also pay a cost when selfing increases total seed set at the expense of future survivorship and reproduction. Such life-history considerations shed new light on the generalization that annuals self-fertilize more than perennials.

I used simple small-scale communities of bacteria and protozoa to study extinction in response to habitat loss and habitat fragmentation. I studied several different community configurations, each with three trophic levels. Unlike most metapopulation studies (experimental as well as theoretical), which have tended to deal with inherently unstable species interactions, I deliberately used community configurations that were persistent in large stock cultures.

These predictions relate to commonly collected field data that include the visiting behavior of females and the quality of accepted and rejected males. Using these types of data, we conclude that pine engravers use an adjustable threshold mate choice tactic because females often accepted the first male encountered, rarely revisited males, visited similar numbers of males in patches of different quality, accepted higher-quality males than those they rejected even on their first encounter with a male in patch, and had higher acceptance thresholds in high-quality patches than in low-quality patches.

Data from some studies suggest that increased heterozygosity may be functionally correlated with superior performance in a variety of fitness-related traits. Thus, hybrid asexual species could be expected to exhibit some degree of heterosis. This spontaneous heterosis hypothesis is tested in a comparative study of asexual and sexual species of the lizard genus Cnemidophorus. Asexual species of the genus are parthenogenetically reproducing hybrids of the sexual species and as a result have high levels of heterozygosity that have persisted since their origins. Five whole-organism physiological traits (burst speed, endurance, maximal exertion, standard metabolic rate, and evaporative water loss rate) were examined in five asexual species and the sexual species that gave rise to them. Trait values for sexual and asexual species were compared using a nonphylogenetic approach and two phylogenetically controlled approaches capable of dealing with reticulate phylogenies. In contrast to the predictions of the heterosis hypothesis, performance for four of the traits in asexual Cnemidophorus was not statistically different than that in their sexual parental species, and asexuals had significantly worse endurance. On the whole, the overall trend appeared to be toward worse performance in asexuals. An obvious interpretation of these results is that heterozygosity and 'vigor' need not be functionally related.

Consensual decisions also had another effect: they increased variation between groups because entire bands enacted their subsistence strategies collectively and the strategies varied between bands. By reducing the intensity of individual selection and boosting group effects, these behaviors provided a unique opportunity for altruistic genes to be established and maintained. In addition, the egalitarian custom of socially isolating or actively punishing lazy or cheating noncooperators reduced the flee-rider problem. In combination, these phenotypic effects facilitated selection of altruistic genes in spite of some limited free riding.

On the other hand, a detailed bifurcation analysis proves that dynamic complexity first increases with nutrient supply (from stationary to a low-frequency cyclic regime and, finally, to chaos) and then decreases (from chaos to a high-frequency cyclic regime). A careful comparison of the two analyses supports the conclusion that food chains cycling at high frequency are oversupplied, while all others are undersupplied. A straightforward consequence of this result is that maximization of food yield requires a chaotic regime.

By using the concept of subjective frequencies, it is shown that among-deme variance in the local sex ratio reduces the average fitness of females when pollen availability limits fertility. In contrast, sex ratio variance increases the fitness of hermaphrodites from the perspective of maternally inherited genes and lessens the negative impact of pollen limitation on hermaphrodite fitness when it is measured from the perspective of biparentally inherited genes. As a consequence, when local demes vary in sex ratio, a polymorphism for a cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) allele can be maintained in the absence of nuclear alleles that restore male function. When restorer alleles are introduced into the model, polymorphism cannot be maintained simultaneously at both the cytoplasmic and nuclear loci. In that case, the CMS allele spreads to fixation, and the equilibrium frequency of females is an inverse function of the equilibrium frequency of the restorer allele, which increases with increased structure.

This article uses nonlinear models to disentangle the confounding effects of prior herbivory on food quantity and quality. The first (null) model assumes that herbivore performance is determined only by the quantity of food available to an average herbivore. Modified models allow two distinct effects of damage-induced defenses: an increase in the amount of food each herbivore is required to consume in order to achieve maximum performance and a reduction in the maximum performance even when herbivores are fed ad lib. Maximum likelihood methods were used to fit the models to data from field experiments in which Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) larvae were reared on three varieties of potatoes that had been damaged to varying degrees by adult beetles: Prior damage reduced the mean mass of beetles at pupation, and this effect was due to both a decrease in food quantity and induced changes in food quality. In contrast, beetle survival was affected in some cases by reduced food quantity but showed no responses that could be attributed to induced defenses.

If it pays a group member to behave selfishly (i.e., increase its share of the group's reproduction, at the expense of group productivity), then its partner will virtually always be favored to provide a reproductive 'bribe' sufficient to remove the incentive for the selfish behavior. The magnitude of the bribe will vary directly with the number of offspring (or other close kin) potentially gained by the selfish individual and inversely with both the relatedness r between tile interactants and the loss in group productivity because of selfishness. This bribe principle greatly extends tile scope for cooperation within groups. Reproductive bribing is more likely to be favored over social policing for dominants rather than subordinates and as intragroup relatedness increases. Finally, analysis of the difference between the group optimum for an individual's behavior and the individual's inclusive fitness optimum reveals a paradoxical feedback loop by which bribing and policing, while nullifying particular selfish acts, automatically widen the separation of individual and group optima for other behaviors (i.e., resolution of one conflict intensifies others).",50,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,40,all,All Open Access

At the other extreme are the larger lacertids with the opposite suite of traits. Much of this pattern can be deduced from two relations: the increase of adult life span with adult body size and the negative allometry of offspring size. After the effects of body size were statistically removed, residuals of adult life span and age at sexual maturity were positively correlated, whereas residuals of the number and size of offspring were negatively correlated. The detection of these size-free relations supports an interpretation of coadaptive adjustments among life-history variables.

To assess the effects of breeding dispersion on foraging success, I simulated the foraging behavior of cliff-breeding seabirds (nesting either solitarily or colonially) searching for patchily distributed prey. Results show that colonial breeding is favored when food patches are sufficiently large or short-lived that competition for food is ameliorated. Conversely, dispersed nesting is favored when patches are small or long-lived.

The principal question addressed is how these forms of density dependence in parasitoid dynamics combine with aggregated parasitism to affect the stability of the models, in relation to suppression of host abundance. When parasitoid yield is an overcompensating function of either parasitoid or host density, stability is enhanced for systems with host equilibria suppressed far below the host carrying capacity. Substantially less aggregation of parasitism is required for stability in this situation than in previous models assuming parasitoid yield is constant. However, this density dependence in parasitoid yield also reduces stability when the host equilibrium is suppressed only moderately below carrying capacity; this is especially true when parasitoid yield is more strongly decreased by high host density than is host per capita reproduction. At present there is little empirical evidence concerning the relationships of parasitoid recruitment to parasitoid and host densities.

I tested experimentally whether parasitism in female Drosophila nigrospiracula increases fluctuating asymmetry in male offspring. I also developed a novel measure for estimating developmental instability in a meristic trait called positional fluctuating asymmetry, which is based on the difference in the position of thoracic bristles between the right and left sternopleuron. I expected this measure to be a more sensitive indicator of developmental instability than the traditional numerical fluctuating asymmetry, because the latter is based on the difference in the actual presence or absence of bristles. Female flies burdened with hematophagous mites, Macrocheles subbadius (Macrochelidae), produced sons with significantly higher positional fluctuating asymmetry than did females carrying no mites. This effect, which may have resulted from impaired provisioning of oocytes by infested females, was dose dependent and magnified in the progeny of younger (18-20 d) versus older (30-32 d) females. This apparent magnification resulted from a slight but not significant increase in asymmetry of offspring of the older and unparasitized females. In contrast, the same mite loads had no effect on offspring numerical fluctuating asymmetry. If low-positional fluctuating asymmetry males enjoy a mating advantage, then with appropriate genetic variability, sexual selection could drive the evolution of host resistance in host populations. However, variability in neither kind of asymmetry influenced male mating success in nature. Thus, although male positional fluctuating asymmetry is causally associated with parasitism via maternal effects, asymmetry-based sexual selection is unlikely to influence the evolution of mite resistance in D. nigrospiracula. The value of the sensitivity afforded by positional fluctuating asymmetry is discussed in the context of sexual selection and conservation biology.",40,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,60,NA,NA

We describe model dynamics in terms that have direct biological interpretations. We illustrate the use of our approach by examining the dynamics of Dungeness crab (Cancer magister) in detail. Model dynamics are found to be very sensitive to changes in life-history parameters. Small changes in vital rates can cause population density to suddenly jump from low to high variability or vice versa. Nonmonotonic switching between chaotic and nonchaotic dynamics is also observed. The period (or dominant timescale) of cyclic behavior is loosely related to values of vital rates, typically increasing with adult survivorship, but can remain constant while vital rates change. Model dynamics are also found to be sensitive to environmental perturbations. For example, model dynamics may be chaotic or nonchaotic for fixed parameter values with environmental perturbations switching model dynamics between these distinct behaviors (i.e., the dynamics are nonstationary).

We present a series of models in which altruism is a continuously varying trait and individuals are free to choose their associates, based on information that is acquired through experience, observation, or cultural transmission. Assortative interactions can generate highly nonrandom variation among groups, favoring the evolution of altruism and other group-level adaptations among genealogically unrelated individuals. Altruism can evolve even when the initial phenotypic variation in altruism is not heritable, a form of genetic assimilation. The importance of assortative interactions depends in part on cognitive abilities that allow the phenotypes of social partners to be assessed.

Using a novel metapopulation model, we investigate the consequences of synchronous versus asynchronous crop planting for the density of a pest either with or without specific predators.

We suggest that the contrasting dynamics of these two populations are caused by differences in fecundity and maturation rate. Red deer show relatively low fecundity and slow maturation, and increases in population density depress both fecundity and juvenile survival.

We illustrate an approach to studying pollinator-mediated selection in plant hybrid zones, using two species of Ipomopsis (Polemoniaceae) as a model system. We measured visitation to flowers in natural and experimental populations by two major types of pollinators, hummingbirds and hawkmoths, at up to three different spatial scales. Using measures of pollinator visitation, we calculated phenotypic selection gradients and characterized the form of selection in the hybrid zone. Hummingbirds overvisited Ipomopsis aggregata compared with Ipomopsis tenuituba and morphological hybrids at all spatial scales, especially the largest scale of kilometers. These responses may depend in part on the presence of other hummingbird-visited plants in the community. Hummingbird behavior produced directional selection favoring wide corolla tubes and intense red coloration. Hawkmoths, in contrast, overvisited plants with narrow corolla tubes. When both types of pollinators were present, corolla width experienced disruptive selection, consistent with a model of hybrid disadvantage, in the natural hybrid zone, however, hawkmoths are rare participants. In most years plants experience visitation from hummingbirds alone. Thus, selection by pollinators usually fits an advancing wave model in which traits characteristic of I. aggregata are favored everywhere.

Here we provide a definition of diffuse coevolution that leads to three criteria for the operation of pairwise coevolution: susceptibilities (resistances) to different herbivores are genetically uncorrelated, the presence/absence of one herbivore does not affect the amount of damage caused by other herbivores, and the impact of one herbivore on plant fitness does not depend on the presence/absence of other herbivores. All three criteria must be satisfied for coevolution to be pairwise; if any of them fail, coevolution is diffuse.

Species that compete may also be locked in predator-prey interactions, a mixture of competition and predation known as 'intraguild predation' (IGP). There is growing evidence for the importance of IGP in many natural communities, yet little formal ecological theory addresses this particular blend of interactions. In this article, we explore the consequences of incorporating IGP into standard models of exploitative competition and food chains (a general resource-consumer model, a Lotka-Volterra food chain model, and Schoener's exploitative competition model). Our theoretical analyses suggest a general criterion for coexistence in IGP systems: the intermediate species (the prey in intraguild predation) should be superior at exploitative competition for the shared resource, whereas the top species (the predator) should gain significantly from its consumption of the intermediate species. Along gradients in environmental productivity, coexistence is most likely at intermediate levels of productivity. Analyses of the models reveal the potential for alternative stable states in systems with IGP; these are particularly likely if the top predator gains little benefit from consuming the intermediate predator. We further show that IGP can lead to unstable population dynamics, even when all pairwise interactions are inherently stable and each species can increase when rare. Persistent, strong IGP raises a puzzle of species coexistence, particularly in productive environments. We conclude by comparing IGP with related community modules (i.e., food chains, exploitative competition, apparent competition) and discussing mechanisms that should foster coexistence in systems with strong IGP.",808,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,97,NA,NA

This plant-induced negative feedback on production contrasts with the positive feedback that had previously been hypothesized. Our model explains the causes and results of several important ecological patterns. First, all ecosystems with a fixed N pool will show a small increase in C storage (especially in soils) in response to elevated CO2 despite constraints by litter-quality feedbacks to N mineralization rate. Second, the decreased N-use efficiency and plateauing of primary production in forest ecosystems with a high N supply reflect saturation of photosynthetic rate with high plant N pools.
