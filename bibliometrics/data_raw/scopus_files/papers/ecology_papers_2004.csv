This caused the standard nominally symmetric t-based intervals, based on approximate normality of the estimator of the total, to be highly unbalanced, i.e., intervals much more often missed from below than from above. To better cope with this situation I suggest an alternative confidence interval procedure that takes into account and adjusts for the induced correlation. A simulation study based on one of the populations used by Gregoire and Schabenberger shows that the resulting adjusted intervals have more balanced noncoverage probabilities and often higher coverage probability than the standard intervals in cases of substantial correlation.

Models for life history canalization and plasticity postulate a threshold for initiation of canalized developmental events. Some models postulate adaptive plasticity, whereas others postulate nonadaptive plasticity that results from environmental modulation of fixed development. These models have been tested by changing feeding rate at various times and determining when timing of life history events becomes unresponsive to those changes. This approach has been criticized because putative thresholds are usually not known. We use an alternative experimental design to test models of reproductive plasticity and canalization, and to estimate thresholds, in the grasshopper Romalea microptera. We develop mathematical models for published verbal models that predict how life history timing changes with feeding rate. Alternative models predict distinct relationships of time to oviposition vs. mean food intake that we test via experimental manipulation of food intake and nonlinear regressions. Regressions yield estimates of both the threshold and the duration of post-threshold development. A model postulating a fixed threshold and canalized post-threshold development provides the best, most parsimonious fit to data for this grasshopper. Thus, the simplest model, postulating no adaptive variation in development, is supported, a result that is consistent with previous experiments on this system using changing feeding rates. We use the estimate of the threshold (in units of food eaten) and measurements of hemolymph protein content to estimate the threshold in units of physiologically relevant storage.

At the first site, the minority host species occurred at frequencies too low to sustain the parasite, whereas at the second location, both hosts constituted an exploitable resource. Thus, only in the latter community does the parasite have the options to expand its niche or to alternate between the available host species. During slave raids, which represent the crucial parasite-host encounter, hosts and slavemakers from the second site were less efficient at defending and raiding, respectively.

Differences in biogeochemistry were most pronounced at broad scales among the major lake basins of Taylor Valley corresponding to differences in geology and microclimate, while variation in invertebrate biodiversity and abundance occurred at landscape scales of 10-500 m, and within individual soil polygons.

This general statement is mostly based on studies from extra-tropical mountains and has been rarely evaluated in subtropical latitudes frequently characterized by drier climates. In the subtropical mountains from Northwestern Argentina (∼23° S), annual precipitation decreases with elevation from >1500 mm at 1200-1500 m, to <200 mm above 4000 m. In consequence, tree growth at high elevations in the region may be seriously limited by water supply. In order to assess the influence of precipitation on tree growth, we evaluated the relationships between climatic variations and radial growth in four species growing at different altitudinal zones: Juglans australis from the montane cloud forest at 1800 m; Alnus acuminata from the montane savanna-like woodland at 2700 m; Prosopis ferox from the subalpine dryland at 3500 m; and Polylepis tarapacana from the high-elevation alpine dryland, at 4750 m. Dendrochronological techniques were used to relate variations in annual ring width with instrumental climatic records. Growth rings were correctly dated to the year of formation, and the cross-dated series standardized using autoregressive models to reduce non-climatic signals present in the records. Tree-ring chronologies, ranging from 117 to 341 years, were compared, during the common period, with instrumental climatic records using correlation-function analysis. In spite of the remarkable differences in elevation and environmental conditions among the sampling sites, correlation functions with climate indicated that the radial growth of the four species is largely controlled by precipitation. In most cases, increased precipitation during the previous and current growing seasons favors tree growth, while temperatures are negatively correlated with radial growth, likely due to the negative effect on water availability. These results indicate that the generalized idea of upper-treeline growth limited by summer temperatures should be carefully evaluated in low-latitude environments and does not apply to subtropical areas with severe water deficits or strong moisture seasonalities.","Alnus acuminata | Altitudinal range | Argentina, Northwestern | Dendrochronology | Juglans australis | Polylepis tarapacana | Prosopis ferox | Rainfall-controlled growth | Subtropical trees | Treeline",NA,NA,NA,NA

Overall, trophic level biomass responses were less pronounced than density because smaller bodied individuals responded more to enrichment. Bottom-up factors controlled basal trophic levels, and detritivores comprised the largest fraction of arthropod density and biomass. Conversely, top-down impacts were apparent but variable, limited to higher order consumers, and did not cascade to the level of primary producers.

Our analyses reveal that (1) there is variation for resistance to herbivores and pathogens among the five families used in the study, indicating that there is broad-sense heritability for resistance; (2) inbred plants suffer greater herbivore damage and have more symptoms of viral infection than outbred plants, i.e., there is inbreeding depression for herbivore/pathogen resistance; (3) the impacts of insecticide applications and inbreeding on reproduction are mostly additive; (4) both male and female functions are significantly affected by the spray treatment and inbreeding; and (5) the adverse effects of both inbreeding and the increased exposure to herbivores/pathogens in the no-spray treatment are greater for female function than for male function, indicating that the impact of genetic and environmental stress can differentially affect the two sexual functions. Together, these findings have important implications for the evolution of selfing, the conservation of small populations, and the establishment and transmission of diseases within populations.",Cucurbita | Disease ecology | Herbivory | Inbreeding depression | Male function | Pathogen infection | Reproductive output | Resistance: Tolerance | Viral disease,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the presence of a lethal predator the active families experienced higher mortality than the less active families.

However, an evolutionary change in chemical defenses in response to herbivory requires that there is both heritable variation for that trait and a response by herbivores to such variation. The subtidal red alga Delisea pulchra produces four main secondary metabolites (furanones) that vary in concentration at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Here we determined the heritability of furanone concentrations and then, with a series of feeding experiments, determined how feeding by herbivores associated with D. pulchra varied as a function of nonpolar extract and furanone concentration. Total furanone concentration showed significant broad-sense heritability (hC2 = 0.234), but broad-sense heritability of the four individual furanones varied in magnitude, ranging from 0.058 to 0.321. Compound 3, which is often the most abundant furanone, was the only one of the four furanones to show significant genetic variation. However, all four furanones were strongly genetically correlated, indicating that selection acting on any one of them will cause a corresponding change in the others. With the exception of the mesograzer gastropod Phasianotrochus eximius, herbivores generally consumed D. pulchra at lower rates compared to other common macroalgae. Macrograzers (sea urchins and large gastropods) were mostly deterred by nonpolar extract that contained levels of furanones that spanned the range of furanone variation in the field. The amphipod Ampithoe ngana was not deterred at the lowest extract concentration, and P. eximius was not deterred by any naturally occurring extract concentration. Compound 3 was deterrent to macrograzers at 3 and 5 mg/g dry mass, but was not deterrent at 1 mg/ g dry mass. Compound 3 was also not deterrent to A. ngana at any of those concentrations. For the most part D. pulchra in the field contains concentrations of furanones that are strongly deterrent to most herbivores. However, at some places and times, furanones do occur at lower concentrations that are not deterrent to herbivores. Given the heritable variation for furanones, when this overlap occurs there is the potential for selection by herbivores for higher concentrations of furanones in D. pulchra.",Chemical defense | Delisea pulchra | Feeding deterrence | Furanones | Herbivores | Heritability | Marine algae | Marine plant-herbivore interactions | Natural selection | Quantitative genetics,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We combined the dispersal data with data on seed production and germination ability to estimate effects on colonization capacity. Habitat fragmentation decreases the number and size of populations. This does not affect the populations' seed dispersal ability, but it reduces the number and germinability of produced seeds, and hence the colonization capacity. Site eutrophication strongly reduces seed dispersal distances, but in some species it also increases seed production and germinability. Thus, long-distance colonization decreases, but short-distance colonization may increase. Wind velocity is the key determinant of dispersal distances. An increase in extreme winds increases long-distance dispersal and long-distance colonization capacity. However, increases in extreme winds predicted for climate change scenarios are not sufficient to compensate the reductions in long-distance colonization due to habitat fragmentation or eutrophication.",Anemochory | Climate change | Dispersal model | Eutrophication | Habitat fragmentation | Long-distance seed dispersal | Mechanistic model | Population size | Productivity | Wind dispersal,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although many trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMII) are caused by changes in prey behavior, less is known about the effects of changes in predator behavior such as prey switching or multiple predator effects (MPE) on indirect interactions, especially in marine systems. We performed a series of field caging experiments off the Isles of Shoals, Maine (USA) from 2000 to 2002 to test for the presence of behaviorally mediated indirect effects in a shallow subtidal food web. Specifically, crab (Cancer borealis) predation on sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) was quantified in three habitats (Codium fragile algal beds, barrens, and mussel beds) representing differing combinations of food and shelter to examine the effects of prey switching by crabs. A second predator (the lobster, Homarus americanus) was added to the crab treatments to examine MPE effects. Urchin mortality was significantly lower in the mussel habitat than in the Codium and barren habitats. Mussels produced a positive indirect effect on urchins by changing the behavior of crabs; crabs fed on mussels instead of urchins (prey switching). In the barrens, crab predation on urchins indirectly increased the abundance of the introduced ascidian, Diplosoma sp., whereas Codium density did not change among treatments. A significant risk reduction for urchins occurred in Codium and barren habitats, but not in mussel habitats when crabs and lobsters were combined. Lobsters also produced a positive indirect effect on mussels by reducing crab predation. Thus, lobsters modify crab behavior and dampen changes in community structure. Our results illustrate the importance of predator behavior and habitat context in modifying consumer pressure and community structure, and argue for the consideration of these factors in other multi-predator systems where habitats represent food and/or shelter.","Cancer borealis | Homarus americanus | Indirect effects | Isles of Shoals, maine | Multiple predators | Predation | Prey switching | Shallow rocky subtidal | Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis | Structural complexity | Trait-mediated indirect interaction | Trophic cascade",NA,NA,NA,NA

We present a conceptual model, based on resource distribution, that predicts whether organismal abundances near edges are expected to increase, decrease, or remain unchanged for any species at any edge type. Predictions are based on whether resources are found predominantly in one habitat (decreased abundance in preferred habitat, increase in non-preferred), divided between habitats (predicts an increase near both edges), spread equally among habitats (predicts a neutral edge response), or concentrated along the edge (increase). There are several implications of this model that can explain much of the variability reported in the edge literature. For instance, our model predicts that a species may show positive, negative, and neutral responses, depending on the edge type encountered, which explains some intraspecific variability observed in the literature. In addition, any predictable change in resource use (for example, by region or season) may explain temporal or spatial variability in responses even for the same species at the same edge type. We offer a preliminary test of our model by making predictions for 52 bird species from three published studies of abundance responses near forest edges. Predictions are based solely on general information about each species' habitat associations and resource use. Our model correctly predicted the direction of 25 out of 29 observed edge responses, although it tended to under-predict increases and over-predict decreases.

The community in secondary forests had an overrepresentation of the most common species in the landscape, though divergence in species' relative abundances within stands suggested an influence of community drift via local bottlenecks. Secondary-forest populations of T. grandiflorum were more genetically divergent than those in primary forests, again indicating drift in small populations. Land-use history and the size of populations and communities drove correlations between species diversity and genetic diversity (and community divergence x genetic divergence), though the strength of correlations was relatively weak. These results extend the generality of positive species-genetic diversity correlations previously observed for islands, and they demonstrate a long-term legacy of land-use history at multiple levels of biodiversity.","Biodiversity | Forest herbs | Forest stands | Genetic diversity | Land-use history | Species diversity | Tompkins County, New York (USA) | Trillium grandiflorum",NA,NA,NA,NA

This study accordingly examines ∼1500 yr in the stratigraphy of two permafrost sediment cores from a High Arctic, polygon-patterned, graminoid-moss tundra. Present-day bryophyte-environment relationships are quantified, and the radiocarbon-dated macrofossil record of bryophytes is used to reconstruct past changes in soil moisture.

As the hydrology of tundra polygons is controlled by known climatic and geomorphologic mechanisms, the recurrent development of polygon vegetation (cf. hydrologic change) is compared to an independent paleoclimatic proxy for net radiation (Rn). Based on this comparison, the vegetation provides support for a pronounced shift to colder and wetter conditions during the Little Ice Age (∼300-465 yr BP), though the long-term response to past climate change is otherwise equivocal. We suggest accordingly that autogenic geomorphologic-vegetation processes may have been generally more important than climate in the long-term development of the polygon-patterned wetland examined.

We tested this hypothesis in pond mesocosms (cattle tanks) by creating gradients of resource supply and predation risk, to which we added diverse assemblages of algal producer and zooplankton grazer species. We then characterized the end-point composition of grazer assemblages and quantity and elemental food quality of edible algae. We found that somatically P-rich Daphnia only dominated grazer assemblages in high-nutrient, no-predator treatments. In these ecosystems, P sequestered in producers exceeded a critical concentration. However, other grazers having even higher body P content did not respond similarly. These grazers were often abundant in low-nutrient environments with poorer food quality. At face value, this result is problematic for ecological stoichiometry because body composition did not correctly predict response of these other species. However, two potential explanations could maintain consistency with stoichiometric principles: species could differentially use a high-P resource (bacteria), or body composition might not always directly correlate with nutrient demands of grazers. Although our data cannot differentiate between these explanations, both suggest potential avenues for future empirical and theoretical study.","Daphnia | Grazers | Light | Nutrients | Phosphorus | Predation | Predation-risk gradients | Resource-supply gradients | Species composition, explaining shifts in | Stoichiometry | Zooplankton",all,All Open Access,NA,NA

The red pigment in copepods, astaxanthin, reduces damage caused by UV radiation, but makes the organism more conspicuous, thereby exposing it to higher predation pressure. In a field survey of six lakes sampled monthly for 16 mo, I quantified UV and predation threat, as well as copepod pigmentation level. The relative threat ratio (UV/predation) was generally lowest during summer and highest during spring; this pattern was paralleled by pigmentation level among copepods. Moreover, the level of pigmentation among copepods in lakes with high predation pressure was lower than among those copepods in lakes with lower risk of predation. In a complementary experimental study performed under constant UV threat, calanoid copepods in the absence of predation threat responded with almost three times higher pigment levels, compared to those with fish present (caged).

Here we demonstrate a novel aspect of grouping as a defense, using aggregated limpets (Patella vulgata) as a test system.

Anemonefish have an indirect positive effect on dascyllus populations due to the faster growth that anemones experience when they are occupied by Amphiprion. A long-term experiment revealed that anemonefish depressed dascyllus density (number of individuals per area of anemone per area of reef) more than abundance (number of individuals per reef area) because anemonefish caused a greater net increase in anemone surface area. We calculated that the effect of competition alone would depress dascyllus populations to near zero. The indirect positive interaction compensated for ∼67% of the direct negative effect. Failure to consider the indirect positive interaction in this system would lead to a gross underestimate of the strength of competition, and would not reveal the critical importance of the indirect mutualism in maintaining local populations of the inferior competitor.

Within only two years of grazer exclusion, microbial biomass was greater in soil of fenced grassland across all levels of soil fertility. This consistent negative effect of grazers on microbial biomass occurred despite the fact that grazers stimulated aboveground plant production in nutrient-rich sites and depressed it in nutrient-poor sites. A consideration of all the potential pathways by which grazers influence decomposer populations suggests that observed grazing-induced reductions in microbial biomass were predominantly associated with a depression in the amount of plant carbon inputs to soils. Finally, across all study sites, microbial biomass was highly correlated with soil carbon content, suggesting that landscape-scale constraints on soil organic matter content and plant production overarch grazer effects on microbial abundance. Our results support previous ecosystem-level studies showing that microbial biomass and growth are constrained by plant production and soil C availability. In addition, our findings demonstrate that decomposer abundance can be influenced by an ecosystem's trophic structure, with significant reductions in microbial biomass occurring as a result of herbivores diverting plant carbon away from soils.",Aboveground primary production | Grazing | Microbial activity | Microbial biomass | Savanna | Soil organic carbon,NA,NA,NA,NA

We developed and tested two new solutions to these demographic instabilities that expand the range of life histories for which (st)age-structured semiparametric inverse methods can be used. We begin by reviewing the range of inverse methods, from fully parametric models in which the governing functions are completely specified, to semiparametric models that replace these functions with non-parametric curves. We illustrate how the demographic instabilities emerge and indicate the requirements that any successful solution must satisfy. Existing solutions use constraints that may conflict with ecological processes and cause strong biases in the inferred rates. Our first solution uses a new statistical constraint that is less restrictive than previous methods. Our second solution is a hybrid approach that supplements the less restrictive statistical constraint with a few estimates of the interaction rates.

We investigated whether predatory fish influenced the heterogeneity (spatial variability) of resources (algae) by modifying the behavior of primary consumers (mayflies). We hypothesized that fish would indirectly increase resource heterogeneity by reducing grazer activity, and that higher densities of grazers would reduce resource heterogeneity only in the absence of fish. We measured the effects of predator cues (brook trout odor) on grazer behavior (Baetis) and algal heterogeneity in mesocosms (∼1 m 2) and in simple natural systems (30-m reaches of adjacent fishless streams). In addition, we measured grazer and algal distributions in complex natural streams that varied in grazer density, presence of fish, and physical conditions. Fish odor altered mayfly grazing behavior (measured using a simple behavioral bioassay) and increased algal heterogeneity (measured by Morisita's index at the scale of individual rocks) in mesocosms and manipulated streams. Furthermore, natural streams with higher grazer densities had lower algal heterogeneity, but only if they were fishless. Interestingly, the presence of brook trout decoupled the link between grazer density and algal heterogeneity in natural streams. These observations indicate that release from the threat of predation or increased densities of grazers can homogenize algal resources in fishless streams. We hypothesize that altered foraging in environments with predatory fish, independent of grazer density, led to increased resource patchiness, possibly by allowing the influence of variation in physical characteristics (e.g., flow and substratum) to predominate or by changing grazer microhabitat use.

Two species, P. taeda and L. tulipifera, had significant increases in growth rates within 5 m of an edge relative to the forest interior. However, edges explain a substantially smaller portion of the variance in growth rate than soil texture, soil nutrients, and topographically derived variables. Possible interactions between soil texture and effects of edges on tree growth rate for P. taeda were found, although the interaction was opposite from our hypothesis that increased water availability would increase the positive effect of edges on growth rates.

We hypothesized that bulldozer grazers (i.e., all or nothing grazing) can be important sources of spatial heterogeneity and that a unimodal relationship should exist between grazer density and resource heterogeneity. We reasoned that organismally generated heterogeneity would be minimal at low densities if grazers are ineffective, and at high densities if grazers thoroughly remove resources. In contrast, spatial heterogeneity should be highest at intermediate densities as bulldozer grazers maintain a dynamic mosaic of resource states. We posited that a corresponding unimodal relationship should exist between grazer density and benthic diversity, if resource heterogeneity is an important mechanism maintaining species diversity. We carried out observational and experimental studies to test our hypotheses. First, we quantified natural spatial patterns of benthic resources across transects using fish feeding scars as surrogates. We then analyzed data using a set of landscape indices that capture different components of heterogeneity. A large degree of spatial heterogeneity of algal and sediment resources was apparent both within and among pools. Second, we manipulated densities of the common grazing fish Parodon apolinari (Parodontidae) in 8-m2 pens, and quantified spatial heterogeneity and corresponding benthic diversity within enclosures. Parodon exerted strong density-dependent effects on the spatial heterogeneity of resources. Initially (at 7 d) we observed a unimodal relationship between grazer density and spatial heterogeneity along our density gradient (1.25-10.0 Parodon/m2), as predicted. However, at 14 d, our lowest fish density (1.25 Parodon/m2) was sufficient to generate substantial spatial heterogeneity. Although grazers were major sources of heterogeneity, we found little support for the hypothesis that organismally generated heterogeneity is an important mechanism for maintaining species diversity. Interestingly, the greatest invertebrate richness occurred in high density treatments, which had the most spatially uniform resource distributions. These results suggest that at the within-pool scale, grazers can have important effects on both spatial heterogeneity and benthic diversity, yet their generation of resource patchiness does not appear to be the underlying mechanism driving strong fish effects on species diversity.",Algae | Andes | Ecosystem engineer | Fish | Geostatistics | Grazer | Habitat modification | Landscape | Patch dynamics | Resource heterogeneity | Spatial ecology | Tropics,NA,NA,NA,NA

We conducted experiments in identical physical environments to show that differences in the sequence of community assembly can create alternate species compositions that persist for many generations. Assembly sequence determined whether experimental food webs contained a single intraguild predator, or two intraguild predators. When the intraguild predator, Blepharisma americanum, became established in communities before the introduction of Tetrahymena vorax, combined effects of resource depletion and intraguild predation prevented the establishment of Tetrahymena. In contrast, when Tetrahymena preceded Blepharisma, both species frequently coexisted. Supporting experiments describe the exploitative competitive abilities of both intraguild predators, document the population dynamics of each species in less complex community modules, and determine the ability of Tetrahymena to invade Blepharisma cultures in the absence of competing prey.

In this study, we assessed the effects of two components of seed dispersal by ants (seed burial depth and elaiosome removal) at several stages during the recruitment of Leucospermum truncatulum, an ant-dispersed plant from the fynbos shrublands of South Africa. A seed-predator exclusion experiment revealed that the removal of elaiosomes significantly reduced rodent predation on seeds buried 1 cm deep and increased the viability of seeds that were not consumed.

In a seed burial depth experiment in which predators were not excluded, deeper burial significantly enhanced seed survival, but this benefit came at the expense of reduced seedling emergence, delayed emergence, and smaller cotyledon size. Despite the potential importance of these seedling characteristics, elaiosomes and burial depth had no significant effect on seedling survival through the first year of this study. In contrast, burial depth had strong positive effects on the fraction of seeds that persisted in the seed bank. Although dormant individuals may die before germinating and reproducing, those that persist at greater soil depths can play a crucial role in rescuing populations from local extinction in unpredictable environments.

Here we develop a simple conceptual model that predicts the effects of ecosystem engineers on species richness based on how the habitat modifications caused by engineers affect primary productivity, assuming a hump-shaped relationship between productivity and species richness. We review data from 35 studies that contained 60 comparisons of species richness on patches that had been modified by ecosystem engineers vs. unmodified patches. We found no general patterns in whether species richness at the patch scale was increased or decreased by ecosystem engineering.

Matching the predictions of the conceptual model, we found a significant negative relationship between productivity and the engineering effect on species richness when ecosystem engineers increased productivity and a weak positive relationship when engineers decreased productivity. We compare the conceptual model developed here to models predicting the effects of grazing and facilitation on species richness.

Indeed, for marine fishes, density dependence in local populations appears to be widespread, particularly during a crucial time period following settlement of larvae into juvenile and adult habitats. I tested whether the demography of newly settled juveniles of the planktivorous fairy basslet (Gramma loreto) was affected by the density of adult conspecifics. Using spatially isolated local populations on coral reefs in the Bahamas, I experimentally transplanted a cohort of juveniles to local populations with three treatments of adult density: adults absent, average adult density, and high adult density (twice average). By following the fate of the transplanted juveniles, I determined that juvenile mortality increased as a function of adult density. Juveniles did not experience significantly higher rates of aggression or lower growth at higher densities of adults. However, in the presence of adults, juveniles generally fed at the back of aggregations, where feeding rates tend to be lower. Automated time-lapse video revealed that predators were found most frequently toward the back of aggregations. Thus competition with adults for prime feeding positions may increase predation risk for juveniles by forcing them to overlap spatially with predators. Consequently, interactions between juveniles and adults could influence the demography of subsequent generations in ways that promote local population regulation.",Coral-reef fish | Density dependence | Gramma loreto | Intraspecific competition | Population regulation | Stage-structured interactions,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), we found that the territories of white and tan males do not differ in size or vegetation structure, suggesting that these factors are not of primary importance to males when deciding where to establish a territory. Instead, we suggest that the placement of white and tan territories depends on the number of neighbors (particularly, white male neighbors). Tan males settle in low-density, neighbor-restrictive habitats where intruder pressure from white males seeking extra-pair copulations is reduced. In contrast, white males tend to settle in high-density areas where the probability of encountering neighboring fertile females is greatest. This segregation has led to intraspecific niche partitioning in the two disassortative pair types so that each male morph can best exploit its respective reproductive strategies. These factors may, in turn, contribute to the maintenance of this unusual mating system and, ultimately, the stability of the polymorphism in this species. Similar forces may be operating in other species without distinct morphological markers; we suggest that researchers keep social factors in mind when examining habitat selection.",Alternative strategies | Neighbor effects | Niche overlap | Polymorphism | Remote sensing | Reproductive success | Social niche | Spatial dynamics | Territoriality | White-throated Sparrow | Zonotrichia albicollis,NA,NA,NA,NA

In shallow (<1 m) mountain forest soils, windthrow activity may result in the redistribution and mixing of mineral and organic soil horizons down to bedrock. We studied the patterns of soil carbon, the dominant constituent of soil organic matter, in watersheds along a windthrow disturbance sequence in a mountainous temperate rain forest in southeast Alaska. Our objectives were (1) to evaluate the influence of windthrow and illuviation on the accumulation of soil organic carbon in mineral horizons and (2) to compare the forms of soil organic matter that have accumulated. Soils were described, and the thickness of the major organic and mineral horizons was measured, every 5 m along transects in three watersheds with contrasting windthrow histories. A subset of the soil description sites was randomly selected and then sampled to determine the quantity and quality of soil carbon. Mineral soil samples were physically fractionated based on particle density. Total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), natural 15N and 13C abundance, micromorphologic analysis (using scanning electron microscopy), and solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were used to compare soil organic matter pools in the three watersheds. The Bh horizon heavy-fraction (>1.65 g/cm3) C pools decreased from 25 Mg/ha in the least disturbed watershed to 3 Mg/ ha in the most disturbed watershed; whereas light-fraction C pools were similar (4-6 Mg/ ha) across all watersheds. Soil C stocks decreased from 216 Mg/ha in the least disturbed watershed to 157 Mg/ha in the most disturbed watersheds. Evidence was found that mobile organic carbon transported in soil water accumulated in mineral horizons principally through sorption to mineral particles. Strong association with mineral particles was greater in the thicker, presumably older, illuvial horizons. We found light amorphous material in some of these thicker illuvial horizons, suggesting that mobile organic carbon may have been immobilized through flocculation of metal-bearing organic acids.

Theoretically, complex food webs allow for alternative pathways and overlapping functions within and among trophic levels, such that cascading effects are buffered and perturbation is resisted. On the other hand, strong interdependence among species and trophic levels in these same systems can make them vulnerable to perturbation. To assess the ability of a tropical rain forest community to resist perturbation or to amplify perturbation through trophic cascades, we measured changes in overall vegetative cover and species richness of understory plants in response to the experimental addition of a top predator beetle. In August 2000, 30 randomly located patches of naturally occurring Piper cenocladum shrubs were found at sites with variable soil quality and light availability, and top predator addition treatments were randomly assigned to half the patches. Using an 8-m2 subplot within each P. cenocladum patch, we estimated (nondestructively) vegetative cover of understory plants for nine months and measured herbivore damage, plant longevity and plant species richness for ∼1.5 years. For all understory species in our subplots, vegetative cover and total numbers of leaves declined significantly more in predator addition patches than in control patches. Understory cover also declined significantly more on poor soils than on rich soils. Mortality of small plants was high overall, but longevity was significantly greater in control patches than in patches with top predators. Herbivore damage was lowest, plant establishment highest, and the accumulation of new plant species highest in control plots on rich soils. The cumulative effect of top predators interacted with plant resources, such that plant species richness was suppressed when beetles were present in understory communities on rich soils. Patterns of herbivore damage suggest that trophic cascades from apex predators through ant predators to herbivores altered the structure of understory vegetation.

We studied a mesic grassland where recently established ""shrub islands"" are increasing in abundance due to fire suppression. Our objective was to assess the role of the direct effects of fire vs. indirect alterations in resource availability (N and light), as mechanisms that may constrain/facilitate shrub (Cornus drummondii) encroachment. The direct effects of fire in 2001 and 2002 were 100% aboveground mortality of C. drummondii shoots and removal of the detrital layer. Post-fire resprouting resulted in ∼600% increase in stem density compared to a 200% increase in shrub islands protected from fire. In burned shrub islands with an added detrital layer, temperature and light penetration to the soil surface were reduced (by 6.5°C and to <3% of full sunlight), but stem density still increased by ∼400%. Thus, both the direct effects of fire and the indirect effect on the energy environment increased C. drummondii stem densities. In contrast, N additions did not influence new stem production or aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP; grams per square meter per year), suggesting that N availability did not constrain shrub growth during this study. While fire did not impact total ANPP, it did shift the relative abundance of growth forms. Grass productivity (360.7 ± 20.1 g/m2 [mean ±1 SE]) was stimulated (an increase of ∼30%) by the high light conditions of the post-fire environment, while C. drummondii ANPP (34.2 ± 2.4 g/m2) was reduced by ∼30%. In shrub islands protected from fire, C. drummondii ANPP was greatest (50.4 ± 2.2 g/m2), whereas lower graminoid ANPP (282.5 ± 19.9 g/m2) was observed. The persistence of woody vegetation, despite two successive fires, along with a significant reduction in grass ANPP (∼30%) suggests that once established, C. drummondii can persist and exclude C 4 grasses. Thus, restoring fire to mesic grasslands may prevent further conversion to shrub/woodland, but the abun-dance of shrubs is likely to remain unchanged with community structure co-dominated by multiple growth forms.","Cornus drummondii | Ecosystem transition | Fire | Konza Prairie, Kansas (USA) | Mesic grassland | Nitrogen | Resource availability | Woody plant encroachment",NA,NA,NA,NA

To better understand population dynamics or to derive effective conservation plans, it is thus crucial to know the frequency of specific mortality causes as well as their variation over time. However, although the mortality cause of retrieved marked animals is often known, this information cannot be used directly to estimate the frequency of a mortality cause. By calculating the ratio of the number of animals reported dead from a specific cause to the total number of retrieved animals, one does not consider the fact that the probability of finding a dead individual depends on the cause of its death. Although frequently used, such ad hoc estimates can be heavily biased. Here we present a new way of estimating the frequency of a mortality cause from ring-recovery (band-recovery) data without bias. We consider the states ""alive,"" ""dead because of mortality cause A,"" and ""dead due to all other causes"" and estimate within a multistate capture-recapture framework the transition probabilities as well as the state-specific resighting probabilities. Among the transition probabilities are the overall survival probability and the proportion of animals dying because of A. From these, the probability that an animal dies during a year due to the specific cause of interest (cause A kill rate) can easily be calculated. We illustrate this model using data from White Storks Ciconia ciconia ringed in Switzerland to estimate the proportion of storks that died due to power line collision. Average unbiased estimates of this proportion were 0.37 ± 0.08 (mean ± 1 SE) for juveniles, about 25% lower than ad hoc estimates, and 0.35 ± 0.09 for adults. The annual survival rate of juveniles was 0.33 ± 0.05 and of adults, 0.83 ± 0.02. Power line mortality is thus important for White Storks, with about one in four juveniles and one in 17 adults dying each year because of power line collision. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of the new model and how the results could be used to explore the link between a specific mortality cause and population dynamics.",Band recoveries | Ciconia ciconia | Kill rate | Mortality cause proportion | Multistate capture-recapture model | Population dynamics | Reporting rate | Ring recoveries | Survival rate | White Storks,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

The second approach, however, takes advantage of the measured distances among all of the sampled individuals in the population and can test for departures toward uniformity.

Predators and their prey were positively associated with one another at scales of 0.5-1 m during the day, but not at all during the night, reflecting the visual foraging nature of the predators and their high mobility relative to their prey. Furthermore, predators and prey were negatively associated during the night and at scales >2 m during the day, which may reflect predator avoidance.

The systems considered are: one predator exploiting two independent prey, and one predator exploiting two prey that use a common limiting resource. In each system, the indirect effect of a change in a consumption-related parameter of one prey species on the population density of the other prey is determined. When prey only share a predator, the change in one prey's density produced by a change in the other prey's vulnerability to the predator is determined by whether or not that second prey is initially overexploited; i.e., whether its exploiter's intake decreases with an increase in the attack rate. Increases in the vulnerability of an overexploited prey decrease the predator population and thereby indirectly increase the population size of the second prey. Increases in the vulnerability of a prey that is not overexploited have the opposite effects on both the predator and second prey populations. Both of these outcomes can be reversed by strong direct density dependence in the predator, provided the predator exhibits satiation. In the food web with a shared food and a shared resource, increases in predator vulnerability of the more vulnerable prey species always increase the population size of the more resistant prey species. However, increases in the vulnerability of the more resistant prey can either increase or decrease the population size of the more vulnerable prey species. When the more resistant prey becomes better at capturing the resource, the less resistant may either increase or decrease. Overexploitation also explains these outcomes.

Although variation in fire frequency has been the focus of most studies attempting to understand variation in serotiny among populations and species of plants, other factors can select against serotiny. One agent in particular that can select against serotiny is an efficient pre-dispersal seed predator that eats a large fraction of the seeds held in the canopy. To test whether selection by such a predator selects against serotiny, we compared levels of serotiny in fire-adapted Rocky Mountain lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta ssp. latifolia) in five ranges lacking its dominant pre-dispersal seed predator, the pine squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) to 344 stands with pine squirrels. Where pine squirrels were absent, the frequency of serotiny was consistently near 100%, whereas where squirrels were present, the frequency was variable, rarely approached the high levels found in areas without squirrels, and averaged much less than 50%. This indicates that squirrels select against serotiny and that, in the absence of squirrels, the frequency of serotiny would probably be uniformly higher throughout much of the Rocky Mountains. Because serotiny levels also influence the density of seedlings following a fire, squirrels, by selecting strongly against serotiny, have the potential to alter the early stages and perhaps the course of succession and various community attributes.",Fire-prone habitats | Keystone species | Life history evolution | Lodgepole pine | Pine squirrel | Pinus contorta | Rocky mountains | Seed predation | Selective agent | Serotiny | Stand-replacing fires | Tamiasciurus hudsonicus,NA,NA,NA,NA

In order to develop this multiple trait approach, it is critical to understand how these multiple traits vary in relation to one another among species. The ecosystem effects of traits that strongly covary can likely be summarized by one of these traits. In contrast, it will be necessary to determine the ecosystem effects of specific trait combinations for those traits that vary independently across species. In the field, I established monocultures of eight herbaceous species common in California annual grasslands. Plant species significantly differed in their litter quantity and quality, live biomass, and effects on soil labile C, soil temperature, and soil moisture. Species effects on soil moisture and temperature were only significant at the times of the growing season when each of these limited plant and microbial activity.

However, for the most part, plant species exhibited unique combinations of these traits. For example, species with similar litter chemistry had the largest differences in plant biomass, soil moisture, and soil labile C.

Sampling error in the data, however, may bias estimators of process variation derived by simple methods. We develop a restricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based method for estimating trend, process variation, and sampling error from a single time series based on a discrete-time model of density-independent growth coupled with a model of the sampling process. Transformation of the data yields a conventional linear mixed model, in which the variance components are functions of the process variation and sampling error. Simulation results show essentially unbiased estimators of trend, process variation, and sampling error over a range of process variation/sampling error combinations. Example data analyses are provided for the Whooping Crane (Grus americana), grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), California Condor (Gymnogyps californianus), and Puerto Rican Parrot (Amazona vittata).

Invading populations, however, often experience rapid evolutionary changes associated with or soon after their introduction. Ecological and evolutionary processes can, therefore, potentially interact over relatively short timescales. A number of recent studies have begun to document these interactions and their effect on short-term invasion dynamics: (1) The degree to which founder effects, drift, and inbreeding alter the genetic composition of introduced populations is mediated by migration and dispersal patterns, the population dynamics of founding populations, and life history. The genetic changes associated with founding can themselves feed back on population dynamics and life history. (2) Patterns of human-mediated dispersal and landscape change can influence the frequency and pattern of hybridization, which in turn can alter invasion dynamics. These altered invasion dynamics can influence the frequency and pattern of subsequent hybridization and introgression. (3) Strong selection can rapidly generate ecotypic specialization. Dispersal patterns, founder effects, genetic system, and life history influence the rate of local adaptation, its persistence, and its distribution in a landscape. (4) Introduced populations are subject to selection on life history traits and can serve as selective pressure on the life history traits of native populations. Life history evolution in both natives and aliens can influence ecological interactions and population dynamics, which in turn can influence the evolution of life history. Too few studies have investigated these interactions to definitively assess their overall generality or to determine how the relative interaction strength of ecology and evolution varies across taxa or ecosystems. However, the studies that do exist report interactions from a wide breadth of taxa and from all stages in the invasion process. This suggests that ecological-evolutionary interactions may have a more pervasive influence on contemporary invasion dynamics than previously appreciated, and that at least in some situations an explicit understanding of the contemporary co-influence of ecology and evolution can produce more effective and predictive control strategies.",Alien species | Dynamics | Evolution | Global change | Interactions,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We used two models to explore the potential contributions of nutrient uptake kinetics, root density, soil properties, and nutrient type to interspecific plant competition for soil nutrients. The first model uses well-known nutrient diffusion and absorption relationships to generate soil nutrient concentration maps and nutrient uptake at the scale of individual roots (PARIS-M). A second model (PARIS-E) was developed based on a fit of the Hill equation to the output of PARIS-M. The PARIS-E model provides an accurate and simple means of determining the relative contributions of sink strength (root surface area X uptake kinetics) vs. space occupation (number of roots per unit area) to competition at equilibrium as modeled by PARIS-M. An analysis based on these two models suggests the following: (1) Diffusive supply (soil nutrient buffer capacity X effective diffusion coefficient) determines the relative importance of space occupation vs. sink strength for nutrient competition. (2) At the low range of reported values of diffusive supply, competition depends on space occupation and, therefore, the species with the most roots per unit area is the most competitive. Sink strength gains in importance as diffusive supply increases and dominates competitive interactions at the high end of the range of reported diffusive supplies. (3) The relative importance of space occupation vs. sink strength depends primarily on soil water content and soil texture, because diffusive supply is sensitive to these factors. Diffusive supply is relatively insensitive to nutrient type. This analysis suggests that nutrient competition models should include the effects of soil properties as a determinant of the relative contributions of sink strength vs. space occupation.",Nutrient diffusion | Plant uptake kinetics | Resource competition | Root morphology,NA,NA,NA,NA

One possibility is to move directionally among patches, staying longer in the best patches (the ""Local-Experience Hypothesis""). Additionally, when foragers reuse patches in a regenerating environment, they can potentially benefit from remembering the most profitable patches, and return preferentially to these (the ""Memory Hypothesis""). Both hypotheses were tested with foraging bumble bees (Bombus spp.) collecting nectar in the foothills and mountains of southwest Alberta, Canada. Individually marked worker bumble bees were observed visiting flowers on focal plants of five species visited primarily by bumble bees. In three plant species (Epilobium angustifolium, Hedysarum alpinum, and Penstemon confertus), variation in nectar secretion rate was experimentally induced by defoliation and fertilization of individual plants. In the other two species (H. sulphurescens and Oxytropis monticola), bees' responses to natural variation in plant-level nectar secretion were measured. Considering the bee population as a whole, plants with higher nectar production rates attracted more bees (three of five plant species) and had more of their flowers visited (three of five plant species). The Local-Experience Hypothesis was supported in three of the five plant species: individual bees stayed longer by visiting more flowers on plants with higher rates of nectar production. The Memory Hypothesis was supported in four of the five plant species; individual bees were more likely to return to plants with higher rates of nectar secretion. Overall, there was a positive correlation between the extent to which individual plants differed in their rate of nectar secretion (a species-level trait), and the strength of support for the Memory Hypothesis (measured as a standardized effect size). That is, individual bumble bees more strongly adjusted their visitation rate based on plant quality as the magnitude of natural differences in plant quality increased. Support for the Memory Hypothesis may explain why bumble bees often revisit the same plants on successive foraging trips: memory for good plants gives them a fitness advantage over naïve bees using the same area.

We found a weak hump-shaped relationship (Jornada) and no relationship (Konza) between richness and productivity at the smallest focal scale (1 m2 at Jornada and 50 m2 at Konza) at each site, but strong hump-shaped relationships at the largest focal scale (49 m2 at Jornada and 200 m2 at Konza) for each site. Relationships between spatial turnover and productivity at each site mirrored the productivity-richness relationships that emerged at the larger spatial scale (i.e., a significant hump-shaped pattern). In contrast, temporal turnover was unrelated to productivity, and hence increasing temporal scale did not appreciably change the form of the productivity-richness relationship. Our study suggests that the way in which productivity-richness relationships change with spatial or temporal scale depends on the form and strength of the underlying relationship between species turnover and productivity. Moreover, we contend that a dominant effect of increasing productivity is the generation of dissimilarity in species composition among localities that comprise a region, rather than increasing the number of species that occur within local communities.

We experimentally varied, for the first time, both species richness (1-8 perennial species/m2) and species evenness (near maximal vs. realistically low) in grassland plots. Net primary productivity (NPP) and ecosystem CO2 uptake declined when richness was reduced, and reductions were similar between evenness treatments. Richness effects were associated more with a selection effect than with complementarity (found only with high evenness). Importantly, extinctions in plots during the second year were not random, but were greater at low than at high evenness (i.e., with increased rarity) and in species with low aboveground growth rates. Thus, species evenness can affect grassland ecosystem processes indirectly by affecting species richness, and it will be imperative to understand how nonrandom extinctions affect NPP in future studies.

In this study, we report on the effects of spider predators on the mortality, dispersal, and spatial population dynamics of Prokelisia crocea planthoppers (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) in a prairie landscape. Based on a three-generation survey of host-plant patches (Spartina pectinata; Poaceae), the density of cursorial and web-building spiders declined significantly with increasing patch size (a pattern the opposite of that for the planthopper). Independent of patch size effects, an increase in the density of web-building and cursorial spiders had a negative effect on planthopper density in one of three generations each. Finally, the likelihood of extinction of local (patch) populations of planthoppers increased significantly with an increase in the density of web-building spiders. Planthoppers in small host-plant patches with high densities of web-building spiders were especially at risk of extinction. To evaluate whether spider effects on planthopper spatial dynamics were mediated by predation and/or spider-induced dispersal, we performed a field experiment in which host-plant patches were either caged or left open and received one of three spider density treatments (removal, ambient levels, or high = triple ambient levels). For the caged patches, there was a nonsignificant decline in planthopper recaptures with increasing spider density, suggesting that mortality effects of spiders on planthoppers were weak. In contrast, planthopper recaptures in open patches declined by 85% between the removal and high spider treatments. This significant decline was mostly attributed to spider-induced emigration. We conclude that, at high spider densities, spiders are likely to have a greater impact on planthopper densities through induced emigration than consumption. Because small cordgrass patches support high spider densities and favor high planthopper emigration rates, the nonlethal effects of spiders may play a very important role in determining critical patch size, source-sink properties of cordgrass patches, and the spatial distribution and spread of planthoppers.",Dispersal | Emigration | Extinction | Metapopulation | Patch dynamics | Planthoppers | Prokelisia | Source-sink | Spartina pectinata | Spatial distribution | Tall-grass prairie | Trait-mediated effects,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the subtropical Rio Grande Plains of southern Texas and northern Mexico, this change in physiognomy typically results in soil C and N accumulation. The extent to which this accumulation is the result of increased C and N inputs vs. decreased losses is not known. To address this issue, we compared soil C and N pools, soil respiration, soil microbial biomass, and potential C and N mineralization and nitrification rates in remnant grassland communities and adjacent woody plant communities known to have developed on grassland within the past 100 years. Mean soil organic C (SOC) and total N pools in the upper 20 cm of the profile were 2X larger in wooded communities (3382 and 273 g/m2 for C and N, respectively) than in remnant grasslands (1737 and 150 g/m2). The larger pool sizes in the wooded communities supported higher annual soil respiration (SR; 745 vs. 611 g C·m -2·yr-1 for woodlands and grasslands, respectively) and greater soil microbial biomass C (444 vs. 311 mg C/kg soil), potential rates of N mineralization (0.9 vs. 0.6 mg N·kg-1·d -1) and nitrification (0.9 vs. 0.4 mg N·kg -1·d-1). However, despite higher SR rates, mean residence time of near-surface SOC in wooded communities (11 years) exceeded that of remnant grassland communities (6 years). The fact that increased fluxes of soil C and N were accompanied by increases in SOC and N pools and total SOC mean residence time suggests that shifts from grass to woody plant dominance have increased both labile and recalcitrant pools of SOC and total N, the latter to a greater extent than the former. Given the widespread increase in woody plant abundance in drylands in recent history, the observed net increase in soil C storage that potentially accompanies this change could have global implications for C and N cycling and the climate system.","Microbial biomass | Nitrification | Potential mineralization | Prosopis glandulosa | Savanna | Soil organic carbon and nitrogen | Soil respiration | Texas, USA | Thorn woodland | Woody plant encroachment",all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We examined the relationship between macroalgal diversity and nutrient availability by evaluating the effects of reduced nutrients and their subsequent replacement via local-scale nutrient loading in tide pools. Macroalgae in Oregon coast high-intertidal pools have evolved in a nitrate-rich upwelling ecosystem, but instead of settling on low-intertidal reefs (where algae are often immersed in nutrient-rich nearshore waters) these individuals have colonized high-zone pools, where they are isolated from the ocean for extended periods of time and are subjected to extended periods of nitrate depletion. In some pools, this nutrient stress was ameliorated by a positive interaction: the excretion of ammonium by invertebrates. We conducted experimental manipulations to quantify invertebrate-mediated ammonium loading and macroalgal ammonium uptake in high-intertidal pools. Variation in tide pool volume and invertebrate biomass created a gradient of local-scale nutrient inputs, allowing us to address the relationship between nitrogen loading and algal diversity. Slow-growing species tolerant of low nitrogen availability were joined by fast-growing species with higher nitrogen requirements in pools with higher ammonium loading rates. A fourfold increase in the ammonium loading rate was associated with a doubling in the number of macroalgal species, and macroalgal assemblages in more species-rich pools were characterized by higher rates of biomass-specific ammonium uptake. These patterns contrast with productivity-diversity relationships in terrestrial systems, where local-scale nutrient enrichments generally result in reduced producer diversity due to displacement of subordinate species by aggressive competitors. Our data suggest that the effect of enrichment on diversity is context-dependent. Each ecosystem has a critical level of nutrient availability, determined by the level of nutrients typically available in that system. Below this critical level, local-scale nutrient additions increase diversity, but above it, diversity declines with enrichment.",Diversity | Facilitation | Macroalgae | Nitrogen uptake | Nutrients | Positive interactions | Productivity | Rocky intertidal | Species richness | Tide pools,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

In the low rocky intertidal zone of the Pacific Northwest, the chiton Katharina tunicata is closely associated with the canopy-forming alga Hedophyllum sessile. In a 27-month field experiment, I used experimental devices to mimic characteristics of the Hedophyllum canopy and monitored the abundance and physiology of Katharina to determine the mechanism behind this association. The data show that this association is due to selection of shaded microhabitats by Katharina, and that neither predation nor Hedophyllum per se influenced the distribution of the chiton. Exclusion of visual predators had no effect on chiton abundance, and tests of the effects of shade independent of Hedophyllum presence indicated that the shade produced by the alga was critical to the chiton. Seasonal fluctuations in levels of 70 kDa (1.16 × 10-19 g) heat shock proteins (Hsp70) indicate that Katharina experience sublethal physiological stress during the spring and summer. The corresponding use of shaded areas during spring and summer low tides suggests that the chiton's distribution is limited during these seasons by the availability of refugia from sublethal abiotic stresses. Subtle variations in environmental conditions are also important to this association; the strength of the positive interaction varied annually, becoming more positive in warm summers (1998 and 2000) and neutral in a cooler summer (1999). On a finer scale, physiological measurements indicate that the response of chitons to summertime temperatures depends on both absolute temperature change and the animal's recent thermal history. In particular, the seasonal onset of daytime low tides in the spring is associated with increased Hsp70 levels, indicating that this is a significant physiological event for Katharina. The importance of facultative positive interactions that allow consumers to escape from sublethal abiotic stresses will likely be variable in time but can have large impacts on communities both by affecting the small-scale distribution of consumers over the short term and potentially by affecting the persistence of organisms over the long term.",Habitat modification | Hedophyllum sessile | Hsp70 | Katharina tunicata | Pacific Northwest (USA) | Positive interactions | Rocky intertidal,NA,NA,NA,NA

We compared trunk growth, water potentials, and ectomycorrhizal dynamics for surviving trees at three high-mortality sites and adjacent low-mortality sites. Four major patterns emerged. First, surviving trees at sites that suffered high mortality exhibited reduced long-term growth and increased water stress relative to adjacent sites where little or no mortality occurred. Second, surviving trees from high-mortality sites had 50% lower ectomycorrhizal colonization and showed a pronounced shift in fungal community composition relative to low-mortality sites. Third, in support of an intermediate-host plant stress hypothesis, trees that experienced intermediate levels of stress supported two-fold greater ectomycorrhizal colonization than trees at the high or low end of a stress gradient. Fourth, we observed a strong correlation between trunk growth and ectomycorrhizal colonization and validated the resulting regression model with independent data. This relationship suggests that tree rings can be used to reconstruct past and predict future ectomycorrhizal colonization. Overall, our findings suggest that predicted climate changes might be accompanied by both qualitative and quantitative changes in ectomycorrhizal dynamics that could affect ecosystems by altering nutrient cycling, carbon dynamics, and host-plant performance.","Arizona, USA (northern) | Climate-change effects | Community structure | Drought effects | Ectomycorrhizal fungi | Intermediate-host plant stress hypothesis | Pinus edulis | Tree rings predict ectomycorrizal colonization",NA,NA,NA,NA

In many areas, the matrix, or habitat between patches, has become dominated by the invasive exotic grass, smooth brome (Bromus inermis). We performed a landscape-level field study in which replicate cordgrass networks (identical in number, size, quality, and distribution of cordgrass patches) were embedded in a matrix composed of either mudflat (a native matrix habitat) or smooth brome. Mark-recapture experiments with the planthopper and parasitoid revealed that the rate of movement among cordgrass patches for both species was 3-11 times higher in smooth brome than in mudflat. Within three generations, planthopper and parasitoid densities per patch were on average ∼50% lower and spatially 50-87% more variable for patches embedded in a brome as compared to a mudflat matrix. A brome-dominated landscape also promoted extinction rates per patch that were 4-5 times higher than the rates per patch in native mudflat habitat. The effect was more acute for the parasitoid. We suggest that the differences in population dynamics between networks of patches in brome and those in mudflat were driven by underlying differences in interpatch dispersal (i.e., patch connectivity).

The effectiveness of stepping stones and corridors was significantly lower in a high-resistance matrix (one that promotes low rates of interpatch dispersal), with stepping stones failing to improve connectivity for the planthoppers relative to controls.

We hypothesized that the natural, mixed diet of caterpillars provides high-quality food via hosts like Viguiera as well as antiparasitoid defense via sequestered toxins from Senecio. We found that a pure Viguiera diet provides superior growth performance over a pure Senecio or mixed diet in the absence of parasitism. However, when parasitism risk is at least moderate, the mixed diet provides a survival advantage over the pure diets of Viguiera or Senecio.

Application of this method to studies in diverse systems indicates that predators can strongly reduce consumer - resource interaction coefficients, often in the range of 20-80%. We use analytic and simulation models to show that effects on interaction coefficients of this magnitude can lead to trait-mediated effects that contribute more strongly than density-mediated effects to the net effects of predators on consumers and their resources, and even qualitatively change model predictions.

Meta-analysis of the null model analyses indicated a general trend to morphological overdispersion, particularly so at restricted scales. Larger scale assemblages were overdispersed relative to only one of the two null models, which we tentatively interpret as being indicative of different competition-driven mechanisms operating at different spatial scales. We also demonstrate that the observed assemblages represent a larger number of species groups than expected by chance, and that this pattern of phylogenetic overdispersion is closely related to the observed morphological patterns.","Assembly rules | Competition | Ecomorphology | Formicidae | Morphological dispersion | Rhytidoponera | Sturt National Park, New South Wales, Australia",NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we assess changes in the shape of the RAD through time in a desert rodent community in Arizona (USA).

Current theory explains trophic structure in terms of the relative abundance and succession of edible and inedible species across gradients of primary productivity. We argue that this explanation is incomplete owing to its focus on inedibility and the assumption that plants and herbivores have fixed defense levels. Consumer-induced defenses are an important source of variation in the vulnerability of prey and are prevalent in natural communities. Such induced defenses decrease per capita consumption rates of consumers but hardly ever result in complete inedibility. When defenses are inducible a prey population may consist of both undefended and defended individuals. Here we use food chain models with realistic parameter values to show that variation in consumption rates on different prey types causes a gradual instead of stepwise increase in the biomass of all trophic levels in response to enrichment. Such all-level responses have been observed in both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and in microbial food chains in the laboratory. We stress that, in addition to the known food web effects of interspecific variation in edibility, intraspecific variation in edibility is another form of within-trophic-level heterogeneity that also has such effects.

Likewise, exotic species invasions could alter subsidies and affect distant food webs, but very few studies have tested this experimentally. Here we report evidence from a large-scale field experiment in northern Japan that invasion of nonnative rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) interrupted reciprocal flows of invertebrate prey that drove stream and adjacent riparian forest food webs. Rainbow trout usurped terrestrial prey that fell into the stream, causing native Dolly Varden charr (Salvelinus malma) to shift their foraging to insects that graze algae from the stream bottom. This indirectly increased algal biomass, but also decreased biomass of adult aquatic insects emerging from the stream to the forest. In turn, this led to a 65% reduction in the density of riparian-specialist spiders in the forest. Thus, species invasions can interrupt flows of resources between interconnected ecosystems and have effects that propagate across their boundaries, effects that may be difficult to anticipate without in-depth understanding of food web relationships.","Food webs | Hokkaido, Japan | Invasion ecology | Large-scale field experiment | Oncorhynchus mykiss | Resource subsidies | Riparian ecology | Salvelinus malma | Stream ecology",NA,NA,NA,NA

Time-depth recorders attached to free-living green turtles (Chelonia mydas) at Ascension Island confirmed a marked increase in dive duration with depth, with the gradient of this relationship being >10 times that seen in diving birds and mammals. Consistent with the prediction that the lungs serve a dual role, we found that, when lead weights were added to some turtles to increase their specific gravity, the mean depth of dives decreased, but for dives to the same depth, weighted animals dived for longer.

We simulated wind dispersal of grassland plant seeds with four mechanistic models of increasing complexity and realism to assess which processes and which attributes of plants and their environment determine dispersal distances. We compared simulation results of the models to each other and to data from field dispersal experiments. The more complex and realistic models predicted short-distance dispersal more accurately and were the only models able to simulate long-distance dispersal. The model comparisons showed that autocorrelated turbulent fluctuations in vertical wind velocity are the key mechanism for long-distance dispersal. Seed dispersal distances are longest under high wind velocity conditions, when mechanically produced turbulent air movements are large. Under very low wind velocity conditions seeds are dispersed farther when there is more surface heating, but never as far as during strong wind events. Model sensitivity analyses showed that mean horizontal wind velocity, seed release height, and vegetation height are crucial determinants of dispersal potential and dispersal distances. Between plant species (but not within a species), seed terminal velocity is an additional important determinant of long-distance dispersal. These results imply that seed release height is the most important plant-controlled dispersal parameter for grassland plants, and that the structure of the local vegetation greatly affects dispersal distances. Thus, management plans for grasslands should take into account that changes in vegetation structure, e.g., due to eutrophication, can reduce the seed dispersal ability of wind-dispersed plant species.",Atmospheric stability | Dispersal experiments | Grassland | Long-distance seed dispersal | Mechanistic dispersal models | Seed release height | Terminal velocity | Turbulence | Uplifting | Wind dispersal,NA,NA,NA,NA

The model describes how annual variation in the hydrograph affects cottonwood mortality (via floods and droughts) and recruitment (via scouring of new habitat and seedling establishment). Using parameter values for the undammed Yampa River in Colorado, we found that abundances of seedlings and younger trees followed a boom-bust cycle driven by high flood mortalities while reproductive adult abundance followed a less erratic 5-15-yr periodicity driven by multiyear sequences of flows favorable to stand recruitment. Conversely, chance occurrences of multiple drought years eliminated cottonwood from up to 50% of available habitat, providing opportunities for competing plant species to establish. By simulating flow alterations on the Yampa ranging from channelization (many floods/droughts) to damming (few floods/droughts), the model suggested that mature cottonwood forest should be most abundant near the observed natural flow regime.

Imperfect capture probability can be easily accommodated in capture-recapture models, but temporary transitions between observable and unobservable states, often referred to as temporary emigration, is known to cause problems in both open- and closed-population models. We develop a multistate mark-recapture (MSMR) model, using an open-robust design that permits one entry and one exit from the study area per season. Our method extends previous temporary emigration models (MSMR with an unobservable state) in two ways. First, we relax the assumption of demographic closure (no mortality) between consecutive (secondary) samples, allowing estimation of within-pond survival. Also, we add the flexibility to express survival probability of unobservable individuals (e.g., ""non-breeders"") as a function of the survival probability of observable animals while in the same, terrestrial habitat. This allows for potentially different annual survival probabilities for observable and unobservable animals. We apply our model to a relictual population of eastern tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum tigrinum). Despite small sample sizes, demographic parameters were estimated with reasonable precision. We tested several a priori biological hypotheses and found evidence for seasonal differences in pond survival.

Despite their extreme specialization on milkweed, Tetraopes require drying grass stems as oviposition sites, even though they do not consume grass. The natural history of the interaction suggests that herbivory may be likely only when milkweeds are in close proximity to grasses. Theory also predicts that two stresses on plants, competition and herbivory, may have non-additive negative impacts on correlates of fitness. In field experiments conducted over two years, I followed the consequences of grass competition and beetle attack for herbivory, growth, and reproduction of milkweed, and reciprocal effects of milkweed on grass in common gardens. To assess the effect of milkweed traits on beetles, I conducted a quantitative genetic experiment using full-sibling families of milkweed and measured the effects of putative resistance traits on the abundance of Tetraopes adults. Milkweeds growing next to grass were initially unaffected in growth but suffered 10% greater leaf herbivory by adult Tetraopes than did milkweeds growing alone. This effect was caused by direct attraction of beetles to grass, not by a competitive modification of milkweed's phenotype. In late summer of the first growing season, when Tetraopes naturally oviposits, I experimentally added larvae to milkweed roots with and without grass competition. Within a month, I detected an interaction between competition and herbivory: neither had an individual impact, but jointly they reduced milkweed growth. In spring of the second growing season, when Tetraopes had completed development, I again found strong evidence for a non-additive effect of competition and herbivory together, severely reducing plant growth compared to their individual effects. Root herbivory induced a plant response that reduced the abundance of leaf-mining flies by 40%, but only for milkweeds with grass competition. Neither competition nor herbivory affected the production of defensive latex, cardenolides, or carbon, but they interacted to affect leaf nitrogen content. Thus, although trait-mediated indirect interactions were implicated in the effect of competition and root herbivory on leaf miner abundance, I did not uncover the mechanism. In the final harvest, beetle herbivory reduced reproductive characters (fruit production, fruit mass, aboveground biomass) by 20-30%, whereas competition had negligible effects. The net interaction effect for grass was competitive, with a 23% reduction in grass biomass caused by milkweed in the absence of herbivory. However, the presence of beetle herbivory on milkweed roots completely alleviated the competitive effect of milkweed on grass. Thus, the associational effect of grass on milkweed resulted in milkweed suffering the non-additive effects of competition and herbivory, whereas grass enjoyed competitive release by facilitating its neighbor's herbivore. Many traits of milkweed (e.g., growth, reproduction, and several resistance traits) showed variation among 23 full-sibling families, indicating that competitive ability and resistance may be subject to natural selection. A multiple regression analysis on family means revealed that leaf trichome density and nitrogen content were negatively genetically correlated with abundance of Tetraopes adults, but probability of flowering and plant height were positively associated. Leaf miners were most strongly negatively affected by latex and trichomes. Thus, complex interactions among competition, root herbivory, and plant genetic variation affect the herbivore and plant community and may result in diffuse coevolution between milkweed and its herbivores.

To test the hypothesis that the spatial segregation of these plants is driven by differential tolerance to salt stress and plant competition, we performed transplant experiments with 10 common plants in the system. When freshwater marsh plants were transplanted to salt marshes, they did poorly and generally died with or without neighbors present. In contrast, when saltmarsh plants were transplanted to freshwater marshes, they thrived in the absence of neighbors, growing better than they did in salt marshes, but when neighbors were present, they were strongly suppressed. These results suggest that the spatial segregation of plants across estuarine salinity gradients is driven by competitively superior freshwater marsh plants displacing salt-tolerant plants to physically harsh saltmarsh habitats, whereas freshwater marsh plants are limited from living in salt marshes by physical factors (e.g., high salinities).

When hummingbirds alone visited experimental populations, narrow flowers indeed performed best by most measures. Hummingbirds showed a slight preference for flowers of intermediate width but deposited more pollen per visit and more pollen overall, and they exported more dye (a pollen analogue) as corolla flare decreased. Bees were more effective than birds at pollinating wide flowers but did not generate overall performance trade-offs. Bees also preferred flowers of intermediate width and deposited more pollen per visit and more pollen overall as corolla flare decreased, but the overall efficiency with which bumble bees exported dye was independent of corolla flare. This demonstrates that phenotypic specialization for hummingbirds might evolve without trading-off the effectiveness of bumble bees.

Trin. ex Steud., in two temperate littoral freshwater marshes. Water availability was the major factor affecting CO2 evolution rates. In the laboratory, microbial assemblages responded rapidly to controlled additions of water, with large increases in CO2 evolution occurring within five minutes after wetting of litter (e.g., leaf blades: 10-295 μg CO2-C·(g ash-free dry mass [AFDM])-1·h-1. Under field conditions, CO2 evolution in the absence of precipitation exhibited a pronounced diel periodicity, with the highest rates occurring during periods of increased water availability resulting from a temperature-induced rise in relative humidity (>95%) and corresponding litter water potential (>-2.0 MPa) during nighttime. For example, in October, rates of CO2 evolution over a 24-h cycle ranged from 5 to 223 μg CO2- C·(g AFDM)-1·h-1 for leaf blades and from 10 to 155 μg CO2-C·(g AFDM)-1·h -1 for leaf sheaths. Maximum rates of CO2 evolution from sheaths were consistently lower than those for leaf blades (by ∼25%), but were typically an order of magnitude higher than those observed from culm litter (e.g., 1.0-18 μg CO2-C·(g AFDM)-1·h -1 over a diel cycle in August) exposed to identical environmental conditions. Much of the differences in maximum CO2 evolution rates from different litter types were related (r2 = 0.72) to differences in litter associated fungal biomass (leaf blades 34-74 mg dry mass/g AFDM, leaf sheaths 16-67 mg dry mass/g AFDM, and culms 2-7 mg dry mass/g AFDM), which was estimated from litter ergosterol concentrations. Based on measured stocks of standing-dead plant litter, estimated daily CO2 flux from standing-dead shoots ranged between 51 and 570 mg C/m2 of wetland surface area.

Early emphases in stream biogeochemistry involved organic carbon dynamics and whole-ecosystem budgets. These approaches were holistic but cumbersome and laborious and ignored several crucial issues, such as variation in organic matter quality. Nutrient-spiraling approaches rectified this shortcoming and provided a flowpath-specific technique for resolving the dynamics of both inorganic and organic materials and for comparing streams of different sizes and flow rates. The ability of nutrient-spiraling approaches to deal with multiple elements and fluctuating flows, including floods, remains elusive, however. There are several opportunities for stream ecology and biogeochemistry to continue cross-fertilization to the benefit of both disciplines. Chief among these is an emphasis on streams as spatially distributed heterogeneous systems, constantly shifting in shape and configuration through time. Hydrologic and material flowpaths integrate this heterogeneity as they alternately converge and diverge and perfuse the channel, hyporheic zone, riparian zone, and floodplain as they transport materials inexorably downstream. Conceptualizing streams as branched structures adds new insights to biogeochemical processing in space and raises several questions about network shape as an independent variable influencing biogeochemical dynamics such as nutrient retention efficiency. Junctions of streams emerge as potentially significant functional units when streams are viewed as networks. Ultimately, stream drainages finely dissect the land and receive water from soils in channelless upland regions which are themselves pervaded by convergent flowpaths, thus blurring the difference between streams and the landscapes they drain. Other lucrative future research opportunities are discussed including a plea for greater use of stoichiometric approaches and a consideration of geometry, disturbance, and legacies at multiple scales of space and time. We predict that future research in biogeochemistry will increasingly seek and find similarities among diverse ecosystem types by focusing on the spatially explicit flowpaths that integrate and connect them.",Biogeochemistry | Flowpaths | Streams,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the field, fungicide (Benomyl) reduced AM mycorrhizal colonization of C. maculosa roots by >80%. Fungicide did not significantly reduce non-AM fungi.

In untreated soils, C. maculosa grew larger in the presence of Festuca idahoensis or Koeleria cristata than when alone. When fungicide was applied these positive effects of Festuca and Koeleria on C. maculosa did not occur. A third native grass, Pseudoroegneria spicata, had much stronger competitive effects on C. maculosa than Festuca or Koeleria, and fungicide reduced the competitive effects of Pseudoroegneria.

To test this prediction, we used a warming experiment in which heaters were suspended over a natural montane meadow for 12 years.

The functional response of herbivores can be density independent until a threshold of competitors is reached in the food patch, and only then does it become density dependent. Herbivores also should be capable of maintaining food intake rate, despite important resource depletion in the foraging patch. The possibility of animal movements during food processing offers herbivores opportunities for cost-free vigilance. When individuals find their next bite before they have finished chewing the current bite, the remaining chewing time becomes ""spare time"" that could be spent in vigilance without reducing food intake rate. Modeling of optimal vigilance demonstrates that such cost-free vigilance might importantly alter expected patterns of scanning by mammalian herbivores. Assuming that interference increases with competitor density, spare time available for scanning should decrease as the number of herbivores in a food patch increases.

We investigated the seasonal development of the herbivore fauna on common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca) to understand the effect of early-season herbivory by different species on insect growth, natural colonization, and community composition. First, we showed that damage by an early-season stem-feeding weevil (Rhyssomatus lineaticollis) reduced growth of monarch larvae (Danaus plexippus) and leaf beetle larvae (Labidomera clivicollis), suggesting that plant quality is reduced by weevil damage. To better understand the potential for initial herbivore damage to affect subsequent colonization by herbivores in the field, we compared undamaged controls to plants experimentally damaged with one of three herbivores: weevils, monarchs, or leaf beetles. We counted seven species of naturally colonizing herbivores on all plants for the next two months to assess colonization, damage, and insect community richness. Our results showed that initial herbivory by different species altered host plant use by herbivores in two years of experiments. Similarly, induced resistance and susceptibility occurred in both years, but due to different initial damaging species on individual plants. Treatment effects also scaled up to alter herbivore community richness. Initial treatments varied in their persistence through the season. For example, in 2001, the influence of initial monarch damage dissipated due to subsequent damage by colonizing herbivores, but the impacts of initial weevil treatment were unaffected. This result suggests that, although induced responses to weevil feeding persisted through the season, monarch herbivory was more likely to affect the herbivore community via a cascade of indirect effects. In 2002, plant and insect responses were more specific, depending on the identity of both initial and colonizing herbivore species. Despite year-to-year variation, considerable consistency in many responses to our treatments indicates that the identity of the initially colonizing herbivore can affect subsequent plant use and community structure.

Additionally, we examined the scaling of nutrient investments with biomass and production both globally and within biomes to determine if and when these ratios respond to macroscale ecosystem properties (such as nutrient availability). We found that, while global forest C:N:P ratios in both foliage and litter were more variable than those of marine particulate matter, biome level (temperate broadleaf, temperate coniferous, and tropical) ratios were as constrained as marine ratios and statistically distinct from one another. While we were more interested in the relative constancy of the C:N:P ratios than their numerical value we did note, as have others, that the atomic ratios calculated for foliage (1212:28:1) and litter (3007:45:1) reflect the increased proportion of C-rich structural material characteristic of terrestrial vegetation. Carbon:nutrient ratios in litter were consistently higher than in comparable foliar data sets, suggesting that resorption of nutrients is a globally important mechanism, particularly for P. Litter C:N ratios were globally constant despite biome-level differences in foliar C:N; we speculate that this strong coupling may be caused by the significant contribution of immobile cell wall bound proteins to the total foliar N pool. Most ratios scaled isometrically across the range of biomass stocks and production in all biomes suggesting that ratios arise directly from physiological constraints and are insensitive to factors leading to shifts in biomass and production.

To assess the impact of the red maple paradox on detrital food webs, we conducted a mesocosm experiment investigating the influence of red maple litter on the food web of temporary woodland ponds. Amphibian biomass and survival were significantly lower in experimental ponds that contained only maple litter. The negative effects of maple litter were most pronounced in larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica). We hypothesize that this effect resulted from a temporary shift from a grazing-based food web in oak mesocosms to a microbial-based food web in maple mesocosms, as oak mesocosms initially had higher levels of phytoplankton biomass and lower levels of bacterial production than maple mesocosms. This bottom-up effect of maple litter on wood frogs then appeared to affect other amphibians and zooplankton through a complex series of interactions.

We conducted a three-year density-reduction experiment to investigate the behavioral mechanisms that regulate the abundance of a Nearctic-Neotropical migrant passerine, the Black-throated Blue Warbler (Dendroica caerulescens), during the breeding season. We found that the number of young fledged per territory, territory size, and the proportion of time males spent foraging were significantly greater on territories around which neighbor density was experimentally reduced compared to control territories. Territory quality, proportion of nests depredated per territory, and male countersinging rates were not statistically different between treatments. These results indicate that individuals with more neighbors (i.e., in neighborhoods with greater conspecific density) have reduced breeding productivity. The results also suggest that a crowding mechanism that mediates interactions among territory-holders could generate the density dependence needed to regulate local abundance, at least in areas of homogeneous, high-quality habitat. The effect of the neighbor-density reduction on warbler fecundity and behavior varied with annual fluctuations in weather and food availability, and was strongest in 1997, an El Niño year, when conditions for breeding were least favorable.

We assume that predictions of vegetation dynamics can be made on the basis of a set of life-history traits that characterize the response of a species to disturbance. For crown-fire ecosystems, the main plant traits related to postfire persistence are the ability to resprout (persistence of individuals) and the ability to retain a persistent seed bank (persistence of populations). In this context, we asked (1) to what extent do different life-history traits co-occur with the ability to resprout and/or the ability to retain a persistent seed bank among differing ecosystems and (2) to what extent do combinations of fire-related traits (fire syndromes) change in a fire regime gradient? We explored these questions by reviewing the literature and analyzing databases compiled from different crown-fire ecosystems (mainly eastern Australia, California, and the Mediterranean basin). The review suggests that the pattern of correlation between the two basic postfire persistent traits and other plant traits varies between continents and ecosystems. From these results we predict, for instance, that not all resprouters respond in a similar way everywhere because the associated plant traits of resprouter species vary in different places. Thus, attempts to generalize predictions on the basis of the resprouting capacity may have limited power at a global scale. An example is presented for Australian heathlands.

Here we use an extensive set of field data on food abundance and quality, combined with experimentally derived measures of nutritional value, to predict the spatial distribution of Thomson's gazelles (Gazella thomsoni thomsoni Günter) on the Serengeti Plains of East Africa. Twelve plausible models, based on alternate foraging objectives or movement rules, were assessed against field data on food and grazer abundance gathered at biweekly intervals (every two weeks) over the course of the wet seasons in two different years. Nomadic movements of gazelles closely tracked changes in the spatial distribution of short grass swards. Gazelles left short grass patches when local daily energy intake dropped below the expected intake averaged across the landscape. Subsequent redistribution of gazelles among neighboring patches was proportional to daily rates of energy intake in each patch. Thus, nomadic movements by Thomson's gazelles were predictable on the basis of local energy gain.

It, along with time allocation, can be used by a forager to manage risk. Apprehension should increase, and time allocation should decrease with a forager's energetic state (marginal value of energy). We tested these predictions on Allenby's gerbils (Gerbillus andersoni allenbyi) by manipulating the energetic state of the gerbils through augmentations of millet seeds. We also manipulated two risk factors, the microhabitat of the foraging patch (bush or open) and the presence of barn owls (Tyto alba). We measured apprehension of gerbils using the selectivity of gerbils for trays that differed in the distribution of seeds that they contained and time allocation using the amount of seeds left behind in trays, the giving-up density (GUD). Gerbils harvested 4.6 times more seeds when supplemental seeds were available, 17.4% fewer seeds when owls were present, 25.8% fewer seeds from the open than the bush microhabitat, and 19.3% fewer seeds from trays when seed augmentations were also present. With regard to time allocation, gerbils had higher GUDs (allocated less time) when risk was higher: in the open microhabitat and in the presence of owls. Also, the response of gerbils to owls was affected both by the seed augmentation and by microhabitat. With regard to apprehension, the gerbils were more apprehensive when extra seeds were added. Their level of apprehension changed little in the bush microhabitat but increased greatly in the open microhabitat when energetic state was manipulated. Thus, gerbils use both time allocation and apprehension in response to predators.

We tested the variability hypothesis using waterbird communities on 12 floodplain lakes, paired into six systems distributed across half of the continent, over the period from 1983 to 2001. Half of the floodplain lakes were regulated (reservoirs) with stable water levels, while the remainder had unaltered hydrology. We analyzed in more detail the waterbird community within the Menindee system, using eight floodplain lakes, paired into four groups of flow regimes. Similar but less marked patterns occurred within the Menindee system. Overall, mean density (±1 SE) on unregulated floodplain lakes was significantly higher (6.04 ± 1.64 waterbirds/ha), compared with regulated floodplain lakes (0.66 ± 0.22 waterbirds/ha). The mean number of species on floodplain lakes was significantly higher on unregulated lakes (17.21 ± 0.95, n = 19), compared with regulated floodplain lakes (9.32 ± 0.56, n = 19). Numbers of waterbird species were significantly higher on unregulated lakes compared with regulated lakes, reaching a higher mean accumulation value over time. High diversity was observed in three of the five functional feeding groups that feed on invertebrate populations and aquatic vegetation. The other two feeding groups (piscivores and large wading species) were similar in number and density between regulated and unregulated lakes, possibly because exotic fish species thrived in regulated lakes. Ordination analyses supported these observations, clearly separating unregulated lakes and flow-regulated lakes. Reduction of hydrological variability, particularly removal of natural drying periods, affected the ecology of regulated floodplain lakes.

Using both natural populations and a common garden, we document pervasive hermaphrodite-biased damage and identify several floral traits associated with resistance. Lower flower number, lower pollen production per flower, and earlier flowering date were associated with higher resistance. Because the sex morphs do not differ in flower number or flowering time, the presence of pollen is the main factor determining sex-differential resistance. We confirmed that simulated clipping was a good surrogate for weevil clipping, and we used simulated clipping to assess sex-morph- and sex-function-specific tolerance. We found that females were less tolerant than hermaphrodites in terms of seed and fruit production, but the sex morphs were similarly unable to compensate fully in flower production. Hermaphrodites showed some ability to compensate in pollen per flower, but this was not large enough to offset flower losses, leading to net undercompensation for pollen per plant. We evaluated potential mechanisms for tolerance and found that the number of reserve buds was the most consistent predictor of tolerance. Finally, we found that herbivory shifted sex expression of hermaphrodites toward greater femaleness via both plastic changes in allocation and direct effects of loss of male-functioning flowers. Our work indicates that the effects of herbivory on sexual system evolution can include sexual phenotype-biased herbivore damage and sex-dependent tolerance, as well as herbivory-induced changes in hermaphrodite sex allocation.

We introduce a measure called the ""quasi-collapse risk"" that is defined as the probability that the number of species in a community falls below some defined value within a fixed period of time following the loss of a species. We develop deterministic and stochastic methods for finding post-extinction communities. We use these methods to investigate the relationship between diversity (species richness) and quasi-collapse risks in model communities. It is shown that, in a deterministic context, communities with more species within trophic levels have a larger fraction of species remaining in post-extinction communities. This benefit of species richness is to a large extent lost in the presence of demographic stochasticity. The reason for this is a negative relationship between population density and species diversity. We also show that communities become increasingly triangular in shape as secondary extinctions take place, due to greater extinction risk of species at higher trophic levels.

We present a dynamic programming model of settling behavior using parameters estimated from a field study of dispersal in desert isopods, Hemilepistus reaumuri, which walk up to thousands of meters before settling in new or already-established burrows each spring. The model shows that incremental costs of dispersal lead to right-skewed population dispersal patterns, in contrast to cost-free systems or those with unitary costs (i.e., a one-time cost of leaving a group or patch). In the model, continuous variation in habitat quality, as opposed to discrete suitable vs. unsuitable sites, allows for trade-offs with dispersal costs that lead to shifts in the likelihood of settling in a patch of a given quality. Thus, measurement of quantitative costs and benefits of movement are needed to understand population dispersal distributions. These costs or benefits may be observable during or after movement, and we examined both pre- and postsettling incremental consequences of dispersal. The daily mortality rate of traveling isopods was 4.2% during the dispersal season, higher than that of settled individuals. Successful settlers traveled more slowly, but burrows started in midseason were most likely to succeed. More distant burrows failed more often, suggesting either an additional cost of movement or a difference in the quality of individuals traveling different distances. The predicted mean dispersal duration from the simulations matched observed values closely, but was based on an unrealistic assumption of perfect knowledge of habitat quality, suggesting some other factor favors longer times before settling.

Experimental manipulations of the abundance of the two predators in an oyster-reef trophic cascade, and the structural complexity provided by reefs of living oysters, demonstrated that enhanced habitat complexity weakened the strengths of trophic interactions. The system of tri-trophic interactions included oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau) as the top predator that consumed the mud crab (Panopeus herbstii), which preys upon juvenile oysters (Crassostrea virginica). On reefs of low complexity, toadfish controlled mud crab abundances and indirectly determined the level of mortality of juvenile oysters. The indirect effects of toadfish on oysters emerged through their influence on how intensely mud crabs preyed on oysters. Augmentation of habitat complexity by substituting vertically oriented, living oysters for the flat shells of dead oysters disrupted both of the direct trophic linkages but did not alter the magnitude of the indirect effect of toadfish on juvenile oysters. This paradox can be understood by partitioning the mechanisms by which toadfish influence mud crabs and ultimately juvenile oysters. Trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs; i.e., predator-avoidance behavior in mud crabs) accounted for 95.6-98.2% of toadfish indirect benefits to oyster survival and, consequently, were a much greater contributor than density-mediated indirect interactions (DMIIs; i.e., the reduction in crab abundance by toadfish). Avoidance behavior was unaffected by modification in habitat complexity. Complex reefs increased total oyster survival because added habitat complexity reduced mud crab predation on oysters. Additionally, the magnitude of this effect was much greater than the increase in oyster mortality as a result of complex reefs disrupting toadfish predation on mud crabs. This experimental demonstration of how habitat complexity modifies trophic interactions in a temperate reef community has fundamental implications for our understanding of species interaction webs and community structure.

Similarly, we asked if sagebrush becomes more resistant when conspecific neighbors are clipped.

PCNM (principal coordinates of neighbor matrices) analysis achieves a spectral decomposition of the spatial relationships among the sampling sites, creating variables that correspond to all the spatial scales that can be perceived in a given data set. The analysis then finds the scales to which a data table of interest responds. The significant PCNM variables can be directly interpreted in terms of spatial scales, or included in a procedure of variation decomposition with respect to spatial and environmental components. This paper presents four applications of PCNM analysis to ecological data representing combinations of: transect or surface data, regular or irregular sampling schemes, univariate or multivariate data. The data sets include Amazonian ferns, tropical marine zooplankton, chlorophyll in a marine lagoon, and oribatid mites in a peat bog.

Thermal populations of both taxa are always surrounded by a nonthermal population of A. scabra that is reproductively isolated from the thermal plants by its later flowering time (summer rather than spring). Since Agrostis species are well known for their ability to form edaphic ecotypes, we used common garden and green-house experiments to test the hypothesis that ""soil type"" (a complex variable including factors such as soil chemistry and soil biotic community) was responsible for the separation of the thermal and nonthermal populations. In addition, field monitoring and growth chamber experiments were used to determine whether soil temperature affected the local distribution of these taxa. The results indicate that the thermal and nonthermal taxa are affected similarly by both soil temperature and soil type. The separate distribution of the thermal and non-thermal taxa is not due to the greater tolerance of one of these taxa for a particular factor, but instead to the interaction between seasonal fluctuations in soil temperature and the life history of the thermal and nonthermal plants. Nonthermal Agrostis plants, which are perennial, are excluded from the thermal habitats by lethal summer soil temperatures that limit the duration of the growing season, effectively selecting for precocious flowering and an annual habit. The thermal plants, in contrast, do not grow in the nonthermal matrix in prevailing cool field temperatures, but do grow in these habitats under artificially elevated temperatures. The thermal taxa may have reduced competitive ability at cooler temperatures.

Seed production differences between morphs were a function of both intrinsic plant characters (fruit production) and predispersal seed predation, which affects the number of viable seeds matured per ovule. Fruit production differences are hypothesized to result from a genotype-by-environment interaction, perhaps related to plant vigor. In contrast, morph differences in the numbers of viable seeds per ovule are produced via differential seed predation by heteropteran insects, as demonstrated by exclusion experiments. Because these predators feed when aril color is not visible, differential predation is evidently a response to pleiotropic effects of fruit color alleles.

The models, however, do not generally allow for divergence in size among individuals born at the same time. Size divergence may, for example, result from the stochasticity that arises due to local interactions between individuals and their environment and has been shown to affect the population dynamics within generations. We studied the effect of the size divergence that develops as a result of stochasticity over many generations, considering the full population dynamical feedback, including resource dynamics. The stochastic variation in our model was generated by local interactions of individuals with the environment. We varied the mobility of individuals, which regulated the strength of the local resource feedback on the consumers. We found that at very high mobility our model provided a good correspondence to similar but fully deterministic models, showing the single generation cycles typical for a size-structured consumer-resource interaction. Intermediate levels of mobility had no notable effect on the dynamics of our model population. At very low mobility, the dynamics appeared to be strongly influenced by stochasticity. We showed that by superposition of the underlying deterministic dynamics and the stochasticity induced by local interactions we could fully understand the dynamics of the model. This finding led us to conclude that, while individual variability may have an impact on population structure and dynamics, it does not necessarily change the deterministic interactions that determine global population dynamics. More specifically, our study highlights the robustness of single generation cycles, showing that even at high levels of individual variability the population dynamics will intermittently exhibit patterns resembling these cycles.",Cohort competition | Consumer-resource interaction | Demographic stochasticity | Life-history variability | Mobility | Physiologically structured population models,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Laboratory trials suggest that this nonrandom rock use is a direct response to thermal cues; juvenile spiders selected warmer over cooler retreat sites.

Therefore, we review fractal analysis and its assumptions, highlighting three ways in which it can yield useful information about individual movement paths regardless of whether or not the assumption of scale invariance has been met. We used these techniques to analyze patterns of individual variation and potential causes of variation in the dispersal searching paths of two species of Australian treecreeper (Passeriformes: Climacteridae).

Thoroughness also differed between the sexes and the species, possibly as a direct consequence of mating and social systems. For almost all individuals, thoroughness varied depending on the spatial scale at which it was examined, revealing three distinct domains of scale in which movement tactics vary because movement is used for very different purposes. Variability in movement tactics was greatest in the largest spatial-scale domain, the one used exclusively for dispersal movements, suggesting that dispersal tactics show more intraspecific variation than other types of movement because dispersal, decisions are influenced by a greater variety of factors.

Yet, it has not been appreciated that these facultative relationships can be mutualistic. I examined the interaction between Phryganoporus candidus, a subsocial Australian spider, and the extrafloral nectary-bearing shrub Acacia ligulata to explore variability in mutualistic interactions over a three-year period. Spiders enhanced seed production by reducing seed predation by heteropterans, wasps, and weevils. Because spider colonies occupy only a fraction of a plant's volume, average benefits ranged from 0.4 to 6% increases in whole-plant seed production. These benefits were strongest in years of low seed production, suggesting that spiders may buffer plants against female reproductive failure. To evaluate benefits for spiders, I established experimental spider colonies on three common hosts. Spider performance (persistence and prey capture rates) on live A. ligulata and live hopbush Dodonaea viscosa exceeded that on dead acacia, suggesting that live hosts are more beneficial than dead hosts.

We constructed a stochastic, individual-based model parameterized with data on red kangaroos. Because we do not know which part of individual growth would change in the course of natural selection, we explored the effects of two alternative models of individual growth in which alleles affect either the growth rate or the maximum size. The model results show that size-selective harvesting can result in significantly smaller kangaroos for a given age when the entire population is subject to harvesting.

This is due to homeostasis, the relatively constant composition of biomass. Yet growth-rate-dependent changes in the composition of biomass do exist. The dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory provides the framework to deal with these simultaneous limitations and stoichiometric restrictions. We illustrate the application with three examples. First, we discuss simple single-species growth of a chemolithoautotroph to illustrate the interactions between nutrients and substrates in growth. We show how the macrochemical reaction equation with variable yield coefficients can be decomposed in a number of subprocesses with constant yield coefficients. We then discuss a simple predator-prey system, where nutrients are accumulated in the prey, which no longer have a constant composition of biomass. The implication is a varying conversion efficiency from prey to predator, with consequences for qualitative aspects of population dynamics. We illustrate the principles with a grazer (a heterotrophic consumer) feeding on algae (autotrophic producers). The algae frequently have an excess of energy in the form of carbohydrates, which are excreted and serve as food supplements for the heterotroph. This exchange of carbohydrates against nutrients is basic to a symbiosis, our third example of application of DEB theory for solving stoichiometric problems in species interactions. The algae are no longer grazed as long as the grazer is able to extract nutrients from other sources. Depending on parameter values of the system, the coexistence can be very stable and further integrate into a single entity with mixotrophic properties. This process is basic to the evolution of the eukaryotic cell and to the organizational structure of metabolism. Mixotrophs can specialize under particular environmental conditions into autotrophs or heterotrophs, which again can associate in symbiotic relationships. The chemical composition of membranes testifies to the frequent occurrence of this process, which can now also be understood quantitatively.",Autotrophs and heterotrophs | Bifurcation theory | Dynamic energy budget (DEB) theory | Ecosystem dynamics | Liebig's minimum rule | Macrochemical reaction equation | Mixotrophy | Nutrient limitation | Producer-consumer dynamics | Stoichiometry | Symbiosis | Syntrophy,NA,NA,NA,NA

This focus is directly relevant to coral reef communities that are characterized by very high species diversity in a spatially heterogeneous environment, display stochastic variability in community structure at small spatial and temporal scales, and are subject to major disturbances. We monitored coral and fish assemblages over 14 years on fixed sites spread over 80 km of the southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, and found evidence of large-scale resilience and predictable recovery of these assemblages. Sometime between November 1987 and October 1989, live coral cover on the shallow northeast flanks of some reefs in the southern GBR decreased from >80% to <10%, probably as a result of storm damage. We compared the fish and benthic communities present in these areas prior to the disturbance (1983-1984) with those present in 1992 and the subsequent changes through to 1998. Hard coral cover increased slowly from 1992 to 1994, then accelerated to be indistinguishable from pre-impact levels by 1998. The response of the coral assemblages was largely due to the predominance of tabulate Acropora species and their characteristics of rapid growth and competitive dominance. Patterns of species richness of the fish families Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Scaridae, and Pomacentridae mirrored that of hard coral, except the Pomacentridae had not recovered to pre-impact levels by 1998. Of the 26 fish species analyzed for changes in abundance, 88% decreased after the disturbance, then subsequently increased, with all but two recovering to pre-impact levels by 1998. Although processes such as settlement and immigration are ultimately responsible for replenishment of local populations, our data suggested that habitat plays a strong role in modifying fish assemblages. Thus, both coral and fish assemblages demonstrated resilience to large-scale natural disturbance and predictability in the structure of the assemblages, with most taxa approaching the asymptote of abundance and species richness that existed prior to the disturbance.",Coral assemblage | Disturbance | Great Barrier Reef | Large scale | Recovery | Reef fish assemblage | Resilience,NA,NA,NA,NA

A shift in climate from cool-wet to warm-dry conditions facilitated comparison of climate-vegetation relationships during two distinct periods: 1957-1976 and 1977-1996. For each treeline, tree radial growth and seedling establishment were correlated against monthly and seasonal temperature, precipitation, moisture availability, and two indices of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO): southern oscillation index (SOI) and sea surface temperature (SST). Four key aspects of climatic influences on N. pumilio radial growth and seedling establishment were as follows.

(2) Moisture availability was the dominant climatic factor influencing seedling establishment, although temperature-precipitation interactions resulted in variability among study areas.

We tested whether size could be used to predict a behavioral response of multiple prey species (n > 50) to exclusion of large-bodied fishes, including seven abundant piscivore species, in a lowland Neotropical river. A randomized block design (n = 6) included three experimental treatments constructed on sandbank habitats: large fish exclusion, cage control (barrier with gaps), and natural reference plot (no barrier). Exclosures prevented passage of all large-bodied fishes, but the mesh size allowed passage of prey fishes. After two weeks, experimental areas were sampled once during the day and once at night. Total abundance of prey fishes was not significantly different among treatments, and effects on species density were variable. Analyses based on fish size class, however, demonstrated significant size-based effects of large-fish exclusion. Abundance of medium fishes (40-110 mm) in exclusion treatments increased significantly relative to controls in day (248%) and night (91%) samples, and this trend was apparent for many species (n > 13). Species density of medium fishes increased significantly in exclusion treatments. There was evidence of an intraspecific, size-dependent response for the three most common species. Ninety percent of prey in stomach contents of seven common large-bodied piscivores (collected from river sandbanks) were 40-110 mm, corresponding to size of fishes that responded to large-fish exclusion. Behavioral responses of medium prey likely resulted from exclusion of these large-bodied piscivores. These results extend size-based predator avoidance behavior demonstrated in temperate systems to a highly connected tropical river food web. In this species-rich web, size is a strong predictor of behavioral responses of multiple prey species to large piscivores, and it can be used to generalize outcomes of multiple species interacting simultaneously.",Complexity | Diversity | Fish | Food webs | Indirect effects | Predator-prey interactions | River | Size structure | Tropics | Venezuela,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

We tested for decreased herbivory, increased fruit set, and decreased predation as evolutionary mechanisms driving synchronous reproduction in an iteroparous perennial plant, Astragalus scaphoides, at three semiarid sagebrush steppe sites in intermountain valleys of Idaho and Montana, USA. Reproduction was synchronous at all sites and significantly bimodal at two sites, but it was never as variable as distinctly mast-seeding plant species. Plants in all populations experienced at least one economy of scale: decreased inflorescence herbivory, increased fruit set, and/or decreased weevil seed predation with increasing flowering plant density. At two of three sites, these relationships were strong enough to increase expected geometric mean seed set. However, among-site differences in benefits and strength of synchrony were not concordant. In particular, the site with the strongest economy of scale and highest coefficient of variation (cv) was the least bimodal. We suggest that different mechanisms drive cv and bimodality in this species, both of which contribute to overall synchrony.

The latter possibility is of particular concern with respect to coral reefs, which have undergone dramatic changes in the last 25-30 years. This paper reports a case in which two reef systems with different biotic histories were recently perturbed to a single, novel state. We compared millennial-scale records of species dominance from reefs in Bahía Almirante, a coastal lagoon in northwestern Panama, to previously published records from reefs in the shelf lagoon of Belize. Reef cores extracted from Bahia Almirante at 5-10 m water depth revealed that the Panamanian reefs were persistently dissimilar from the Belizean reefs for at least 2000-3000 years prior to the last several decades. The Panamanian reefs were dominated continuously by branching finger corals, Porites spp. (primarily P. furcata). Shifts from the Porites-dominated state to dominance by other coral species were rare, were restricted to small areas, and lasted for decades to centuries. The Belizean reefs were dominated continuously by the staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis in the same depth range during the same period. Excursions from the Acropora-dominated state were again rare and spatially localized. Populations of Ac. cervicornis in the Belizean lagoon were nearly extirpated by an outbreak of white-band disease in the late 1980s, and changes in water quality were apparently detrimental to branching Porites in Bahía Almirante in recent decades. These large-scale perturbations caused the two reef systems to converge on a third, historically unprecedented state: dominance by the lettuce coral Agaricia tenuifolia. Ag. tenuifolia possesses life-history attributes and environmental tolerances that enabled it to become dominant in both disturbed ecosystems. Although the two phase shifts to Ag. tenuifolia differed in both their general mechanisms and specific causes, they had the effect of eliminating the salient difference in benthic composition between the Panamanian and Belizean reefs.

Here we present the results of a four-year experimental study on the effects of a hematophagous ectoparasite, the hen flea (Ceratophyllus gallinae), on growth, survival, and lifetime reproductive success of nestlings of the Great Tit (Parus major). In a design A, half of the nests were heat-treated several times per year to kill parasites, while in the other half, fleas were allowed to immigrate naturally over several years. To allow for the estimation and statistical control of effects due to potentially nonrandom phenotype distribution within this design, a second design, design B, was applied. In design B, all nests were heat treated to kill parasites after nest box occupation, and the subsequent infestation of half of the nests was then randomized in space and time. In both designs, the fleas significantly reduced nestling body size but did not significantly affect the probability of nestling recruitment as local breeders. Parasitism reduced the clutch size of the nestlings' first recorded clutch, and of the subsequent clutches, and reduced the total number of recruits produced per nestling over the entire study period. Because body size of the recruited nestlings, both at the end of growth and as recruits, was not significantly different between treatments, the reduced fitness was not an indirect consequence of parasite-modified body size. This study provides experimental evidence for parasite-induced effects during growth on survival and development of offspring and shows the consequences of this phenotypic modification on lifetime reproductive success.

The number of exotic seedlings emerging and the biomass of dicot seedlings removed during weeding were also significantly lower in plots containing natives as compared to plots that did not contain natives. We found evidence that the ability of established native perennial species to limit space available for exotic annual seeds to germinate and to limit the light available to exotic seedlings reduced exotic productivity and shifted competitive interactions in favor of the natives.

A field experiment demonstrated that grazing by the snail can cause the loss of aquatic plants, a change toward dominance of planktonic algae, and thereby a shift toward turbid water. Estimates of biologically fixed nutrients released through snails grazing on aquatic plants revealed that phosphorus releases were sufficient to explain the recorded increase in phytoplankton biomass. Hence, our study demonstrates how an herbivore may trigger a shift from clear water and macrophyte dominance to a turbid state dominated by planktonic algae.

Our study used an 18-year sampling program in intertidal and subtidal habitats and before-after, control-impact analyses. We show that a 3.5°C rise in seawater temperature, induced by the thermal outfall of a power-generating station, over 10 years along 2 km of rocky coastline in California resulted in significant community-wide changes in 150 species of algae and invertebrates relative to adjacent control areas experiencing natural temperatures. Contrary to predictions based on current biogeographic models, there was no trend toward warmer-water species with southern geographic affinities replacing colder-water species with northern affinities.

Many temperature-sensitive algae decreased greatly in abundance, whereas many invertebrate grazers increased. The responses of these benthic communities to ocean warming were mostly unpredicted and strongly coupled to direct effects of temperature on key taxa and indirect effects operating through ecological interactions.","BACI analysis | Benthic community structure | Biogeographic distribution information | Climate change, predicting effects | Diablo Cove, California, USA | Ocean warming | Rocky reef | Temperature change | Thermal discharge of a power plant, effects",NA,NA,NA,NA

A common objective of such studies is to evaluate the relationship between abundance or density and covariates that describe animal habitat or other environmental influences. However, little attention has been focused on methods of modeling abundance covariate effects in conventional distance-sampling models. In this paper we propose a distance-sampling model that accommodates covariate effects on abundance. The model is based on specification of the distance-sampling likelihood at the level of the sample unit in terms of local abundance (for each sampling unit). This model is augmented with a Poisson regression model for local abundance that is parameterized in terms of available covariates. Maximum-likelihood estimation of detection and density parameters is based on the integrated likelihood, wherein local abundance is removed from the likelihood by integration. We provide an example using avian point-transect data of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) collected using a distance-sampling protocol and two measures of habitat structure (understory cover and basal area of overstory trees). The model yields a sensible description (positive effect of understory cover, negative effect on basal area) of the relationship between habitat and Ovenbird density that can be used to evaluate the effects of habitat management on Ovenbird populations.",Abundance estimation | Avian point counts | Distance-sampling methodology | Mixture models | Ovenbird | Random effects,NA,NA,NA,NA

Juvenile cannibals in mesocosms displayed a type III (sigmoid) density-dependent functional response, resulting in significantly higher proportional mortality of smaller conspecifics at high prey densities. Consistent with the laboratory result, cage-enclosed juvenile cannibals in a field experiment eliminated conspecific settlement peaks in mussel habitats and decoupled the relationship between larval and settlement abundance within three days. Density-dependent interference between cannibals in mesocosms decreased per capita predation rates, but conspecific prey mortality still increased with cannibal densities when the abundance of cannibals passed a critical threshold, suggesting that the recruitment success of consecutive cohorts may be negatively correlated. This was supported in a field experiment where the abundance of juvenile cannibals explained 71% of the variation in settlement loss from uncaged mussel habitats. Density-dependent cannibalism also occurred within juvenile cohorts even though food was provided in excess, but the resulting mortality was too low to eliminate initial density patterns over a 30-day period. The results demonstrate that cannibalism between juvenile shore crabs can cause high and strongly density-dependent mortality at natural densities, and that both a functional response and a numerical effect of larger cannibals can regulate the recruitment of new cohorts within days of settlement. A coupling of cannibal and settlement densities on a regional scale is expected to decrease recruitment variability within and between local populations. Moreover, the interaction between the type III functional response, mutual interference, and density-dependent dispersal of cannibals is predicted to reduce cannibalistic rates at low prey and high cannibal densities, respectively, and stabilize local population dynamics in relation to the abundance of juvenile habitats, consistent with field observations of shore crab populations in the study area.",Carcinus maenas | Density-dependent cannibalism | European green crab | Functional response | Larval supply | Mutual interference | Nursery habitat | Recruitment regulation | Settlement,NA,NA,NA,NA

After accounting for yearly variation, we found that calf body mass increased with the age of their mother until mothers were 6 years of age, then leveled off until 15 years of age. Body mass varied from year to year in similar ways for male and female calves. Winter harshness, and density when calves were in utero, could account for only a small part of this variation. Variation in calf body mass could be decomposed into a climatic component, determining the mean body mass of a cohort, and a mother component, determining the position of calves' body mass relative to the mean of their cohort. The mother effect could be further decomposed into an effect of the mother's age and an effect of the mother's quality. The latter explained >35% of the body mass variation in male calves, and ∼15% in females, while the proportions of the variation due to cohort effect were 28% and 42%, respectively. The mother's quality effect was therefore sex-specific and accounted for ∼1.5 times more of the variance in male than female body mass. Females with relatively long jawbones for their age had larger calves.

Empirical evidence shows that the specific growth rate is positively related to RNA concentration both between and within taxa in both unicellular and multicellular organisms. Since RNA is rich in P and constitutes a substantial part of the total P in organisms, a high growth rate is also connected with a high P content. We argue that the reason for this pattern is that the growth of all biota is closely linked with their protein synthesis rate, and thus with the concentration of ribosomal RNA. Dynamic energy budget theory supports the positive relationship between RNA and specific growth rate in microorganisms, whereas the predictions concerning multicellulars only partially agrees with the observed pattern. In a simple model of consumer growth, we explore the consequences of various allocation patterns of RNA, protein, carbohydrates/lipids, and other biochemical constituents on organism potential growth rate and C:N:P stoichiometry. According to the model the percentage of N and especially percentage of P per dry mass increases with increasing specific growth rate. Furthermore, the model suggests that macromolecule allocation patterns and thus N:P stoichiometry are allowed to differ substantially at low growth rates whereas the stoichiometry at high growth rates is much more constricted at low N:P. The model fits empirical data reasonably well, but it is also acknowledged that complex life cycles and associated physiological constraints may result in other patterns. We also use a similar approach of modeling organism growth from basic biochemical principles to illustrate fundamental connections among biochemical allocation and C:N stoichiometry in autotroph production, which is based on allocation patterns between carbohydrates and rubisco. Similar to the RNA-protein model, macromolecular composition and C:N ratios are more constrained at high than at low growth rates. The models and the empirical data together suggest that organism growth is tightly linked with the organisms' biochemical and elemental composition. The stoichiometry of growth impinges on nutrient cycles and carbon fluxes at the ecosystem level. Thus, focus on the biological basis of organism C:N:P stoichiometry can mechanistically connect growth strategy and biochemical and cellular mechanisms of biota to major ecological consequences.",Autotroph production | C:N:P stoichiometry | Consumer growth rate | Dynamic energy budget theory | Macromolecular allocation patterns | Protein allocation | Ribosomal RNA | Rubisco,NA,NA,NA,NA

Such data fall well short of demonstrating that nesting females actively select from among potential sites based on cues that predict fitness-determining phenotypic modifications of their offspring. We provide such data from experimental studies on a small oviparous snake (the keelback, Tropidonophis mairii) from the wet-dry tropics of Australia.

Incubation on wetter substrates significantly increased body size at hatching, a trait under strong positive selection in this population (based on mark-recapture studies of free-ranging hatchlings). Remarkably, the hydric conditions experienced by an egg in the first few hours after it was laid substantially affected phenotypic traits (notably, muscular strength) of the hatchling that emerged from that egg 10 weeks later.

Plants resist damage to leaves in a variety of ways, and we now have a rich literature documenting how plants defend themselves against herbivore attack. In contrast, the mechanisms by which plants resist enemies that consume floral parts or resources are much less known, even though damage to floral tissue usually has tighter links to plant fitness than damage to leaf tissue. Many plants experience nectar robbing, whereby floral visitors remove nectar from flowers, often without pollinating. Nectar robbers can reduce plant fitness to degrees comparable to, or even surpassing, reduction by herbivores. However, because nectar attracts both pollinators and nectar robbers, plants face a dilemma in defending against nectar robbers without also deterring pollinators. Here, we extend the conceptual framework of resistance to herbivores to include resistance to nectar robbers, focusing on nectar traits. We review published data and find that an array of nectar traits may deter robbers without deterring pollinators. Although resistance traits against robbers have been broadly identified, the costs and benefits of these traits in terms of plant fitness remain poorly understood. We present data showing that a nectar trait (dilute nectar) might directly, as well as indirectly, benefit plant fitness by deterring nectar-robbing bumble bees of Ipomopsis aggregata without deterring hummingbird pollinators.

Recent data show that predators on average have a higher nitrogen content and lower C:N ratio than potential herbivorous prey. Thus, many predators may be nitrogen limited, and intraguild predation may allow them to increase their nitrogen intake and growth by supplementing a diet of herbivores with more nitrogen-rich intraguild prey. We tested this hypothesis using an assemblage of salt-marsh-inhabiting arthropods. First, we determined the nitrogen content and C:N ratio of taxa in four trophic groups (plants, herbivores, omnivores, and predators). Second, we fed an intraguild predator, the wolf spider Pardosa, one of three diets (herbivores, intraguild prey, or an alternating mix of the two) and measured spider survival, growth, capture rate, and biomass and nitrogen intake. In general, body nitrogen content increased and C:N ratio decreased from lower to higher trophic levels for marsh-inhabiting species, with predators having a higher nitrogen content and lower C:N ratio than herbivores. Performance experiments showed that in one case Pardosa ingested more biomass and nitrogen and grew faster on a diet of intraguild prey (the planthopper egg predator Tytthus) than on a diet of herbivores (the planthopper Prokelisia dolus). This occurred because Pardosa captured more Tytthus than Prokelisia and not because Tytthus (a stoichiometric exception) was higher in nitrogen content. In another case, Pardosa grew slower on a diet of intraguild prey (the web-building spider Grammonota) than on a planthopper diet even though Grammonota was more nitrogen rich, a result we attribute to prey behavior and risk of predation. Mass gain and nitrogen intake in Pardosa were highly correlated with the biomass of prey consumed. However, after accounting for the biomass of prey consumed across all diet treatments, we found little evidence that either the nitrogen content or C:N stoichiometry of prey contributed to Pardosa's growth. Thus, there was little support for the hypothesis that the nitrogen stoichiometry of prey directly confers a performance advantage to Pardosa and in itself promotes intraguild predation. In this system, characteristics other than the nitrogen stoichiometry of prey play a significant role in prey capture and predator performance. Nonetheless, by supplementing their diet with readily captured intraguild prey, predators such as Pardosa can increase their nitrogen intake and performance.",C:N ratio | Diet mixing | Ecological stoichiometry | Intraguild predation | Nitrogen content | Omnivory | Predator performance | Prey behavior | Prey nutrition | Risk of predation | Salt marsh | Trophic level,NA,NA,NA,NA

We recently developed a theoretical model that predicts levels of biotic homogenization or differentiation (i.e., decreased community similarity) according to a series of distinct mechanisms that describe the outcomes of various interactions between native species, nonnative species, and the environment. Here, we test this model using empirical data for freshwater fish faunas in the United States at three spatial scales: the entire continent, zoogeographic provinces in California, and watersheds within these provinces. Our analysis reveals that, in general, mechanisms depicting widespread introductions of cosmopolitan species and either no or differential spatial patterns of native-species extirpations explain fish-community homogenization across multiple spatial scales. Our results also highlight the potential effect of spatial grain on the perceived importance of different invasion-extinction scenarios shaping patterns of homogenization and differentiation. Next, we discuss the utility of the model for providing insight into the dominant ecological processes likely driving the homogenization of other major taxonomic groups that currently lack quantitative estimates of community change. Our study is the first to quantitatively examine the relative importance of different ecological mechanisms that can generate observed patterns of biotic homogenization. Using this model may allow advance prediction of future patterns of homogenization by explicitly considering underlying ecological processes and mechanisms.","Beta diversity | Biodiversity | Biotic differentiation | Community similarity | Distinctiveness | Fish communities, biotic-homogenization likelihood | Fish fauna | Species extinctions | Species invasions | Species richness | Taxonomic homogenization",NA,NA,NA,NA

To identify the biological cause of density dependence, we manipulated both population density and the availability of shelter (crevices used as refuges from predators) in small plots of continuous reef. We detected strong density-dependent mortality in plots with few refuges, but mortality was density independent in plots with abundant refuges, indicating that limited shelter causes density dependence. Predator density was unrelated to the density of gobies and refuges, suggesting that predators displayed a type III functional response in patches with few refuges. In a second experiment, we manipulated goby density within replicate plots of three sizes (4, 16, and 64 m2) that varied naturally in the availability of refuges. If refuge availability was ignored, mortality appeared to be density independent at all scales. If, however, plots were grouped by refuge availability, mortality was density dependent in plots with few refuges, but low and density independent in plots with many refuges at all spatial scales. Understanding the mechanism of density dependence (refuge shortage) was thus required to measure the strength of density dependence in natural, spatially variable, habitat. We suggest that density dependence was detectable in plots of different sizes because the relationships between the densities of gobies, refuges, and goby predators were similar across the spatial scales we studied. Our work demonstrates that identifying the biological interactions that cause density dependence, and characterizing the spatial domains at which those interactions operate, will be important to accurately assess the effects of density dependence on population dynamics.",Coral reefs | Coryphopterus glaucofraenum | Density dependence | Density-dependent mortality in reef fishes | Gobiidae | Population regulation | Prey refuges and predation | Reef fishes | Shelter limitation | Spatial scale,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

However, few experimental studies have determined the relative importance of proximate underlying causes such as architectural constraints or resource competition among flowers, and fewer still have identified likely selective factors that favor sequential variation in allocation. By combining observational and experimental studies in natural populations of Aquilegia canadensis, we showed that ovule and pollen production declined with flower sequence by 9% and 18%, respectively, due to architectural effects. However, a much stronger decline in fruit set (27%) and seeds per fruit (58%) was mediated entirely by competition for resources among flowers. Reducing resources by defoliation greatly reduced fruit set (-37%) and seeds per fruit (-61%) and increased the severity of the decline in fruit set. Experimentally alleviating resource preemption by first flowers greatly increased the seed production of later flowers (+39%) to the extent that fourth flowers on manipulated plants set as many seeds as first flowers on control plants. In contrast, aspects of floral morphology including sepal size, nectar spur length, and herkogamy showed little or no sequential variation and were relatively insensitive to experimental manipulation of resources. We also investigated whether the positional decline in allocation was adaptive. Disproportionate investment in early flowers was not associated with a seasonal decline in important environmental factors (e.g., light, water, soil nutrients) or cross-pollination. Marker-gene assays also failed to show that early flowers consistently produced a greater proportion of high-quality outcrossed progeny. All flowers had a high probability of being eaten by herbivores (mean = 70%). However, the risk of herbivory was lower for early flowers (64%) than later flowers (79%). Herbivory may, therefore, select for higher allocation to early flowers as well as flexible investment mediated by interflower competition because it allows the reallocation of resources to later flowers when early flowers are lost to herbivores. This adaptive hypothesis is further supported by comparative data from closely related A. caerulea, which differs from A. canadensis in the nature of herbivory as well as the pattern and mechanism of sequential variation in reproductive allocation.",Allocation | Aquilegia canadensis | Columbine | Herbivory | Outcrossing | Pollen limitation | Resource limitation,NA,NA,NA,NA

Numerous studies, however, have demonstrated that temporal heterogeneity is the rule rather than the exception in natural systems. A case of particular interest is an expanding and contracting population where determination of source and sink populations is dependent on the timing and duration at which population growth rates are measured. Thus, ecologists have been perplexed about what is the proper scale to test for source-sink dynamics. In this study, I present a temporally variable source-sink dynamic driven by flooding disturbance. I measured population growth rates of an herbivorous neotropical rolled-leaf beetle, Cephaloleia fenestrata (Chrysomelidae), at different temporal scales in this expanding and contracting population. I demonstrate that flooding created a strong sink, but the system lacked source-sink dynamics during nonflood periods. The sink is caused by a flood-related sevenfold decrease in survival probability. There was no evidence for effects of flooding on recruitment. Migration was directional from the upland to the flood zone habitat, supporting the conclusion that the population in the flood zone is a sink. A Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that whether the population in the flood zone is a sink, and the intensity of the sink, ultimately depend on the flooding frequency. Given an observed flood frequency of approximately once per year, the flood zone population was determined to be a long-term sink. This study provides evidence of high temporal variability resulting in fluctuations in and out of a source-sink dynamic and implicates a causal factor (increased mortality due to flooding). These results illustrate the importance of considering temporal variability in source-sink dynamics, and in choosing the proper temporal scale at which to test for source-sink dynamics.",Cephaloleia fenestrata | Dispersal | Disturbance | Flooding | Mark-recapture | Pleiostachya pruinosa | Source-sink dynamics | Survival | Temporal heterogeneity,NA,NA,NA,NA

Species present in zones of extreme aridity or temperature exhibited narrower niche breadths than species situated in moderate sites, suggesting that stress-tolerant species do not occupy broad environmental ranges. Second, species niche positions were related to selected biological traits. Species of arid sites had significantly lower blade areas than did species of moist sites, confirming a functional trade-off between stress tolerance and productivity for leaf design. Species dispersal mode was correlated to species niche positions on the aridity gradient, suggesting allometrically determined correlations between leaf design and the design of reproductive structures. Species niche positions were also correlated with flowering traits, with species that initiate flowering in winter found under Mediterranean climate influence and species that initiate flowering in spring in sites with greater summer rainfall input.

We demonstrate that the mean and maximum distances that ants transport seeds adapted for ant dispersal increase with worker body size, and that this relationship is an accelerating power function. This pattern is consistent among three ant subfamilies that include most seed-dispersing ants as well as most invasive ant species, is generalizable across ant species and communities, and is independent of diaspore mass.

Last, we show that small seed-collecting ants and decreased seed dispersal distances are common features of sites occupied by invasive ants.

I employed that framework to describe phenotypic life history trade-offs in a large herbivore, moose (Alces alces). The relative importance of top-down and bottom-up ecological constraints to female moose in south-central Alaska was appraised at the population level by analyzing population size, growth, and winter habitat of moose, and the size and impact of their principal predator populations (wolves [Canis lupus] and brown bears [Ursus arctos]). At the individual level, longitudinal mortality and reproductive patterns of radio-collared individuals were studied to estimate vital rates and life history trade-offs that could be attributed to nutrition and predation, respectively. The population was essentially stable through the 1980s and early 1990s, and began declining in the period of this study (1994-2000). Nutritional constraints on productivity were evident in low twinning rates (9-24%) and delayed age of first reproduction (3.4 yr) relative to other moose populations. However, the decline of the population was due principally to high rates of summer mortality of calves, resulting in low recruitment in the fall (0.11-0.22 offspring/female) and increasing adult mortality. Bear and wolf densities were high and moderate, respectively, while human harvest of moose was limited to males. Modeled population growth indicated a very limited capacity for population recovery through increased reproduction when compared to the effects of reducing predation. Constraints on population growth were mirrored in life history trade-offs. Trade-offs that were attributed to bottom-up effects included reduced rates of both parturition and twinning as a consequence of maternal investment in the prior year. Important trade-offs also were detected between top-down factors and reproductive effort through significantly increased predation on adult females with calves and increased survival of yearlings when adults skipped or abandoned reproductive attempts and extended the duration of maternal care.",Alces alces | Brown bears | Browse | Cervidae | Cost of reproduction | Models | Moose | Nelchina | Population dynamics | Predator-prey | Ungulates | Wolves,NA,NA,NA,NA

We used aerial photographs, archives, and dendroecological data (315 sites) to reconstruct a stand initiation map for the area. The cumulative distribution of burnt area in relation to time since fire suggests that the fire frequency has decreased drastically since the end of the Little Ice Age (about 1850) in the entire region. However, a large part of the area was burned between 1910 and 1920 during intensive colonization and when the climate was very conducive to fire. For the period 1920-1945, large fires have mainly been concentrated in the more populated southern area, while few fires have been observed in the virgin coniferous forest in the north. Despite slight differences between the south and the north, fire cycles or the average number of years since fire are not significantly different. Since 1945, there have been far more fires in the south, but the mean fire size was smaller than in the north. These results suggest that the transition between the mixed and coniferous forests observed in the southern boreal forest cannot be explained by a difference in fire frequency, at least during the last 300 years. As climatic factors and species potential distribution did not vary significantly from south to north, we suggest that the transition from mixedwood to coniferous forests is mainly controlled by fire size and severity. Smaller and less severe fires would favor species associated with the mixedwood forests as many need survivors to reinvade burnt areas. The abundance of deciduous species in mixedwood forests, together with the presence of more lakes that can act as firebreaks, may contribute to decreases in fire size and severity. The transition between the two vegetation zones could be related to the initial setting following the vegetation invasion of the area during the Holocene. In this context, the limit of vegetation zones in systems controlled by disturbance regimes such as fires may not have reached a balance with current climatic conditions.

For the validation time period, we correctly predicted up to nine times as many invasions as a null (random) model. Further, the Allee model assigned average probabilities of invasion four times higher for lakes that became invaded than for uninvaded lakes, whereas the non-Allee model predicted probabilities for invaded lakes only two times higher.

The potential interaction of these life history trade-offs was studied under varying degrees of predation and nutritional limitation using models based on data from radio-collared moose in south-central Alaska. The interaction was mildly antiregulatory, assuming that bottom-up trade-offs are density dependent. That is, as nutritional constraints increased, a female that skipped reproduction after successfully rearing a calf enhanced the survival of herself and her yearling enough in the second year to overcompensate for the loss of productivity. In a declining population, the reverse could occur, accentuating the decline. A more general, stage projection matrix was used to model a broader range of predation rates in summer and winter, in order to contrast the potential importance of bears (Ursus arctos and U. americanus) and wolves (Canis lupus) in such an interaction. The greatest effect of life history interactions on population growth occurred with moderate predation in summer and heavy predation in winter. Relative to direct ecological effects on survival and reproduction, the influence of such an interaction was relatively weak. However, subtle effects on the stability of predator-prey interactions, particularly those involving bear predation, cannot be excluded because of the antiregulatory nature of the interaction and uncertainties about class-specific vulnerability to predation in other settings. These findings underscore the relevance of understanding the alternative life history choices that arise from interactions in both directions on the food chain, particularly given that the top-down trade-offs are usually poorly known.",Alces alces | Brown bears | Costs of reproduction | Models | Moose | Population dynamics | Predator-prey | Ungulates | Wolves,NA,NA,NA,NA

Floral nectar has traditionally been viewed in the context of pollination. Extrafloral nectar on the other hand, can act as an indirect defense, allowing the plant to recruit predators and parasitoids. Whereas this makes for a clear-cut categorization, in reality the functions may not be so discrete. Extrafloral nectar may serve a role in pollination, while floral nectar can be utilized by predators and parasitoids and thus can contribute to plant defense. Here we use the optimal defense theory to generate predictions with respect to allocation patterns of defensive nectar. These predictions are then tested using novel data on the production patterns of bracteal and foliar nectar in cotton, Gossypium hirsutum. Bracteal nectar production shows a distinct peak on the day of anthesis, followed by a prolonged secretion during fruit maturation. This suggests that bracteal nectaries function in pollination as well as defense. Constitutive nectar production at the bracteal nectaries exceeds foliar nectar secretion by a factor of between 80 and 110. Whereas nectar production at foliar nectaries is induced following herbivore damage to leaves, bracteal nectar production is not induced in response to fruit damage and even decreases when the fruiting structure is subjected to herbivory. This shows that both an inducible and a constitutive variant of an indirect defense can occur within one plant species. This pattern of nectar allocation fits the optimal defense theory, which predicts high levels of constitutive defenses in valuable tissues such as fruits and induced defenses in less valuable tissues such as leaves. This result lends support to the interpretation that indirect defense has been a selective force in the evolution of bracteal nectaries. Although optimal defense theory has described direct defense allocation solely in terms of probability of attack and value of the plant structure, we argue that herbivore accessibility is an additional factor shaping the allocation of indirect defenses.",Bracteal nectar | Cotton | Extrafloral nectar | Foliar nectar | Gossypium hirsutum | Herbivore refuge | Indirect defense | Multiple functions | Nectar allocation | Optimal defense theory | Pollination,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

The indoor experiments show that food and temperature modulate the actual depth at which the animals stop migrating, whereas fish and ultraviolet radiation likely determine the timing of migration (its synchronization with dawn and dusk).

Later temperature fluctuations correlated with changes in spruce forest composition until 11 600 yr BP, when evidence for a shift to warm, dry conditions agrees with the replacement of spruce by pine (Pinus spp.) populations. Raised lake levels indicate increased moisture availability by 8200 yr BP when mesic hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and beech (Fagus grandifolia) populations replaced the dry-tolerant pines. Cooler-than-modern temperatures, however, persisted until 6000 yr BP and appear to have limited the expansion of hickory (Carya spp.) populations. Similarly, moisture-dependent chestnut (Castanea dentata) populations did not increase until ∼3000 yr BP, when moisture availability rose to modern levels. Pathogens played a key role in a dramatic decline in hemlock populations around 5400 yr BP, but the decline also corresponds with low lake levels indicating that moisture availability may have been a factor in the decline and recovery. Our analysis, therefore, demonstrates that changes in both the abundance of existing taxa and the arrival of new taxa closely correlate with independently documented changes in climate.

To determine whether aboveground competition and facilitation influence the ability of an annual forb, Atriplex patula var. hastata, to compensate for herbivory, I performed a field experiment in which the presence of insect herbivores and plant neighbors were manipulated in a factorial design.

In cleared treatments, herbivory reduced survival by almost 50% and reproduction by 37%. In contrast herbivory had no significant effects on plant survival or reproductive output in buffered treatments. Thus, facilitation through soil shading increased plant compensation for herbivory. However, herbivores also strongly reduced fruit production (45%) in vegetated treatments, suggesting that competition magnifies herbivore impacts.

Recent experimental studies, however, provide mixed support for this historical view. To test the plant-stress hypothesis (PSH), we employed two methods (the traditional vote-counting approach and meta-analysis) to assess published studies that investigated insect responses to experimentally induced water-deficit in plants. For insects, we examined how water deficit affects survivorship, fecundity, density, relative growth rate, and oviposition preference. Responses were analyzed by major feeding guild (sap-feeding insects and chewing insects) and for the subguilds of sap-feeders (phloem, mesophyll, and xylem feeders) and chewing insects (free-living chewers, borers, leaf miners, and gall-formers). Both vote counting and meta-analysis found strong negative effects of water stress on the performance of sap-feeding insects at large and on members of the phloem- and mesophyll-feeding subguilds in particular. Both analytical techniques demonstrated a nonsignificant response for chewing insects at large due to the offsetting effects of water stress on the different subguilds. For example, our analyses found consistent positive responses for borers, negative responses for gall-formers, and inconsistent responses for free-living species and leaf miners. Overall, our analyses strongly challenge the historical view that herbivorous insects exhibit elevated performance and outbreak dynamics on water-stressed plants. Rather, there is widespread evidence that many phytophagous insects, especially sap-feeders, are adversely affected by continuous water stress. Despite enhanced foliar nitrogen during times of plant stress, concurrent reductions in turgor and water content interfere with an herbivore's ability to access or utilize nitrogen. To explain the discrepancy between the observed outbreaks of phytophagous insects on water-stressed plants in nature and the negative effects detected in many experimental studies where plants are continuously stressed, we propose a ""pulsed stress hypothesis"" whereby bouts of stress and the recovery of turgor allow sap-feeders to benefit from stress-induced increases in plant nitrogen. Our finding that phloem-feeding insects respond positively on intermittently stressed plants but exhibit poor performance on continuously stressed ones is consistent with this hypothesis and suggests that the phenology of water stress as it mediates nitrogen availability may hold the key to understanding how water stress affects the population dynamics of insect herbivores.",Feeding guild | Meta-analysis | Outbreak dynamics | Phytophagous insects | Plant-stress hypothesis | Stress-induced plant physiology | Turgor pressure | Vote-counting analysis | Water-stressed plants,NA,NA,NA,NA

We characterized the temporal and spatial properties of fire regimes in ponderosa pine forests of the southern San Juan Mountains of southwestern Colorado by collecting 175 fire-scarred tree samples from nine sites across a wide range of topographic settings. All tree rings and fire scars were dated using standard dendrochronological techniques. Fire-free intervals were statistically modeled using the Weibull distribution to provide quantitative measures that characterized the historical range of variation in pre-EuroAmerican fire regimes. Fires during our reference period were more frequent in the low elevation ponderosa pine forests (6-10 yr) than in the high elevation, mixed conifer forests (18-28 yr). Fires at lower elevations were predominantly low-severity, isolated fires. Fires during some years (e.g., 1748) were spatially extensive throughout the entire mountain range. Intervals that delimited significantly long fire-free periods ranged from 10-19 yr (low elevation) to 27-50 yr (high elevation). Fire histories were similar between the eastern and western portions of the mountain range, although we found significant evidence of topographic isolation on fire regimes at one site. Pre-1880 fires primarily occurred in the dormant season, and we found no temporal changes in past fire seasonality. We found no compelling evidence that Native Americans influenced fire regimes in our study sites. We found a hiatus in fire occurrence between 1750 and 1770 that we believe was likely related to weakened El Niño-Southern Oscillation activity, an extended series of cool-phase Pacific Decadal Oscillation events, and weakened monsoonal moisture, all possibly entrained in an invasive air mass typical of locations that are more northerly. In addition, pre-1880 fires occurred during years of severe drought, conditioned by above average moisture conditions in preceding years. The 20th century is characterized by a near complete absence of fires (fire-free interval of >100 yr), suggesting future wildfires may be more widespread and ecologically severe compared to pre-1880 fires.","Climate-fire interactions | Dendrochronology | Disturbances, human | Fire history | Fire regimes | Mixed conifer | Ponderosa pine | San Juan Mountains, Colorado, USA",NA,NA,NA,NA

Water supply to leaves depends on maintaining an intact water column in the xylem from the roots to shoots. Because this hydraulic pathway is under tension, it is vulnerable to breakage through the induction of air emboli (cavitation). Although the physiological benefit of resistance to water-stress-induced xylem cavitation for desiccation tolerance is clear, there is considerable interspecific variation within and across climates. To understand the adaptive significance of this variation and the potential trade-off with water transport, we compiled a database of 167 species from 50 seed plant families and examined relationships among resistance to xylem cavitation, water transport capacity (as determined by the specific conductivity of xylem [Ks]), and climate. Relationships were evaluated using standard cross-species correlations (r). Because inferences about the adaptive significance of these correlations can be biased by the potential similarity of closely related species, we also analyzed our data using phylogenetically independent contrast correlations (PIC) calculated over a range of alternate seed plant phylogenies. Resistance to cavitation, expressed as the xylem tension at which 50% of hydraulic conductivity was lost (Ψ50), ranged from -0.18 to -9.9 MPa for angiosperms and from -1.5 to -14.1 MPa for conifers. Conifers were most resistant to cavitation, with mean Ψ50 80% more negative than angiosperms. In contrast, K s was 270% higher in angiosperms than conifers. Across all species, cavitation resistance increased with decreasing mean annual precipitation. However, significant phylogenetically independent contrast correlations between Ψ50 and annual precipitation were found within the evergreen angiosperms and conifers but not in the deciduous angiosperms. Thus, the adaptive significance of increased resistance to cavitation as a mechanism of drought tolerance may be of primary importance in evergreen angiosperms and conifers. In contrast, analysis of independent contrasts indicated that K s increased with decreasing rainfall in deciduous angiosperms, whereas there was no association between Ks and water availability for evergreen angiosperms and conifers. These results suggest that the evolution of increased Ks may be a critical adaptation to water limitation in deciduous angiosperms. Although there was a significant cross-species correlation between Ψ50 and Ks, this relationship, was not supported by the independent contrast correlation, suggesting that the evolutionary basis for a trade-off between cavitation resistance and water transport capacity is weak.",Adaptation | Climate | Correlated evolution | Hydraulic conductivity | Independent contrasts | Potential evapotranspiration | Precipitation | Temperature | Vegetation | Water-stress-induced xylem cavitation,NA,NA,NA,NA

The apparent underlying mechanism is a greater provisioning of larvae with energy-rich triacylglycerol (TAG) lipids as female age increases. The volume of the oil globule (composed primarily of TAG) present in larvae at parturition increases with maternal age and is correlated with subsequent growth and survival.

Planktonic cyprid larvae were sampled with pumps while suspended panels were used to measure initial contact (grease-coated panels), settlement (5-d immersion), and recruitment (30-d immersion). Larval supply varied with coastal-scale upwelling but was uncorrelated to local flow speed. Settlement rate was highly correlated to contact rate, and the proportion of settling larvae increased with established recruit density. In contrast to model predictions, contact rate was negatively correlated with local flow speed, which explained 33% of total variation. This correlation was maintained through settlement and recruitment suggesting that flow-mediated initial contact is an important link between larval supply and recruitment. No evidence from field studies indicated behavioral responses by larvae to flow although observations in a laboratory flume suggested active rejection of potential settlement sites at increasing flow speeds. It is suggested that initial adhesion is limited by flow speed through drag and lift forces acting on larvae.

These pannes are physically harsh habitats where stress-tolerant forbs escape the competitively dominant clonal turfs. In this paper, we experimentally examine the hypothesis that soil waterlogging maintains forb pannes. Experimentally draining pannes led to the replacement of typical panne vegetation by Spartina patens. After four years, S. patens cover increased by greater than 300% in the drained plots, while in adjacent, unmanipulated controls, its cover remained unchanged. In a second experiment, forb panne elevation was manipulated to either increase or decrease soil drainage. After three years elevated plots were dominated by S. patens, whereas lowered plots were dominated by Spartina alterniflora, with reduced forb densities. Our results demonstrate that forb panne communities are the consequence of poor drainage and waterlogged soils that limit the success of competitively dominant clonal turfs and permit the persistence of panne forbs.

We found that asymmetric specialization is common in plant-pollinator interactions, and that its occurrence is more frequent than expected under a simple null model that assumed random interactions among species; furthermore, large assemblages with many pairs of interacting species tend to have more asymmetric interactions than smaller assemblages. A second null model, which incorporated a correlation between species frequency of interaction and degree of specialization observed in most data sets produced patterns that were generally closer to those present in the data.

Commonly, the relative use of each resource is quantified as the number of observations in each resource class or the proportional occurrence of a resource within a home range. We believe that a more accurate estimate can be summarized by a utilization distribution (UD). We present an analytical approach that explicitly incorporates a probabilistic measure of use, as defined by the UD. We used animal relocation points and fixed-kernel techniques to determine a UD within a home range. We related this probabilistic measure of use to categorical and continuous resource variables using multiple regression. Regression errors accounted for spatial autocorrelation so that the significance of regression coefficients could be appraised for each animal and averaged across animals. This allowed us to quantify the individualistic nature of resource selection and test for consistency in use of resources by a population. Sample sizes in population assessments correctly reflected the individual animal as the experimental unit. We used this technique in a geographic information system setting to examine the importance of local-scale (forest cover) and landscape-scale (degree of fragmentation, proximity to edges and human use areas) attributes to breeding season habitat selection by 25 radio-tagged Steller's Jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) in western Washington State, USA. Individual jays varied significantly in habitat use, but most (20) concentrated their use in areas with many vegetation patches or in areas with extensive edge between forest and nonforested land cover. This confirmed our prediction that jays prefer fragmented habitat and forest edges and helped to explain why jays are most abundant in fragmented landscapes. However, we refined our understanding of why they used such habitats by demonstrating that landscape attributes affected use of local habitat features: high-contrast edges were used most if they were associated with small human settlements and campgrounds. Use of patchy and edgy areas within home ranges may be reinforced by natural selection because jays that inhabited areas with complex-shaped patches and concentrated their activity in such areas were most likely to fledge young.

For benthic herbivores, chemical cues from macroalgae can strongly influence both larval settlement/metamorphosis and subsequent performance. We compared the effects of chemical cues from host algae on different life history stages of the ""arboreal"" sea urchin Holopneustes purpurascens. In sublittoral habitats near Sydney, Australia, H. purpurascens occurred primarily on two algal hosts: red alga (Delisea pulchra) and kelp (Ecklonia radiata). Urchins on E. radiata were significantly larger than those on D. pulchra, but no recruits occurred on E. radiata. In experiments, larvae rapidly metamorphosed in the presence of D. pulchra, but metamorphosis was delayed or nonexistent in the presence of E. radiata. D. pulchra produces a polar chemical inducer of metamorphosis not found in E. radiata. In contrast to larval metamorphosis, feeding and performance of juvenile and adult urchins were considerably worse on D. pulchra than on E. radiata. Feeding experiments confirmed that nonpolar metabolites (halogenated furanones) in D. pulchra deter feeding. Adding natural concentrations of the most abundant furanone to otherwise palatable diets completely inhibited feeding. Urchins fed D. pulchra had reduced survival, growth, and reproduction compared to those fed E. radiata. H. purpurascens did not thrive on the alga on which they preferentially settled; therefore, postrecruitment movement from D. pulchra to E. radiata was crucial to fitness. Urchins in D. pulchra beds moved between plants at night and preferred E. radiata in habitat preference experiments. Movement was constrained by diurnal predators, particularly damselfish Parma microlepis. When H. purpurascens was removed from their algal hosts during the day (but not at night), P. microlepis ""clipped"" their spines and tube feet. Removal of 10% of an urchin's spines and tube feet was fatal. H. purpurascens recruits onto a host that does not support persistence of the benthic phase and then shifts host plants, incurring a predation risk.

Thus, we quantified available habitat, perch use, and the undisturbed locomotor behavior of four syntopic ecomorphs of Anolis lizards (A. sagrei, A. distichus, A. carolinensis, and A. angusticeps) in the field. Fifty percent of the cumulative perch length available in the habitat had values of diameter, length, and incline <0.8 cm, 54 cm, and 67°, respectively, indicating that narrow, short, and steep perches dominated the study site. The selection of all perch attributes by A. distichus was biased, whereas each of the remaining species randomly used at least one of the three attributes describing perch structure. Narrow breadth of resource use most often reflected the narrow breadth of available resources rather than selective use of resources. Interestingly, the behavioral and morphological specializations of A. angusticeps facilitate the use of the most common type of perch (twig) rather than a rare resource.

Plant uptake and cycling transport these heavier elements to the soil surface, resulting in shallower vertical distributions for strongly cycled elements than for other elements. In this paper, we evaluate the biogeochemical consequences of this process at different spatial and temporal scales based on chronosequence studies and soil database analyses. In the bare coastal dunes of Argentina, the vertical distributions of exchangeable K+ (strongly cycled) and Na+ (more weakly cycled) were similar initially but diverged 15 years after pine afforestation, with K distributions becoming significantly concentrated in the surface and Na distributions becoming deeper. To evaluate the effects of plant stoichiometry on micronutrient distributions, chronosequences of paired native grasslands (low Mn cycling) and eucalypt plantations (high Mn cycling) in the pampas of Argentina were also used. Within 50 years, eucalypts dramatically redistributed Mn pools toward the soil surface, reducing total pools by half at medium depths (20-60 cm) and increasing concentrations by up to an order of magnitude at the surface. Globally, we used generalized contrasts among exchangeable K, Na, and Mg in 7661 soil profiles to estimate the global magnitude of K uplift due to plant activity. Based on this calculation, the exchangeable K pool in the top 20 cm of soils without plant uplift would be 4-6 × 1015 g smaller globally, one-third to one-half smaller than its current size. Vegetation change alters the vertical distribution and bioavailability of mineral elements.

However, some plants, particularly those with few chemical defenses, may actually become more susceptible to herbivores following damage; that is, damage may induce susceptibility. We tested the hypothesis that a fungal symbiont of tall fescue grass provides induced resistance to aphids by manipulating fungal infection, plant damage (clipping), and level of nutrient fertilizer in greenhouse/laboratory experiments. The fungus had a negative effect on aphid reproduction that was most pronounced following damage. This result appears to be caused by elevated levels of alkaloids produced by the fungus after damage. Furthermore, plants lacking fungal infection were more susceptible to aphids following damage. Hence, while plant damage induces susceptibility in uninfected plants, it does the opposite (induced resistance) in infected plants. Additional experiments showed that the reversal of induced susceptibility is influenced by intrinsic (fungal strain) as well as extrinsic (nutrient application to plants) factors. We also found that the induced resistance conferred by the fungus comes at the cost of tolerance (reduced regrowth) in infected plants. As a modulator of both resistance and tolerance, the fungus plays a central role in influencing defense of host plants against herbivores and should have important implications for plant-herbivore interactions in natural and agricultural systems.",Alkaloids | Aphid | Constitutive resistance | Endophyte | Festuca | Fungi | Induced resistance | Neotyphodium | Plant defense | Plant-insect interaction | Rhopalosiphum | Simulated herbivory,NA,NA,NA,NA

This species is known from only six small populations that are highly differentiated genetically. Matrix models based on eight years of data (1994-2001) were used to assess the pattern of variation in the demographic vital rates of this species, and to investigate the causes of their variation. Asymptotic growth rates λ varied widely between years and populations (0.613-1.424). Randomization tests were developed to test for spatial and temporal variation in the asymptotic growth rates. These tests rely on individual data on both survival and fecundity. As our demographic survey only allowed us to estimate average fecundities, additional fecundity data collected from 1994 to 1996 were used to assess the distribution of individual fecundity expected within populations under demographic stochasticity or sampling error. Randomization tests showed that asymptotic growth rates were significantly different between populations and between years in C. corymbosa. In contrast, log-linear analysis performed only on transition data (i.e., excluding fecundity) suggested that the observed variations in transition probabilities were mostly explained by sampling error or demographic stochasticity rather than environmental stochasticity. This suggested that variations in fecundity among populations and among years may play a key role to explain temporal and spatial differences in λ. Life-table response experiment analysis revealed that variations in fecundity and especially in the number of just-emerged seedlings per plant explained most of the observed variance in λ. Spatial and temporal variations were detected for most lower-level vital rates, but causal factors that may account for these patterns are still unknown: no effect of genetic diversity was detected on the dynamics of the species, and correlation between lower-level vital rates and climatic data did not reveal any clear trends. Our study emphasizes the need to conduct long-term demographic surveys and to collect individual fecundity data to get more insights into the causes of variation of the demographic behavior of C. corymbosa.",Centaurea corymbosa | Environmental stochasticity | Individual fecundity data | LTRE analysis | Matrix population models | Randomization tests,NA,NA,NA,NA

Theoretical models suggest that variation in resistance to herbivores may persist if resistance is costly and herbivore damage is variable. If so, then natural selection should favor resistant plants when damage is high and disfavor it when damage is low. However, without long-term equivalence between costs and benefits, then natural selection either should drive the trait to fixation if it has a net benefit or eliminate it if it has a net cost. Previously we showed that the production of glandular trichomes carried a net cost in short-term studies, suggesting that this expensive resistant trait might be eliminated from D. wrightii populations. To test this hypothesis we monitored survival and seed production of sticky and velvety D. wrightii in the presence of herbivores in 11 natural populations over four or five years. In eight populations where both types occurred, the finite rate of increase for velvety plants was 60-274% greater than for sticky plants. Plant survival averaged between two and three years and did not differ significantly between types. Because seed production consistently favored velvety plants, our prediction that the proportion of sticky plants should decline was met within five years in seven of those eight populations.

Parasitism rates declined exponentially with increasing distance from floral patches, reaching zero beyond 14 m. Increased potential fecundity reduces the chances of parasitoids becoming egg-limited, whereas increased longevity reduces the chances of parasitoids becoming time-limited during host oviposition.

Small-mammal distribution and abundance may then influence tree population dynamics through variation in seed predation and seedling establishment. To determine if small-mammal activity patterns, seed survival, and seedling recruitment varied with neighborhood structure, we designed a study conducted at two habitat levels: canopy-tree neighborhoods, which reflected variation in seed production, and understory neighborhoods, which reflected differences in protective cover and interactions among animals. We live-trapped small mammals during the summer and fall of 1995 and 1996, experimentally measured seed survival in the falls of 1995 and 1996, and quantified total tree seedling recruitment in the spring of 1997.

Small-mammal activity patterns changed between 1995 and 1996 in response to seed production. Canopy tree neighborhoods were a good predictor of overall small-mammal activity, and neighborhoods with high small-mammal activity had low seed survival. The canopy-tree neighborhoods with sufficient seed rain and high seed survival displayed increased seedling recruitment. Understory structure was a poor predictor of seed survival and seedling recruitment but appeared to be the primary axis along which habitat partitioning among mammal species took place when population densities were low.

Using chronology statistics and response functions, we tested the consistency of climate-growth responses in tree-ring series from Larix decidua and Pinus cembra trees of four age classes. Tree-ring statistics (mean sensitivity, standard deviation, correlation between trees, and first principal component) did not change significantly with age in P. cembra, whereas in L. decidua they appeared to be correlated with age classes. Response function analysis indicated that climate accounts for a high amount of variance in tree-ring widths in both species. The older the trees are, the higher the variance explained by climate, the significance of the models, and the percentage of trees with significant responses. Age influence on climate sensitivity is likely to be non-monotonic. In L. decidua, the most important response function variables changed with age according to a twofold pattern: increasing for trees younger than 200 years and decreasing or constant for older trees. A similar pattern was observed in both species for the relationship between tree height and age. It is hypothesized that an endogenous parameter linked to hydraulic status becomes increasingly limiting as trees grow and age, inducing more stressful conditions and a higher climate sensitivity in older individuals. The results of this study confirm that the climate signal is maximized in older trees, but also that a sampling procedure non-stratified by age (especially in multi-aged forests) could lead to biased mean chronologies due to the higher amount of noise present in younger trees.

During the 50-d experiment, leaf decomposition was not affected by the presence of crayfish, whereas fine sediment was reduced to similar extents in both crayfish treatments. Some invertebrates followed a similar pattern to that of sediment accrual, suggesting that removal of fine sediment by crayfish was a primary mechanism underlying differences in invertebrate densities. Medium (4-6 mm body length) and large (≥7 mm) Tanypodinae were rare in crayfish treatments, probably as a result of selective predation. Conversely, crayfish appeared to facilitate Deleatidium mayflies, as predicted by a trophic cascade (large Tanypodinae predator removal) or shredder-collector facilitation (fine particulate organic matter production). In many cases, the response of dependent variables was equally strong at both crayfish densities. In a sediment flush experiment, sediment removal treatments were established, along with no-crayfish control and crayfish treatments, to assess the relative impacts of predation and sediment removal on each invertebrate taxon. Crayfish had little impact on leaf decomposition, although decomposition rate was significantly faster than in sediment flush treatments, where collector-scraper invertebrates were reduced as a result of sediment removal. Despite the fact that fine sediment was similarly reduced in crayfish and flush treatments, the response of invertebrates to treatments differed according to invertebrate taxon and size class. Overall, large Tanypodinae were selectively preyed upon; Orthocladiinae, Oribatei, and Oligochaeta responded primarily to sediment removal; Deleatidium were indirectly facilitated; and Chironominae, Ostracoda, and Cyclopoida were relatively unaffected.

We compared the rewards offered by trees experimentally protected from mammalian browsing for seven years with those offered by unprotected trees. Protected trees produced 25% fewer nectaries per leaf and 25% fewer swollen thorns than did trees in browsed plots. Relaxation of indirect defenses when trees are protected from herbivores is consistent with the dual hypotheses that inducible defenses are dynamic and that plants can save costs by relaxing these defenses when they are not needed.

Various studies suggest that several species of native ladybird beetles (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) have declined in abundance in particular habitats (especially crops) and/or geographic regions following the colonization of North America by the seven-spotted ladybird beetle (Coccinella septempunctata L.). However, the factors responsible for such declines are unclear. Long-term sampling of alfalfa fields in northern Utah revealed that as C. septempunctata established itself and increased in numbers, densities of native species decreased significantly over the period 1992-2001. The decline in numbers of native ladybirds mirrored a decline in numbers of their principal prey in alfalfa, pea aphids. Field experiments with induced aphid outbreaks were conducted to test the hypothesis that dispersing native adults have shifted their foraging efforts away from alfalfa as the introduced species has increased in numbers and depressed prey availability. As predicted by the hypothesis, native ladybirds rapidly reaccumulated in alfalfa when prey became abundant. Their presence was brief, however, as they and especially the more numerous C. septempunctata quickly suppressed experimental aphid outbreaks. The ratio of densities within experimental plots with high aphid numbers to densities in the surrounding field was greater for native ladybirds than for C. septempunctata. Also, densities of native ladybirds varied more closely with aphid densities among fields in late May 2001 than did densities of C. septempunctata. Hence, native ladybirds appear especially responsive to local aphid density. C. septempunctata's impact on aphid density in alfalfa appears to have reduced significantly the degree to which the habitat retains foraging native adults. Thus, introduced species may influence the distribution and abundance of native competitors not only by reducing survivorship in local habitats, but also by altering the dynamics of dispersal and habitat use across the landscape.",Aggregation | Coccinella septempunctata | Coccinellidae | Competition | Dispersal | Exotic species | Habitat selection | Invasion | Predation,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this epidemiological experiment, we exposed infected and uninfected Daphnia magna populations, which had been kept for many generations under a constant high food supply, to reduced food resources. Using the microsporidian gut parasite Glugoides intestinalis, which is exclusively horizontally transmitted, we tracked changes in parasite and host population size as well as host body length to elucidate how food shortages for the hosts influence host and parasite population dynamics. In both infected and uninfected populations, food shortage led to an approximately equal reduction in host density and changes in host body length distribution. Large hosts suffered a higher mortality than smaller hosts, which significantly reduced the mean body length in the host populations; however, this change was stronger in the infected populations and went hand-in-hand with a reduction in parasite spore load (a measure of intensity of infection) and prevalence. This effect disappeared after six weeks of food shortage, when the populations reached a new equilibrium.

Different choice of transformation, standardization, and distance measure were considered. For 19 data sets taken from the literature, P values for the different statistics were compared. Power simulations were then conducted, where data were generated to mimic the properties of each of the 19 data sets. For transformed data, using different distance measures (Euclidean, Manhattan, Bray-Curtis) and different distance-based statistics had little effect on power. Overall, statistics based on multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) were at least as powerful as others, although particular data sets gave different results. The distance-based statistics most commonly used in the literature do not standardize abundances, so these were more powerful when effects are present in taxa that are more variable (on the transformed scale), and less powerful otherwise. There are several reasons to prefer a statistic based on MANOVA to others (e.g., interpretability, generalization to more complex designs), and so we generally recommend that the MANOVA-based statistics used here be preferred to distance-based statistics.","Community composition data | Empirical power comparison | Hypothesis tests | MANOVA | Multivariate analysis | Permutation test | Randomization test | Statistical methods, comparisons | With permutation tests",NA,NA,NA,NA

Observed population sizes across all patches were compared to the expectation that, if variance in parameters had no effect, population size should equal the sum of the carrying capacities of all plants. Results showed that variance in K alone, or in r and K together, strongly affected herbivore population size; increasing variance led to progressively stronger effects. The direction of the deviation of herbivore population size from the expectation in the absence of variance could be positive, negative, or both for different combinations of variance in r and K. Increasing skew also increased the deviation of observed population sizes from the expectation. Herbivore mobility increased the effect of variance in patch (plant) quality, whereas herbivore selectivity decreased the effects of variance by decreasing herbivore movement.

We mapped the 357 S. quadrinervis adults (≥15 cm dbh) in 75 ha at Gunung Palung National Park, Indonesian Borneo, and compared the dynamics of juveniles <1 cm dbh between eight areas (80 m diameter plots) with high densities of conspecific adults and eight containing low densities.

Plots with high and low density of S. quadrinervis adults did not differ in understory light, slope, aspect, or soil properties nor in the total density (all species combined) of either adults or juveniles. We evaluated four kinds of evidence. All were consistent with the hypothesis of negatively density-dependent population dynamics: (I) Density and size: Although the density of juveniles <25 cm tall per capita adult increased with local adult density, the pattern reversed for juveniles >75 cm tall. This suggests positive density-dependent seedling recruitment followed by negative density-dependent juvenile dynamics. (2) Foliar condition: Juveniles had more leaves per unit height where adult density was low. Growth and survival increased more with leaf number than with height. (3) Juvenile dynamics: Growth and survival were higher where adult density was low. Previous work suggests that herbivores may drive this negative density dependence in juvenile performance. (4) Population dynamics: We modeled population growth rate (λ) for each of the 16 areas using separate matrix models parameterized with empirical juvenile transition rates. We found that λ declined with local adult density (r2 = 0.40), and this trend was robust to the inclusion of El Niño conditions.

For autotrophs nutrient limitation means less fixation of inorganic C or excretion of organic C, while for heterotrophs nutrient limitation means that more of ingested C will ""go to waste"" in the form of egestion or respiration. There is in general a mismatch between autotrophs and decomposers that have flexible but generally high C:element ratios, and consumers that have lower C:element ratios and tighter stoichiometric regulation. Thus, C-use efficiency in food webs may be governed by the element ratios in autotroph biomass and tend to increase when C:element ratios in food approach those of consumers. This tendency has a strong bearing on the sequestration of C in ecosystems, since more C will be diverted to detritus entering soils or sediments when C-use efficiency is low due to stoichiometric imbalance. There will be a strong evolutionary pressure to utilize such excess C for structural and metabolic purposes.

We tested experimentally the enemy-release hypothesis with the invasive neotropical shrub Clidemia hirta (L.) D. Don (Melastomataceae). Clidemia hirta does not occur in forest in its native range but is a vigorous invader of tropical forest in its introduced range. Therefore, we tested the specific prediction that release from natural enemies has contributed to its expanded habitat distribution. We planted C. hirta into understory and open habitats where it is native (Costa Rica) and where it has been introduced (Hawaii) and applied pesticides to examine the effects of fungal pathogen and insect herbivore exclusion. In understory sites in Costa Rica, C. hirta survival increased by 12% if sprayed with insecticide, 19% with fungicide, and 41% with both insecticide and fungicide compared to control plants sprayed only with water. Exclusion of natural enemies had no effect on survival in open sites in Costa Rica or in either habitat in Hawaii. Fungicide application promoted relative growth rates of plants that survived to the end of the experiment in both habitats of Costa Rica but not in Hawaii, suggesting that fungal pathogens only limit growth of C. hirta where it is native. Galls, stem borers, weevils, and leaf rollers were prevalent in Costa Rica but absent in Hawaii. In addition, the standing percentage of leaf area missing on plants in the control (water only) treatment was five times greater on plants in Costa Rica than in Hawaii and did not differ between habitats. The results from this study suggest that significant effects of herbivores and fungal pathogens may be limited to particular habitats. For Clidemia hirta, its absence from forest understory in its native range likely results in part from the strong pressures of natural enemies.

Although competitive interactions between invasive and native species are considered among the most important mechanisms driving invasion dynamics, such interactions are in general poorly understood. The European honey bee (Apis mellifera) is a widespread and economically important invader long suspected to competitively suppress many native bee species. Yet the extent to which this introduced species alters native communities remains controversial, reflecting ongoing debate over the importance of resource competition in regulating pollinator populations. I experimentally tested the effects of competition with Apis on colony foraging behavior and reproductive success of a native eusocial bee, Bombus occidentalis Greene, in coastal California. B. occidentalis colonies located near experimentally introduced Apis hives had lower mean rates of forager return and a lower ratio of foraging trips for pollen relative to nectar. Both male and female reproductive success of B. occidentalis were also reduced with greater proximity to introduced Apis hives. Reproductive success correlated significantly with measures of colony foraging behavior, most strongly with the relative allocation of foraging effort to pollen collection. This pattern suggests that B. occidentalis colonies exposed to competition with Apis experienced increased nectar scarcity and responded by reallocating foragers from pollen to nectar collection, resulting in lowered rates of larval production. These results provide evidence that Apis competitively suppresses a native social bee known to be an important pollinator, with the potential for cascading effects on native plant communities. This work also contributes to a greater understanding of the role competitive interactions play in pollinator communities, particularly for social bees.",Apis mellifera | Biological invasion | Bumble bee | Colony | Competition | Pollinators | Reproductive success,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hitherto, comparative demography based on matrix models has relied upon decomposing elasticity matrices into blocks, each containing matrix elements deemed to represent recruitment, stasis, or progression to larger size classes. Elasticities across an entire matrix always sum to unity, and different populations and species can be compared on the basis of the relative proportions of these three variables. This method has been widely used, but it contains a weakness in that the value of matrix elements is a function of more than one vital rate. For example, transitions representing progression to larger size classes involve a survival rate as well as a growth rate. Ideally, then, demographic comparisons between populations should be made using elasticities of vital rates themselves, rather than elasticities of matrix elements that are compounds of those rates. Here, we employ the complete set of general equations for the elasticity of vital rates in an entirely new analysis of matrices for 102 species of perennial plants. The results show a surprising similarity to an earlier analysis based upon matrix element elasticity and provide important confirmation of general patterns of correlation between plant life history and demography. In addition, we show that individual vital rate elasticities cannot, on their own, predict variation in life history. Therefore, all three demographic processes (survival, growth, and reproduction) are necessary to account for life history variation.

Inbreeding reduced population-level tolerance to spittlebug herbivory with respect to plant aboveground biomass. Inbreeding effects on tolerance varied significantly among plant families for three fitness traits, indicating the opportunity for selection by herbivores to improve tolerance in inbreeding populations. These results also indicate that herbivores can alter inbreeding depression in plants.

We found such nocturnal foraging to be as profitable as diurnal foraging, and guppies under threat incurred a substantial growth penalty when predators inhibited night feeding. Denial of night feeding also decreased daytime courtship by males, facultatively duplicating a classical observation comparing courtship intensity in contrasting predator regimes, but providing a novel mechanism for the effect. Our findings support the view that evaluations of predator effects on life histories should consider potential predator-caused alterations in size-specific energetic gain, along with the classical consideration of predator-altered mortality rates. The results of this study show that predation threat can induce a large, facultative shift in the temporal niche and vital rates of a prey species.

These underlying mechanisms are defined by the various ways in which species differ in their response to disturbance-induced spatial and temporal variability in resources and environmental conditions. As an example, the original specification of the IDH required patchy disturbances for coexistence. However, because the underlying mechanisms of coexistence can also operate at the within-patch scale, patchy disturbances are not a necessary requirement for coexistence under intermediate-disturbance regimes. These conclusions are illustrated through the analysis of three models: a spatial within-patch model, a spatial between-patch model, and a purely temporal model. All three generate similar patterns of coexistence under intermediate disturbance, yet underlying that coexistence lie at least two quite-distinct mechanisms of species coexistence: the storage effect and relative nonlinearity. The results from our analyses suggest that, as a promoter of species coexistence, the IDH is both broader in scope and richer in detail than has previously been recognized.","Coexistence, mechanisms of | Environmental variability | Intermediate disturbance hypothesis | Nonlinearity, relative | Patch dynamics | Reciprocal-yield law (RYL) model | Species coexistence, storage effect",NA,NA,NA,NA

The analysis explores the effects of four factors on the range of consumer characteristics that allow coexistence: (1) whether resource growth is biotic or abiotic; (2) the efficiency of the consumers in reducing the resource population; (3) the rapidity of the demographic response of the consumers to changes in resource density; and (4) the period and amplitude of the periodicity in resource growth. Coexistence of two competitors differing greatly in the linearity of their responses is most likely when (1) resource growth is biotic and (2) the consumers are relatively inefficient. The effects on coexistence of the third and fourth factors can be more complicated, particularly when the resource is biotic. However, in most cases coexistence occurs over a wider range of conditions when the linear consumer has a more rapid numerical response than the nonlinear consumer and when the period of environmental fluctuation is much longer than the minimum doubling time of the consumer populations. If the resource is biotic, consumer-resource cycles can be produced by the nonlinear consumer, and environmental cycles may either interfere with or reinforce these, contracting or expanding the conditions allowing coexistence. However, the interaction of endogenous cycles and periodic variation in resource growth generally has highly nonadditive effects on coexistence. These findings help explain why few previous experimental studies have demonstrated coexistence due to the relative nonlinearity of consumer responses.",Chaos | Coexistence | Competition | Consumer-resource model | Functional response | Nonlinearity | Periodic variation,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here I report results of a laboratory microcosm experiment crossing eight algal compositions (seven monocultures and a polyculture of all seven species) with five ciliate herbivore compositions (no herbivores, three monocultures, and a polyculture of all three species). Microcosms allowed comparison of short-, medium-, and long-term (dozens of generations) results. Niche differentiation allowed competing algae to coexist in the absence of herbivores. Surprisingly, algal polycultures produced more biomass than the most productive monocultures only in the medium term. A temporally variable relationship between the productivity of diverse and depauparate algal assemblages might reflect changes in competitive mechanisms over time, and/or transient dynamics, and contrasts with the predictions of simple competition models. Herbivores had little effect on total algal biomass or algal composition, in part because of the lack of a strong trade-off between algal competitive ability and edibility. Increasing algal diversity significantly reduced the biomass of one herbivore, apparently because competition from inedible algae reduced the productivity of edible algae. A negative effect of inedible algae on herbivore biomass accords with simple food web theory and indicates that increasing diversity on one trophic level can have negative consequences for other trophic levels. Herbivores varied little in their abilities to graze different algae. Total algal biomass, algal composition, and total herbivore biomass were independent of herbivore diversity and composition, and algal composition had only minor effects the outcome of competition among herbivores. However, the outcome of herbivore competition was predictably asymmetrical, indicating that herbivores varied in other ways, such as ability to consume alternative food sources (bacteria). Further factorial manipulations of diversity and trophic structure are needed to improve understanding of the likely consequences of species loss in food webs.

Although exposure to ATV is generally lethal, larvae and metamorphs maintained sublethal, transmissible infections for >5 mo. Field data corroborate the persistence of ATV between epidemics in sublethally infected metamorphs. Three-quarters of dispersing metamorphs during one epidemic were infected, and apparently healthy metamorphs returning to breed harbored ATV infections.

Using time series data generated from simulations of populations limited by three commonly used forms of density dependence (ceiling, Beverton-Holt, and Ricker) we asked the question: ""When do simple density-independent PVA models provide useful guidelines for prioritizing extinction risk despite density-dependence inherent in the underlying real populations?"" Simple DA methods severely underestimated maximum growth rates (μmax) used to generate time series data for all three forms of density dependence. These methods also underestimated the intrinsic environmental variability in growth rates, or process error (σ2), for the ceiling model, but overestimated this parameter for the Beverton-Holt and Ricker models.

Although correlations between observed and estimated risks were high, bias (e.g., over- and underestimation) was extensive. Estimated probabilities of 50% declines were typically much lower (overly optimistic) than observed probabilities of the same decline. By contrast, accuracy increased substantially for predictions of 75% decline, and the ""optimistic"" bias was replaced by conservative bias (overestimates of risk). Regardless of the form of density dependence, estimates of risk were least accurate when populations were recovering rapidly but were much more accurate when most needed by conservation practitioners: when the population fluctuated near its carrying capacity, recovered slowly to this abundance level, or declined toward extinction.

The study showed how fur seals adjusted their time budgets to maximize the mean rate of energy intake in response to varying prey abundance. The behavioral indicator of prey abundance was the amount of time spent by fur seals at the bottom of dives after adjustment for dive depth. This indicator was well correlated with independent measures of prey abundance. The indicator was calibrated in terms of net rate of energy intake from information about energy expenditures in Antarctic fur seals and was used within the framework of optimal foraging theory to examine how female fur seals organized their foraging activity within and between bouts. Foraging in Antarctic fur seals conformed to many of the predictions from energy rate-maximizing behavior. For example, the apparent net rate of energy intake by fur seals declined with time spent in a patch, and the rate of energy intake on leaving a patch declined as apparent food availability in the environment declined. In addition, the time spent in patches increased as apparent food availability declined. Antarctic fur seals were able to adjust their behavior to track highly variable prey distributions and densities. The simple decision about when to leave a patch in relation to current environmental prey availability appears to be responsible for allowing fur seals to maintain saturation of the foraging rate as food density declines.",Antarctic fur seals | Arctocephalus gazella | Behavioral index | Food availability | Functional response | Optimal foraging | Patch use | Rate maximization | South Georgia,NA,NA,NA,NA

Different vital rates responded to the increase in density at different rates, causing long-term changes to the demographic and spatial structure of the population. These changes altered the impact of different age- and sex-specific vital rates on annual changes in population size.

First, we established the relationship between territory size and the canopy-tree foliage density. We then utilized the relationship between foliage density and foliage arthropod density (in particular, Lepidoptera larvae) to evaluate whether an inverse correlation between food density and territory size existed and to examine the proximate cues that Red-eyed Vireos used to adjust territory size. Foliage density in a habitat patch was used by Red-eyed Vireos as a proximate cue to set the size of a three-dimensional territory volume that ultimately corresponded to the ""average"" caterpillar density on those trees during the nestling stage. Territory volumes were smaller where foliage density was greater. Two measures of competitor density were not inversely correlated with territory size. These results support the structural-cues hypothesis for a species that forages in the structurally complex foliage of deciduous forests, and they are consistent with the food-value theory of territoriality. Caterpillar density varied widely over the course of the breeding season, among locations and among tree species, reaching a low during the nestling stage of the breeding cycle. Yet, the total territory volume utilized by Red-eyed Vireos was inversely related to the density of caterpillars during this stage (i.e., when they would be needed as a food source to provision young), consistent with the food-value theory. Food availability at the time of territory selection was not a reliable cue for future food resources because of spatial and temporal variability in caterpillar density. Instead, a stable structural cue, foliage density, was highly predictive of caterpillar density during the nestling stage of an average, or typical, year. This study suggests that Red-eyed Vireos can reliably secure food resources for nestlings at the time of territory establishment, using foliage density as a cue.",Breeding biology | Caterpillars | Deciduous forest arthropods | Foliage density | Habitat selection | Lepidoptera | Neotropical migrant birds | Proximate vs. ultimate factors | Red-eyed Vireo | Territory | Timing of breeding | Vireo olivaceus,NA,NA,NA,NA

While Reid couched his paradox in terms of the migration of oaks in Great Britain, observers have documented the same problem in a wide variety of species. In almost all cases, these authors suggest that occasional, long-distance events, probably mitigated by active dispersal factors (ants, birds, rodents) are responsible. Clark and co-workers have shown that order statistics can bridge the gap between theory and predictions, essentially using ""fat- tailed"" dispersal kernels raised to high powers corresponding to rare, distant dispersal events. However, the spatial caching structure induced by most active dispersers has not been specifically examined. In this paper we develop a complementary approach to order statistics, based on the theory of homogenization, to describe the long-distance dispersal probabilities of seeds. The homogenization approach includes the spatial structure of active dispersal explicitly, and generates a corrective factor to current estimates of migration rates. This corrective factor is the ""caching scale ratio,"" the ratio of mean scatter-hoard size to mean separation between cache sites, and is, in principle, directly observable. The methodology is not limited to animal dispersers and can be used to address any set of dispersal agencies operating at differing scales, in one or more spatial dimensions. This approach is tested for three dispersal mutualisms where Reid's paradox is known to operate: harvester ant/wild ginger, Blue Jay/ oaks, and nutcracker/stone pine. Migration rates predicted using the homogenized approach compare favorably with estimates for tree species based on the paleo-ecological record.

ABA and cytokinin levels are correlated with patterns of osmotic tolerance, photosynthesis, growth, and leaf longevity, and their concentrations in specific tissues change throughout plant development.

Here we use theoretical models to explore the influence of ecological assembly on the diversity of multitrophic communities along gradients of productivity. We show that assembly dynamics can generate scale-dependent patterns consistent with those observed in nature; while unimodal productivity-diversity patterns are produced at the scale of local communities, positive monotonic patterns emerge when diversity is measured at larger spatial scales (among communities). This occurs due to increases in beta diversity with productivity.

In the first, a stoichiometric analysis of herbivores consuming food with varying carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratios is undertaken, in which the intake of C is segregated into easily assimilated compounds and fiber. Two herbivore strategies emerge from the analysis, both as a means of minimizing limitation by C, not N: fiber eaters that consume high C:N food and have efficient fiber digestion, and selective feeders that consume low C:N food but that do not possess fiber-digesting enzymes. In the second example, the stoichiometric axiom that a single substrate, the one in least supply relative to demand, limits growth is used to identify potentially limiting essential amino acids in the diets of a range of animals. Large consumer-prey imbalances in amino acids were found in several cases, indicating that, at least in theory, growth should be strongly limited by individual amino acids rather than bulk N.

Molecular/cellular studies have concentrated on the role of signaling pathways for systemic induced resistance, mainly involving salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, and more recently the cross-talk between these pathways. This cross-talk demonstrates how interactions between signaling mechanisms and phytohormones could mediate plant-herbivore-pathogen interactions.

In these sympatric populations, juvenile coho are larger, occupy mutually preferred deep, low-velocity pools, and displace steelhead into shallow, high-velocity riffles. I measured habitat selection over a wide range of species' densities under two competitive scenarios: coho larger than steelhead (natural size asymmetry), and species size matched (natural size asymmetry removed). When coho had their natural size advantage, interspecific competition was strongly asymmetric, and habitat selection by both species depended primarily on coho density. Removing the size advantage of coho reduced by half the per capita effect of coho on steelhead habitat selection, which was then affected similarly by intra- and interspecific competition. However, habitat selection by coho still depended more on intra- than interspecific competition. The effect of asymmetric competition on niche overlap was density- and scale-dependent. Asymmetric competition reduced niche overlap nonsignificantly across all densities at the habitat type scale (pools, riffles). At the microhabitat scale (velocity, distance, depth), asymmetric competition reduced niche overlap at low, but not high, densities. Because I manipulated the competitive asymmetry in a single sympatric species pair, this experiment alters a competitive interaction while controlling for evolutionary history and thus provides a direct test of the effect of asymmetric competition on habitat selection and niche overlap.

Responses to predators were always larger under low competition than under high competition.

Many plants are damaged or even killed by flooding events due to the associated oxygen deprivation in cells. Stimulated shoot elongation is an important adaptive mode that can restore contact of leaves with the atmosphere above the water surface. This strongly improves inward diffusion of oxygen and the rate of photosynthesis. Fast elongation of submerged petioles of the model plant Rumex palustris involves the integrated action of the plant hormones ethylene, auxin, gibberellin, and abscisic acid. The closely related Rumex acetosa is unable to switch on petiole elongation when submerged. In a comparative study of these two Rumex species, we found that the response to the gaseous phytohormone ethylene, which accumulates in plant tissues during submergence, explains their contrasting elongation behavior. In order to study the importance of this shoot elongation response in the distributional patterns of plants in natural floodplains, we quantified the ethylene-induced elongation response of 22 plant species occurring in the Rhine River floodplain. These results were compared with the results of a multivariate analysis based on 84 vegetation surveys performed in the same area. The species compositions of the surveys were grouped along two environmental gradients: flooding duration and soil dehydration after the floodwater subsided. If we superimpose the ethylene-induced elongation capacity on these vegetation data, it becomes clear that the capacity to elongate upon exposure to ethylene positively correlates with flooding duration and negatively with soil dehydration. Based on this analysis, we conclude that the capacity to elongate is an important selective trait in field distribution patterns of plants in flood-prone environments. Fast shoot elongation under water seems to be a favorable trait only in environments with shallow and prolonged flooding events, while costs associated with this response prevent its expression in sites with deep floods, sites with floods short in duration, or in sites in which flood water recedes rapidly.

From an ecological perspective, exposure to one stress may alter the plant's probability of being exposed to another stress. From a mechanistic perspective, hormonal and biochemical signaling interactions between responses to each stress may influence the severity or ability to adaptively respond to the subsequent stress. In this article, we consider the relationship between plant water and salt stress and attack by pathogens and herbivores. Empirical data suggest that water stress and the probability of attack by pathogens and herbivores are correlated between habitats. Biochemical interactions between plant responses to water and salt stress and insect and pathogen attack are also interrelated. Initial biochemical models indicated that abscisic acid (ABA), an important hormone in responses to water and salt stress, had a synergistic positive role with jasmonate-induced defenses against herbivores and an antagonistic role with salicylate-based resistance to some pathogens. Based on this background, we developed predictions about how water and salt stress would alter plant resistance to insects and pathogens and tested the predictions using tomato plants as a model system. We used polyphenol oxidase activity as a marker of the jasmonate response and pathogenesis-related protein P4 as a marker of the salicylate response. First, we examined levels of chemical defense in wild-type and ABA-deficient plants and the ability of these plants to resist insect and pathogen attack. In the second experiment, we exposed plants to short-term salinity stress and tested their subsequent resistance to a chewing insect Spodoptera exigua and the bacterial speck pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. We have two key findings. First, ABA-deficient plants had higher levels of salicylate-mediated responses and were more resistant to bacterial speck disease, consistent with the proposed role of salicylate in defense against pathogens. This suggests linkage between water availability to the plant and salicylate action in pathogenesis through ABA signaling. ABA-deficient plants had reduced resistance to the insect Spodoptera exigua, suggesting a positive correlation between responses to water stress and herbivory. The lack of difference in chemical expression of the jasmonate (JA) response (polyphenol oxidase activity) between wild-type and ABA-deficient plants did not support the proposed mechanism of synergism with the jasmonate response. Second, salt stress reduced the chemical induction (e.g., pathogenesis-related protein P4) of the salicylate response, but this did not affect resistance to the pathogen. Salt stress did not alter resistance to the herbivore Trichoplusia ni, but did alter the negative signal interaction between the jasmonate and salicylate responses. Under control conditions, the jasmonate and salicylate responses are antagonistic to one another, with induction of one response reducing the inducibility of the other. Under salt stress conditions, the negative effect of salicylate on the jasmonate response was reduced. Thus, complex interactions occur between ABA, JA, and SA, hormones that are important regulators of abiotic and biotic stress responses.

We hypothesized that (1) phytoplankton are less sensitive to a nutrient pulse with increasing zooplankton biomass, size, and Daphnia abundance, and (2) phytoplankton recover more quickly from the nutrient pulse with increased zooplankton biomass and increased abundance of taxa with rapid numerical responses, especially small-bodied cladocerans. We tested these hypotheses in field mesocosm experiments, which crossed four zooplankton community structures with two nutrient pulse treatments in a fully randomized factorial design. We found that phytoplankton sensitivity decreased with increased zooplankton biomass, size, and Daphnia biomass regardless of the method used to define the reference state, supporting our first hypothesis and suggesting that results for sensitivity are robust to methodology. This result, together with previous work, clearly demonstrates that zooplankton have a strong effect on phytoplankton sensitivity. Further, as predicted, return times were shorter with increased zooplankton biomass and biomass of small cladocerans. However, contrary to expectations, return times also declined with Daphnia and copepod biomass, suggesting that the effects of zooplankton on return time are more complex than we hypothesized.

This study characterized how density influences multilevel selection on size in the Great Lakes sea rocket (Cakile edentula). Plants were grown at three different densities in the field, and multilevel natural selection on plant size was estimated. As predicted, only individual selection was detected at the lowest density, but group selection was detected at higher densities. Surprisingly, group selection was strongest not at the highest density, but at intermediate density, where it opposed individual selection; shorter, heavier individuals growing in groups of tall, light plants had the highest fitness. At the highest density, the effect of neighbor phenotype on reproduction differed between central and peripheral group members, leading to no overall group selection detected at high density. The observation that group selection was more prevalent at higher density than at the lowest density supports the general prediction that more intense interactions among group members can lead to stronger group selection.

Using manipulative experiments during a two-year study, I showed that predatory ants can act as agents of selection on extrafloral nectary (EFN) traits.

Sire-offspring regression analyses demonstrated that both the proportion of leaves with EFNs and EFN size exhibit heritable variation in G. thurberi. A two-year insecticide experiment revealed that herbivory reduced plant growth and seed production in the field, independently of the effects of ants. Both ant abundance and EFN availability were manipulated in the field using a 2 X 2 factorial design. When ant visitation was reduced, plants supported more herbivores, experienced greater leaf damage, and produced fewer flowers and seeds. Furthermore, fewer ants visited plants with experimentally reduced EFNs; leaf damage was higher and seed number was lower compared to plants with ambient levels of EFN, indicating that EFNs mediate the benefits of ants. In addition, natural variation in EFN frequency correlated positively with seed production.

In this article, I illustrate the potential for plastic responses in plants to physiologically interact, with particular reference to Arabidopsis thaliana. I also suggest avenues for future study utilizing characterized plant material, tools to manipulate the expression of plastic responses, and ways to monitor physiological and ecological consequences that are available using this and other plant species.",Adaptive phenotypic plasticity | Arabidopsis thaliana | Auxin | Competition | Gibberellic acid | Herbivores | Induced defenses | Jasmonic acid | Peroxidase | Phytochrome | Salicylic acid | Shade avoidance responses,NA,NA,NA,NA

As an example of how these approximations may be applied, we use demographic and environmental data from a trapped population of martens (Martes americana) in Ontario to evaluate the effect on harvest yield of improvements in prediction of recruitment based on fluctuations in its prey base.

Using a transplant experiment, we experimentally showed that biotic interactions have a predictable, deterministic impact on zooplankton community structure in a metacommunity of highly interconnected shallow ponds. Fish predation and presence of abundant macrophyte cover rapidly structured regional communities of zooplankton, both in terms of relative abundances and of cladoceran species richness.

This case study evaluates whether warming is driving the northward range expansion of a skipper butterfly (Atalopedes campestris). Recently colonized areas have warmed 2-4°C over the past 50 years. To assess the importance of climate change for population persistence in these areas, I compared population dynamics at two locations (at the current range edge and just inside the range) that differ by 2-3°C. Population growth rate at these two locations over two years was positively correlated with January mean and annual mean temperatures. To determine whether larval overwinter survivorship could explain this correlation, I transplanted larvae over winter to both sites. Larval survivorship was very low at both locations, but significantly lower at the range edge, probably because lower lethal temperatures frequently occurred there. To estimate the direct effect of cold stress on larval survivorship, I applied a previously derived hazard-rate model based on laboratory experiments. With input from field-measured daily mean temperature, the model accurately predicted transplant survivorship at both locations over two winters. Combined results from population and larval transplant analyses indicate that winter temperatures directly affect the persistence of A. campestris at its northern range edge, and that winter warming was a prerequisite for this butterfly's range expansion.",Atalopedes campestris | Climate change | Cold tolerance | Geographic range limits | Population abundance | Range shift,NA,NA,NA,NA

This bat feeds on low-protein fruit, and females have bimodal polyestrous cycles that are relatively long for a small mammal. We measured the energy and water balance of captive nonreproductive, pregnant, and lactating females, and of free-ranging lactating females. Our results indicate that females use more than one strategy to cope with the high energy demands of reproduction. These strategies may change according to the availability of food and reproductive status. The primary strategy near the end of pregnancy and at peak lactation was increased food consumption. In the laboratory, mean metabolizable energy intake (MEI) of pregnant and lactating females (271 and 360 kJ/d, respectively) increased by 35% and 80%, respectively, compared to that of nonreproductive females (200 kJ/d). At peak lactation, energy intake measured by doubly labeled water averaged 350 kJ/d. During late pregnancy, water turnover rate (WTO) increased by 15-23% compared to that of nonreproductive females. In the field, WTO at peak lactation was 44% higher than in captive lactating females, and milk production was estimated to be 22 mL/d. Absolute resting metabolic rate (RMR) in late pregnancy was significantly lower than the RMR of nonreproductive females, suggesting that a metabolic depression was used as a compensatory mechanism. Fat deposition was evident during the second pregnancy, when food availability was high, presumably in preparation for a second lactation period. Fetal tissue represented ∼1.3% of the total energy assimilated during pregnancy, and the gross efficiency of lactation averaged 24%. Both values are lower than the values reported for other eutherian mammals, but similar to estimates for other bat species, and probably reflect the high energy costs associated with flight. A long lactation period may be constrained by flight and the low-protein diet of fruits.

However, these explanations fail to consider expected native-exotic richness relationships under a null model assuming no species interactions. We show via simulation that the null expectation for a randomly assembled community is a negative relationship between native and exotic species richness at the smallest scales and, when plots vary in total richness, a positive relationship at larger scales. We outline a procedure to compare observational data to this null expectation using a permutation test of labels of species origin (native or exotic).

We measured natural tree and shrub regeneration in a factorial experiment combining distances from adjacent forest, mowing treatments of the Saccharum, and a prescribed burn. To determine the applicability of the general model of neotropical succession and the nucleation model of succession to species composition of forest regeneration in these anthropogenic grasslands in Panama the effect of time since fire and distance to remnant vegetation (isolated trees, shrubs, and large monocots) was measured. Fire significantly affected species composition and decreased species richness because most species had either their resprouting ability or seed germination inhibited by fire; the few species that had regeneration enhanced by fire dominated early successional communities. Sites differed in time since fire, ranging from 1 to 4 yr; the interaction of site and distance from the forest significantly affected community composition and the prevalence of species with different dispersal mechanisms and shade tolerance. At recently burned sites, light-dependent wind-dispersed species predominated; most were found near the forest edge. As time since fire increased, significantly more shade-tolerant, larger-animal-dispersed species were recorded, and the proximity to and species identity of remnant vegetation became more important in affecting species composition of the natural regeneration; no significant effect of distance from the forest was found at sites that were unburned for three or more years. Our results support both successional models; the temporal sequence of species composition corresponded to later stages of the general model, while the spatial distribution of species followed the nucleation model.

Daily caloric requirements of killer whales determined from allometric regressions for field metabolic rate show that an adult killer whale requires 51-59 kcal·kg-1·d-1 (2.5-2.9 W/kg). Caloric values of prey items determined by bomb calorimetry ranged from 41 630 kcal for an adult female sea otter to sequentially higher values for male otters, sea lion pups, and adult Steller sea lions. Integrating these results with demographic changes in marine mammal populations show that fewer than 40 killer whales could have caused the recent Steller sea lion decline in the Aleutian archipelago; a pod of five individuals could account for the decline in sea otters and the continued suppression of sea lions. The collapse of the historical prey base of killer whales due to human whaling may have contributed to a sequential dietary switch from high to low caloric value prey, thereby initiating these declines.

Although indirect interactions among plants through shared pollinators are often expected to be competitive, pollinator sharing may be beneficial when plant species jointly attract or maintain populations of pollinators. In this study, I tested the hypothesis that pollinator-sharing congeners facilitate reproduction in a focal taxon, Clarkia xantiana ssp. xantiana, and that positive interactions are most pronounced in small and sparse populations. Population surveys revealed that C. x. xantiana frequently coexists with pollinator-sharing congeners except at the periphery of its range. Populations varied extensively in size and density, with small populations more likely associated with pollinator-sharing congeners; conversely, populations occurring alone were more likely large. Flowering schedules in Clarkia communities ranged from segregated to aggregated. Although there was not strong evidence of character displacement, modes in flowering time were often staggered among Clarkia species resulting in a protracted flowering season within plant communities. Studies of bee pollinator availability in 17 populations and pollen limitation to reproduction in 39 replicate populations revealed that populations occurring with multiple congeners had high pollinator availability and low pollen limitation of reproduction compared to populations occurring alone.

We found that spring winds and water temperature mediate the intensity of density-dependent survival from the eggs to the age-0 stage. Fall water temperature and juvenile pollock predator abundance mediate density dependence from the age-0 to the age-1 stage. The inclusion of such nonadditive and nonlinear effects in a population dynamics model improved our ability to simulate pollock recruitment.

In a natural survey of browsed and unbrowsed plants, we documented severe undercompensation.

We tested these predictions by manipulating the predator community associated with a sedentary herbivore, the spider mite Tetranychus cinnabarinus, feeding on papaya, Carica papayae, The predators included a widely foraging specialist consumer of spider mites, the ladybird beetle Stethorus siphonulus, and a sit-and-wait generalist predator, the tangle-web spider Nesticodes rufipes. The experiments provided support for both predictions. The widely foraging predator Stethorus when tested alone was capable of effective suppression of spider mite populations. In contrast, the sit-and-wait predator, Nesticodes, never suppressed spider mites. Instead, Nesticodes consistently increased the population growth rates of spider mites. This effect was most likely due to Nesticodes suppressing populations of the intermediate predator Stethorus.

We used two experiments to determine the effects of open habitats and distance on dispersal and colonization by red-backed salamanders, Plethodon cinereus. In the first experiment, salamanders were displaced from habitat edges 25 m and 55 m into an open field and farther into the forest. Return rates from salamanders crossing the field vs. the forest were then used to determine the barrier effects of open habitats.

However, salamanders did colonize most of these field plots within one year. Initial colonists tended to be in the size range of young adults, suggesting that there may be a distinct dispersal phase for terrestrial salamanders.

Macrocystis, like other kelps, has a biphasic life history in which the dispersal stage is the 1N spore generation. Once spores settle, they grow into sedentary and microscopic male or female gametophytes, which produce sperm and eggs. Fertilization ensues, and the resultant 2N sporophyte, the spore-producing form, grows rapidly to a height of up to 25 m. Based on previous empirical studies and modeling field surveys, the potential for self-fertilization is expected to be high, largely due to the shape and extent of spore dispersal distributions. The costs of self-fertilization were assessed with laboratory and field experiments over the entire life history of the sporophyte stage. There was no evidence for self-incompatibility, and fitness was dramatically lower in selfed compared to outcrossed individuals. In addition, there was evidence that costs were more severe under intraspecific competition with outcrossed individuals. The demonstrated severity of the consequences of self-fertilization suggests a species that typically outcrosses (at least under the assumption that costs result from rare recessive deleterious alleles). However, costs were more pronounced in later life history phases, suggesting routine self-fertilization. One implication of significant levels of self-fertilization in Macrocystis is a sort of inbreeding-mediated localized population senescence, leading to striking oscillations in populations, a pattern seen in many Californian kelp beds.","California, USA | Competition | Dispersal | Inbreeding | Kelp | Macrocystis pyrifera | Outcrossing | Self-fertilization | Spores",NA,NA,NA,NA

For many such species it is possible to assign sex with certainty only at some occasions; for example, when they exhibit certain types of behavior. A common approach to handling this situation in capture-recapture studies has been to group capture histories into those of animals eventually identified as male and female and those for which sex was never known. Because group membership is dependent on the number of occasions at which an animal was caught or observed (known sex animals, on average, will have been observed at more occasions than unknown-sex animals), survival estimates for known-sex animals will be positively biased, and those for unknown animals will be negatively biased. In this paper, we develop capture-recapture models that incorporate sex ratio and sex assignment parameters that permit unbiased estimation in the face of this sampling problem. We demonstrate the magnitude of bias in the traditional capture-recapture approach to this sampling problem, and we explore properties of estimators from other ad hoc approaches. The model is then applied to capture-recapture data for adult Roseate Terns (Sterna dougallii) at Falkner Island, Connecticut, 1993-2002. Sex ratio among adults in this population favors females, and we tested the hypothesis that this population showed sex-specific differences in adult survival. Evidence was provided for higher survival of adult females than males, as predicted. We recommend use of this modeling approach for future capture-recapture studies in which sex cannot always be assigned to captured or observed animals.

Several species of crustose coralline algae (CCA) are known to induce coral settlement; however they also employ physical and biological anti-settlement defense strategies that vary greatly in effectiveness. We examine the interactions between settling larvae of two common reef building coral species (Acropora tenuis and A. millepora) and five species of CCA (Neogoniolithon fosliei, Porolithon onkodes, Hydrolithon reinboldii, Titanoderma prototypum, and Lithoporella melobesioides) that co-occur on reef crests and slopes of the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Distinct settlement patterns were observed when coral larvae were provided with a choice of settlement substrata. Settlement on the most preferred substratum, the CCA species T. prototypum, was 15 times higher than on N. fosliei, the least preferred substratum. The rates of post-settlement survival of the corals also varied between CCA species in response to their anti-settlement strategies (shedding of surface cell layers, overgrowth, and potential chemical deterrents). Rates of larval settlement, post-settlement survival, and the sensitivity of larvae to chemical extracts of CCA were all positively correlated across the five species of CCA. Nonliving settlement substrata on coral reefs is sparse; consequently the fact that only a few CCA species (notably T. prototypum) facilitate coral recruitment, has important implications for structuring the reef ecosystem.",Australia | Coral | Coralline algae | Defense | Great Barrier Reef | Metamorphosis | Recruitment | Settlement | Shedding | Substrata | Survival,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

However, actual comparisons of overwinter mortality among latitudinally separated populations have been exceedingly rare, and no such study has focused on temperate-zone lizards, one of the groups thought to experience greater overwinter mortality at higher latitudes. Here we examine latitudinal variation in overwinter mortality among seven populations of the side-blotched lizard (Uta stansburiana) along a transect spanning nearly 15° of latitude in the western United States. We used standard mark-recapture techniques to estimate daily mortality rates for the fall through spring (overwinter) period for three consecutive years. Using these data, we directly test the hypothesis that rates of overwinter mortality increase with increasing latitude. Surprisingly, daily mortality rates during the overwinter period appear to be lower - not higher - at higher latitudes. And, in spite of longer winters in the north, even total seasonal losses to winterkill appear, if anything, to be lower at higher latitudes. Mortality rates during the overwinter period were consistently lower than during the activity season, and this pattern was especially pronounced at cold northern sites. These observations indicate that winterkill may not be an important determinant of annual mortality for these populations, and they support the view that predator-mediated mortality during the activity season is the primary source of population loss. Because Uta are inactive during cold winter weather, and because their primary predators are either similarly inactive (e.g., other lizards and snakes) or may have migrated south (e.g., birds), predator-prey encounter rates are lower during higher latitude winters.",Abiotic factors | Comparative demography | Latitude | Lizard demography | Lizard mortality | Mortality gradients | Mortality rate | Population regulation | Predation | Uta stansburiana | Winter mortality,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, individuals of all dispersal statuses, i.e., adult and first-breeding philopatric and immigrant birds, significantly contributed to changes in colony size, indicating an important effect of dispersal on colony dynamics via colony quality. Given that there is strong evidence that Lesser Kestrels base their settlement decisions on conspecifics, we tested whether immigrants used the number of previously settled residents in year t (social or conspecific attraction hypothesis) and/or the breeding performance of conspecifics in year t - 1 (performance-based attraction hypothesis) to select their breeding colony. Breeding success of colonies varied both in space and time and was autocorrelated from one year to the next. Moreover, lifetime reproductive success of Lesser Kestrels was positively associated with colony size, and individuals can predict final colony size early in the breeding season, so assumptions of both hypotheses were fulfilled. Our results support the social attraction hypothesis, since immigration was positively related to the number of philopatric adults, but not to conspecific breeding success the year before. Given that departure decisions of adults were based on personal information about breeding success and colony size is related to fitness prospects, previously settled individuals provide easy and reliable information about colony quality, and social attraction could be seen as a particular case of public information in Lesser Kestrels. Consistently, absolute numbers of both philopatric adults and immigrants increased with colony size the year before, although immigrants increased only up to a threshold beyond which this trend disappeared. Therefore, immigrants seem to be prevented from settling in the largest colonies, which could explain why all individuals do not concentrate in a few big colonies, but some settle in suboptimal colonies or colonize unoccupied sites.

We evaluated seasonal N fixation rates on a total of 12 natural forest preserves varying in time since last fire (35-355 years). Each site was monitored for N fixation activity using a calibrated acetylene reduction assay. Nitrogen fixation rates were found to increase linearly with time since fire. This increase in N fixation with succession is likely a function of degree of colonization by cyanobacteria and site factors such as presence of available N. Surface applications of 4.5 kg N-ha -1·yr-1 as NH4NO3 were found to eliminate N fixation while applications of P resulted in only a slight and temporary increase of N fixation rates. In contrast to common observation our findings suggest that N fixation in boreal forests becomes more important in late succession. Limited N availability in late succession is clearly one of the primary drivers of N fixation rates in boreal forest ecosystems.

Replicate plots were plowed once per year in October, March, or May, and disturbance timing had a marked impact on botanical composition from the outset.

Three guilds of species were apparent: fall germinators, spring germinators (seeds with a chilling requirement to break dormancy), and indifferent species (species germinating after disturbance, irrespective of timing). Some species were driven close to local extinction by annual soil disturbance at the ""wrong"" time of year; presumably their seed banks were small or rapidly depleted, and recruitment to their populations may have been more reliant on the annual seed rain. Proof that temporal variability of disturbance is an important contributor to long-term species coexistence requires a demographic approach showing both a storage effect and relative nonlinearity of competition.

(2) ANOVA that takes blocking, into account is an efficient way of correcting for deterministic structures or spatial autocorrelation. (3) For constant effort, experimental designs that have more, smaller blocks, broadly spread across the experimental area, lead to tests that have more power in the presence of spatial autocorrelation.

Soil moisture did not explain the difference in soil respiration between woodlands and grasslands. Soil temperatures at the 10-cm depth were 5°C cooler in woodlands during the growing season and significantly different between woodlands and grasslands throughout the year, explaining most of the low soil respiration in woodlands.

We found no significant differences between woodlands and grasslands in long-term (82-week) laboratory incubations of potentially mineralizable soil C and short-term incubations for microbial biomass C.

Assuming root respiration is 50% of soil respiration, we estimate that the turnover of woodland soil C stocks may be slowed by 15 years relative to grassland. This suggests that, if juniper expansion (now occurring across nearly 5 million hectares in the Great Plains) proceeds to canopy closure, annual soil C flux may be potentially reduced by as much as 19 × 106 Mg of C below C flux rates that occurred historically from tallgrass prairie soils.",Afforestation | Soil carbon cycling | Soil respiration | Tallgrass prairie | Woody encroachment,NA,NA,NA,NA

Because carbon (C) and N dynamics are closely linked, herbivore activity may also affect C distribution. We initiated a replicated mini-ecosystem experiment to test the hypothesis that insect frass (feces) influences soil C and N dynamics following insect defoliation. One hundred and sixty red oak (Quercus rubra) saplings were transplanted to seven-gallon (26.5-L) pots with soil and litter from the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory (CWT) (Otto, North Carolina, USA) and overwintered in experimental pot stands. During the 2002 growing season, trees were subjected to a 3 X 2 factorial experimental design with three damage groups (herbivore, mechanical, ""undamaged"") and two frass depositions (frass, no frass). Frass deposition increased soil total C, total N, and the soil NH4+ pool. Leachate NO3- export also increased following frass additions. We suggest that herbivore frass mobilizes sufficient C and N to affect soil pools and N export, though abiotic factors may influence the ultimate fate of the nutrients in frass. In addition, herbivory increased soil respiration and decreased total soil N relative to ""undamaged"" controls independent of frass deposition. While we discuss four possible mechanisms for this observation, we hypothesize that the increased soil respiration results from enhanced root-exudate C and subsequent microbial oxidation. This mechanism has implications for C sequestration and N retention in forest soils. In addition, the effects of mechanical damage consistently did not match those of real herbivory, suggesting that differential responses of Q. rubra to damage types also may affect soil nutrient dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the feeding activity of insect herbivores can have direct and indirect effects on the cycling of C and N within the season of defoliation.","Ammonium | Carbon | Dissolved organic nitrogen | Frass deposition and soil nutrient dynamics | Herbivory, real vs. simulated | Malacosoma americanum | Microbial biomass | Nitrate | Nitrogen cycling | Quercus rubra | Red oak | Soil respiration",NA,NA,NA,NA

The mean rate of spread with the Allee effect is ∼19%; removing the Allee effect results in a mean rate of spread of ∼31%. Sensitivity analysis both with and without the Allee effect reveal that seedling establishment, inflorescence density, and outcrossed seed production are key factors determining invasion rate. When there is an Allee effect, the invasion rate is sensitive to variation in self-pollinated seed production. By structuring the population according to density classes instead of the more usual age or stage classes, the deterministic model demonstrates a novel way of representing density dependence and an Allee effect in population biology. This approach could be applied to model the population dynamics of any species that spreads from multiple foci and in which these foci later coalesce.",Allee effect | Density structured model | Depensation | Invasive species | Lag time | Sensitivity analysis | Spartina alterniflora,NA,NA,NA,NA

Quantifying field metabolic rate (FMR) and water influx rate (WIR) of parents feeding nestlings as measures of parental effort, we found that parental FMR and WIR of larks decreased with increasing aridity. Water and energy requirements of 6-8 d old nestlings were reduced in desert species. Nestling growth rate, clutch size, and number of clutches decreased with increasing aridity, and nest predation rates increased with increasing aridity. We combined FMR and WIR of parents and chicks, energy and water accumulated during growth, and brood size to establish energy and water budgets of parent-brood units. Parent-offspring energy budgets equaled 261 kJ/d for Hoopoe Lark, 164 kJ/d for Dunn's Lark, 388 kJ/d for Skylark, and 347 kJ/d for Woodlark, a 27% reduction in the desert species when taking into account mass differences. Family unit WIRs were 46.6 g/d for Hoopoe Lark, 37.3 g/d for Dunn's Lark, 101.6 g/d for Skylark, and 83.2 g/d for Woodlark. Parent-brood units of arid-zone species used 28-51% less water per gram mass than species from mesic areas. These results support the hypothesis that decreasing food and water availability favor lower energy and water requirements of parents and young, reduced growth rates, and smaller clutch sizes with increasing aridity. The decrease in parental effort with increasing aridity might reflect a lower fitness value of a single brood for arid-zone species than for larks from mesic habitats, suggesting that the probability of adult survival is higher in arid than in mesic areas.",Alaudidae | Aridity | Clutch size | Desert | Field metabolic rate | Growth rate | Larks | Life history | Nest predation | Water influx rate,all,All Open Access,NA,NA
