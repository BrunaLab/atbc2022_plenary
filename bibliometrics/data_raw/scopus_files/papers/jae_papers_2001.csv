The seasonal decline in clutch size observed in many avian populations may be due to (a) a causal effect of the timing of breeding or (b) variation in individual quality (i.e. lower quality individuals lay fewer eggs and lay later in the season). 2. To distinguish between these two hypotheses, we manipulated the timing of breeding of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris L.) by removing first clutches to induce the production of replacement clutches. This experiment was performed at two sites over three breeding seasons. 3. To test whether the within-individual trend in clutch size differed from the seasonal decline in clutch size observed in the population, we devised a novel randomization test that overcomes some of the potential limitations of previously used analyses. 4. We observed no within-female decline in clutch size in any year at either site. Therefore, clutch removal did not appear to manipulate female quality (due to the costs of egg production), a potentially confounding factor in such experiments; only the timing of breeding was manipulated. 5. The within-individual seasonal trend in clutch size differed significantly from the population decline in four of six cases (year-site combinations); there is good reason to believe that the lack of a significant difference in the two other cases was due to low statistical power. Thus, our data support the hypothesis that the season decline in clutch size in this species is due to variation in female quality. 6. The between-year repeatability of clutch size was 0.47 and significantly different from zero, whereas that of relative laying date was much lower (-0.23) and non-significant. The repeatability data are thus consistent with the quality hypothesis: clutch size is characteristic of individuals regardless of their timing of breeding. 7. Female body mass at the beginning of incubation was not related consistently to clutch size or laying date, and therefore does not appear to be an indicator of female quality in this context.",71,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,"Egg mass, intraspecific variation | Laying date, Monte Carlo test | Repeatability",29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,1

Body size determines rates of respiration and production, energy requirements, mortality rates, patterns of predation and vulnerability to mortality. Body size distributions are often used to describe structure and energy flux in communities and ecosystems. 2. If clear relationships can be established between body size and trophic level in fishes, they may provide a basis for integrating community and ecosystem analyses based on size spectra, food webs and life histories. 3. We investigated relationships between the body sizes (weight and length) of northeast Atlantic fishes and their trophic level. The abundance of 15N, as determined by stable isotope analysis, was used as an index of trophic level. 4. Cross-species and comparative analyses demonstrated that body size was unrelated or weakly related to trophic level. Thus allometric relationships between body size and trophic level could not be used to predict the trophic structure of fish communities. 5. The results of the cross-species analyses contrasted with patterns in the size and trophic structure of entire fish communities. When fish communities were divided into size classes, there were strong positive relationships between size class and trophic level. The slope suggested a mean predator: prey body mass ratio of 80:1. 6.

It is often difficult to quantify the separate contribution of exploitation and interference competition to the starvation of poor competitors yet, in vertebrates, it seems widely supposed that depletion is normally the mechanism underlying density-dependent starvation. This paper presents arguments that density-dependent starvation occurs through interference in wintering oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus eating mussels Mytilus edulis without prey depletion having a significant influence. 2. Exclosure experiments and mussel bed surveys showed that oystercatchers (i) depleted mussel numerical density by up to 25% in their most preferred large prey size classes, but by only 12.1% overall; (ii) reduced mean mussel length by 1.5%; but (iii) had no detectable effect on the thickness of the shells and therefore the availability of mussels to the 60% of oystercatchers that opened mussels by breaking the shell. 3. Oystercatcher intake rate did not fall until prey biomass had decreased to very low densities. Depletion was not nearly large enough for mussel biomass to be reduced to this point. 4. The flesh content of individual mussels decreased from autumn to spring by 40-50% but oystercatchers did not increase their rate of foraging to compensate. Intake rate declined over the winter because of deteriorating mussel condition; very little was because of depletion. 5. Over the current range of population size, the density-dependent functions produced by a behaviour-based individual's model were the same whether depletion was allowed to occur or not, confirming that depletion played no role in the density-dependent starvation. 6. At current population sizes, intake rate was reduced as population density increased only through increased interference, this leading to starvation late in winter when mussel flesh content was low. It was not just the subdominant birds most susceptible to interference that starved, but the least efficient ones as well, even though the density dependence was not due to exploitation competition.",40,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Depletion | Functional response | Interference | Intraspecific competition,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,3

We studied how differences in the cost of producing male and female offspring in humans affected the productivity of twin vs. singleton deliveries in two ecologically different areas of pre-industrial (1752-1850) Finland. Given the higher energy requirements of male infants, we predicted sons to suffer more from increased litter size and food scarcity than daughters. 2. We found that the number of offspring surviving to adulthood from a twin delivery differed between the archipelago and mainland areas of rural Finland. On the mainland areas, where crop failures and subsequent famines were common throughout the centuries, twin deliveries were much less successful than in the south-west archipelago, where food conditions were traditionally more stable and survival was ensured by fishing. 3. Productivity of twin deliveries was modified by the gender composition of the twins; female-female twin births were generally most successful and male-male births least successful. 4. On the mainland, giving birth to twins of any gender composition never increased the mothers' reproductive success beyond giving birth to either a male or female singleton, whereas in the archipelago mothers could increase their reproductive output by producing twins. This was because in the archipelago female-female twin deliveries contributed on average more than one adult offspring to the breeding population, whereas a singleton delivery of either gender produced only about 0.7 adults. 5. Our results show that increases in litter size and variability of food conditions increased male mortality. High female twin survival in the archipelago led to higher fitness of twinning mothers in relation to mothers with only singletons. Twinning has traditionally been significantly more common in the archipelago as compared to the mainland, but contrary to the prediction, there were no apparent differences in the frequency of male-male and female-female twins being born.",31,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Food conditions | Litter size | Mortality | Reproductive success | Sex ratio,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,5

Density-dependent and climatic conditions experienced by individuals before and after birth differ considerably between cohorts. Such early environmental variability has the potential to create persistent fitness differences among cohorts. Here we test the hypothesis that conditions experienced by individuals in their early development will have long-term effects on their life history traits. 2. We approached this by analysing and contrasting the effects of climate (the North Atlantic Oscillation, NAO) and population density at year of birth on cohort birth weight, birth date, litter size, age of maturity, survival and fecundity of Soay sheep, Ovies aries L., ewes in the population on the island of Hirta, St Kilda, Scotland. 3. Significant intercohort variations were found in life history traits. Cohorts born after warm, wet and windy (high NAO) winters were lighter at birth, born earlier, less likely to have a twin and matured later than cohorts born following cold and dry (low NAO) winters. High population densities in the winter preceding birth also had a negative effect on birth weight, birth date and litter size, whereas high postnatal densities delayed age of first reproduction. 4. High NAO winters preceding birth depressed juvenile survival but increased adult survival and fecundity. The negative influence of high NAO winters on juvenile survival is likely to be related to mothers' compromised physical condition while the cohort is in utero, whereas the positive influence on adult survival and fecundity may relate to the improved postnatal forage conditions following high NAO winters. High pre- and postnatal population densities decreased juvenile (neonatal, yearling) and adult (2-4 years) survivorship but had no significant effect fecundity.",224,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Climatic changes | Density dependence | Density independence | Life-history variation | North Atlantic Oscillation | Soay sheep,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,6

We investigated the effects of kinship on the spatial dynamics of non-breeding flocks of long-tailed tits in order to determine the information available on the kinship of other members of the population from their use of home ranges. 2. A novel method of home range analysis was devised based on 'convex hull peeling'. This method takes into account the dispersion of all fixes within a home range and permits the quantitative analysis of home range use. In addition, the method allows the extent of overlap between adjacent home ranges to be determined and the use of those areas to be investigated. 3. Non-breeding flocks of long-tailed tits were composed mainly of relatives, but also included unrelated immigrants. Flock ranges were large and there was extensive overlap between adjacent flocks. 4. The degree of range overlap was significantly affected by the relatedness of flocks. If two flocks contained close relatives they were more likely to overlap than two flocks containing non-relatives. Moreover, the amount of overlap was significantly greater for two adjacent related flocks than for two adjacent unrelated flocks. 5. The use of overlapping areas of non-breeding ranges of long-tailed tit flocks was also influenced significantly by relatedness. Overlapping flocks that were unrelated to each other usually avoided areas of overlap, while related flocks did not generally show such avoidance behaviour. 6.

This study examined the changing status of the marine ecosystem at the island of South Georgia (Southern Ocean) using up to 27 variables measured over 22 years from three upper trophic level predators that specialize in foraging upon krill (Eupuasia superba Dana). These variables included population size, breeding performance, offspring growth rate, foraging behaviour and diet. A method was developed for reducing these multivariate time-series to a single vector, called a combined standardized index (CSI). 2. Sensitivity analyses showed that missing values had a large effect upon the accuracy of the CSI but this effect was reduced if the individual variables were highly correlated. The level of correlation and proportion of missing values within the empirical data set were within the acceptable range. Individual variables had widely varying influence upon the CSI but, in general, those with longer time-series had the greatest influence. 3. Principal components analysis showed that variables representing offspring growth tended to explain the greatest proportion of the variability in the CSI and this was followed by variables representing diet. 4. There were 3 years in which the CSI showed extreme and significantly low values. There was a significant non-linear functional response (similar to the Holling Type II functional response) between the overall CSI and krill biomass and a similar relationship existed when the CSI was calculated for each species individually. 5. Separate analysis of variables that were likely to be representative of changing population size showed the presence of a significant decline between 1977 and 1998. There was no trend in the CSI from variables representative of foraging conditions during the summer breeding season.

Barnacles are a good model organism for the study of open populations with space-limited recruitment. These models are applicable to other species with open supply of new individuals and resource limitation. The inclusion of space in models leads to reductions in recruitment with increasing density, and thus predictions of population size and stability are possible. 2. Despite the potential generality of a demographic theory for open space-limited populations, the models currently have a narrow empirical base. In this study, a model for an open population with space-limited recruitment was extended to include size-specific survival and promotions to any size class. The assumptions of this model were tested using data from a pan-European study of the barnacle Chthamalus montagui Southward. Two models were constructed: a 6-month model and a periodic annual model. Predicted equilibria and their stabilities were compared between shores. 3. Tests of model assumptions supported the extension of the theory to include promotions to any size class. Mortality was found to be size-specific and density independent. Studied populations were open, with recruitment proportional to free space. 4. The 6-month model showed a significant interaction between time and location for equilibrium free space. This may have been due to contrasts in the timing of structuring processes (i.e. creating and filling space) between Mediterranean and Atlantic systems. Integration of the 6-month models into a periodic annual model removed the differences in equilibrium-free space between locations 5. Model predictions show a remarkable similarity between shores at a European scale. Populations were persistent and all solutions were stable. This reflects the apparent absence of density-dependent mortality and a high adult survivorship in C montagui.

Occurrence and abundance of shrews varied significantly between sites and years but the size of the landscape or the study site had no effect on the abundance of shrews.

Resource availability has long been recognized to influence reproductive decisions in eusocial Hymenoptera. We analysed how protein availability affects the number and the weight of worker, male and queen pupae, as well as its effect on sex, caste and reproductive allocation ratios, in the Argentine ant Linepithema humile Mayr. Colonies were maintained on diets with three levels of access to proteins: no protein, intermediate and high levels of proteins. 2. There was no significant difference between the intermediate and high levels of protein in the number of queen, male and worker pupae produced. Similarly, the intermediate vs. high levels of protein treatments did not differ with regard to the weight of pupae nor the relative investments between the three castes. This suggests that, in L. humile, there could be a threshold over which additional amounts of protein have no more effect on reproductive allocation or the size of the individuals produced. 3. The main effect of protein supplementation was to increase the number of sexual pupae (queens and males) produced. By contrast, the number of workers produced remained unaffected by the level of proteins. The higher investment in sexuals in nests supplemented with proteins resulted in a significantly higher proportion o f queen pupae among females, as well as higher proportion of males among all individuals produced in these nests. However, the proportion of males among sexuals (numerical sex ratio) was not significantly different between supplemented and unsupplemented nests. 4. Workers reacted to a higher protein diet not only by rearing more sexuals, but also by producing larger individuals of the three castes. 5. The proportional investment allocated to queens among females was higher in the protein-supplemented treatments. Protein-supplemented nests also invested proportionally more into sexual production than unsupplemented nests. However, whereas increased sexual production is generally associated with a more female-biased sex investment ratio in ants, sex allocation ratio was not significantly different between supplemented and unsupplemented nests. 6.

The study examined the behavioural factors that influence variation in foraging costs of wandering albatrosses (Diomedea exulans Linnaeus) during two consecutive years. This was performed by measuring simultaneously foraging activities and metabolic rates (W kg-1) of breeding birds during the incubation periods of 1998 and 1999. 2. A total o f 38 birds (19 in each year) were injected with doubly labelled water, equipped with satellite transmitters to measure foraging distance and flight speed, and equipped with activity recorders to measure landings and take-offs from the water surface. 3. In 1999, birds spent on average 30% more time at sea (11.07±3.53 SD, days), travelled 43% further (5473±2348 SD, km) and increased the number of landings and take-offs per day by 66% (28.1±11.4 SD, landings per day) compared to 1998. 4. Energy expenditure rates during foraging were significantly higher in 1999 (5.3±0.8 SD, W kg-1 n = 8) compared to 1998 (4.5±0.5 SD, W kg-1, n = 11). 5. Landing and take-off rates explained the greatest proportion of variation in energy expenditure rates of wandering albatrosses, rather than total distance travelled, flight speed or time in flight. 6. Despite 18% higher foraging costs in 1999, the daily rate of food intake was similar between years, suggesting that energy acquisition per unit effort was lower. 7. The energetic cost of flight for wandering albatrosses was estimated to fall between 3.4 and 5.1 W kg-1, or 1.4-2.0 × measured BMR, one of the lowest flight cost yet reported for any seabird.",80,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Cost of flight | Doubly labelled water | Foraging ecology | Interannual variability | Satellite tracking,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,16

The behaviour of two butterfly species, a habitat specialist (Speyeria idalia) and a habitat generalist (Danaus plexippus), was tracked at four prairie edges to determine the extent to which edges act as a barrier to emigration. The four edge types studied were crop, road, field and treeline. The edges differed in structure ranging from high-contrast (treeline) to low-contrast (field). 2. S. idalia, the habitat specialist, responded strongly to all edges, even those with low structural contrast. However, S. idalia's response was strongly affected by conspecific density at crop and field edges; individuals were less likely to exit from high density plots. S. idalia responded to edges both by turning to avoid crossing them, and returning to the plot if they had crossed. 3. D. plexippus responded strongly only to treeline edges Wind direction and time of year were important factors influencing behaviour at edges for this species. Conspecific density was not a significant factor affecting their behaviour. D. plexippus responded to edges by not crossing them, but rarely returned once they had crossed. 4. In highly fragmented landscapes, such as the one in which this study occurred, butterflies which show little or no response to edges may exhibit high emigration rates because of the high probability of encountering an edge in small habitat patches. Butterflies may respond strongly to even subtle habitat boundaries, but those responses may be modified by the edge structure, local environment or other conditions. Therefore, modifying edge structure may be a way to influence emigration rates, making it a useful tool for conservation.",199,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Edge permeability | Habitat fragmentation | Lepidoptera | Tracking study,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,18

We present a multivariate model of the post-fledging survival of juvenile great and coal tits (Parus major L., P. ater L.) in relation to chick body condition and timing of breeding. Radio-telemetry and colour marks were used to track tit families during 20 days from fledging, that is, the period of post-fledging dependence. Data on 342 chicks of 68 broods were obtained. 2. Forty-seven per cent of juveniles died during the observation period, predation being the main cause of mortality. In the first 4 days after fledging the mortality rate was 5-10% per day. 3. Survival of juveniles was positively correlated with fledging mass. Furthermore, survival strongly decreased during the season. In the second half of June, mortality was five times the rate of mid-May. The differential survival resulted in selection for both early fledging and high fledging mass. Juvenile condition was less important for survival in birds that had fledged early in the season. Their survival rates exceeded 70% in all weight classes, whereas in late broods only the heaviest individuals survived equally well. The survival of birds fledging both late and in poor condition was below 20%. Thus, selection for high fledging mass was much stronger in the late season than in early broods. 4. We conclude that the impact of predation after leaving the nest results in selection for early breeding and, particularly in the late season, for high fledging mass. This may explain why the earliest broods have been found to produce most recruits into the breeding population even if they did not profit from maximum food availability during the nestling period. On the other hand, energetic limitations may constrain the begin of egg laying in adult birds. Thus, counteracting evolutionary responses to the seasonal development of food availability (the caterpillar peak) and to the risk of post-fledging mortality (the peak in post-fledging mortality) may have focused the period of optimal reproduction to a narrow time-window.",460,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Coal tit | Great tit | Post-fledging survival | Predation | Radio-tracking | Reproduction | Timing of breeding,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,19

We conclude that fur-return data reflect relative abundance of muskrat and mink, and not primarily information about the trappers. 3. The most-common temporal pattern of the two species are cycles with a period of 8-9 years, with muskrat cycling 1-2 years ahead of the mink. This pattern, as would be expected in a typical predator-prey relationship, is found throughout the boreal forest region, with the exception of several posts in eastern Canada.

Theoretical arguments suggest that distributions of migratory birds in winter should match patterns of food availability, but in reality the match between migrants and their food may be imperfect because, for various reasons, birds may be unable to 'track' food resources. We tested the hypothesis that food availability influences the distribution of migratory canopy-foraging insectivorous warblers wintering in Jamaica. 2. Over a wide spatial scale (24 sites on the island), warbler abundance varied significantly among sites and habitats and was significantly dependent on measures of arthropod biomass. Alternative factors (vegetation characteristics, resident bird competitor abundance, predator abundance) were not correlated with warbler abundance. 3. Over a short temporal scale (about 2 weeks) at a single site, warbler abundance increased as predicted quantitatively after a natural, rapid increase in arthropod biomass. 4. Over a longer temporal scale (the duration of a winter), changes in density and persistence of individually marked American redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla, L.) on six sites corresponded with concurrent fluctuations in arthropod biomass. 5. These results document a strong association between arthropod biomass and warbler abundance in time and space, suggesting that warblers wintering in Jamaica distribute themselves in response to food resources. 6.

The role of individual experience vs. the use of conspecific cues on breeding dispersal decisions have seldom been determined in colonial birds. We studied causes of breeding dispersal in the lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni), a species that breeds in colonies of variable size as well as solitarily. During a 6-year study in Spain, we gathered information on 486 subsequent breeding attempts and on 26 explanatory variables which evaluated individual experience, conspecific cues in terms of breeding performance and colony size, and different ecological and populational characteristics. 2. Two decisions were separately analysed: whether or not to disperse, and how far to move. Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) allowed us to identify the relative contribution of each explanatory variable while controlling for the non-independence of individual dispersal decisions across years. 3. Females seemed to disperse more often than males (34% vs. 19%), and both sexes apparently dispersed less with age. However, a GLMM showed that experience (i.e. the number of years a bird bred in a particular colony) was the only factor influencing breeding dispersal. Birds showed higher site fidelity the greater their experience in a colony, which could be related to benefits derived of increased local familiarity. A second GLMM showed that, before birds acquired experience in a particular colony, individual nest failure due to predation and proximity to other colonies increased the probability of dispersal, dispersal being also higher in colonies with poor conspecific breeding success. Furthermore, solitary nesting birds were more prone to disperse and dispersal probability decreased the larger the colony of origin, according to fitness expectations associated with colony size. 4. A GLMM explaining dispersal distances retained two variables - birds dispersed farther the lower the breeding density in the surroundings, and the larger the distance to the nearest colony. Dispersing birds tended to settle within their previous foraging areas (median dispersal distance = 1.6 km), being constrained by the availability of nearby colonies. 5. Lesser kestrels mainly cue on their own breeding performance and experience in a particular colony at the time of taking a dispersal decision. However, inexperienced birds also partially cue on the size and breeding success of their own colonies (but not on the size or breeding performance of other colonies), and birds moved larger distances when dispersing from areas of low populational density.

In Nazca boobies, second eggs provide insurance against the failure of the first egg or early death of the first hatchling, but approximately half of all females lay only one egg. We tested the hypothesis that one-egg clutches result from food limitation by providing female Nazca boobies with supplemental food. 3. A higher proportion of supplemented females produced two-egg clutches than did control females. Supplemented females produced larger second-laid eggs than did control females, but not first-laid eggs. Laying date and laying interval were not affected. 4. Comparisons of clutch size and egg volume between years indicated that the supplemental feeding experiment was not conducted in a year with a poor natural food supply. Thus supplemented females produced larger clutch sizes despite apparently normal natural food levels. 5.

(iii) the residual index also assumes the homogeneity of regression coefficients (parallelism assumption), which should be tested with a special ANCOVA design. (iv) even if the assumptions of the linear model hold for the original variables, they will not hold for the residuals. 3. More importantly, the residual index is an ad hoc sequential procedure with no statistical justification, unlike the well-known ANCOVA.

Stones along the shore of a eutrophic English lake in summer have one of two epilithic assemblages. Many stones are covered with dense filaments of the macro-alga Cladophora glomerata and the tubes of detritivorous/browsing chironomids. Others have few algal filaments and are dominated by gallery-building caddis larvae (Tinodes waeneri). These communities are patchily distributed along the shore, macro-algae dominating in areas away from riparian trees and on tall, rather than flat stones. The origins of this dichotomy were assessed in a field experiment that provided new surfaces for colonization, according to a planned schedule in time and space. 2. To examine temporal heterogeneity, artificial substrata (clay tiles) were introduced into the littoral each month from February to October 1995 and harvested on several occasions from 1 to 9 months later. 'Large' scale spatial heterogeneity was investigated by introducing tiles into three locations along the shore that differed with respect to shoreline trees. At a smaller scale, tiles were introduced with varying degrees of accessibility to dispersing insect larvae by placing them directly on the lake bed, above the bed on platforms, or as stacks of several tiles (to mimic tall stones). 3. There was a distinct temporal separation in the colonization of invertebrates, with tube-building chironomid larvae dominating substrata in spring, before being displaced by Tinodes in summer. A strong temporal pattern in algal productivity, with spring and autumn maxima and a summer minimum, was attributable to nutrient limitation in summer. 4. In summer, there was a strong spatial separation of organisms at large and small scales. In patches under or near trees, chironomids and Cladophora were replaced by Tinodes larvae. Cladophora remained abundant away from trees, where tiles were never colonized by the crawling Tinodes larvae, originating from egg masses laid beneath trees. Areas distant from oviposition sites may act as a grazing refugium for Cladophora and its associated chironomids. At a smaller scale, the inability of Tinodes to colonize the upper surfaces of tall stones also created spatial refugia for algae and chironomids, even within patches of generally high Tinodes density. 5. There was also evidence of a temporal grazing refugium for Cladophora. Cladophora filaments which colonized tiles introduced in April subsequently resisted grazing by Tinodes newly recruiting in June. Filaments colonizing tiles introduced before or after April, however, were vulnerable to Tinodes. The precise mechanism for this is unclear, however. 6. Spatiotemporal patterns in the epilithic community were caused by the external factors of a seasonally fluctuating nutrient supply and a patchy riparian strip of trees and the intrinsic factors of habitat choice, and the life history phenology of the organisms concerned. Our results infer strong direct biotic interactions among species (particularly grazing of Cladophora by Tinodes), indirect interactions between Tinodes and several chironomids via habitat engineering (i.e. the removal of Cladophora as chironomid habitat) and the crucial role of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in decoupling those interactions.",46,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Chironomidae | Cladophora | Lake littoral | Landscape heterogeneity | Species coexistence | Trichoptera,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,27

Females should adjust their reproductive effort prior to substantial investment. For roe deer, due to delayed implantation, this adjustment may occur at ovulation/fertilization during the summer rut, or at implantation in mid-winter. We investigated the effects of climate and maternal phenotype (mass, condition, age) on potential litter size (number of fertilized ovulations) and implantation failure (number of fertilized ovulations less number of fetuses) of 818 individual roe does from nine populations across Britain. 2. Potential litter size varied from 1 to 4, with 0-100% of does per population poly-ovulating. Among prime-aged does, 16.7-54.5% subsequently failed to implant at least one blastocyst. 3. Individual fecundity was determined by the combined effects of maternal phenotypic quality and age, but acting at different stages of the reproductive process: potential litter size increased with increasing maternal body mass; implantation failure was independent of phenotypic quality, but varied in relation to maternal age, being lowest for prime-aged does, somewhat higher for yearlings, but higher still for senescent females. 4. Implantation failure increased with increasing initial potential litter size, perhaps related to physiological malfunction. Implantation was often an all-or-nothing process, with females either implanting all or failing to implant any of their fertilized blastocysts. 5. Climatic factors were not consistently correlated with individual female fecundity within populations, but between populations implantation failure increased with climatic severity. 6. For species such as roe deer, where females rely on food intake rather than fat reserves for reproduction, we suggest that a two-step process shapes patterns of reproductive output: body mass first sets an upper limit to potential litter size at conception, then reproductive output is limited mainly by senescence and climatic severity through implantation failure.",70,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Body mass | Climate | Condition | Implantation failure | Litter size | Senescence,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,29

Within-patch and between-patch flights were distinguished based on flight distance. The quality of this classification was tested statistically by examination of log-survivor curves of flight times. 3. Wasps remained longer in patches with higher host densities, which is consistent with predictions of the marginal value theorem (Charnov 1976). Under the assumption that each flight indicates a patch departure, there is no relationship between host density and leaving tendency. 4.

It is widely appreciated that complex population dynamics are more likely in systems where there is a lag in the density dependence. The transmission of maternal environmental conditions to offspring phenotype is a potential cause of such a lag. Maternal effects are increasingly found to be common in a wide range of organisms, and might thus be a frequent cause of nonequilibrium population dynamics. 2. We show that a maternal effects' lag generally increases population variability. This may result from the lag inducing cycles (or more complex dynamics) in a deterministic environment or, in a stochastic environment, from the lag interacting with environmental noise to produce more variable dynamics than would otherwise occur. This may happen whether the underlying dynamics are equilibrium, periodic or more complex. 3. Although maternal effects may generally destabilize dynamics there are a clear set of exceptions to this. For example, including a maternal lag may convert cycles to equilibrium dynamics, which may revert to cycles when external noise is added. 4. The influence of the maternal effect depends importantly on the details of the model, whether it is structured or unstructured, the life-history traits which are maternally affected, and the type of density dependence. 5.

The captured animals were tagged and taken back to the laboratory, where their resting metabolism (RMR), thermogenic capacity (NA induced metabolism excluding RMR) and body mass were measured. 3. Body mass, RMR and thermogenic capacity did not differ significantly between the start and end of winter in voles that were captured at both times. 4. Body mass varied significantly over the winter months, being lowest in January and highest in March. Thermogenic capacity also varied over the winter and the variation was linked significantly with changes in ambient temperature, suggesting that either voles with greater thermogenic capacity were more likely to be active on cold nights, or voles were flexible in their thermogenic capacities.

Type II functional responses, which can be described by Holling's disc equation, have been found in many studies of predator/prey and host/parasite interactions. However, an increasing number of studies have shown that the assumptions on which the disc equation is based do not necessarily hold. We examine the functional response of kleptoparasitically feeding Arctic skuas (Stercorarius parasiticus L.) to the abundance of fish-carrying auks and, by examination of the assumptions of the disc equation, test whether it can explain the function. 2. The rate at which individual skuas make successful chases is a decelerating function of the abundance of auks. However, it would appear that this is not determined by factors that influence their probability of success, but by the rate at which they initiate chases. This too is a decelerating function of the abundance of auks. Arctic skuas have a Type II functional response. 3. Although Arctic skuas exhibited a direct numerical response there was no evidence that components of predation connected to the density of predators (direct prey stealing, or increased host avoidance) had any effect on the rate at which individual skuas made chases or were successful in their chases. We conclude that the observed functional response is free from any effects of interference. 4. We suggest that abnormally high levels of foraging effort expended by breeding skuas and their poor breeding success in the years of observation argue against the limit to the observed functional response being determined by skuas' energetic requirements. 5. Several of the assumptions underlying the disc equation do not hold. The duration of chases (handling time) was not a constant; it decreased with increasing host abundance. Moreover, the chase duration predicted by the disc equation, if handling time limited the functional response, was far in excess of that observed. Furthermore, the observed rate of decline in the searching time per victim with increasing host abundance suggested that skuas' instantaneous rate of discovery was also not constant. Possible reasons for these observations are discussed.

Eruptions occur when a species appears in unusually high densities within and often outside of its normal range. We used 30 years of Christmas Bird Counts combined with cone/seed-crop data on boreal coniferous trees, breeding bird surveys, and weather records to test correlates of winter eruptions by 11 species of primarily boreal North American seed-eating birds. 2. Eruptions of six species in eastern (red-breasted nuthatch Sitta canadensis L., black-capped chickadee Parus atricapillus L., evening grosbeak Hesperiphona vespertina Cooper, pine grosbeak Pinicola enucleator L., red crossbill Loxia curvirostra L. and bohemian waxwing Bombycilla garrulus L.) and five species in western North America (pine grosbeak, pine siskin Carduelis pinus Wilson, evening grosbeak, bohemian waxwing and red-breasted nuthatch) correlated with a combination of large coniferous seed crops in the previous year followed by a poor crop. Breeding population size in the year of the eruption was also correlated positively with the event in two of the species. Eruptions in these species apparently occur when large boreal seed crops resulting in high population densities (via high overwinter survivorship and/or high reproductive success) are confronted with a relatively poor seed crop the next autumn. 3. Eruptions of common redpolls Carduelis flammea L. and black-capped chickadees in the west followed only large seed crops the previous year, suggesting that high density is a more important factor leading to eruptions than seed crop failure. The opposite was true for white-winged crossbills (Loxia leucoptera Gmelin) in the east, where eruptions correlated only with poor current year seed crops. This was the only species supporting the 'seed-crop failure' hypothesis as the sole cause of eruptions. 4. Purple finches Carpodacus purpureus Gmelin erupted following years when breeding population densities were high for reasons apparently unrelated to the seed crop. Eruptions of three species in both regions were uncorrelated with any of the variables tested. 5. We conclude that seed crops of boreal trees play a pivotal role in causing eruptions for a majority of boreal species, usually through a combination of a large seed crop resulting in high population densities followed by a poor seed crop rather than seed-crop failure alone.

Corals are clonal organisms and show a plastic growth. We study a partial differential equation model for the dynamics of size distribution of corals and predict the trajectory of recovery after a catastrophic disturbance, such as the recent bleaching that killed most corals in southern Japan. 2. We assume that the mean growth rate of colony size, measured in projected area, is a linear function of colony size, and that the variance in growth rate is proportional to the size, which is consistent with the growth data of a coral Acropora hyacinthus Dana 1846. 3. The model incorporates the space-limitation in colony growth and recruitment. The growth rate and recruitment rate are proportional to the fraction of free space within the local habitat. 4. In many corals, including A. hyacinthus, recruitment occurs in a short period once a year. However, our model illustrates that the colony size distribution does not show distinguishable cohorts since the observed variance in growth rate is large. The model with discrete settlement and a large variance in growth rate results in size distributions that are very well approximated by an explicitly soluble model with constant recruitment and no growth variance. 5. When mortality is low, the dynamics of size distribution show two different phases in the recovery process. In the first phase, size distribution is determined by recruitment and growth, and can be predicted well by the case without mortality. After free space is depleted, recruitment and growth slow down and become balanced with mortality. The equilibrium size distribution is controlled by all the three processes. Both for the transient and the equilibrium size distribution, the average colony size increases with growth rate but decreases with recruitment rate. 6.

Simulations of a stochastic, individual-based predictive model were used to investigate the ecological processes relating to the formation and growth of colonies (local populations) of Audouin's Gull (Larus audouinii Payraudeau). A colony was established in 1981 at the Ebro Delta (in the north-western Mediterranean) and since then, the colony has grown dramatically at an average rate of 44% per year, such that by 1997 it held 65% of the total world population of this species. 2. Our model shows that the observed growth in the colony cannot be explained without large-scale immigration of individuals into the colony. Although immigration occurred in most of the years throughout the study, years with an absence of immigration and even with net emigration from the colony also occurred. 3. The most likely source of immigrants was the colony on the Chafarinas Islands (655 km southwards from the Ebro Delta), which has been the largest known colony excluding the Delta in every year since 1981. However, immigrants from other neighbouring colonies apart from the Chafarinas, and even from other colonies beyond the western Mediterranean metapopulation were presumably also involved. 4. Immigration from other colonies is likely to be driven by temporal heterogeneity in the relative quality of the different colonies, combined with individuals dispersing to search for and select the most suitable breeding place, in order to increase their fitness. However, breeding success at the Ebro Delta colony was not autocorrelated from one year to the next, suggesting that the predictability of the environment was low. 5. Predictability was also low in other colonies within the metapopulation, independently of their size or relative quality. Results suggest that the presence of conspecifics (rather than local reproductive success) may be more important for immigrants in breeding site selection. 6. Colonization of the Ebro Delta was probably facilitated by the effective protection of the site against human disturbances, which produced a new, empty, high quality site for prospecting gulls.

Over the next 5 years, colonies were mapped several times per year and the biomass of each colony was estimated from the volume of the nest-mound. 3. The average biomass and density of colonies within the removal areas gradually converged on those of control plots and were no longer detectably different after two years.

Significantly more new colonies were established within core areas of experimental plots than within core areas of control plots during the first year following removals. 6. The per-colony probability of movement and the net influx of colony biomass were significantly higher in central regions of the experimental plots than in control plots during the first year.

Ecologists concerned with life-history strategies of parasitoid wasps have recently focused on interspecific variation in the fraction of the maximum potential lifetime egg complement that is mature when the female emerges into the environment. Species that have all of this complement mature upon emergence are termed 'pro-ovigenic', while those that do not are termed 'synovigenic'. We document and quantify the diversity of egg maturation patterns among 638 species of parasitoid wasps from 28 families. 2. We test a series of hypotheses concerning variation in 'ovigeny' and likely life-history correlates by devising a quantitative index - the proportion of the maximum potential lifetime complement that is mature upon female emergence. 3. Synovigeny, which we define as emerging with at least some immature eggs, was found to be by far the predominant egg maturation pattern (98·12% of species). Even allowing for some taxonomic bias in our sample of species, pro-ovigeny is rare among parasitoid wasps. 4. There is strong evidence for a predicted continuum in ovigeny index among parasitoid wasps, from pro-ovigenic (ovigeny index = 1) to extremely synovigenic species (ovigeny index = 0). 5. As predicted, synovigenic species are longer-lived than pro-ovigenic ones, and ovigeny index and life span are negatively correlated across parasitoid taxa, suggesting a life span cost of concentrating reproductive effort early in adult life. 6. There is equivocal evidence that host feeding (i.e. consumption of host haemolymph and/or tissues by adult wasps) is confined to synovigenic parasitoid wasps. It is also not certain from our analyses whether host feeding is associated with a relatively low ovigeny index. 7. As predicted, egg resorption capability is concentrated among producers of yolk-rich eggs. Also, the hypothesis that it is associated with a tendency towards a low ovigeny index is supported. Parasitoid species that produce yolk-rich eggs also exhibit a lower ovigeny index than species that produce yolk-deficient eggs. 8.

Many studies of cooperatively breeding birds have found no effect of group size on reproductive success, contrary to predictions of most adaptive hypotheses. A model is proposed for variation in group-size effects: group size has a reduced effect on success when conditions for breeding are good, such as in good environmental conditions or in groups with older breeders. This hypothesis is tested with a case study of white-browed scrubwrens Sericornis frontalis and a review of the literature. 2. The scrubwren is a cooperatively breeding passerine with male helpers. Previous analyses revealed no effect of group size on reproductive success, but those analyses were restricted to groups with older females (Magrath & Yezerinac 1997). Here 7 years' data are used to contrast the effect of group size on reproductive success for yearling and older females. 3. Yearling females breeding in groups had more than double the seasonal reproductive success than those breeding in pairs, even after controlling for territory quality. However, group size still had no effect on the reproductive success of older females. Yearling females tended to survive better in groups, but older females tended to survive better in pairs, emphasizing this pattern. 4. Yearlings breeding in pairs were more likely to be found on poor-quality territories than those breeding in groups, exaggerating the already-strong effect of group size on yearling success. Older females were not affected significantly by territory quality. 5. Group size, territory quality and female age affected different components of seasonal reproductive success. Group size increased the success of individual nesting attempts, while both territory quality and female age affected the length of the breeding season, and thus the number of breeding attempts. 6. A sample of the literature on cooperative breeders shows that group size has a larger effect on reproductive success in poorer conditions, caused either by younger, inexperienced breeders or poorer environmental conditions. Scrubwrens therefore illustrate a widespread pattern, which provides an explanation for much of the variation in group-size effects among and within species. Clearly single estimates of group-size effects for species can be inadequate to test ideas about the evolution of cooperative breeding.",68,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Breeder age | Cooperative breeding | Sericornis frontalis | Territory quality | White-browed scrubwren,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,41

The timing of dispersal by juvenile thornbills was bimodal. Juveniles either dispersed by the end of the breeding season or remained on their natal territory into the autumn and winter. Juveniles that delayed dispersal were four times more likely to recruit into the local breeding population than juveniles that dispersed early. 4. Delayed dispersal was advantageous because individuals that remained on their natal territory suffered little mortality and tended to disperse only when a local vacancy was available. Consequently, the risk of mortality associated with obtaining a breeding vacancy using this dispersal strategy was low. 5. Males, the more philopatric sex, were far more likely than females to delay dispersal. Despite the apparent advantages of prolonged natal philopatry, however, only 54% of pairs that raised male fledglings to independence had sons that postponed dispersal, and most of these philopatric sons gained vacancies before their parents bred again. Consequently, few sons have the opportunity to help their parents. Constraints on delayed dispersal therefore appear to play a major role in the evolution of pair-breeding in the brown thornbill.",96,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Delayed dispersal | Natal philopatry | Nestling weight,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,42

An evaluation of the potentially adverse effects of measurement must be made before concluding that one is dealing with a 'dispersal sink'. 2. We conducted a spatially and temporally replicated removal experiment on common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) in uniformly suitable old-growth eucalypt forest in south-eastern Australia, that was designed to address the question: does immigration 'rescue' populations from extinction? 3. Despite taking precautions to minimize potential harm, analyses indicated some evidence of an adverse effect of handling on the survival of pouch-young and strong evidence of effects on adult survival. In addition, symptoms of stress associated with handling observed at our site, corresponded to symptoms reported in connection with the long-term (15 + years) trapping study on possums conducted by Efford et al. in the Orongorongo Valley (OV) of New Zealand. 4. Initial projections from a demographic model indicated that the resident population at our site was not replacing itself (births < deaths), suggesting that the site was a dispersal sink. This was inconsistent with the fact that the site was in prime habitat. Moreover, the measured rate of true immigration in response to experimental removals was not sufficient to maintain the population density. Using data from Efford (1998), our model confirmed his suggestion that the OV site also appears to be a dispersal sink for possums, despite being in prime habitat. 5. When otherwise undiagnosable deaths among adults were assumed to be due to handling and 'right-censored' (excluded), the projection was that the resident population at our site was stable (r ≅ 0), and therefore not in need of 'rescue' by immigration. Similarly, when survival estimates for the OV site were corrected by the same amounts, the projection was that the population at that site was also stable. 6. Most vacancies created by our experimental removals were filled by neighbouring residents that expanded their ranges into the removal areas. We suggest that the artificial 'removal' of residents as a consequence of deaths due to handling, may often induce an influx of such apparent immigrants, thereby giving the impression that immigration is 'rescuing' populations from extinction.",31,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Demography | Dispersal | Metapopulations | Removal experiments | Rescue effect,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,43

The Mauritius kestrel Falco punctatus (Temminck 1823) has recovered from very low numbers. In order to evaluate the severity of the population bottleneck that it experienced, we have developed a method for estimating the productivity of the nests that escaped detection. This method uses ringing records for MCMC estimation of parameters describing the recruitment of adults to the breeding population and the growth in productivity of undiscovered nests. 2. Comparison of the estimates for the two restored populations (eastern and western) showed a far lower proportion of undiscovered nests in the former, as predicted because of widespread use of nestboxes. This served to verify the method of estimation. The estimates show a steady increase in population size, in contrast with field estimates indicating a recent reduction in growth. 3. The results suggest that the alarmingly low estimates of population size in 1974 (two breeding pairs) were accurate, and that few undiscovered nests existed during the bottleneck. 4. The recovery of the population seems to have been initiated by the intensive conservation effort. The most rapid period of population growth coincides with the reintroduction programme. The results imply that the eastern population is much more reliant on intensive management for its future growth.",20,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Bayesian estimation | Endangered species | Markov Chain Monte Carlo | Minimum viable population size | Reintroduction,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,44

Trawling disturbance has wide-ranging impacts on the marine environment and is well known to modify benthic habitat and community structure. This has led to speculation about the positive and negative impacts of trawling on ecosystem processes such as production. 2. Existing theory suggests that frequent trawling disturbance may lead to the proliferation of smaller benthic species, with faster life histories, because they can withstand the mortality imposed by trawling and benefit from reduced competition or predation as populations of larger species are depleted. Since smaller species are more productive, trawling disturbance may 'farm the sea', with knock-on benefits for consumers, including fish populations. 3. We conducted the first large-scale studies of trawling effects on benthic production across quantified gradients of trawling disturbance on real fishing grounds in two regions (Silver Pit and Hills) of the North Sea. There were 27- and 10-fold differences in levels of beam trawl disturbance among the Silver Pit and Hills sites, respectively. 4. Size structure was described using normalized size-spectra, and the slopes and intercepts of these spectra were related to levels of trawling disturbance. Production was estimated from the size spectra, using a new allometric relationship between body mass and the production to biomass (P:B) ratio of marine invertebrates. The general validity of the relationship was confirmed using a phylogenetic comparative approach. 5. In the Silver Pit region, trawling led to significant decreases in infaunal biomass and production. The abundance of larger individuals was depleted more than smaller ones, as reflected by the positive relationship between the slope of the normalized size spectra and trawling disturbance. The effects of trawling disturbance were not significant in the epifaunal community. In the Hills region, where the range of trawling disturbance was lower, trawling disturbance did not have significant effects on biomass or production. 6. In the Silver Pit, relative infaunal production (production per unit biomass) rose with increased trawling disturbance. This was attributable largely to the dominance of smaller animals in the disturbed communities. The increase in relative production did not compensate for the loss of total production that resulted from the depletion of large individuals. There was some evidence for the proliferation of small polychaetes at moderate levels of disturbance, but at higher levels of disturbance their biomass and production fell. 7. We conclude that reported increases in the biomass and production of small infaunal invertebrates in the North Sea are attributable largely to recent increases in primary production that were driven by climate change, and not to the effects of trawling disturbance.",191,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Allometry | Beam trawling | Fishing effects | P:B ratios | Phylogeny | Size spectra,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,45

In models of size-structured predator-prey systems, the effects are evaluated of gape-size limited predation on prey population growth and density when predators are non-interacting, cannibalistic, interfering, and cannibalistic and interfering. 2. Predation from non-interacting predators markedly reduces prey density, compared with prey densities in the absence of predation. When density-dependent cannibalism between predators is introduced, predator density and therefore total functional response decrease, resulting in a decrease in predation pressure and higher prey densities. 3. Size- and density-dependent interference between predators substantially decreases functional responses in the predators, and the prey population is thus allowed to grow more dense. Allowing for cannibalism between interfering predators also decreases predator density, but here the decreased number of predators does not have the releasing effect seen in solely cannibalistic predators. The interference between predators decreases with predator density, and per capita functional responses increase and compensate for the decrease in predator density. 4. These theoretical results are compared with results from natural systems with pikeperch and northern pike. Both species are cannibalistic, and pike are also kleptoparasitic, mirroring the models. Results from introductions of the different piscivores into natural systems corroborate the outcome of the models, since introduction or increased densities of pikeperch have shown to have severe and long-lasting effects on prey, while pike have only initial, decreasing over time effects on prey stock.

The extent of directional environmental change expected in the next century underscores the need to understand density-dependent population regulation. 2. Direct density dependence generated by intraspecific competition and/or predator-prey interactions should buffer environmentally produced changes in density-independent growth rates (r). Density dependence generated by interspecific competition should magnify sensitivity to changes in r. 3. We tested these predictions by assembling protist communities in laboratory microcosms and subjecting the communities to directional environmental change. Two experiments used pairs of competing protists (Colpidium striatum Stein and Tetrahymena thermophila Nanney & McCoy, and Paramecium tetraurelia Sonneborn and Blepharisma americanum Suzuki) along with single-species controls. Two experiments used predator-prey pairs (Didinium nasutum Müller or Euplotes patella Ehrenberg preying on Colpidium) and controls containing only prey. We grew replicates of each species combination in two temperature regimes (constant or slowly increasing temperature). Independent of these experiments, we quantified the temperature dependence of r (intrinsic rate of increase) for each species. 4. Comparison of effects of temperature on r to effects on mean density revealed that intraspecific competition buffered species densities against temperature changes that increased r by over 200%. Interspecific interactions did not affect species responses to environmental change. Temperature change had weak effects on species densities, whether or not other species were present. 5.

The concept of reproductive costs is a central tenet of life-history theory, but the proximate mechanisms whereby such costs are mediated remain poorly understood. In this paper we demonstrate a link between clutch size and escape take-off speed in small birds, mediated through changes in flight muscle volume during laying. 2. In a series of experiments the same adult female zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) were made to lay both large and small clutches. When producing the larger clutches, females lost more flight muscle condition and became significantly slower to take off during escape flights. 3. This reduction in take-off speed with increased egg production was evident after the last egg was laid, and was independent of changes in body mass, so was not simply due to the presence of the eggs inside the female. 4. This indicates that there is a trade-off between fecundity and the maintenance of somatic musculature critical to an animal's escape response. As changes in take-off speed can have disproportionate effects on the chances of ground-feeding birds surviving a predatory attack, the degree of reduction in flight muscle condition during laying could be a constraint on clutch sizes in such birds.",84,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Egg production | Flight performance | Predation risk | Reproductive costs | Zebra finch,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,49

In order to estimate the effect of weaning mass and body condition on the post-weaning survival of grey seal pups from the Isle of May, Scotland in 1998 during their first year of life, a simultaneous analysis of live resighting and dead recovery mark-recapture data was used. A new type of tag was employed which allowed individuals to be identified when resighted alive (Hall, Moss & McConnell 2000) as well as when found dead. 2. The probability of post-weaning survival to age 1 increased with body condition at weaning and differed between the sexes. Regardless of pup condition and time of year, the odds of survival for female pups over a 2-month interval was estimated to be 3.37 (SE = 1.30) times higher than for males. Regardless of sex, a 1 standard deviation increase in pup condition was estimated to increase the odds of survival by a factor of 1.422 (SE = 0.226). For a male pup in average condition (0.41 kg cm -1) the estimated annual survival after adjusting for tag-loss was 0.193 (SE = 0.084); for a female pup in average condition (0.39 kg cm -1) it was 0.617 (SE = 0.155). 3. The effect of condition at weaning on survival was significantly greater for male pups than for females. This implies that high quality females should invest more heavily in their male pups because the marginal return, in terms of increased reproductive value, from any additional expenditure is twice that for females.

Over a 10-year period, we examine the recruitment from 1392 nests of great tits, 575 of which had their brood size experimentally manipulated. We defined final manipulation as the difference between the number of young ringed and the original clutch size. 3. Mean nestling mass declined with final manipulation: those broods from which young were removed had a significantly higher mean fledging mass than control broods, which in turn fledged at a higher mass than those from nests to which young had been added. There was a significant difference in the strength of this effect between years. 4. Addition nests (final manipulation ≥2 young) fledged significantly more offspring (x̄ = 10·96, SE = ±0·16, n = 167) than control nests (final manipulation = -1, 0 or +1 young; x̄ = 8·68, SE = ±0·07, n = 646), which fledged significantly more young than removal nests (final manipulation ≤2 young; x̄ = 5·68, SE = ±0·09, n = 579). 5. Recruitment per nest (the key measure upon which selection would act since parental survival was independent of manipulation in this study) was greatest for parents rearing a brood size equal to their own clutch size. Averaged over the 10 years, a Poisson model of the number of young recruited per nest showed maximal recruitment to occur at a final manipulation of 0·42 extra young added to the original clutch size. This final manipulation value was not significantly different from zero manipulation (i.e. when parents rear the same size of brood as their original clutch size). 6. Using a restricted data set, where there was no loss of young through egg-hatch failure and/or loss of very small young, and examining recruitment per nest with respect to experimental manipulation, indicated maximal recruitment to occur at a manipulation of an additional 0·44 young. The recruitment from this experimental manipulation was not significantly different from zero manipulation (i.e. control broods). 7. The original size of clutch laid by a female was indicative of the 'condition' of the parents. Manipulation of brood size showed that birds naturally laying larger clutches were 'fitter' than birds laying smaller clutches in that, when comparing birds that were all made to rear the same brood size, those with young removed recruited more young than control parents, which in turn recruited more young than those parents to which young had been added to the nests. 8. There were significant differences between years in the shape of recruitment per nest relative to the extent of both final and, separately, experimental manipulation, but in no year did addition broods recruit significantly more offspring than control broods. 9.

We compared movement trajectories under this treatment to those of 29 hedgehogs released at two sites known to support abundant hedgehogs. A third treatment comprised 20 unmanipulated hedgehogs at three sites. We estimated habitat use and proximity to habitats by comparing each observed trajectory to simulated random walks of equal length. We sought differences between treatments in movement and habitat use from nested analysis of variance. 2. No two trajectories of any translocated hedgehogs followed the same route; most involved little change in body weight, and took the animal into or through existing populations.

While birds are top predators in most rocky intertidal communities, the relationship between foraging pattern and variability in food web structure has not been studied. This study examined the spatio-temporal variation of both avian foraging and food web structure at an intertidal rocky shore in northern Japan over a 1-year period. 2. Seventeen bird species foraged on the intertidal rocky shore. Crows and gulls were dominant, and their major prey was sea urchins that migrated from the sub-tidal to intertidal habitat. Interspecific interactions (i.e. stealing of food, utilization of food waste by other species) occurred between crows and gulls especially when feeding on sea urchins. The prey of the birds showed spatial and temporal partitioning. 3. The number of prey items consumed per day by the dominant birds varied with various factors. Factors strongly affecting the foraging pattern of crows were waves, tides, humans and gulls, and those strongly affecting the foraging pattern of gulls were tides, humans, sea urchins and crows. 4. In the rocky intertidal food web, most of the top predators were birds, and most of the birds were omnivores. The birds consumed many more species than did other consumers. Food-resource partitioning caused spatio-temporal compartmentation among subwebs in which the top predators were dominant birds. 5. Analysis of food web statistics (i.e. web size, numbers of links, linkage density, chain lengths) revealed that the presence/absence of birds did not change the relationships between web size and the other statistics.

Movements of many animals along a life-path can be separated into repetitive ones within home ranges and transitions between home ranges. We sought relationships of social and environmental factors with initiation and distance of transition movements in 114 buzzards Buteo buteo that were marked as nestlings with long-life radio tags. 2. Ex-natal dispersal movements of 51 buzzards in autumn were longer than for 30 later in their first year and than 35 extra-natal movements between home ranges after leaving nest areas. In the second and third springs, distances moved from winter focal points by birds that paired were the same or less than for unpaired birds. No post-nuptial movement exceeded 2 km. 3. Initiation of early ex-natal dispersal was enhanced by presence of many sibs, but also by lack of worm-rich loam soils. Distances travelled were greatest for birds from small broods and with relatively little short grass-feeding habitat near the nest. Later movements were generally enhanced by the absence of loam soils and short grassland, especially with abundance of other buzzards and probable poor feeding habitats (heathland, long grass). 4. Buzzards tended to persist in their first autumn where arable land was abundant, but subsequently showed a strong tendency to move from this habitat. 5. Factors that acted most strongly in 1/2-km buffers round nests, or round subsequent focal points, usually promoted movement compared with factors acting at a larger scale. Strong relationships between movement distances and environmental characteristics in 1/2-km buffers, especially during early ex-natal dispersal, suggested that buzzards became primed by these factors to travel far. 6. Movements were also farthest for buzzards that had already moved far from their natal nests, perhaps reflecting genetic predisposition, long-term priming or poor habitat beyond the study area.",49,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Buteo | Buzzard | Natal | Nuptial | Soils,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,56

Recent characterizations of the spatial scale of population dynamics have typically considered patterns at a single scale and ignored the possibility that different patterns may arise at different scales. In this study we assessed population densities of field voles with cyclic dynamics in northern England at 147 sites from three spatial scales on five occasions over a 2·5-year period. 2. The scale over which densities were similar was estimated by comparing the variance of density at the three scales (< 1 km2, 10 km2, and 70 km2) and by using autocorrelation techniques. Closer sites were more similar in density than more distant sites and the autocorrelations suggested that sites up to within 8-20 km had more similar densities and higher population synchrony than the average similarity for all the sampling sites. 3. A generalized additive model fitted to all the data showed that the data supported the hypothesis of a travelling wave of vole densities moving through the study area. The model assumed that the wave moved at a constant speed and in a uniform direction. Estimates of the wave's speed (14 km year-1) and direction (travelling in a direction of 66° from north) were consistent with the estimates which had previously been calculated from a time series of vole densities covering a much smaller spatial area but a longer temporal scale. 4. The spatio-temporal pattern of vole densities detected over a small spatial scale therefore appears to extend over much larger scales and occurs despite the fragmentation of suitable vole habitat at local (a few square kilometres) and regional (hundreds of square kilometres) scales.",48,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Field voles | Kielder | Microtus agrestis | Population synchrony | Spatial scale | Travelling wave,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,57

Resource users have a curvilinear relation of abundance to the richness of their limiting resource, with richness defined by the carrying capacity of renewing resource in the absence of exploitation. The non-linearity means that local unevenness in the distribution of resources can directly influence the overall abundance of users. This effect is entirely independent of overall resource abundance. 2. Outcomes are demonstrated for a classical model of consumer aggregations under conditions of ideal and free exploitation. Consumers that make little impact on the stock of their limiting resource can benefit directly from environmental heterogeneity. They can sustain higher abundance in an environment with unevenly spread resources than in one of equivalent richness with an even spread. Positive effects of heterogeneity are reduced by density dependence in the exploitation rate, for example caused by mutual interference between users. Heterogeneity may have a negative impact on abundance for consumers with a more efficient exploitation of resources. 3. Similar outcomes are predicted for classical models of consumer breeding populations as for consumer aggregations. At still larger scales, unevenness in the distribution of resource patches in metapopulations, and of niches in communities, can increase the abundances of populations and species. Species or communities most likely to benefit from unevenness in their resource carpet are those most vulnerable to local extinction from loss or degradation of their habitat. 4.

A random search model predicted for every sampling date the encounter rate with buried clams providing oystercatchers vary the depth at which they probe their bill into the substrate. The time needed to handle encountered prey was estimated from experimentally determined relationships of handling time with clam size and handling time with burying depth. Encounter rate, handling time and body weight of the potential prey items were used in an optimal prey choice model to predict the average intake rate of an oystercatcher as a function of probing depth. 4. The predicted intake rate reached a profitable level only during three restricted periods. During the first period, a relatively high intake rate could only be achieved by probing extremely deeply, and the mortality rate of the clams remained at a low level. During the other two periods, maximal intake rate was reached by probing only the upper few cm of the substrate, and this time there was a high mortality in the prey population. 5.

The importance of recruitment processes in determining benthic population dynamics has received considerable interest among marine ecologists in the last two decades. Observational demographic studies, in which recruits were followed to and through the adult state, aimed to estimate whether the variation in the numbers of recruits is dampened by density-dependent post-recruitment processes. These studies revealed conflicting results on the importance of post-recruitment density dependence, but were performed over at most a few years. 2. Based on a study of the demography and growth of the bivalve Macoma balthica (L.) on an intertidal flat in the Dutch Wadden Sea for a period of almost 30 years, we explored the extent to which the among-cohort variability in recruitment was reflected in the secondary production (which results from the combined action of recruitment, mortality and growth) of the adult population. 3. Since growth in length was of the Von Bertalanffy type and post-recruitment instantaneous mortality rate was approximately constant for each cohort, production could be explicitly written in terms of the following parameters: recruit density, condition (ratio of mass to cubic length), Von Bertalanffy growth coefficient, asymptotic cubic length, and expected life span. 4. Decomposing the among-cohort variability in production in terms of the covariance matrix of these parameters revealed that most of the variance in production could be attributed to year-to-year variability in recruit density. 5. Small negative covariances between recruit density and asymptotic size and expected life span indicated weak density dependence after recruitment. 6.

The concept of site-dependent population regulation combines the ideas of Ideal Free Distribution-type of habitat settlement and density dependence in a vital rate mediated by habitat heterogeneity. The latter is also known as habitat heterogeneity hypothesis. Site-dependent population regulation hypothesis predicts that increasing population density should lead to inhabitation of increasingly poor territories and decreasing per capita population growth rate. An alternative mechanism for population regulation in a territorial breeding system is interference competition. However, this would be expected to cause a more even decrease in individual success with increasing density than site-dependent regulation. 2. We tested these ideas using long-term (1975-99) population data from a goshawk Accipiter gentilis population in Eastern Westphalia, Germany. 3. Goshawk territory occupancy patterns and reproduction parameters support predictions of site-dependent population regulation: territories that were occupied more often and earlier had a higher mean brood size. Fecundity did not decrease with increasing density in best territories. 4. Using time-series modelling, we also showed that the most parsimonious model explaining per capita population growth rate included annual mean habitat quality, weather during the chick rearing and autumn period and density as variables. This model explained 63% of the variation in per capita growth rate.

Individual variation in feeding rate in the absence of competitors (absolute feeding rate) and decline in feeding rate in the presence of competitors (susceptibility to interference) are frequently used as measures of competitive ability or fitness in short-term foraging studies.

There are, however, few data on whether absolute feeding rate and susceptibility to interference competition remain constant for individuals between years. 2. The hypothesis that absolute feeding rate and susceptibility to interference were similar between years was tested by observing 25 European blackbirds Turdus merula feeding in seminatural experimental patches, during January to March over a 2-4-year period 1995-98. Absolute feeding rate was measured as the feeding rates of solitary blackbirds. Susceptibility to interference was measured as the change in feeding rate of a focal bird when it fed in the presence of different numbers of competitors. 3. Individuals changed significantly in their feeding rate between years, but most individuals did not change in their feeding rate relative to others in the population. The absolute feeding rate of an individual was significantly positively correlated with its feeding rate in the subsequent year. 4. There was no significant variation in susceptibility to interference for individuals between years. Only two of 27 blackbirds showed a significant change in susceptibility to interference between years. 5. Relative absolute foraging rate and susceptibility to interference competition were reasonably similar between years in blackbirds.

Many classical models of ungulate foraging are premised on energy maximization, yet limited empirical evidence and untested currency assumptions make the choice of currency a non-trivial issue. The primary constraints on forage intake of ungulates are forage quality and availability. Using a model that incorporates these two constraints, we predicted the optimal biomass of forage patches for ungulate grazers using an energy maximizing vs. a time minimizing strategy. 2. We tested these predictions on wood bison (Bison bison athabascae Rhoads) grazing naturally occurring sedge (Carex atherodes Spreng). The digestive constraint was determined by a series of ad libitum feeding trials using sedge at different stages of growth. Sedge digestibility declined with biomass. Ad libitum intake of sedge by bison declined with sedge digestibility and thus decreased with sedge biomass. On the other hand, short-term sedge intake rates of wood bison increased with biomass. 3. Incorporation of these constraints resulted in the prediction that daily energy gain of bison should be maximized by grazing patches with a biomass of 10 g m-2, whereas a bison could minimize daily foraging time needed to fulfil its energy requirement by cropping patches with a biomass of 279 g m-2. 4. To test these quantitative predictions, we used a staggered mowing regime to convert even-aged stands of sedge to a mosaic of patches varying in quality and quantity. Observations of bison grazing these mosaics indicated that patches of biomass below 120 g m-2 were avoided, while patches of biomass 156 and 219 g m-2 were highly preferred, with the greatest preference for the latter. 5. These results indicate that bison were behaving as time minimizers rather than energy maximizers.

Recently emerged brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis Mitchill) foraging in still-water pools along the sides of streams exhibit conspicuous variation in foraging behaviour. Some charr are sedentary and eat crustaceans from the lower portion of the water column. Others are mobile and eat insects from the upper portion of the water column. This study examines whether this behavioural diversification represents potentially adaptive responses made by individuals to local environmental conditions. 2. Four models were constructed to predict how the ratio of mobile to sedentary charr was expected to change with pool morphometry, and how the location and orientation of mobile and sedentary charr were expected to differ within pools. The models assumed the charr forage competitively, but each model differed in assumptions regarding which features of pool morphometry determine the availability of the two main prey types. A spatial constraint hypothesis also was considered. 3. Findings from this study support the hypothesis that the divergent foraging tactics represent adaptive adjustments made by individual charr in response to competition for spatially separated food sources. Variation in the numbers of sedentary and mobile charr across pools, and spatial distributions of the charr and their crustacean and insect prey within pools, were most consistent with a model assuming that the availability of insect prey, and hence the number of mobile charr, was determined by the pool surface area while the availability of crustacean prey, and hence the number of sedentary charr, was determined by the pool perimeter. 4.

We determined whether reproductive costs associated with precocious or later breeding by female Townsend's voles (Microtus townsendii) differ and how this relates to the multivoltine life history of microtines. We related the probability of mothers surviving the lactation period to maternal age and the number of pups per litter using logistic models allowing for a threshold value in either explanatory variable below (for litter size) and above (for age) which survival is constant. 2. Females born at the beginning of the breeding period were precocious, giving birth for the first time by the time they were 85 days old (min 38 days). Females born at other times delayed sexual maturation by up to 6 months. 3. The survival of females who gave birth before a fitted threshold of 85 days old declined precipitously if they gave birth to more than five pups per litter. Survival of older females did not vary in relation to the size of their litters. 4. Precocious females had not reached adult size when they conceived their first litter and substantially increased their structural mass during pregnancy. We estimated that young primiparous females gained on average 127 ± 9% of their conception weight during their 21-day first pregnancy compared to an average increase of 47 ± 2% per pregnancy for all other females. It appears that the low survival during lactation experienced by this cohort alone may be a consequence of the cumulative costs of gestation, lactation and somatic growth. 5. We build simple life-table models to estimate the contribution of very precocious (conception at 25 days), precocious (conception at 50 days) and non-precocious females (conception > 50 days) to the population as the probability of surviving the spring and summer, plus the total number of females produced and surviving until the end of the summer. We parameterized such models using the empirical survival estimates. Females who conceived five young very precociously made the greatest contribution to the autumn population. Delaying reproduction had a large cost: A very precocious female starting with five young would contribute 7·21 females, while a precocious female with the same initial litter size would contribute only 2·83 females. This advantage stems from both the longer breeding-life span and from the fact that offspring of very precocious females may themselves reproduce in the year of their birth, such that they compound the precocious investment of their mothers. 6.

The effect of weather on the size of British butterfly populations was studied using national weather records and the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (BMS), a national data-base that has measured butterfly abundance since 1976. 2. Strong associations between weather and population fluctuations and trends were found in 28 of 31 species studied. The main positive associations were with warm summer (especially June) temperature during the current and previous year, low rainfall in the current year and high rainfall in the previous year. Most bivoltine species benefited from warm June weather in the current year, three spring species and two that overwinter as adults benefited from warm weather in the previous summer, and most species with moist or semi-shaded habitats increased following high rainfall and cooler weather in the previous year. 3. Simple models incorporating weather variables and density effects were constructed for each species using the first 15 years' population data (1976-90). These fitted the observed data for that period well (median R2 = 70%). Models were less good at predicting changes in abundance over the next 7 years (1991-97), although significant predictive success was obtained. 4. Parameter values of models were then adjusted to incorporate the full 22-year data-run. For the eight species whose models had best predicted population changes or fitted the data well (R2 > 85%, models were run from 1767 to 1997, using historical weather records, to 'predict' trends in abundance over the past two centuries. For three species it was possible to compare predicted past trends with contemporary accounts of abundance since 1800. In each case, the match between predictions and these qualitative assessments was good. 5. Models were also used to predict future changes in abundance, using three published scenarios for climate change.

Theory suggests that territorial species should share many of the same dynamical characteristics as metapopulations, including asynchronous local dynamics, potential for stochastic extinction of the population when rates of successful dispersal fall below mortality risk, and critical importance of the ratio of suitable to unsuitable habitat for long-term persistence. These propositions were tested on a population of beavers (Castor canadensis Kuhl) in Algonquin Provincial Park, Ontario, which has been continuously monitored over 11 years. 2. Results showed that the total population was considerably less variable than local abundance at 14 beaver colonies, due to asynchrony among local populations. This suggests that local ecological interactions were more important in determining year-to-year variation in beaver numbers than broad-scale environmental processes, such as weather. 3. Of the local colonies, 20% were never abandoned over 11 years, although there was considerable turnover among adults. Offspring production exceeded adult abundance at five source colonies, which did not quite compensate for negative net production at nine sink colonies. These observations were consistent with predictions of spatially structured models of territoriality incorporating local variation in habitat suitability. Mean colony size and probability of recurrence from year-to-year were associated with local food availability, indicating that trophic interactions were important in determining local population dynamics. 4. The beaver population in Algonquin declined steadily over the study period, however, suggesting that spatial and demographic processes were insufficient to stabilize abundance over time. This is consistent with predictions of spatially structured models of territoriality in which suitable and unsuitable habitats are interspersed. It is hypothesized that long-term decline in habitat suitability is induced by acceleration of woody plant succession due to selective foraging by beavers.",75,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Beaver | Demography | Sink | Source | Territory,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,71

High Arctic landlocked Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus L., are used as a reference system to examine the theory of alternative life history strategies in Salmonids and their implication for population structure and potential speciation. In these closed, autonomous systems, Arctic charr are the only fish species present and alternative life history strategies are represented by two distinct size modes, commonly known as 'dwarf' and 'normal' charr. 2. Simple mathematical models are used to caricature the density-dependent interactions within and between the dwarf and normal components of these bimodal populations. Two different assumptions concerning the genetic relationship between the two alternative life history strategies are investigated: complete reproductive isolation, or a single stock which chooses between the alternative strategies facultatively. 3. In constant environmental conditions, the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is not affected by the assumed genetic relationship, and the ESS proportions of dwarfs and normals are shown to depend on environmental parameters. The ESS proportions vary with these parameters along an evolutionarily stable continuum (ESC) and, in particular, a high proportion of normals is associated with high growth rate as a juvenile, and a 'stunted' or unimodal population with low growth rate. The predicted ESC for selection of the normal strategy is similar to that observed experimentally in the analogous case of smolting in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. 4. A difference in the ratio of fecundity to mortality rate between dwarf and normal sub-populations is shown to be essential to maintaining bimodal populations, and it is argued that cannibalism is one mechanism which could achieve this difference. 5. The model is extended to ask what ecological conditions would favour evolution toward the speciated or reproductively isolated state. It is concluded that short-term environmental fluctuations select against speciation and it is speculated that most natural bimodal Arctic charr stocks will achieve maximum individual fitness within a 'semispeciated' configuration which is maintained by incomplete assortative mating.",28,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) | Population dynamics | Size-structured populations | Sympatric speciation,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,72

Populations of formerly continuously distributed species subdivided by habitat fragmentation may show distributions in space and time that are consistent with predictions of metapopulation theory. Local extinctions and recolonizations should result in the most fragmented sites being infrequently occupied and the least fragmented sites being continuously occupied by sensitive species. The probability of extinction is predicted to be negatively correlated with patch size and the amount of habitat in the landscape. Conversely, recolonization is predicted to be negatively correlated with the isolation of the patch, and positively correlated with the amount of habitat in the landscape. 2. Data from a 3-year study of the effect of fragmentation were used to test whether these predictions from metapopulation theory apply to populations of the long-distance migrant forest bird Piranga olivacea (Scarlet Tanager) in fragmented North American landscapes. 3. Principal components analysis was used to derive a composite measure of fragmentation. This measure was used in a logistic regression as a predictor of the number of years that territorial males would occupy a site, given that it was occupied at least once. More fragmented sites were more likely to be occupied only once; the least fragmented sites were more likely to be occupied in all three years. Data on fragmentation were necessary, but not sufficient, to predict site reoccupation, and were poor predictors at medium levels of fragmentation. 4. The univariate measures of fragmentation (patch size and isolation, proportion of forest, and forest/non-forest edge), were also used in logistic regressions to predict the separate, probabilities of local extinction or recolonization. Local extinctions were negatively correlated with patch size and amount of forest in the landscape, as predicted. Recolonizations were negatively correlated with isolation of the patch as predicted, and surprisingly. also with the amount of edge in the landscape. This suggests that stochasticity may drive, extinctions, but that habitat selection may play an important role in recolonization. 5.

Associated with the development of the field of macroecology has been the recognition and analysis of a number of different patterns in the large-scale abundance and distribution of species. The mechanistic bases of these patterns have usually been considered in isolation, yet the patterns are necessarily linked, as the same individual animals contribute to all of them. 2. Here, a model linking macroecological patterns in abundance, distributional extent and body mass is developed, based on how the finite amount of energy available to the species in a region is divided between them. The energy available to a species is assumed to support some quantity of biomass, which must then be allocated to either many small-bodied or fewer larger-bodied individuals. This identifies a necessary link between population size and body mass, which predicts when the variety of relationships between these variables in the published literature are expected to occur. 3. Although framed in terms of energy use by species, the model does not assume that energy per se is necessarily limiting populations. How individuals use space determines the form of relationships between population size and distributional extent, distributional extent and body mass, and population density and body mass. The model additionally allows a number of falsifiable predictions about the anatomy of macroecological patterns. 4.

Siberian jays (Perisoreus infaustus) can acquire breeding status along two routes. Some offspring dispersed in their first summer of life, but one-third of birds ringed as nestlings (39 of 117; 40 broods) postponed dispersal beyond their first winter and up to 3 years of age, 2. Birds dispersing in their first summer were able to settle in flocks outside their natal territory, while retained offspring appeared to be queuing for territorial vacancies in high-quality habitat rather than claiming one of the currently available vacancies of low quality. 3. Males dispersing in their first year acquired territories close to human settlements, and with few low spruces. Reproductive success was low in those territories. Males with delayed dispersal acquired territories further away from human settlements and with a high density of low spruces (< 15 m). Reproductive success was high in such territories. 4. A preference of all birds for territories characterized by high reproductive success, regardless of their timing of dispersal, suggests a causal relationship to habitat characteristics. A non-breeding surplus of retained offspring had priority to vacancies at high densities and these birds claimed territories where reproductive success was high. At low densities and without a non-breeding surplus it was possible for birds dispersing as yearlings to shift territory, and acquire vacant sites of higher quality. It was birds settled in the territories with lowest reproductive success which shifted, and at low population density their territories remained vacant. 5. Siberian jays postponed dispersal as a strategic trade-off, where they forego dispersal options of low quality while queuing for high-quality habitat.

A central concept in ruminant foraging ecology is that even slight changes in plant quality affect body growth substantially, because ruminants not only gain more protein and energy but also use less time for rumination when eating high-quality forage. Increased access to highly nutritious forage is thus regarded as an important driving force in the evolution of migration in large herbivores, because the temporal and spatial variation in plant quality is huge. Body weight is in turn a major determinant of reproductive performance and survival in ungulates, and therefore important for population dynamics. 2. In the temperate region, the vertical movement of cervids from a low-elevation winter range to a high-elevation summer range is the most common pattern of migration. Migration to high elevations during summer is regarded as a strategy to increase energy intake among northern temperate ungulates. 3. It has been suggested that there is increased forage quality at high elevation. This leads to the prediction that body weights are positively correlated with the proportion of high-altitude habitat. Alternatively, cervids may benefit due to prolonged access to newly emerged forage as they migrate along an altitudinal gradient. If so, it can be predicted that body weights are highest in regions with the highest diversity of different altitudes. 4. The facing of slopes, i.e. the aspect, is also regarded as an important part of the habitat for deer. Access to north-facing slopes is regarded as favourable because plant quality may be higher on north-facing slopes; access to a variety of different aspects is also favourable because this may lead to a variable snow melt and thus a longer time period with access to high-quality forage. 5. In order to test the above predictions (under points 3 and 4), we analysed the spatial variability of body weight of 8452 female and 12 474 male red deer harvested during 1975-98 from 105 municipalities in Norway. 6. Body weight of red deer was positively related to the diversity of altitudes, and negatively related to the proportion of high-altitude habitat per se. This demonstrated that the altitudinal migration of cervids is not necessarily due to increased forage quality at high elevation, but rather that migrating cervids gain from prolonged access to newly emerging forage along an altitudinal gradient as they migrate to high elevation during early summer. 7. There was also no support for the hypothesis that access to a high proportion of north-facing slopes was favourable; rather, body weight of red deer was correlated with access to a diversity of aspects. There was thus clear evidence that a variable topography, measured as different altitude levels and aspects, was positively related to body weight of red deer. We discuss the possible causes of why an ideal free distribution is not reached, and conclude that phenological differences in plants related to topography can have a large impact on body weights of cervids, and therefore induce considerable spatial heterogeneity in population dynamics.",223,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Altitude | Demography | Foraging | Ideal free distribution | Plant quality,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,77

We investigated the effects of three types of host on the persistence of a tick-borne virus, using the grouse-hare-deer-tick-louping ill virus system of upland Britain. Each host differed in its interaction with the vector and pathogen. Grouse amplify virus only, deer amplify vector only and hares amplify both. Grouse alone suffer high virus-induced mortality. 2. An analytical model of the system was parameterized using empirical data from two wild populations with different community structures. By changing relative host densities we examined the conditions under which the virus would persist and considered the possibility of parasite-mediated competition between hosts. 3. Although deer alone and grouse alone were unable to maintain louping ill virus, a deer-grouse community usually allowed virus persistence because grouse transmitted virus while deer maintained the tick population. Since virus reduces grouse populations this is a type of apparent competition, and is unusual because deer do not amplify the virus. 4. At very high deer densities, the opposite effect could occur, whereby virus died out because of 'wasted' infected tick bites on deer, that do not transmit virus (the dilution effect). 5. In a hare-grouse two-host system virus usually persisted because hares amplified both the vector and virus (through non-viraemic transmission). Thus, apparent competition may occur between mountain hares and grouse. 6. The addition of a third host type increased the likelihood of disease persistence. Hares added to the deer-grouse system rendered the dilution effect unlikely because of additional virus amplifiers.

Most physiological processes are temperature-dependent. Thus, for ectotherms, behavioural control of body temperatures directly affects their physiology. Ectotherms thermoregulate by adjusting habitat use and therefore thermoregulation is probably the single most important proximate factor influencing habitat use of terrestrial reptiles, at least in temperate climates. 2. Snakes have been shown to raise their body temperature following feeding in a laboratory thermal gradient, presumably to enhance digestion. This experiment was exported to the field to explore the link between feeding, habitat selection and thermoregulation in free-ranging snakes. 3. Experimental feeding was conducted in the laboratory and in the field on black rat snakes (Elaphe obsoleta obsoleta) that had temperature-sensitive radio-transmitters surgically implanted. 4. Snakes had higher mean body temperatures following feeding than prior to feeding in a laboratory thermal gradient. 5. Some, but not all evidence, indicated that black rat snakes increased their mean body temperature following feeding in the field. Indices of thermoregulation indicated that the snakes thermoregulated more carefully and more effectively after they had eaten. 6. Forest edges provided the best opportunities for thermoregulation in the study area. Black rat snakes were less likely to move following feeding when fed in edges than when fed in the forest and were more likely to be found in edges following feeding, whether they had been fed in the forest or in an edge. 7. Results of this study and one previous study suggest that thermoregulatory behaviour of snakes following feeding in the laboratory is a reliable predictor of their behaviour in the field. A review of 13 studies of the thermoregulatory behaviour of snakes following feeding in the laboratory revealed that not all species behave similarly.

Mate fidelity was significantly greater with increasing age in males but not females. There was also a significant negative relationship between mate fidelity and breeding density (as measured by proportion of box occupancy); i.e. the lower the breeding density the higher the incidence of breeding with the same mate. Site fidelity showed significant linear and curvilinear increases with age that were significant in females but not males. There was also a significant negative relationship between site fidelity and breeding density; i.e. the lower the breeding density the higher the incidence of breeding at the same site. Previous breeding experience had no effect on either mate fidelity or site fidelity, and both mate and site fidelity were significantly lower after a breeding season was skipped. In addition, mate fidelity was significantly lower when a site was switched and vice versa. Lifetime reproductive output increased significantly with mate fidelity but showed no relationship with site fidelity. This suggests that fitness is optimized more through mate selection than site selection and that mate fidelity is not a by-product of site fidelity. Annual reproductive success showed a significant linear increase with age in males but not females, and a strong parabolic relationship with breeding experience that was significant in both sexes and significantly greater in males than females. These results suggest that (i) males may be more responsible for mate selection and females for site selection; (ii) improved foraging experience with age and a cost of reproduction may be more important factors in males than females; and (iii) reproductive success may be optimized by behaviour of the male rather than the female. Controlling for the age and experience terms of both parents, experience with a mate had a significant positive linear effect on annual reproductive success. This suggests that mate fidelity is adaptive in Cassin's anklets, and that studies examining the effects of age and experience on reproductive performance should separately consider the duration of the pair bond. Controlling for all other variables, neither experience at a breeding site nor breeding density showed significant correlations with reproductive success.

Despite the importance of fire in many natural systems, knowledge of how fire affects the relationship between hypogeous fungi and mycophagous mammals in fire-prone environments is limited. Using experimental fires, we examined consumption of hypogeous ectomycorrhizal fruit-bodies by an endangered tropical mycophagist, the northern bettong Bettongia tropica Wakefield, in north-eastern Australia. 2. Fungus was the major dietary component (56%) throughout all seasons, both before and after fire. At least 35 hypogeous taxa were consumed. Number of taxa consumed during different seasons was similar, but was significantly higher on unburnt sites than on burnt sites. Similarly, diversity of taxa per faecal sample was significantly greater on unburnt sites, but also increased irrespective of fire from wet season to dry season. 3. Cluster and principal component analyses were used to examine patterns in consumption of fungal taxa. The greatest differences in dietary composition were between the period immediately after fire on burnt sites (early wet season) and all other season and treatment combinations. This difference was due to increased consumption of taxa in the fire-adapted family Mesophelliaceae and reduced consumption of the genus Elaphomyces. Principal component analysis revealed two major gradients in consumption. The first accounted for 32% of total variance and described change in consumption of taxa with season. The second accounted for 24% of total variance and described change in consumption of taxa before and after fire. 4. Despite taxon-specific changes in consumption of hypogeous fungi, the body condition of bettongs did not change significantly between seasons or in relation to fire, suggesting that bettongs were never compromised in their optimal fungal intake. 5. Our data show that the northern bettong has a flexible response to fire and could be best thought of as a fire-adapted marsupial.

The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) affects marine ecosystems, lakes and some terrestrial ecosystems around the Atlantic rim, but evidence for effects on rivers is scarce. For 14 years, we sampled riverine macroinvertebrates in eight independent streams from the Llyn Brianne experimental catchments in central Wales. We assessed whether year-to-year persistence in rank abundance and species composition tracked the NAO. 2. Persistence was quasi-cyclical and varied synchronously across all streams, irrespective of chemistry and catchment land use. Invertebrate communities in all stream types or habitats switched significantly from being highly persistent during negative phases of the NAO (winter index < 1 = cold, dry winters) to unstable during positive phases (> 1 = mild, wet winters). These effects occurred in both rare and common taxa. 3. Acid episodes could not explain low persistence in positive NAO years because variations in acid-base status were not linked to the NAO. Moreover, fluctuations in persistence were apparent even in well-buffered streams. 4. Discharge in adjacent gauged catchments increased in positive NAO years by 15-18% but neither flow variability nor flow maxima were higher. Nor were variations in invertebrate persistence at Llyn Brianne directly correlated with discharge pattern. Discharge variations alone were therefore insufficient to explain links between persistence and the NAO, but we cannot exclude subtle effects due either to flow or temperature. 5. These data illustrate how the persistence of invertebrate communities varies through time in fluctuating environments. Positive phases of the NAO are accompanied by ecological instability in the Llyn Brianne streams, although the exact mechanisms are currently unclear. The effects of the NAO might confound or obscure other long-term change in rivers such as recovery from acidification or the effects of global warming.",119,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Aquatic insects | Climatic variation | Constancy | Disturbance | Stability,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,83

Performance improved from first-time breeders to intermediate-aged birds. Nest initiation advanced, and clutch size increased in both sexes. In females the number of hatchlings and fledglings increased, and the proportion of nests failing completely declined. Performance declined in females after 'middle-age', in the number of young fledged, and the proportion of young fledged relative to initial clutch and brood size. Also, the proportion of nests that failed completely increased in the oldest birds Males showed similar patterns. 3. An index of performance incorporating clutch size, hatching and fledging efficiency, and two measures of total nest failure increased to, then declined after, 4 years of age in females and 3 years in males. The relationship between this index and age was best predicted by quadratic regression. 4. We found no support for three of four hypotheses to explain improvement in performance with age. Recapture rates declined after age 4Y in males, but remained unchanged in females until age 7Y +, while output decreased in both sexes (Residual Reproductive Value). Birds breeding repeatedly did not perform better during their first attempt compared to birds that bred only once (Selection). Birds with varied breeding experience did not differ in their performance within age-groups (Breeding Experience). We did find support for the Breeding Age hypothesis; in females with no breeding experience, there was a successive advance in laying and increase in clutch size from 2 to 4 years of age. 5. Improved performance may be due to skills acquired with age, such as those devoted to feeding and balancing energy demands, which are necessary to prepare and maintain individual condition prior to, and during, breeding.

Recent theoretical studies on population synchrony have focused on the role of dispersal, environmental correlation and density dependence in single species. Trophic interactions have received less attention. We explored how trophic interactions affect spatial synchrony. 2. We considered a host - parasitoid coupled map lattice to understand how the self-organizing spatial patterns generated by such dynamics affect synchrony. In particular, we calculated the spatial correlation functions (SCF) associated with travelling waves, spatial chaos and crystal lattices. 3. Travelling waves were associated with cyclic SCF (called second-order SCF) that differed greatly from those seen in spatial chaos or crystal lattices. Such U-shaped patterns of spatial synchrony, which have not been predicted by single-species models, have been reported recently in real data. Thus, the shape of the SCF can provide a test for trophically generated spatiotemporal dynamics. 4. We also calculated the cross-correlation function between the parasitoid and the host. Relatively high parasitoid mobility resulted in high within-patch synchrony of the dynamics of the two species. However, with relatively high host mobility, the parasitoid dynamics began to lag spatially behind those of the host. 5. We speculated that this spatial lag between the host and parasitoid is the ultimate source of travelling waves, because the spatial cross-correlation in turn affects host dynamics. 6.

The beetle larvae have a limited time to found pupae and can only parasitize one host pupa during their lifetime.

The female beetles adapt their oviposition decisions and their clutch size based on information associated with the presence of a host.

The California population of the pipevine swallowtail Battus philenor is a specialist on the Dutchman's pipe Aristolochia californica, an endemic vine that is densely covered with trichomes. Populations of B. philenor outside California use other Aristolochia species that are largely glabrous. The average clutch size of the pipevine swallowtail is larger in California compared with populations elsewhere and larvae feed gregariously until late in the third instar. 2. In the field, caterpillars consumed more leaf material and showed preference for portions of leaves with trichomes removed. However, large groups of caterpillars were consistently observed feeding on the apical portion of the plant, where trichome density was highest. Smaller groups of caterpillars were observed feeding more often on mature leaves on the lower portions of the plant, where trichome density was lower. 3. Laboratory experiments showed that the walking speed of a commonly observed predator, larvae of the green lacewing Chrysopa carnea, was reduced as trichome density increased. Furthermore, lacewing search efficiency and capture rate of a model prey item were compromised by high trichome density. 4. In an additional field experiment, no difference was found in the percentage mortality of groups of four and 12 caterpillars. However, growth rate of the larger group was accelerated by 25% compared with smaller groups. In an experiment using a ladybird beetle larva Hippodamia convergens as the predator, no difference was observed in absolute mortality of caterpillars, suggesting that group size does not function directly as a defence against predators. 5. First instar caterpillars are most vulnerable to predators, thus feeding in larger groups may benefit caterpillars by accelerating growth.

Using data on the spatial distribution of the British avifauna, we address three basic questions about the spatial structure of assemblages: (i) Is there a relationship between species richness (alpha diversity) and spatial turnover of species (beta diversity)? (ii) Do high richness locations have fewer species in common with neighbouring areas than low richness locations?, and (iii) Are any such relationships contingent on spatial scale (resolution or quadrat area), and do they reflect the operation of a particular kind of species-area relationship (SAR)? 2. For all measures of spatial turnover, we found a negative relationship with species richness. This held across all scales, with the exception of turnover measured as βsim. 3. Higher richness areas were found to have more species in common with neighbouring areas. 4. The logarithmic SAR fitted better than the power SAR overall, and fitted significantly better in areas with low richness and high turnover. 5. Spatial patterns of both turnover and richness vary with scale. The finest scale richness pattern (10 km) and the coarse scale richness pattern (90 km) are statistically unrelated. The same is true of the turnover patterns. 6. With coarsening scale, locations of the most species-rich quadrats move north. This observed sensitivity of richness 'hotspot' location to spatial scale has implications for conservation biology, e.g. the location of a reserve selected on the basis of maximum richness may change considerably with reserve size or scale of analysis. 7. Average turnover measured using indices declined with coarsening scale, but the average number of species gained or lost between neighbouring quadrats was essentially scale invariant at 10-13 species, despite mean richness rising from 80 to 146 species (across an 81-fold area increase).

We hypothesize that differences in host-handling times among three closely related encyrtid parasitoids (Metaphycus anneckei Guerrieri & Noyes, Metaphycus hageni Daane & Caltagirone and Metaphycus lounsburyi [Howard]) are influenced by the defences of their host, black scale (Saissetia oleae [Olivier]). Two forms of host defence were examined: (i) the scale's possession of a hard integument, and (ii) the effect of ants tending S. oleae. 2. Duration of host assessment, host rejection, drilling/oviposition and the presence or absence of host feeding were measured for M. anneckei, M. hageni and M. lounsburyi. Results show that M. anneckei oviposits through the soft ventral integument while M. hageni and M. lounsburyi oviposit through the harder dorsal integument. M. anneckei was never observed to host feed while both M. hageni and M. lounsburyi use hosts for either oviposition or host feeding. The ventral drilling location and absence of non-concurrent host feeding significantly reduced the overall host-handling time of M. anneckei, relative to M. lounsburyi and M. hageni. 3. Oviposition success of M. anneckei and M. hageni in the presence of ants was compared. An observation arena was established with the numbers of Argentine ants, Linepithema humile (Mayr) and S. oleae manipulated on potted oleanders. M. hageni and M. anneckei were placed, individually, onto the observation arena and their interaction with ants and S. oleae recorded. While 55.3% of M. anneckei successfully oviposited, M. hageni was unable to oviposit or host feed in the presence of foraging ants. 4. Field tests were conducted using potted oleander plants, infested with S. oleae, to determine the effect of L. humile on scale density, parasitism levels and parasitoid species composition.

The interspecific density-distribution relationship is a general and robust pattern that has been described as a rule in community ecology. Many theoretically plausible causes of the relationship have been described, but it is still disputed which factor(s) are most important. 2. Using data on the densities and distributions of butterflies and their host plants collected in a 35-km2 area of north Wales, and data on butterfly mobility, niche breadth, habitat breadth and distance from range margins, we examined five of the principal explanatory mechanisms. 3. We found that several variables were significantly correlated with density or distribution. Habitat breadth, mobility and distance from range margin had significant positive effects on butterfly distribution. Host-plant density was significantly positively related to butterfly density; mobility was significantly negatively related to density. 4. Despite these results, we could not unambiguously demonstrate that one hypothesis (or several interacting hypotheses) generated density-distribution correlations. The most conclusive evidence was that statistical patterns of distribution (aggregation models) underpinned the positive density-distribution relationship seen amongst the more mobile butterflies. The results provided evidence against the metapopulation dynamic explanation, and were equivocal with respect to the contributions of range position, niche breadth and resource availability. 5. An alternative approach was to explore deviations from the underlying relationship between density and distribution, rather than concentrating on the correlation itself. This approach was much more successful: we demonstrated that species that occurred at high densities relative to their distributions used aggregated resources and were relatively sedentary; whereas those that occurred at low densities relative to their distributions used less aggregated resources, and were more mobile. Mobile species had less aggregated distributions than did relatively sedentary species. 6. Given that the interspecific density-distribution pattern appears to be almost ubiquitous and that the proposed explanations are not mutually exclusive, faster progress may be made by examining deviations from the pattern than from further analysis of the pattern itself.",48,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Abundance | Metapopulation dynamics | Niche breadth | Range-size | Resource density,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,97

It is commonly accepted that many adaptations characterize carnivores that live in water. However, no comparative tests have ever shown systematic differences between aquatic and terrestrial carnivore species as a whole. We examine numerous hypotheses that purport to distinguish aquatic and terrestrial carnivores using 20 morphological, life history, physiological and ecological traits. 2. Using the method of independent contrasts with a complete species-level phylogeny of extant carnivores, we found few differences between aquatic and terrestrial species. Compared to terrestrial sister taxa, aquatic carnivores are streamlined (increased head and body length for a given body weight), have larger brains, smaller litter sizes, shorter interbirth intervals, and shorter lifespans. 3. Some of these differences are important functionally. Larger brain size may be related to increased cognitive and sensory needs required for an amphibious lifestyle; smaller litters are likely associated with increased neonatal survival amidst competition for suitable breeding sites and advantages accruing to increased precociality. 4. We conclude that broad differentiation of carnivores into aquatic and terrestrial ecotypes is not useful given that adaptive differences between these groups are limited and seemingly no more numerous than those that occur within each ecological group.",19,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Aquatic adaptations | Comparative method | Independent contrasts | Phylogeny | Terrestrial ecology,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,98

The effects of temperature and interspecific competition among two parasitoids (Aphytis maculicornis (= paramaculicornis) (Masi)-Coccophagoides utilis Doutt) of the olive scale (Parlatoria oleae (Colvée)) were examined, and the reason for the successful biological control of olive scale explained. 2. An age-structure distributed maturation time model of this system was developed that simplifies many of the details of prior physiologically based models. 3. Temperature-dependent physiological indices were used to scale fecundity and survivorship rates from their maximum values. 4. The distributed maturation time population dynamics model captured the variance in temperature-related development times required to simulate the dynamics of the system. 5. A type III ratio-dependent functional response was used to estimate parasitism rate on olive scale and also served to stabilize our single patch model. 6.

The effect of mobility and spatial scale,Cowley M.J.R.,Journal of Animal Ecology,00218790,70,3,410-425,2001-01-01,May 2001,10.1046/j.1365-2656.2001.00508.x,"1. Positive relationships between the density and distribution of species in taxonomic assemblages are well documented, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Two factors that are expected to be important in explaining variation in these relationships are the spatial scale of analysis and the relative mobility of the study species. 2. We examined density-distribution relationships in British butterflies at a variety of spatial scales. Distributions were proportions of grid squares occupied: 50 m grid within 0'25 km2 areas (local), 500 m grid in 35 km2 (regional), 10 km grid across England, Wales and Scotland (national), 153 000 km2 grid squares across Europe (European), and also seven categories of international distribution (Global; 1 - European endemic to 7 = in 5 + continents). Densities were measured using transect counts at local, regional and national scales. 3. Different relationships between density and distribution occurred at different scales of analysis. When we controlled for the effects of mobility and/or phylogenetic association, a positive relationship between density and distribution was apparent at local, regional and national scales. Species' national densities in Britain were positively correlated with their European distribution sizes, but significantly negatively correlated with their global range sizes. 4. Butterfly mobility had a positive effect on distribution and a negative effect on density at all spatial scales. For a given total abundance, more mobile species had lower densities but wider distributions, i.e. they were less aggregated than more sedentary species. 5. The decreasing strength of the density-distribution correlation, and the eventual reversal of the pattern, with the increasing magnitude of difference between the scale at which density was measured relative to distribution, suggests that some element of niche may be important in determining densities and distributions. However, the measure of niche breadth analysed did not explain significant variation in density, distribution, or in the density-distribution relationship.",145,Journal,ar,Article,100,10,10,Abundance | Butterfly Monitoring Scheme | Dispersal | Phylogeny | Range-size | Rarity,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,100

As many species of marine benthic invertebrates have a limited capacity for movement as adults, dispersal mode is often considered as a determinant of geographical ranges, genetic structure and evolutionary history. Species that reproduce without a larval stage can only disperse by floating or rafting. It is proposed that the colonization processes associated with such direct developing species result in spatial distributions that show relatively greater fine scale patchiness than the distributions of species with a larval dispersal stage. This hypothesis was tested by collecting molluscs at different spatial scales in the Isle of Man. 2. Spatial distribution patterns supported the predictions based on dispersal mode. Estimated variance components for species with larval dispersal suggested that the majority of the spatial variation was associated with variation between shores. In comparison, there was relatively more variability within shores for abundance counts of species with direct development. 3. Multivariate analyses reflected the univariate results. An assemblage of direct developers provided a better discrimination between sites (100 m separation) but the group of species with larval dispersal gave a clearer separation of shores (separated by several km). 4. The fine scale spatial structure of direct developing species was reflected in higher average species diversity within quadrats. Species richness also reflected dispersal mode, with a higher fraction of the regional species pool present for direct developers in comparison to species with larval dispersal. This may reflect the improved local persistence of taxa that avoid the larval dispersal stage.",49,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Direct development | Larval dispersal | Mollusca | Spatial distribution,29544,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,101
