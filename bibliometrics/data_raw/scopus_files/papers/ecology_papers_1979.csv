Fields 1 and 2, located near a nuclear-fuel reprocessing facility that had released approximately 640 mCi (24 GBq) 238Pu and 570 mCi (21 GBq) 239,240Pu to the atmosphere in the 20 yr preceding sampling. Field 1 was 230 m from the point of release (a 62-m stack) and contained 57 nCi (2.1 kBq) 238Pu/m2 and 255 nCi (9.4 kBq) 239,240Pu/m2. Field 2 was 420 m from the stack and contained 15 nCi (0.56 kBq) 238Pu/m2 and 79 nCi (2.9 kBq) 239,240Pu/m2. The distribution of Pu between soil and vegetation components was similar in the two fields with only 1.3% of the 238Pu and 0.2% of the 239,240Pu occurring in pines, herbaceous vegetation and litter. More of the Pu could be suspended from the soil into the atmosphere by a 6 m/s wind on Field 1 than on Field 2 due to the lower biomass of herbaceous vegetation and litter on Field 1. Approximately 2% of the 238Pu and 0.5% of the 239,240Pu could be resuspended on Field 1, whereas only 0.5% of the 238Pu and 0.1% of the 239,240Pu could be resuspended on Field 2. Plutonium contamination of the vegetation occurred primarily by (1) direct deposition of recently released Pu onto vegetation, and (2) resuspension of Pu from the soil to vegetation surfaces. Root uptake apparently made negligible contributions to the Pu contents of the above-ground vegetation.",19,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,1

Specific energetic parameters of an isopod, Oniscus asellus, and an earthworm, Eisenia foetida, and 4 sludges were determined under a variety of conditions. Oxygen consumption rates for O. asellus, E. foetida, and sludge were measured from 5° to 30°C and found to fit an exponential formulation expressed as Q10. The earthworm had a 39% lower respiration rate when food was present. The respiration rate of sludge was directly proportional to its moisture content although the history of the moisture regime also affected oxygen consumption with recently wetted sludge having the highest rate. The aging of sludge brought about an exponential decline in respiration rate. Egestion rates for O. asellus and E. foetida were determined gravimetrically from 5° to 37°C. Egestion was maximal at 20°C for O. asellus and 15°C for E. foetida. The effect of temperature on egestion was formulated as a modified Krogh curve. Moisture above a threshold level was found to have no effect on egestion. Sludge type had a marked effect on egestion rate with one sludge even being toxic, although egestion rates were generally similar to those found for other substrates. Sludge egested from the macroinvertebrates had a respiration rate 2.82 times greater than non-eaten sludge. Using the derived functional relationships and constants, along with published values of assimilation efficiency, a Fortran simulation model INDEC was constructed for predicting the effect of macroinvertebrate feeding on decomposition. Model predictions were compared with values obtained from sludge-invertebrate microcosms, and a high correlation (r = .916, N = 60) was found. The importance of macroinvertebrates in stimulating biological activity in heterotrophic systems was discussed and related to specific parameters of the INDEC model. The roles of specific energetic conversions, such as secondary production, in affecting decomposition processes were demonstrated.",11,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,2

White oak (Quercus alba) leaf litter decomposition and litter and soil microarthropod populations were studied in control and treated areas. Weight loss of natural white oak leaf litter averaged 35% for the 1st yr and reached 67% after 2 yr. Litter decomposition rates were similar to control and treated areas. However, white oak leaves defoliated through stem injections lost 59% of their biomass in 1 yr. Decomposition was incresed because of initially higher N levels and a lower C:N ratio in defoliated leaf tissue. Herbicide spray treatment increased microarthropod densities for up to 8 mo after application. The herbicide spray apparently influenced springtail and mite reproductive activity in treated area. The increases in soil and litter microarthropod densities were not sufficient to affect leaft litter weight losses. Repeated defoliation of plant communities and the resulting increased decomposition rates could cause imbalances in litter dynamics and cycling processes. Changes in the timing of annual litterfall and the rates of nutrient release may thus lead to soil desiccation and the depletion of available nutrient pools.",12,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,3
