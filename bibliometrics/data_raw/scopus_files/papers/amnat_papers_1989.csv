A zooplankter's weight in water, weight per mass and sinking speed are likely to change non-linearly with animal growth, may change quite rapidly at certain stages of development, and may have maxima or minima. The changes could have significant energetic implications for zooplankton.

Polygyny in this species is probably best explained by models in which polygyny either has a net benefit or has no cost or benefit to females and in which the degree of polygyny is increased by female choice based on territory quality. In pied flycatchers, Ficedula hypoleuca, polygynous mating does seem to be costly to females. We can reject models in which females are forced to pay the cost because of a skewed sex ratio and those in which females are compensated for the cost. Polygyny in pied flycatcher is explained by models in which females pay a cost of polygynous mating for which they receive no compensation; discrimination among cost no-compensation models is difficult. Evidence regarding whether polygyny is costly to females is less conclusive in the other species examined, but what evidence there is supports a cost in marsh wrens Cistothorus palustris, and no cost in yellow-headed blackbirds Xanthocephalus xanthocephalus.

Analysis showed 3 basic results. 1) The annual life cycle is optimal under low storage efficiency, low habitat reliability, low growth rate, and a short growing season. 2) Under any other conditions, perennial growth is optimal. During years in which the final amount of resources is smaller than a critical value, the plant remains immature and saves all of the resources for the next season. If it becomes larger, the plant invests the excess in reproductive activities and repeats the same growth schedule thereafter (steady state). 3) Reproductive effort of a mature plant is high for an annual, is lowest for a perennial just above the threshold for the perennial growth pattern, increases as the length of the season increases, and in a very productive habitat may even exceed the level for an annual. The ratio of the plant size established by stored material to the maximum plant size decreases with the length of the growing season. Growth patterns and leaf phenology of many deciduous plants indicate that the nonlinearity of photosynthetic rate as a function of the size of the production part is important. For a case with nonlinear photosynthesis but without an upper limit to the leaf expansion rate, a plant's optimal phenology, if normalized by size, can be parameterized by productivity (maximum relative growth rate multiplied by a season's length) and stability (annual survival multiplied by storage efficiency). Timing of the cessation of leaf production within a season by a small immature plant is determined by productivity (occurring later in a more productive habitat). Leaf production ends earlier in the season as the plant grows. The optimal time for ending leaf production in a mature plant is controlled mainly by stability (ceasing earlier at the more stable site) and is almost independent of productivity. -from Authors"

Males displayed in scattered leks (75-300 m apart) comprising 3-15 males. Within each lek, an alpha and beta male, with strict relative dominance ranks, performed most of the courtship display. Of 50-60 active males per season, only 6-8 males were well-established alpha males in leks with consistent levels of dual-male displays (calls and dances). Demographic data suggest that males may be â¥8 yr of age before attaining beta status. Alpha tenure can last fromn 2 to at least 4 yr. Alpha males were rarely or never seen in perch zones other than their primary perch zone (their area of dominance). Lower-ranking males maintained simultaneous affiliations with males in as many as 6 different zones. Each zone, therefore, acted as a hub in which males with different affiliations around the rim came into contact. Marked changes occurred in male traits with increasing age and status: 1) significant declines in weight throughout the life span, without loss of dominance status; 2) a 4 yr delay in plumage maturation with distinct subdefinitive, transitional stages; 3) reduction in the number of perch zones with which older males maintained affiliations; and 4) increasing probability of copulatory success. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that subdefinitive plumages in this species serve primarily as accurate indicators of age, which in turn largely determines status, and that males queue for positions in an age-based dominance system. Direct benefits to cooperation by the beta male consisted of rare immediate copulations and eventual ascent to alpha status. The high variance of mating success means few opportunities for success by younger males and should favor long-term strategies, such as cooperation and delayed plumage maturation, that enhance the prospects of future success. -from Author"

With >2 sibs, the difference in the shares of 2 consecutive members of the hierarchy should increase down the dominance rank, such that the greatest difference in fitness occurs between the last 2 members, and the least between the top 2. Fitness differences are most exaggerated when resources are relatively scarce. In a 2nd model, these conclusions related to ""long-term aims' (ideal states to be achieved by the end of the nestling period). If we allow that, at a given time, sibs may differ markedly in their profit from food uptake, there quite clearly become instances when a dominant sib should allow a weaker nest mate to take more of a given meal. Roughly, this should occur at the moment during a given feeding bout when the asymptotic increment in fitness for the weaker sib is more than twice that for the stronger sib. A 3rd model investigates a case in which a sib's share of the resource is determined by competitive begging. Each sib can increase its share by a unilateral increase in its begging expenditure. Phenotypic strategies are sought for such expenditures that are evolutionarily stable, one for each sib, given that a stronger sib gains more resources for a given effort. For 2 sibs, the weaker sib always spends more on begging, and the stronger sib's expenditure decreases as the competitive asymmetry between sibs increases. The disparity between begging efforts is actually greater when resources are plentiful, and although the stronger sib's share is greater when resources are scarce, the weaker sib may (paradoxically) attain the greater share when resources are plentiful. Despite this latter effect, the net gain (food uptake minus begging cost) of the stronger sib is always higher and its fitness therefore greater. Preliminary field tests of these models, using great egret Casmerodius albus, are presented. -from Authors"

The model proposes that seabirds from neighboring colonies typically occupy nonoverlapping feeding zones and that colony population is a function of the size of these zones. The model assumes that birds recruiting as 1st breeders choose the colony in which feeding conditions are most favorable. If colonies are not limited in nest-site availability and if nest-site quality is uniform among colonies, differential recruitment will lead to an equality of feeding conditions among colonies, as predicted by ideal-free theory. Such variable recruitment is plausible because at least some seabird species frequently recruit to non-natal colonies. Where neighboring colonies overlap in potential foraging range, feeding-habitat use in the area between colonies should also reach an equilibrium defined by the need to minimize travel costs between the feeding site and the colony. Birds should not regularly feed closer to colonies other than their own, because if they did so they should also nest at the closer colony, hence saving travel time to the feeding site. The zone of feeding habitat that is closer to a colony than to any neighboring colony may be termed the colony's hinterland. If birds forage only within the hinterland and if populations are regulated by the food supply in a region of uniform ocean productivity, then colony size should be a function of hinterland size. -from Author"

The latter could take place either because the dominant is the species most resistant to deleterious physical or biotic conditions or because it is superior in competition to all others. One possible mechanism enabling one species to replace and exclude many others is the possession of an ectomycorrhizal (EM) association. Most tropical tree species sampled in the Neotropics and Africa have a different type, the vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) association. Various characteristics of the EM association, eg greater host specificity the greater protection it gives its host from natural enemies and deleterious physical factors, and its ability to secure nutrients in both organic and inorganic form before they are available to a VAM association, may confer an advantage on its host tree species that allows it to replace itself and to displace or exclude VAM host trees. In forests where the VAM type is more common, most tree species are associated with the same set of fungal species and thus may be nearly equivalent in competitive ability for securing resources. Such equivalence promotes diversity. Examples of nonpersistent dominants (type II) are those that first colonize large open patches (>1 ha). Dominance probably results when few species are available for colonization during the short period open to invasion after a disturbance and few are adapted to the conditions in recently disturbed large patches. After a single EM tree species achieves dominance in a type-I forest, other species in the same family are more likely to invade than are those of a different family. Thus, a many-species VAM rain forest might gradually shift to one with a single EM species dominant, leading to a forest of higher diversity dominated by several species from a few families that associate with EM fungi. -from Authors"

The host also has many types of reactions and defenses. A simple phenomenological model shows how evolution by natural selection could explain this diversity, and why the diversity of a host roughly corresponds to the diversity of a parasite. At the level of species diversity of hosts and parasites, the model provides a theoretical basis for Eichler's rule. The model is based on a 2-player (host, parasite), zero-sum game. The model assumes that the elements of the payoff matrix are chosen at random, once and for all, and supposes that the host and parasite contend over changes in the parasite's net rate of reproduction. The model implies that it is to each player's advantage to diversify its strategies if the cost of additional strategies can be neglected. Analysis gives bounds on how quickly each player must diversify, relative to its opponent, to avoid any change in average net rate of reproduction (NRR). Within these bounds, the probability of a substantial change in average NRR for either player tends to zero as both players diversify. When the change in NRR for different strategies is generated by a random mechanism, which on the average does not favor either player, an antagonistic host-parasite relation will either evolve large numbers of parasite and host strategies or else become evolutionarily unstable. It is not necessary to invoke selective effects of multiple species of parasites and multiple species of hosts to explain this diversity of strategies. Even directly opposed interests can be stabilized by sufficient diversification of strategies on both sides. -from Authors"

The MVT departure rule predicted that there should be 2 departure thresholds, one for the 1st flower visited and another for the 2nd. Several stochastic-threshold rules were also examined; the threshold varied as a function of a bee's recent reward experience and memory of it. Again, a multiple-threshold rule accurately described bee behavior. -from Author"

Since low temperatures reduce photosynthesis more in light-saturated leaves than in unsaturated leaves, mechanisms that minimize saturation are especially important for trees that may carry out substantial photosynthesis at low temperatures.

The nested analysis of variance addresses this problem by partitioning variance and covariance between taxonomic levels. Estimation of variance components and the derived intraclass correlation coefficient can be used to describe the overall increase in variation through time and the relation between variances at different taxonomic levels. Applying this procedure to data about the body mass of eutherian mammals showed a steep increase in variance associated with the adaptive radiation of the group in early Tertiary times, with much lower rates of increase thereafter; chromosome number varies more between taxa at lower levels of classification than does body mass. The variance of species within genera increased with the geologic age of the genus, permitting a quantitative description of the rate of evolutionary divergence. It is argued that covariance between taxa is attributable to ancestry and covariance within taxa to function, and that adaptive hypotheses should be tested by the within-taxon correlation.

The hypothesis that the expression of provisioning behavior by nonbreeding auxiliaries is an unselected consequence of the evolution of communal breeding is presented as an alternative. The functional significance of nonbreeders' feeding offspring is irrelevant with respect to the evolutionary origin of the behavior because provisioning offspring is a constraint of many present-day species of birds, including those with helpers at the nest. A model depicts provisioning by nonbreeding auxiliaries as an expression of a heterochronic change in ontogeny brought about as a result of a shift in life-history pattern (ie reduced breeding dispersal and parental tolerance). Because the cost to nonbreeding birds of exhibiting provisioning may be low relative to the benefits of (normal) parental provisioning, selection pressure on ""helping' may be negligible. However, further evidence suggests that even if the costs were high, evolving the ability to discriminate between the contexts of the stimuli evoking the provision response would be difficult. Furthermore, even though the occurrence of communal breeding correlates almost perfectly with the occurrence of helping, estimates of inclusive fitness cannot be used to argue that there has been (separate) selection for provisioning by helpers.

This selection event was followed by another favoring birds with deep beaks capable of extracting the only available food, arthropods from beneath the bark of trees and within Opuntia trunks and old pads. For young birds, the ability to develop (learn) techniques for extracting a new food item was a better predictor of survival than was bill shape. Among the group that acquired these skills, more of the birds with deep bills survived, as was the case for the adults. During 1984, males that obtained females had deeper bills than those that failed to do so. Because this mating advantage did not occur in years without natural selection, birds with deep bills probably had more energy available for courtship. A parallel case of natural selection is described in a sympatric congener, G. magnirostris in which birds with deep beaks capable of cracking large and hard Cordia lutea seeds were favoured. The population has undergone little or no evolutionary change in bill dimensions in response to selection during the last 9 yr despite the presence of high levels of additive genetic variance. Evolutionary change has not occurred because the action of selection on one trait in one direction has been counteracted by selection in the opposite direction on another, positively correlated trait. Changes in the proportions of dry-season niches among years cause changes in the proportions of birds with certain beak morphologies and feeding skills best suited to exploiting them.

This behavior can stabilize the otherwise unstable, discrete-time, Nicholson-Bailey model, typically at the cost of increasing the host equilibrium density. The key feature that produces both effects in this model appears to be the absence of within-generation dynamics; in particular, parasitoids are not able to reaggregate in response to changes in local host density within the generation. The effects of aggregation on the otherwise neutrally stable Lotka-Volterra model are examined, allowing the parasitoid to reaggregate continually as local host density changes. Aggregation appears as positive covariance between the parasitoid and host density across patches, affecting the model by altering the initially linear functional response. Aggregation always increases parasitoid efficiency and hence reduces host equilibrium density. The effects of aggregation on model stability are examined in several circumstances: 1) the parasitoid responds to a signal ranging from absolute to relative difference in local host density; 2) aggregation is linear or acclerating in response to this signal; 3) variance of the host distribution is related in various ways to the mean host density. When account is taken of the probable limits set on parameter values by theoretical considerations and field conditions, it appears that aggregation is typically destabilizing. -from Authors"

The 2 density measures are related as a function of the variances of local population size and resource and the covariance between them. Under some special ecological circumstances, the 2 measures are equivalent. Wealth can be measured as either the resource- or population-weighted reciprocal of local density, and again these measures are related by the variances and covariances of local resource and population.

This restriction of pollen removal could be achieved by a plant presenting only a small portion of its pollen at one time (packaging) and/or by limiting the amount of presented pollen that a pollinator removes during a single visit (dispensing). The restriction of pollen removal required to maximize the expected total deposition on stigmas depends on the number of pollinator visits a plant receives, variation in the frequency of visits, and the pattern of pollen removal during a series of visits. Many aspects of floral biology contribute to a plant's ability to restrict pollen removal, including inflorescence size, flower morphology, anthesis patterns, nectar production, and dichogamy.

In general, rainfall is a good predictor of reproductive output for the common grasses but not for the sparse.

Thus, the pattern of environmental fluctuations in moisture buffers the reproductive output of the sparse species. The common species track environmental fluctuations.

Early males apparently mate with early-season reproductive females that supersede orphaned nests or oviposit on satellites. The small number of males produced may represent a trade-off between their early-season reproductive value and their cost later in the season. The cost of an early male is the reproductive value of males and females that could have been produced in late summer if resources had been invested in workers. Satellite nest were closely associated with polydomous colonies, suggesting that a reduction in the ability of alpha foundresses to maintain their reproductive dominance of polydomous colonies leads to the expression of alternative reproductive behavior. Functional polygyny results in reduced genetic relationships between adults and reproductive offspring and should favor behavior that increases individual reproduction. Satellite nests were functionally like additional nests in polydomous colonies, but alpha foundresses (queens) were never observed on them, and spring-produced female offspring appear to have been the sole egg layers. Other unmated, nonreproductive (presumably worker) offspring incorporated satellite nests into the set of nests they worked. -from Authors"

It simulates a colony's foraging via a series of differential equations that quantify the forager activity, the food-source dynamics, the interactions of foragers and food sources, and the colony's energy budget for foraging, defined as the number of nonforagers that the foragers can feed. At the colonial level, the influence of the number of foragers and the size of the foraging area is examined; the colony's social structure, in which only a small proportion of workers forage, greatly limits its potential benefit, leading to the definition of a maximum socially compatible foraging benefit. This is measured in relation to forager characteristics (size and the possession or lack of a memory of food-source location) and to food-source characteristics (size and duration of availability). Foragers without memory obtain their highest benefit when the food sources equal in size their load-carrying capacity, but those with memory can exploit sources several times larger with nearly maximum benefit. There is always on forager size that achieves a maximum benefit greater than that of other sizes. Increasing the sources' duration of availability, or decreasing the competition for them, increases this size. Larger foragers achieve their maximum benefit with larger foraging areas and lower foraging densities. For sources of intermediate size and long availability, a large forager without memory has a higher benefit than a small one with memory; with short availability, the reverse is true. It is predicted that social insects foraging without recruitment or cooperation tend to group into 2 classes. One is characterized by large colonies, foragers, foraging areas, and prey, low foraging densities, and aggressive territorial behavior; the other class is the inverse. -Authors"

Since song is usually limited to sexually mature males and since females exhibited preferences with respect to various aspects of song, sexual selection may well have been involved. Specifically, it is assumed that imitative learning may give rise to a variant song that some females prefer over innate song and also that female preference is not affected by early song experience. However, the assumption of polygyny restricts the applicability of results, since most bird species are monogamous. Coevolution of imitative song and female preference from low initial frequencies requires a strong preference. Transmission from father to son is critical and must be efficient, unless compensated for by strong female preference. Initial increase of imitative song is less likely to occur if paternal song is forgotten and replaced by a new song learned from another adult male.

These costs are higher in leaves than in stems and tend to decrease from deciduous shrubs and forbs to graminoids to evergreen shrubs to mosses to lichens.

This broad tolerance of individuals from high latitudes has led to wider latitudinal extent in the geographical range of high-latitude species than of lower-latitude species. If low-latitude species typically have narrower environmental tolerances than high-latitude species, then equal dispersal abilities in the 2 groups would place more tropical organisms out of their preferred habitat than higher-latitude species out of their preferred habitat.

The model predicts that stand measurements form a linear band when the logarithm of aboveground stand biomass is plotted against the logarithm of plant density. The band appears narrow because biomass per unit of volume and the ratio of height to width are biologically constrained and vary much less than stand biomass or density. In the absence of systematic trends in either parameter, simple geometry would fix the slope of the band at - 1/2 . Thus, the extent of deviation from - 1/2 is of primary biological interest, since that deviation reflects biological trends in plant shape or packing density across the plant kingdom. Aboveground biomass, density, and height data from 370 plant stands revealed systematic trends in both parameters. Small plants growing at high densities tend to be relatively more slender and to pack more biomass per unit of volume than do larger plants in less dense stands. Herbaceous monocots are more slender and pack more biomass per unit of volume than herbaceous dicots, which are in turn higher in both measures than trees. Such trends yield an interspecific relationship with a slope shallower than the ideal - 1/2 value. The interspecific band encloses dynamic self-thinning lines that differ widely in slope; therefore, the static and dynamic relationships can be considered independently and are not simple facets of a single thinning ""law'. Many proposed interpretations of the constant in the dynamic self-thinning equation can be more clearly applied to a new constant calculated for single stands from the product of biomass per unit of volume and the ratio of height to width. -from Author"

Pollination ecologists should be wary of using standing crop to measure encountered crop. When resources in a patch renew at a constant rate, systematic foraging (reducing the standard deviation but not the mean of the inter-arrival time) does not increase the mean resource abundance encountered by a forager. However, systematic foraging may increase the fitness of a territorial forager because it reduces mean standing crop and therefore intruder pressure, and systematic foraging may increase the fitness of a risk-averse forager because it reduces the standard deviation of encountered crop. When the rate of resource renewal in a patch depends on the amount of resource in that patch, systematic foraging alters the mean resource abundance encountered by a forager.

If the effects of endothermy are included in the model developed to account for the evolution of viviparity in reptiles, then qualitative and quantitative differences in embryonic developmental rates are predicted between reptiles and birds as a result of eggs being retained within the uterine environment. This modification offers an explanation for the total absence of viviparity in birds. The evolutionary sequence for mammalian viviparity from an endothercm viviparous ancestor was probably through the progressive production of smaller eggs, with proportionally shorter embryonic developmental times, which would allow for relatively longer periods of egg retention before oxygen-supply constraints would be reached.
