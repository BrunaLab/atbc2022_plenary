A 90-km2 landscape, originally occupied by rain forest, consisted of forest fragments and natural corridors of vegetation surrounded by pasturelands. Artificial strips of vegetation also were present as live fences. Bats were sampled with mist nets set at ground level in 52 forest fragments, three corridors, nine shaded plantations, six unshaded plantations and three live fences. We sampled each site twice, each time for a 5-h period for two consecutive nights. Bats were captured and released and the species identity and reproductive condition of adult females were recorded. Annual fruiting phenology and fruit production was measured with fruit traps in a forest site in three 500 × 20-m transects. We captured 4799 bats of 39 species. At forest sites we recorded 97% of the species and captured 44% of the bats. In corridors we captured 76% of the species and 16% of the total individuals. In the plantations we captured 71% of the species and 32% of the individuals. In the live fences we captured 32% of the species and 8% of the individuals. Three species, Pteronotus parnelli, Carollia brevicauda and Glossophaga soricina, accounted for 52% of all bat captures. Fruit-eating species and fruit-eating insectivores accounted for 65% of captures. Fleshy fruits were available year-round, but a seasonal pattern was evident. Presence of lactating females seemed to be associated, in general, with rainfall and fruiting seasonality, but individual species displayed different patterns ranging from aseasonal polyoestry to seasonal bimodal polyoestry, seasonal polyoestry and seasonal monoestry.

This synthesis concentrates on the life-history period from seed to adult plant and indicates that important hurdles have been demonstrated for some species in some habitats.

The pollination syndrome approach was used because it integrates characteristics of flowers and their pollinators into an evolutionary framework that allowed experimental testing of predictions. The flowers of A. vulgate displayed traits that were typical of both beetle and wind pollination syndromes. The protogynous inflorescences produced heat and odour during nocturnal anthesis, had numerous stamens with copious, light pollen, and were visited by hordes of beetles that used the inflorescences as feeding, mating and oviposition sites. In contrast, some of these features, such as numerous stamens with copious, light pollen, a high pollen to ovule ratio, and no obvious production of visitor rewards, were also typical of the wind pollination syndrome. However, floral rewards appeared to be tissues of the fleshy staminate petals and pollen that were readily devoured by the beetles. In addition to the Coleoptera, insect visitors to A. vulgare inflorescences included several species of Hymenoptera, Diptera and Orthoptera. However, only Nitidulidae and Curculionidae beetles were effective insect pollinators. Pollination treatments showed that wind pollination was possible, but fruit set was significantly higher for female flowers visited by beetles. Although a pollen/ovule ratio of 50 000:1 and outcrossing index confirmed an outcrossing breeding system, pollination experiments suggested that A. vulgate had the potential for self pollination. Therefore, the breeding system might be best classified as facultatively xenogamous (cross fertilizing). The predictive value of potential pollinator agents for A. vulgare was inadequate because its floral traits were indicative of both cantharophilous and anemophilous pollination syndromes.",23,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Anemophilous palm | Cantharophilous palm | Coleoptera | Curculionidae | Nitidulidae | Outcrossing index | Pollination syndrome | Xenogamous breeding system,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,5,NA,NA

All tree seedlings showed an increase in maximum assimilation rate (Amax) with canopy openness (CO) until a certain threshold was reached. This saturation threshold varied between species. A steady increase in the maximum assimilation rate over the entire range of canopy openness explored was found only for Piper.

The hypothesis that seed survival and seedling recruitment depending on seed size, are related to forest type and the intensity of harvesting and stand refinement was therefore tested at Paracou, French Guiana, for three animal-dispersed tree species. Two forest areas, corresponding to two forest types, were selected based on the occurrence of a dominant species, Eperua falcata (Caesalpiniaceae). Two factors were tested: forest type (E. falcata-rich and E. falcata-poor) and level of harvesting (unlogged, low intensity of logging, low intensity of logging and thinning liberation by tree-poison girdling) within each forest type. Overall, there was no effect of species nor of logging treatment within forest type after 6 wk. There was only a significant effect of forest type on seed survival in the large-seeded Carapa procera, a rodent-dispersed species in the Meliaceae. In the two medium-sized seed species, Pradosia cochlearia and Manilkara bidentata, two frugivore-dispersed Sapotaceae, the effect of treatment was overall significant but was also highly variable between plots within treatments. After 1 y, C. procera showed little seedling recruitment due to low seed removal and dispersal, and high seed-seedling predation under all conditions. Neither forest type, nor treatment nested within forest type, affected seedling recruitment in P. cochlearia whereas M. bidentata seedlings were favoured in unlogged conditions at the E. falcata-poor forest type. These results suggest that species characteristics (such as seed size and palatability), or local tree diversity and resources for granivores select for contrasting patterns in tree recruitment between forest type in the rodent-dispersed tree species, and these interact with level of tree harvesting and stand refinement in the other frugivore-dispersed tree species.",22,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Carapa procera | Eperua falcata | Manilkara bidentata | Paracou | Pradosia cochlearia | Seed | Seedling | Selective logging,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,7,NA,NA

This species favours small, herbaceous larval foodplants that either die off annually or exhibit marked declines in leaf quality during the dry season. As expected, reproductive activity in H. bolina was broadly correlated with both rainfall and humidity, with individuals spending part of the dry season (early April to late August) sheltering in overwintering sites in a state of reproductive diapause. The timing of the overwintering period was similar between the 2 years, which suggests that individuals respond to seasonally predictable cues such as photoperiod.

Plant and leaf traits were correlated with interspecific variation in attack by herbivores and pathogens in order to account for differences among plant species. Across all species, pathogen damage was 1.5 times higher than insect damage (17.3% vs. 6.8%, respectively). Most insect damage occurred to young leaves while they were expanding (end of the dry season). In contrast, pathogen attack was low on young expanding leaves at the end of the dry season, increased as those leaves matured in the wet season, but continued to increase through the next dry season. Protein-binding capacity was negatively associated with interspecific differences in insect damage to mature leaves. Protein availability and plant height were positive predictors of pathogen attack among plant species, while leaf expansion rate was a significant negative predictor. Interspecific differences in leaf phenology had little effect on the amount of damage caused by either insects or pathogens. However, new leaves produced during the wet season suffered less insect damage than leaves produced during the dry season, the time of greatest leaf production. Timing of young leaf production affected pathogen attack but the season of escape depended on plant species. In contrast, there was no evidence for escape in space as common species were less likely to suffer high pathogen attack than rare species.

Annual growth, in both species, was dependent on annual and/or monthly variation in local precipitation but less so on temperature. For each species, however, patterns of growth reflected unique degrees of sensitivity to monthly rainfall and rainfall during previous years. It is hypothesized that such differences were due to the rooting depth of these species. A review of the literature also indicated similar diverse cambial growth responses by tropical trees to variation in annual and monthly climate. Lastly, it was shown that variation in longer term fluctuations in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, as measured by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), significantly influenced local precipitation in Guanacaste only during the wettest portion of the wet season. Such temporal sensitivity may have differentially influenced the longer-term growth of some tropical tree species but not others.

This study is based on a 14-mo investigation on avian diet, supplemented with a 3-y census of frogs and a 1-y census of lizards in a humid forest of central Panama. From 91 bird species, 1086 regurgitates were collected, in which were found 75 lizards and 53 frogs. Over 50% of the common, primarily insectivorous bird species preyed upon lizards or frogs, with a mean frequency of 0.26 prey/sample. These birds (22 species, nine families) foraged on various substrates from different strata of the forest, fed on invertebrates averaging from 3.3 to 17.2 mm in length, weighed from 11 to 195 g, and had bill lengths that varied from 12.2 to 49.8 mm. Based on a logistic regression analysis, intensity of foraging at army-ant swarms was the variable that best explained the likelihood that a bird species preyed upon lizards, leading to a classification that was 91% correct. In contrast, bill length and body length classified correctly 88% of the frog-eating birds, which showed a fairly constant 1:7 bill length/body length ratio (as opposed to a mean but highly variable 1:10 ratio in other species). A multiple regression analysis showed that seasonal variation in intensity of lizard predation was positively related to arthropod abundance except during the breeding season when lizard intake decreased, presumably because nesting birds did not follow ant swarms. Intensity of frog predation correlated with frog abundance over time, the latter being inversely related to arthropod availability. Ninety-seven per cent of all lizards and frogs identified in the diet samples (n = 105) were from two genera, Anolis and Eleutherodactylus, respectively. Prey size distribution in the regurgitates suggested an optimal prey size of 33.5 mm snout-vent length (SVL) for lizards and 14.5 mm SVL for frogs. Birds preyed opportunistically on the different Anolis species, but almost exclusively upon juvenile individuals. Abundances of the different Eleutherodactylus species correlated with their predation rates, but these frogs represented only 10% of all the frogs observed during the censuses.

Kinabalu in Borneo was carried out for 50 weeks across four vegetation types: a hill forest (800 m asl), a lower montane forest (1700 m), an upper montane forest (2000-3000 m) and a subalpine forest (3000-3500 m). In the hill forest, a large fruiting peak following the general flowering phenomenon was observed during October-November in 1996 and a fruitless period was observed during February-April in 1997. During the fruitless period, the number of resident frugivorous birds decreased. A bimodal fruiting pattern was observed in the lower montane forest. A large number of frugivorous temperate migrants were observed when the fruiting peak occurred. The number of resident frugivorous birds increased and several lowland bird species were observed, when the number of resident birds decreased in the hill forest. In the upper montane forest and the subalpine forest, more continuous and irregular fruiting patterns without outstanding peaks were observed and the number of resident frugivorous birds was more stable throughout the year. These suggested (1) there was a strong relationship between fruiting seasonality and seasonal dynamics of temperate migrants in the lower montane forest; (2) seasonal altitudinal movements of lowland bird species to montane vegetation might occur during the fruitless period in the lowland forest; and (3) the continuous fruiting pattern in the higher vegetation zones might be related to the scarcity of available frugivorous birds. The hypothesis that the influx of temperate migrants into the montane vegetation of Mt. Kinabalu is affected by density and habits of resident frugivorous birds is supported.

We re-examined the question by taking measurements on palms growing under the full range of conditions experienced in the natural environment. Using trunk height as a surrogate variable for ontogenetic stage, we found that individual palms undergo the transition to adult morphology over a wide range of heights from < 10 m to > 20 m. Palms growing in gaps undergo the transition early, whereas those growing under a closed canopy undergo the transition late. Noting this, we asked whether the transition occurred in individuals that were growing faster than a critical minimum rate, and found no correlation between growth and morphological stage.

Abundance of Uromys caudimaculatus was positively correlated with size of fragment and peaked in continuous forest.
