The distribution is roughly lognormal, corresponding to high skewing on a linear scale toward small geographical ranges, with a median geographical range of c1% of the area of North America; only 2% of the species have ranges >50% of this area. Skewing is high for bats, rodents, insectivores and lagomorphs and less pronounced for carnivores and artiodactyls. There are both latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in range size, with average ranges increasing to the North and to the East. At any one latitude, however, there is wide variability in range size. Corresponding to these gradients in range size are latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in species density, with density increasing as average range size decreases. These latitudinal gradients have long been appreciated, but the longitudinal gradients may ultimately prove more illuminating because they are less confounded by the kinds of systematic changes (in temperature, etc.) that accompany latitudinal change. With 23 distinct habitat types in North America, patterns both in geographical range and in species density are correlated with the number of different habitats a species range includes: high density of species and small geographical range sizes occur in areas of high habitat diversity. Correlations between the number of habitats (and the average geographical range of habitats) versus latitude and longitude explain some of the geographic variation in species' range patterns noted in this article.

The Trojan-sparrow strategy is successful for invading honest population states under all conditons, which indicates that the conventional badges-of-status model is fundamentally evolutionarily unstable in the absence of constraints limiting phenotypes to honesty.

Also, there was a clear difference in the density-wing form response between species in temporary and persistent habitats. Macropterous forms were triggered at lower densities for species inhabiting temporary rather than persistent habitats. However, males of species in temporary habitats were macropterous at both low and high rearing densities; macroptery was positively density-dependent in the females of these species and in both sexes of species in persistent habitats. Results suggest that habitat persistence influences the migratory capability of planthoppers: 1) by selecting for habitat escape, and 2) by dictating availability of mates. In persistent habitats wings are less necessary for habitat escape and they are rarely required for mate location. As a consequence and because wings impose a reproductive penalty, flightlessness prevails.

Such a species can become locally extinct on a regional or landscape scale in grasslands that experience both a variable rainfall, in which drought is characteristic, and sustained heavy grazing. The changes in the temporal and spatial patterns of grazing in human-influenced systems has created the possibility of local extinction. Catastrophic mortality of established populations occurs as a consequence of droughts in combination with sustained grazing, which eventually leads to the elimination of the population. Elimination of the established population is more likely to occur in semiarid than moist areas because of the greater frequency and duration of droughts. Maintenance or reestablishment of the population depends on successful recruitment, but seedling mortality is high because of intraseasonal drought and tramping. The seed bank of an extinction-prone species is rapidly eliminated if the output of seed is curtailed. These species do not form persistent seed banks because the seeds have a limited (2-3 yr) intrinsic capacity for survival when in a state of induced or enforced dormancy. Innate dormancy lasts for only a few months. Therefore, the size of the seed bank is determined primarily by the annual input of seed.

Cuckolder males would then maximize their reproductive success by preferentially intruding during female fertility on sites with little announcement. Intensive announcement of female fertility will be a phenotype-limited evolutionarily stable strategy, since benefits continue to accrue to males relative to their investment in announcement. If male announcement rate is an honest measure of male quality, neighboring females are predicted to choose males with a high announcement rate as extrapair copulation partners. Similarly, the interest taken by a male's own females in neighboring males should be inversely related to that male's announcement rate. Sexual selection should therefore drive the announcement strategy.

Euryophagous consumers use both predictable and highly variable hosts that often occur at low densities.

Two groups of potential hosts escape herbivory: apparent, predictable species whose chemistry is probably atypical of Capparales and species with low apparency and low predictability.

The authors propose that the inverse relation between apparency and palatability observed in temperate-zone studies in an intermediate stage in an evolutionary trajectory leading to permanent escape from herbivory as herbivores lose adaptation to seldom encountered hosts.

Generally, the strongest separation of species by habitat selection results from distinct-preference competition between species whose individuals have very limited abilities to assess the density of food in a patch. But if individuals have much ability to assess food density, there is little or no increase likely in their selectivity compared with the single-species case. Habitat selection may stabilize predation as well as competition. The conditions required for stabilization closely resemble those predicted by optimal-foraging theory: victims need to prefer the safer habitat most when their populations are lowest or when their chance of being killed in the riskier habitat is highest. Multispecies studies emphasize the potential for differential susceptibility and optimal habitat selection to maintain diverse communities. -from Author",491,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,68,NA,NA

A model for individual behavior integrates the effects of variability in individual genotypes with the current model of age and environmental determinism. Worker behavior is characterized by two elements: the proportion of time spent performing specific tasks (task specialization) and the temporal pattern of task performance (temporal division of labor). Evidence presented here suggests that these components may be independent of one another. Variation in the temporal pattern of performance of nest activities is independent of variation in the ontogeny of foraging behaviour. -from Authors,101,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,69,NA,NA

Rapid seed processing has influenced pulp composition and seed-packaging traits. In particular, the link between rapid passage of small seeds and pulp through the intestine may help explain why fleshy fruits are high in simple sugars and free amino acids.

The authors' hypothesis is that, contrary to other predators, the prey available to large aerial insectivorous bats is restricted to large prey.

If multiple plant lineages have evolved the new defense type, then they should be consistently more diverse than their sister groups when the latter retain the primitive defensive repertoire.

Among yearling fish, those that conceive broods early in the season do so at higher reserve levels than females that breed late in the season. Late breeding places less demand on stored energy, and postponement enables individuals with low initial reserves to breed without drawning energy stores down to lethal low levels. However, lipid reserves do not explain all of the size-based variation in breeding schedule. In fish of both age classes, small size causes a delay in breeding, independent of lipid reserves.

The local ESS stability condition therefore contributes more to a description of the dynamics of variation at an evolutionary equilibrium than to the description of the stability of the evolutionary equilibrium. -from Author",309,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,91,NA,NA

Theoretically, under hard selection, optimal habitat selection may often lower the probability of maintaining a polymorphism at a locus that affects adaptation to different habitats.

Two hypotheses, the active-defense hypothesis (AD) and the hypothesis of a carbon/nutrient balance (CNB), attempt to explain the mechanismn of such responses to defoliation. Manual defoliation of three fast-growing deciduous species (Grewia flavescens, Acacia tortilis, Dichrostachys cinerea) resulted in increased resistance to insect attack in the next year. Concomitantly, N and P concentrations in leaves decreased and leaf total phenol and condensed tannin concentrations increased. The slowly growing Burkea africana, Ochna pulchra and Euclea natalensis responded differently to manual defoliation. In the year following defoliation, leaf reistance to insect attack declined, concentrations of total phenols and condensed tannin in leaves decreased, and concentrations of N and P increased. These opposite responses are consistent with the expectations of CNB rather than AD. Defoliation of B. africana by caterpillars of one of its major defoliators, the saturniid moth Cirina forda, resulted in a greater loss of resistance than did manual defoliation of B. africana, further suggesting that the AD does not apply to B. africana.

This leads to the possibility that the weak full-sister versus half-sister discrimination shown by honey bees is partly due to a low diversity of odor cues. Low diversity of odor cues may also facilitate the evolution of highly cooperative worker behavior by making queen-rearing discrimination less worthwhile. -from Author",74,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,115,NA,NA

Sex allocation,Pamilo P.,American Naturalist,00030147,137,1,83-107,1991-01-01,1991,10.1086/285147,"The inclusive-fitness model gives a powerful method for analyzing the sex-allocation patterns of social insects, both at the level of individual colonies and at the level of populations. Genetic relatednesses and reproductive values, both of which are essential in constructing the inclusive fitness, are relatively easy to estimate empirically. The reproductive success of males and females, however, can in many cases be difficult to estimate. This is particularly so when workers should be counted as a sexual investment, because colonies either recruit daughter queens as new reproductives or form new colonies by fission. Results suggest that we can predict equilibrium investment ratios in such cases, provided that workers are counted as an investment. When daughter colonies are formed by budding and they remain in close contact with the mother colony and with each other, the fitness consequences can be complicated, and the expected investment ratios depend on local resource competition or local resource enhancement. -from Author",174,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,116,NA,NA

Single isolated workers become active spontaneously, but at no particular interval. One worker can stimulate another worker to become active, thus coupling their movement-activity patterns. As ants are placed in larger groups, the variation in the interval between activity peaks declines in a manner predicted by coupled-oscillator theory. The colony can be regarded as a population of excitable subunits. -from Author",103,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,117,NA,NA

A strong positive correlation between the relative persistence ability of a species and its density remains even after correcting for the sampling effect of area. This pattern is probably due to differences between species in extinction vulnerability attributable to density: the more abundant species persist longer in fragments. This differential vulnerability to extinction produces a pattern in which the bird species present in species-poor fragments are nested subsets of those in species-rich fragments. -Authors,207,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,118,NA,NA

Two models are derived from a generalized Lefkovitch model with immigration: 1) with constant seed rain; 2) considering seed rain as a function of the forest mosaic configuration that changes according to a Markov-chain process. This framework was used to analyze data for the pioneer tree Cecropia obtusifolia at Los Tuxtlas rain forest. The 1st model suggests that despite low soil-seed survival rates, high seed densities in all patch types in a forest mosaic may be explained by the abundant seed rain typical of pioneer species. An abundant seed rain to all patches enables the regeneration of this species despite high seed predation and pathogen attack rates in the soil. Analysis of the 2nd model suggests that increased gap formation in sites 2-35 yr since disturbance seems to alter seed availability of pioneers and patch dynamics less than an equal increase in gap formation in mature patches (>35 yr since disturbed). Extensive deforestation that alters seed-rain regimes will prevent regeneration of secondary species that have fast seed-bank turnover rates. -from Authors",62,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,119,NA,NA
