We show that optimal packing of flowers in fig syconia will result in a highly skewed distribution of style lengths and a positive skewness of pedicel lengths. These predictions were qualitatively tested in eight species of figs and the results indicate that observed style length distributions did not conform to those expected. We argue that while the pedicel lengths are likely to be a spinoff of optimal packing of the flowers, style lengths are probably shaped by independent selective forces. The pedicel lengths also are subjected to compensatory growth so as to place the stigmas at a common height in the central cavity for effective pollination of the flowers. This was substantiated by the response (dependence) of pedicels to (on) the length of the style, neck, and other floral features.

Plants that invest more in floral displays and/or rewards are expected to attract more pollinators than those that do not. A large number of plants, however, are severely pollen-limited yet either produce small rewards or none at all. The orchid, Comparettia falcata, is a pollinator- dependent, self-compatible epiphyte distributed throughout the Greater Antilles, Central and South America. In Puerto Rico where it is pollinated by the hummingbird Chlorostilbon maugaeus, C. falcata presents a smaller nectar reward than most other plants pollinated by the same species. To determine whether or not selection would favor the production of higher nectar levels, we enhanced the quantity of nectar offered by flowers in a Puerto Rican population for two flowering seasons. We monitored visitation frequencies, pollen movement, and reproductive success at three sites with different canopy coverages. Daily censuses of hummingbirds provided estimates of relative pollinator abundance. A multiway contingency test employing Wald's statistic showed no overall differences in reproductive success between plants with enhanced rewards and unmanipulated controls. Site differences, however, were clear. Plants of the mid- and high-light sites had greater success than those of the low-light site, and the differences were usually at least two-fold. There was a significant site-treatment interaction in reproductive success that could be attributed to the overall trend whereby controls of both mid- and high-light sites did better than the nectar-enhanced plants. Most of the observed pollinations (85%) with stained pollinia resulted in self-pollinations that did not differ among treatments.

Bromeliad plants behaved as islands in that, within forests, the species richness and abundance of their animal communities were significantly and positively correlated with increase in plant size. The amount of canopy debris they accumulated was similarly correlated with increase in plant size. Overall diversity was lowest in the dwarf forest, where plants were uniformly small. Animal communities were stable from year to year, and could be characterised for each forest type and for compartments within the plant. They showed a pattern of high dominance, which increased with elevation (McNaughton index 37, 54, and 73, respectively, for the tabonuco, palo colorado, and dwarf forest). Alpha-diversity for sites sampled in each year reflected net primary productivity (NPP) of the forest, declining with increasing elevation when animal abundance measures were used (jackknife estimates of Simpson's diversity index 6.54 and 11.04 [tabonuco], 3.53 and 6.22 [palo colorado], and 2.75 and 2.17 [dwarf forest]). Species richness over the two years, however, was highest in the intermediate palo colorado forest (187 species), compared to 146 and 88 in the tabonuco and dwarf forests, respectively. These figures were close to jackknife estimates of maximum species richness. The difference in species richness between tabonuco and palo colorado forests was significant in one year only. In addition to NPP, other factors, such as litter quality and the structural complexity of the habitat in the palo colorado forest, may have influenced species richness. The most abundant species in individual plants were also the most widely occurring, confirming known patterns of abundance and distribution in other functional groups.

Although severe drought is infrequent in Neotropical moist forest, we studied the water relations of shade-tolerant understory species with short or long leaf life spans during the severe 1991-1992 dry season on Barro Colorado Island, Panama.

Regeneration of Myoporum was uniformly very low in comparison. Invasive grass cover, which suppresses Sophora germination, was highest in mid-elevation woodland where Sophora dominated. The distribution of mature and sapling Sophora were both related to study site, reflecting previous ungulate browsing and uneven recovery due to grasses. Densities of Sophora snags were not different among any of the sites, suggesting a more even distribution in the past.

It is a dense-wooded, large, common canopy tree in primary peat swamp rain forest. Its seedlings, although shade tolerant, can grow rapidly in high light conditions, but frequently lack structural stability. Most juvenile stems (94% in the understory and 38% in canopy gaps) collapse under their own weight or from branchfalls. Fallen stems then ramify into vegetative sprouts, which in turn may collapse, perpetuating a vegetative juvenile cycle. Most recruitment is from sprouts rather than from seed. Structural analysis of stem dimensions shows that stems 2-8 cm DBH (diameter at breast height) are close to the theoretical buckling limit, especially for those dependent on neighboring vegetation to maintain vertical form. Trees > 4 cm DBH persisting as upright stems develop stilt root support and become structurally independent at ca 8 cm DBH. Eventually, as stems thicken, stilt roots anastamose and trees adopt the cylindrical growth form of mature canopy trees (up to 150 cm DBH). Thus, the vegetative life history strategy of the species is to: (i) regenerate a large 'ramet bank' from the majority of juveniles that fail structurally while suppressed in the understory, and (ii) to maximize height growth at the expense of diameter growth in high light conditions.

The elevated planting platforms raise the critical rooting zone of crops such as potatoes, quinoa, or barley above perennially saturated soils.

To test this hypothesis, nitrogen fixation was estimated in situ in the water column of canals, in the soils of planting platforms, in the soils of a dry hillside field, and in the sediments and water column of marshes and totora beds. Nitrogen fixation was significantly greater in the canals of the raised-field systems and in marshes compared to planting platforms and the hillside field.

Its habitat in Australia consists of small rain forest patches that are scattered through a savanna matrix. It is a mast flowering canopy species that produces large quantities of fruits fed on by mobile frugivores such as birds and fruit bats. The genetic diversity of this species was investigated, especially in relation to rain forest patch size, geographic isolation, and geographic distribution. Syzygium nervosum was found to have high levels of genetic diversity within populations (H(e) = 0.307). Diversity among populations, however, was relatively low (F(ST) = 0.118), and was not spatially structured across its geographic range in Australia. This is thought to have been caused by relatively frequent gene flow among populations (N(m) = 1.67), mediated primarily by mobile frugivores. Genetic diversity was not correlated with patch size or isolation. It is thought that seed dispersal by frugivores has acted to expand the effective population size of this species beyond the individual rain forest patch, and thus has prevented the substantial loss of genetic diversity that otherwise would have been observed. Thus this species is dependent upon these frugivores for the maintenance of its genetic diversity and hence its long-term viability.

Small light gaps (≤12 m2) were very common in Rhizophora mangle fringe, comprising almost 22 percent of these forests. Rhizophora mangle gaps were smaller than gaps in Avicennia germinans forests. In R. mangle forests, gaps were caused by branch death, and in A. germinans forests, gaps were caused primarily by downed trees.

The mean survival for all treatments in descending order were: Chrysophyllum pomiferum (89%), Pouteria peruviensis (84%), P. caimito (75%), and Micropholis venulosa (40%). For all variables, species differed significantly within litter treatments. In M. venulosa, survival and relative growth rate in leaf number significantly decreased with the removal of litter, whereas herbivory increased. Relative growth rate in height of P- peruviensis decreased significantly with litter removal, while the levels of herbivory were higher with the addition of litter. Conversely, litter quantity had no effect on the performance of C. pomiferum, but herbivory was lower in the removal treatment. Finally, in P. caimito, litter treatment did not affect performance or herbivory. Results suggest that differences in litter quantity differentially affect tree species with similar biology (i.e., large-seeds, shade tolerance) in life stages other than germination and early establishment.

We sampled young E. labios trees in disturbed forest to compare evidence of stem boring insect and stem miner damage in plants with and without colonies of C. quadriceps. Dissections of a subsample of plants showed that dipteran stem borers and stem miner damage were significantly more common in plants lacking C. quadriceps colonies than in plants with established colonies. Evidence from these dissections and from field counts of meristem damage caused by emerging borers suggested that coleopteran stem borers were also more abundant when ants were not present. In addition to the incidence of stem boring insects and ant colonies, we examined relative levels of leaf pubescence by measuring trichome density and leaf size for E. labios trees. We found that trichome density was significantly greater in trees with evidence of prior shoot damage (presumably from stem borer emergence at the meristem) but was not significantly related to the presence or absence of an ant colony. This prompted us to compare trichome density on leaves of nearby small trees and of different branches of the same tree, pairing a stem/branch that appeared damaged with one that appeared healthy. Trichome densities on leaves from damaged stems and branches were significantly greater than were trichome densities on healthy branches and stems. Based on these empirical data, we present several possible explanations for the patterns of association between ants, stem borers, and pubescence.

By studying an A. paca population in a Pacific lowland forest of Costa Rica, we developed indirect observational methods to estimate population density and food resource utilization. To estimate population density, we divided the number of A. paca burrows found in a 12-ha census area by the average number of burrows utilized per individual from radiotelemetry data. We compared this estimate to independent population estimates obtained using two transect methods. Agouti paca density was estimated at 93 individuals/km2 based on burrow number, and between 67 to 70 individuals/km2 using transect methods. This discrepancy corroborates previous studies suggesting that transect methods underestimate population density. To identify food resources consumed by the species, we collected fruits and seeds with unambiguous A. paca teeth marks. The only animal in Central America with an incisor width similar to A. paca is Dasyprocta variegata; in a comparison of both species, however, we found that A. paca had a significantly larger incisor width and that teeth marks of 4 mm or wider unambiguously indicated handling by this species. By applying this technique, food resources utilized by A. paca can be identified more easily than by direct observation.

This research examined the growth ecology of seedlings and trees of the Neotropical timber species, Carapa nicaraguensis (Meliaceae). Shadehouse experiments, field plantings, and growth rate analyses tested the hypothesis that Carapa seedlings and trees experience higher growth rates in high light levels (recently formed logging gaps or logged forest plots) than in low light levels (old logging gaps or undisturbed forest plots). Consistently poor seedling growth rates under low light conditions suggest that seedlings establishing in newly formed gaps will be more successful than those establishing in building-phase gaps. Thus, the first year after logging is a critical time for gap recolonization by Carapa, and seed casting into gaps after logging is recommended. Growth of Carapa trees was significantly faster in logged forest than in undisturbed forest, and was positively associated with light availability. The results provide evidence that harvest models can be both diameter- and illumination-based. Crown illumination was not significantly highest in logged forest than in undisturbed forest, indicating that the illumination scale for this study was not sensitive enough to detect increases in light availability brought about by selective logging.

During the six-month study period (June-November 1992) spider monkeys (Ateles paniscus) dispersed the seeds of 71 plant species, whereas howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus) dispersed seeds of 14 species. Spider and howler monkeys also differed greatly in their ranging behavior and defecation patterns, and as a consequence, produced different seed rain patterns. Monkey defecations were visited by 27 species of dung beetles (Scarabaeidae). Dung beetles buried 41 percent of the seeds in the dung, but the number of seeds buried varied greatly, according to seed size. Removal rates of unburied seeds by rodents varied between 63-97 percent after 30 d for 8 plant species. The presence of fecal material increased the percentage of seeds removed by seed predators, but this effect became insignificant with time. Although seed predators found some seeds buried in dung balls (mimicking burial by dung beetles), depth of burial significantly affected the fate of these seeds. Less than 35 percent of Brosimum lactescens seeds buried inside dung balls at a depth of 1 cm remained undiscovered by rodents, whereas at least 75 percent of the seeds escaped rodent detection at a depth of 3 cm and 96 percent escaped at 5 cm.

The open forms of Brazilian savanna ('campo cerrado' and 'campo sujo') are the most affected by such invasions, because their structure is open, permitting enough sunlight into the lower strata. The invasion of alien forage grasses occurs in almost every cerrado nature reserve. This study was carried out in the 'Cerrado de Emas Biological Reserve', Pirassununga, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, with the following objectives: (a) to compare the abundance of native and alien grass species; (b) to verify the importance of such alien grasses in the community; (c) to identify distribution patterns for the alien grass species in a gradient from the edge (highly disturbed) to the center (less disturbed) of the reserve; and (d) to explore the distribution of native and alien grasses in the search for possible competitive interactions. Using the 'point method,' a total of 260 points was sampled and 52 species were recorded. The four most frequent species (FA = absolute frequency) were two native (Echinolaena inflexa [Poir.] Chase [FA = 38.85%] and Diandrostachya chrysotrix [Nees] Jacues Felix [FA = 15.38%]) and two alien African species (Melinis minutiflora Beauv.

B. decumbens presented the highest number of contacts per point, showing the highest stratification. To detect possible edge-center distribution gradients, correspondence analysis was done, initially using all the recorded species and subsequently only the four more frequent grasses, with similar results: (a) the alien grasses, especially M. minutiflora, did not show a distinct distribution gradient from edge to center, but occurred over the whole reserve; (b) no distinct ecotonal band around the reserve (edge-belt) was detected, the whole reserve seeming to be 'ecotonal'; and (c) E. inflexa and M. minutiflora showed similar phytosociological patterns, and spatial distribution; association between these two species was statistically significant.",93,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,African grasses | Alien plants | Biological invasions | Brachiaria decumbens | Brazil | Cerrado | Edge effect | Habitat fragmentation | Melinis minutiflora | Savanna,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,52,10.1111/j.1744-7429.1999.tb00117.x,NA,NA

Rooting depth and the proportion of root surface area in the upper 20 cm of soil did not differ significantly between life-forms because some treelets/shrubs at Andulau were deep-rooted; all saplings studied were deep-rooted. The root:leaf area ratios of both saplings and treelets/shrubs at Andulau were significantly higher than those at Gigante. We attribute this strong difference to the lower soil content of available nutrients at Andulau where rainfall shortage is less severe and regular than at Gigante.

In central Amazonia, natural succession at forest edges typically produces a dense wall of vegetation dominated by Cecropia spp. that buffers the forest interior. Fire encroachment into forest edges, however, eliminates the soil seed bank, enhances plant mortality, and promotes succession to an open, Vismia-dominated edge that does not buffer the forest interior. Contrasting open, fire-encroached forest edges and closed, non-fire-encroached edges were examined in central Amazonia to assess the effects of edge structure on microclimate and vegetation structure in tropical forest fragments. Edge penetration distances for most microclimate and vegetation structure variables were as much as two to five times greater at open edges than at closed edges. The magnitude of these differences suggests that edge structure is one of the main determinants of microclimate and vegetation structure within tropical forest fragments. Edge effects also varied systematically with fragment area. For a given edge type, 100-ha fragments had consistently lower canopy height, higher foliage density, higher temperature, a higher rate of evaporative drying, lower leaf litter moisture content, and lower litter depth than continuous forest, at all distances from the forest edge. These differences, however, were relatively minor compared to the striking differences in edge penetration between open and closed forest edges.

L. Burm.) Underw., dominates vast areas of rainforests on the windward slopes of Mauna Loa Volcano on the island of Hawai'i. Because clone size has important ecological and evolutionary consequences in such a dominant species, we used isozyme analysis to investigate clone size and other aspects of genetic diversity and reproduction over a broad range of environmental conditions on primary successional sites (pahochoe lava substrates). Isozyme analysis provided a measure of the upper limit of clonal size in this interdigitating clonal species. Each 0.5-ha primary successional site on Mauna Loa was comprised of a minimum of two to four clones. Genetic diversity in Dicranopteris was low; of 32 putative loci investigated, only 4 were polymorphic, with 2 or 3 alleles/locus. Over the 17 study locations on Mauna Loa and Kilauea Volcanoes, we identified nine multilocus genotypes based on unique combinations of allozymes. Seven of the nine genotypes were heterozygous for at least one locus, evidence of an intergametophytic mating system. Highly dispersible spores, coupled with intergametophytic mating should promote higher genetic diversity. We propose that the following factors contributed to low genetic diversity: founder effects; extreme isolation from mainland gene pools; high potential for mating among different gametophytes produced from the same sporophyte; relatively low numbers of safe sites for gametophyte establishment over space and time; and long-term reliance on vegetative growth. Leaf phenotypes were associated with genotype, but also with environmental conditions. Enough variability within a genotype existed to support the current treatment of Hawaiian Dicranopteris as one species. Vegetative growth was the primary means by which Dicranopteris covered the landscape.

Biomass and nitrogen dynamics were compared among: (i) species; (ii) mid- and high elevation forest types; (iii) riparian and upland sites; and (iv) pre- and post-hurricane disturbed environments. Biomass disappearance was compared using multiple regression and negative exponential models in which the slopes were estimates of the decomposition rates subsequent to apparent leaching losses and the y-intercepts were indices of initial mass losses (leaching). Cyrilla racemiflora leaves with low nitrogen (0.39%) and high lignin (22.1%) content decayed at a low rate and immobilized available nitrogen. Dacryodes excelsa leaves had moderate nitrogen (0.67%) and lignin (16.6%) content, decayed at moderate rates, and maintained the initial nitrogen mass. Prestoea montana foliage had high nitrogen (1.76%) and moderate lignin (16.7%) content and rapidly lost both mass and nitrogen. There were no significant differences in litter disappearance and nitrogen dynamics among forest types and slope positions. Initial mass loss of C. racemiflora leaves was lower in 1990 but the subsequent decomposition rate did not change. Initial mass losses and the overall decomposition rates were lower in 1990 than in 1989 for Dacryodes excelsa. Dacryodes excelsa and C. racemiflora litter immobilized nitrogen in 1990 but released 10-15 percent of their initial nitrogen in 1989, whereas P. montana released nitrogen in both years (25-40%).

A potential effect of increases in nutrient supply to the lake's floating papyrus is increasing of the plants' investment in above-water material and reduction of the amount of energy invested in uptake and storage. Biomass and its allocation between culms, panicles, roots, and rhizomes was measured in 17 sites around the 150-km2 lake. Although above-water biomass was greatest in sites closest to the lake's major nutrient inflow, the River Malewa, there was little evidence of corresponding decreases in the biomass of uptake and storage tissues. In August 1995, the average ± SD biomass of papyrus in the lake was 11,540 ± 3020 g/m2, with the papyrus containing about 4500 ± 1900 g total carbon/m2 and about 100 ± 70 g total nitrogen/m2. Plant nitrogen contents did not vary with distance from the main external nutrient supply. Together with low nitrogen concentrations in the plants (0.60 ± 0.26 in culms and 0.99 ± 0.50% in rhizomes), very high carbon to nitrogen ratios (49 ± 20:1) and nitrogen fixation in the rhizosphere explaining only about half of the plants' nitrogen, papyrus is a likely net sink for nitrogen supplied from the lake's increasingly cultivated watershed. Despite this role, clearance of papyrus in favor of agriculture partly explains the reductions in the area of papyrus within the lake basin from 48 km2 in the late 1960s to 14 km2 in 1995.",49,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Assimilation | Carbon | Eichhornia crassipes | Nitrogen | Nitrogen storage | Nitrogen uptake | Rhizomes | Swamps,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,68,10.1111/j.1744-7429.1999.tb00383.x,NA,NA

Rarely considered in discussions of such defense investments, however, is the necessity for plants to defend themselves against oxidative damage caused by light exposure itself. To determine if the ability to respond to elevated levels of light exposure by increasing production of antioxidant compounds is a general characteristic of foliage in tropical plants, we conducted a broad survey of antioxidant content in foliage of 55 species in a tropical forest community by comparing individuals within forest gaps to conspecifics in the closed canopy forest. To do so, we devised a rapid assay to use under field conditions. Of the 41 species of shrubs, trees, and lianas demonstrating a discernible difference in antioxidant content under the two light regimes, 34 (68%) showed higher antioxidant content under high light conditions. In a quantitative laboratory-based study using four of these species, light was associated with a 15 to 45 percent increase in water-soluble antioxidants in three species; one species displayed a 118 percent increase in fat-soluble antioxidants as well.

The experiment was intended to simulate the effects of savanna fires at the end of the dry season. The experiment included three initial size classes of plants that were allowed to grow free from competitors. The results showed an immediate negative effect of shoot removal on tiller number in all three species; however, at the end of the experiment, defoliated plants had recovered and their final sizes did not differ significantly from those of control plants. We registered an overcompensating response to shoot removal on aerial biomass of Trachypogon plumosus, while the other two species (Andropogon semiberbis and Leptocoryphium lanatum) compensated completely for the removed aerial biomass. Differences in initial plant size were only significant in L. lanatum. Shoot removal resulted in a significant decrease in the fraction of flowering tillers in T. plumosus, but had no significant effects on flowering in A. semiberbis. Experimental plants of L. lanatum did not flower during the experiment. Although immediate shoot removal effects were strongly negative, the three species were able to recover not only in the number of tillers but also in aerial biomass.

Seeds collected from beach drift along the Rio Negro showed a high percentage of floaters (82%).

The specific gravity of the seeds was near that of water, 1.04 ± 0.03 for sinkers and 0.98 ± 0.02 for floaters. The ability to float was correlated directly with the volume of the air pocket between the two cotyledons, which varied from 5.6 to 20.5 percent of the total seed volume. In a long-term floatation test lasting 81 days, 45 percent of the seeds never floated, 33 percent always floated, and 22 percent first sank for one week and then floated for at least one month. Seeds that never floated eventually rotted, but not until days 6373. Seeds that were floating at day 81, regardless of how long they had been floating, were placed on moistened filter paper for 18 days during which time 36 percent germinated, 45 percent rotted, and 19 percent did neither but remained viable. These results suggest that S. polyphylla achieves dimorphism in flotation of its seeds, some sinking and some floating, by producing seeds of continuous variation in specific gravity around a mean close to 1.00.
