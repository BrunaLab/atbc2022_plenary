The high intensity, broad scale, and relatively high frequency of these storms makes them a major agent of catastrophic disturbance in the Caribbean and the Atlantic seaboard of the USA. Although the return frequency of hurricanes for any given area is low (on the order of years or decades) relative to the lifespan of an individual investigator or a typical research project, the return time is shorter than the life span of a canopy tree or a forest ecosystem. Hurricanes have struck the Caribbean repeatedly within recorded history and have played a role in shaping plant population dynamics, and nutrient cycling over evolutionary time scales (thousands of years) in much of the Caribbean. This paper focuses on the short term changes in nutrient cycling induced by Hurricane Hugo as well as the possible long-term consequences of such disturbances on tropical forests. Discussion centres on Research sites, the Luquillo Experimental Forest in Puerto Rico and the North Inlet site in South Carolina. The processes summarized are: hurricane litterfall and associated nutrient fluxes and exports; salinization of coastal soils from storm surge and associated changes in soil chemistry; fine root dynamics after disturbance, changes in soil nutrient pools and fertility; and, hurricane-induced changes in N transformation and fluxes. -from Authors",63,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA,NA
