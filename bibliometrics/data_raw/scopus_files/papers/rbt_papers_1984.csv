Under natural conditions they do not seem to cross inter-species barriers; a zoonosis has not been documented for man. However, animal rotaviruses might contribute to the emergence of new reassortment strains in view of their segmented genome, and thus, produce new antigenic variants. On the contrary, Campylobacter fetus jejuni produces a true zoonosis. Man acquires bacilli by ingesting water and foodstuffs contaminated with feces from infected animals. In an outbreak of diarrhea in 22 calves, rotavirus was detected in 8 (36%) and Campylobacter in 6 (27%). Three (14%) calves experienced double infection. There were no human cases involved in this outbreak.",0,6545623,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,1

The myotoxic phospholipases A notexin, taipoxin, crotoxin, and Bothrops asper myotoxin induce muscle necrosis by first affecting the integrity of the plasma membrane, thereby inducing a calcium influx that culminates in cell death. The small basic myotoxin crotamine acts on the voltage-sensitive sodium channels of skeletal muscle sarcolemma, inducing a sodium influx which is responsible for depolarization and contraction of skeletal muscle, as well as for vacuolization of sarcoplasmic reticulum. Cardiotoxins are basic membrane-active polypeptides that disorganize the structure of membranes; the myotoxic activity of cardiotoxins results from their ability to disrupt skeletal muscle sarcolemma. Finally, two hemorrhagic toxins (hemorrhagic toxin b and viriditoxin) are myotoxic; apparently, they secondarily to ischemia which develops in muscular tissue as a consequence of the hemorrhagic action of these toxins.",28,6400184,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,5

Caloric values obtained as true metabolizable energy (TME) indicate that the pejibaye has a higher content of energy than corn and that it is not necessary to separate the seeds from the fruits in animal feeds; the level of indispensable aminoacids is considerably low, especially methionine, which is lower than in corn; thin layer chromatography shows that most of the free fatty acids are present in a ratio of 2:1 in unsaturated to saturated acids.

The presence of enteric pathogens was investigated in the stools of 267 diarrheic children and 190 healthy controls. Both groups belong to yearly cohorts recruited at birth as part of a longitudinal multidisciplinary study of mothers and children. Campylobacter fetus jejuni was identified as the only pathogen in the stools of 24 diarrheic children (9%) and in four healthy controls (2%), a significant difference (p less than 0,05). The clinical features of the episodes were: irritability (77%), blood in stools (35%), anorexia (38,5%), and fever and vomiting (36%). Dehydration was not important among infected children (only one with 5% dehydration). All children received oral salt solutions and only two were treated with antibiotics. Rotaviruses were the main etiologic agents (17%) and Campylobacter ranked second (10,5%).

Cryptosporidium sp. was found in 4.3% of the cases of diarrhea; diarrhea was generally severe in urban children, but mild in the rural. Infection was detected in urban children less than one year of age: contrasting, no rural infants were found infected, which might be related to breast-feeding, since Puriscal infants were intensively breast-fed for several months, while many urban infants were not breast-fed or were weaned earlier. Cryptosporidium sp. appeared during the warm, rainy and humid months of May through August, when the coccidium was associated with 14.8% of the urban and 15.4% of the rural diarrheas.

In this particular case, the bats were Molossidae and Vespertilionidae, both insectivorous. Adults and last nymphal ticks easily fed on suckling white mice in the dark; feeding lasts from 20 to 40 minutes, when abundant coxal fluid is produced; oviposition occurs from 14 to 27 days later.
