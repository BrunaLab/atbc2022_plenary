Mulch and phosphorus fertilizer treatments held similar responses, as they both favoured the seed bank of erect dicotyledons such as P. pentandrus and Cassia mimosoides. On the whole, the effects of grazing remained modest compared with the residual effects of past crop management practices. However, seedling densities increased as a result of dry-season grazing, while the soil seed bank decreased with wet-season grazing.

We compared the distribution of food items in the bulbul diet according to seasons and to abundance classes of this bird. Pycnonotus jocosus is mostly frugivorous and frequently eats the main alien plants (more than 80% frequency of food items). Sites with alien species, such as Clidemia hirta, providing fruits throughout the year supported more birds than sites providing fruits, such as Schinus terebinthifolius, seasonally. The birds facilitated seed germination by removing the pulp of fruit: the final per cent germination (FG) of cleaned seeds was higher than those within the fruit for three of the four plant species and in some cases passage through birds significantly increased FG (Schinus terebinthifolius) or Coefficient of Velocity (CV) (Lantana camara).",53,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Clidemia hirta | Frugivorous bird | Germination | Invasion | Mutualism | Propagation | Pycnonotus jocosus,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA,NA

This paper compares the response of a lowland dipterocarp forest at Danum, Sabah, in a period of low (LDI) and a period of high (HDI) drought intensity (1986-96, 9.98 y: 1996-99, 2.62 y). Mean annual drought intensity was two-fold higher in the HDI than LDI period (1997 v. 976 mm), and each period had one moderately strong main drought (viz. 1992, 1998). Mortality of 'all' trees ≥10 cm gbh (girth at breast height) and stem growth rates of 'small' trees 10-< 50 cm gbh were measured in sixteen 0.16-ha subplots (half on ridge, half on lower slope sites) within two 4-ha plots. These 10-50-cm trees were composed largely of true understorey species. A new procedure was developed to correct for the effect of differences in length of census interval when comparing tree mortality rates. Mortality rates of small trees declined slightly but not significantly between the LDI and HDI periods (1.53 to 1.48% y-1): mortality of all trees showed a similar pattern. Relative growth rates declined significantly by 23% from LDI to HDI periods (11.1 to 8.6 mm m-1 y-1): for absolute growth rates the decrease was 28% (2.45 to 1.77 mm y-1). Neither mortality nor growth rates were significantly influenced by topography. For small trees, across subplots, absolute growth rate was positively correlated in the LDI period, but negatively correlated in the HDI period, with mortality rate. There was no consistent pattern in the responses among the 19 most abundant species (n ≥ 50 trees) which included a proposed drought-tolerant guild. In terms of tree survival, the forest at Danum was resistant to increasing drought intensity, but showed decreased stem growth attributable to increasing water stress.",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Borneo | Drought | Forest dynamics | Interval correction | Mortality | Tree growth | Understorey,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,3,all,All Open Access

For this, interactions between 136 consumed fruit species and 13 frugivorous species were studied. Fruit and seed size were the most important physical factors determining food selection of all consumer species. Nutritionally birds favoured and mammals avoided lipid-rich fruits. For Cheirogaleus spp., that go into torpor, there was a trend to select sugar-rich fruit pulp. However, for numerous fruit traits the consumer species had no clear feeding preferences and they seemed to be quite flexible, eating whatever was available. This might be related to unpredictable fruit availability and low fruit productivity in the littoral forest, which may also partially explain the low number of frugivores present. Nevertheless frugivores have different impacts on seed dispersal.

Many flying foxes starve after forests are stripped of food sources, and hunting by humans may also increase in the post-cyclone period. In December 2001. Cyclone Waka passed directly over the Vava'u Islands in the Kingdom of Tonga, western Polynesia. We visited the islands 6 mo later to survey the flying fox (Pteropus tonganus) population and assess availability of potential food items (fruit and flower) in primary, secondary and plantation forests. Less than 20% of the pre-cyclone bat population (surveyed in 1999-2001) remained 6 mo after the storm. The density of potential food trees in flower or fruit at this time was only 15% of pre-cyclone density, and the main species available were different in the two time periods.

We tested this hypothesis with Macaranga bancana ant-plants, which are protected efficiently by resident, mutualistic ants from herbivores, parasites and encroaching vegetation. Because cost-effective defence of the host by ants increases ant fitness, selection should act on ant behaviour to produce patterns of distribution of defence as predicted for direct chemical defence traits. Termites and pieces of tape were equally distributed over the uppermost ten leaves and over the leaf-bearing part of the stems (with termites mimicking a transient herbivore, while tape mimics a long-term stress caused by a climber or plant parasite). This arrangement allowed a separation of putative coevolutionary adaptations in the ants' behaviour from other potential sources of spatial patterns in ant defence, such as differences in herbivore pressure, in the vulnerability of different herbivores, or in direct plant defences. Ant activity dropped rapidly at termite baits, but remained high at tapes for at least 5 h, thereby demonstrating adaptive differential responses to the differences between the two stressors.

In a tropical cloud forest in Colombia, inflorescences of Xanthosoma daguense opened at dusk, releasing a sweet scent and raising their temperature 1-3°C. Soon after, two species of Scarabaeidae (Dynastinae; Cyclocephala gregaria and C. amblyopsis) and one species of Nitidulidae (Macrostola costulata) arrived with pollen. Cyclocephala beetles remained inside the inflorescence for 24 h. The next night, Cyclocephala beetles left the inflorescence after picking up the freshly shed pollen, almost always moving to the nearest inflorescence available. The probability of inflorescence abortion and number of fruits set after the visit of one individual was equivalent for both Cyclocephala species. However, C. gregaria was much more abundant than C. amblyopsis, so it was the most important pollinator. There was a positive relationship between the number of dynastine visits and the number of fruits produced. Besides carrying pollen to the inflorescences, nitidulid beetles had a negative effect on female reproductive success through fruit predation. Nitidulid larvae developed inside the infructescence and preyed on up to 64% of the fruits. However, 8% of inflorescences not visited by dynastines were probably pollinated by nitidulids, because hand-pollination experiments showed that self-pollination was unlikely. Inflorescences potentially pollinated by nitidulids comprised 25% of the fruit crop in the year of our study. This interaction with a fruit predator that is also a potential pollinator resembles brood-site pollination systems in which pollinators prey on part of the fruit set (e.g. Ficus, senita cacti, Yucca), making this system substantially more complex than previously described dynastine-pollinated systems in aroids.",29,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Araceae | Colombia | Cyclocephala | Dynastinae | Macrostola costulata | Nitidulidae | Pollination,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,29,NA,NA

Reproductively mature trees developed buttresses and were rarely decumbent. However, if they became decumbent, they died without sprouting. Juvenile trees were frequently decumbent, and their decumbent shoots sprouted vegetatively. Therefore, vegetative sprouting acted as a countermeasure to decumbency and death on the soft wetland soil.

In tropical moist forest, advance regeneration in the form of shade-suppressed seedlings is a major component of regrowth in new gaps. Tree seedlings may be filtered by the composition and structure of the forest understorey. In a lowland forest in Central Panama, we examined light availability, litter accumulation and the seedling community (abundance, diversity and composition) under and away from the canopies of a common subcanopy, clonal palm, Oenocarpus mapora, and tested whether seedling abundance varies as a function of changes in understorey light conditions and leaf litter depth. We found evidence that leaf litter was five times deeper and light availability 27% lower under O. mapora canopy than where it was absent. The probability of finding a seedling in plots under O. mapora canopies was 33% lower than in plots without the palm. Plots under O. mapora canopies also had 49% fewer species of seedlings and those seedlings came from significantly larger seeds than seedlings in plots not under the palm. Overall, seedling density was positively correlated with light availability and negatively correlated with leaf litter depth. A transplant experiment confirmed that for at least one large-seeded species of dicot, seedlings are negatively affected by the reduction in light availability and increase in leaf litter. Under O. mapora, seedlings of Gustavia superba (Lecythidaceae) had lower survivorship and biomass accumulation than away from the palm.

Ants, widely regarded as the most important consumers of extrafloral nectar, made up only 60% of all nectary-visiting arthropods.

Its objectives were (1) to determine the range and interspecific variation in six photosynthetic parameters, and (2) to identify morphological and chemical leaf traits that can predict light-saturated net photosynthetic rates (on a leaf area or leaf mass basis, Amax-area or Amax-mass). Species averages of A max-area in sun leaves ranged between 14.2 and 20.3 μmol m -2 s-1 (mean 17.5) which is high compared with literature data.

Amax-mass showed a higher interspecific variation than Amax-area, and was positively correlated with SLA and leaf N content (slope: 13.4 nmol CO 2 g N-1 s-1). Both, Amax-area and Amax-mass were more closely related to leaf morphological attributes than to leaf N.

The foraging behaviour of 28 species was described in terms of four major dimensions (i.e. foraging technique, food substrate, perching site and perching height). Seasonal rainfall produced an increase in vegetation growth in the lower vegetation layers, while fruiting and flowering peaked in the dry season. We did not find much seasonal variation in foraging ecology when we analysed our data at the species or at the community levels. At the guild level, however, we found some seasonal shifts in perching height, food substrate and foraging technique. Some of these shifts seemed to be determined by food availability and distribution, as omnivores increased fruit consumption when this resource was more abundant, and nectarivores tracked the vertical distribution of flowers. The vertical biomass distribution of this avian community seemed to be largely determined by food. However, seasonal variation in the total biomass of some guilds was probably related to factors not considered in this study, such as breeding, or intra-African migratory movements. Altogether, despite marked seasonal variation in vegetation structure and food resources, the bird assemblage showed little change in its feeding ecology and micro-habitat use.

The approach used an earlier-established 82.5-ha permanent plot with a new surrounding 50-m grid of transect lines. Tree diameters were available from the plot but trees on the grid were recorded as being ≥ 50 cm. The grove consisted of 1028 trees in 2000. Other species occurred within the grove, including the associated subdominants Tetraberlinia bifoliolata and T. korupensis. Microberlinia bisulcata becomes adult at a stem diameter of c. 50 cm and at an estimated age of 50 y. Three oval-shaped subgroves with dimensions c. 850 m x 1350 m (90 ha) were defined. For two of them (within the plot) tree diameters were available. Subgroves differed in their scales and intensities of spatial tree patterns, and in their size frequency distributions, these suggesting differing past dynamics. The modal scale of clumping was 40-50 m. Seed dispersal by pod ejection (to c. 50 m) was evident from the semi-circles of trees at the grove's edge and from the many internal circles (100-200 m diameter). The grove has the capacity, therefore, to increase at c. 100 m per century. To form its present extent and structure, it is inferred that it expanded and infilled from a possibly smaller area of lower adult-tree density. This possibly happened in three waves of recruitment, each one determined by a period of several intense disturbances. Climate records for Africa show that 1740-50 and 1820-30 were periods of drought, and that 1870-1895 was also regionally very dry. Canopy openings allow the light-demanding and fast-growing ectomycorrhizal M. bisulcata to establish, but successive releases are thought to be required to achieve effective recruitment. Nevertheless, in the last 50 y there were no major events and recruitment in the grove was very poor. This present study leads to a new hypothesis of the role of periods of multiple extreme events being the driving factor for the population dynamics of many large African tree species such as M. bisulcata.",43,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Grove formation | Multiple disturbances | Seed dispersal | Size distribution | Spatial pattern | Tropical rain forest,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,67,all,All Open Access

The primary seed dispersers and their dispersal effectiveness were determined through focal watches at eight trees. Only 3 of 13 frugivores that consumed Maesopsis fruits functioned as seed dispersers (silvery-cheeked hornbill Ceratogymna brevis, Fischer's turaco Tauraco fischeri and blue monkey Cercopithecus mitis).

Bat activity was significantly and positively related to insect availability and ambient temperature, whereas increased visibility of the moon had a negative influence on flight activity. Together, these factors best explained both total bat activity and activity of bats hunting in open space and edge habitats. The interaction between temperature and light intensity was the best predictor of activity by species foraging in obstacle-rich forest habitats, however, the regression model had a low predictive value. Overall, a large proportion (c. 50%) of the variation in bat activity appeared to be a consequence of transect- and/or habitat-specific influences. We found a significant non-linear relationship between the activity of QCF (quasi-constant frequency) and FM-QCF (frequency modulated - quasi-constant frequency) bats and the phase of the moon, with lowest levels of activity occurring near full moon. We interpret this lunar-phobic behaviour as a reflection of a higher predation risk during moonlit periods.

During the dry season, when food resources are scarcer, larvae and juveniles make slightly offset inshore migrations during the day, so that they feed at different places, on copepods of different sixes.

A blind study, using samples collected from the same transect in the following year, provided a test of reproducibility. The results show (1) clear elevational distribution patterns and (2) the ability of calibration data to predict the altitude of the blind samples. Characteristic associations of pollen taxa are found under differing hydrologies and elevations. The floodplain pollen assemblages are characterized by abundant Mauritia, Sloanea, Ficus, Iriartea and Arecaceae pollen types. At higher elevations, these lowland types decrease or are absent. Alchornea, Urticaceae/Moraceae, Bignoniaceae and Cecropia are dominant components of the pollen rain of the low-elevation zone (< 1000 m). Acalypha, Alchornea, Cecropia, Rubiaceae and Urticaceae/Moraceae are important between 1000 m and 1600 m elevation. Pollen of Hedyosmum, Alnus, Poaceae and Combretaceae/Melastomataceae are abundant between 1600 m and 2000 m, Cecropia pollen dominates samples from low- to mid-elevation disturbed forests. Alnus pollen is most abundant, and Poaceae becomes rare, between 2000 and 2700 m. At high elevations above 2700 m, Asteraceae, Poaceae, Polylepis, Muehlenbeckia-type and Myrsine pollen are dominant. Statistical analysis of the data set using Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) shows a precise correlation between community composition and elevation. The DCA axis 1 values are strongly correlated with sample elevation, exhibiting a linear relationship (r2 = 0.904). The results provide an estimate of the sensitivity of pollen analysis in the Neotropics as a proxy for measuring elevation and, by inference, temperature.",91,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Andes | Elevation | Moss polster | Palaeoecology | Peru | South America | Transect,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,75,NA,NA

The two species are mainly frugivore-granivores, even during the annual period of fruit scarcity (56% of the annual diet in red brockets and 68% in grey brockets). Both rely heavily on fruits and seeds, but overcome the fall in fruit availability by eating significant quantities of fibres, leaves and flowers, particularly the red brocket. Seasonal variation in quantity consumed was observed only for gravid females, which suggests that reproduction may be dependent on the fruiting season. Both species took a wide variety of plants (respectively a total of 79 and 107 species, and 8.4 and 8.9 species per stomach on average). They can be considered non-selective feeders, choosing fruits above all according to their abundance, their size, and perhaps their softness. Both species are seed eaters, destroying nearly all seeds ingested. The two species are potential competitors, but their diet competition may be reduced by their large difference in body size and somewhat different ecological niches. These deer are among the most generalized frugivores of the Guianan forest, thus reducing their food competition with other frugivores.",50,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Food competition | Frugivory | Terrestrial vertebrates | Tropical forest,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,76,NA,NA

Of particular interest was the influence of herbivory and its relation to drought, since water stress is known to influence herbivore performance. For seedlings with less than 10% leaf damage, mortality during a 6-mo period spanning the driest part of the drought was three times higher than mortality in the previous and subsequent 6-mo periods (∼10% vs. ∼30%). Leaf production was also higher during this period. Survival was positively related to leaf number and negatively related to leaf damage. Dryohalanops lanceolata was the tallest and leafiest species, and had low levels of leaf damage. Depending on sample period, abscission of leaves with more than 50% damage was between two and three times more likely than those with less than 10% damage. Mortality of seedlings defoliated by more than 50% was around twice that of seedlings defoliated by less than 10%. However, fewer than 10% of seedlings were defoliated by more than 50% at any time. The effect of defoliation did not seem to be altered by drought. Defoliation levels increased after the drought, perhaps due to a resurgence of insect populations. Drought may become a more important influence on dipterocarp regeneration in future, since El Niño events are thought to be increasing in frequency.",14,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Dipterocarpaceae | Drought | ENSO | Herbivory | Malaysia | Sabah,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,77,all,All Open Access

A hierarchical design was used with riffles nested into reaches, and individual stones nested into riffles. Macroinvertebrate abundance and taxon richness varied at riffle scale, although patterns of variation seemed to change with time of recolonization, and taxonomic composition varied mostly at reach scale. Patterns of variation of background communities and macroinvertebrate drift at different spatial scales suggest that the contribution of these two sources of colonists to stone recolonization depends on spatial scale. Macroinvcrtebrate abundance was related to local environmental variables during recolonixation, but taxon richness was related to the local environment only in the very first stage of the process.

The wet and intermediate plots were similar in total species richness, the dry site somewhat lower in diversity: all three sites differed substantially from each other in species composition. Forest-wide growth of large trees was higher at the wet and intermediate sites than at the dry site, but sapling growth was highest at the dry site and lowest at the intermediate site. Forest-wide growth differences were reflected by individual species. for example, saplings of species at the dry site grew faster than saplings of the same species at the intermediate site. Forest-wide mortality was lowest at the dry site and highest at the wet, and this difference was also reflected by individual species. We suggest that low mortality and growth in the drier forest was due to the longer annual dry season and higher deciduousness, and that high sapling growth at the dry site was due to greater light penetration to the forest floor. Growth rates were elevated at all three sites during 1998. possibly due to reduced cloud-cover during the El Niño. Contrary to expectation, mortality during 1998 was not elevated at wet and intermediate sites during the El Niño drought, but was at the dry site. Finally, we found that some species performed poorly at one site and declined in abundance, while having stable or increasing populations at another site, demonstrating that the communities are not at equilibrium.",198,Journal,ar,Article,100,8,8,Barro Colorado | Climatic variation | El Niño | Forest dynamics | Panama | Precipitation gradient | Tree species demography | Tropical forest,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,80,NA,NA

The limited area and less-diverse resources of islands should make competition between similar species more acute and should lead to marked niche segregation, with a larger niche breath for the endemic species. Spizaetus bartelsi was recorded significantly more frequently in forest habitats from sea level to 2500 m asl and S. cirrhatus more in open habitats up to 1600 m asl. Contrary to the prediction, the endemic hawk-eagle occurred in a smaller range of habitats (four out of seven) compared with S. cirrhatus that was found in all seven habitat types.
