Two null hypotheses were implemented using individual- and sample-based randomization tests to generate null distributions for α and β components of diversity at multiple sampling scales. The two tests differed in their null distributions and power to detect statistically significant diversity components. Individual-based randomization was more powerful at all hierarchical levels and was sensitive to departures between observed and null partitions due to intraspecific aggregation of individuals. Sample-based randomization had less power but still may be useful for determining whether different habitats show a higher degree of differentiation in species diversity compared with random samples from the landscape.

Here, we report the results of experiments designed to examine whether inbreeding depression is influenced by the frequency of inbred plants in the competitive neighborhood. Two species of the annual plant genus Amsinckia were studied, one a near-complete selfer (Amsinckia gloriosa) and the other a partial outcrosser (Amsinckia douglasiana).

The average yearly reduction in population growth rate (λ) caused by mollusks in the experiment was 0.14. The largest contribution to this decrease in total fitness occurred through a decreased survival of established plants. In contrast, seedling emergence and probability of flowering were the fitness components that were most affected in terms of relative change. The more important a life-cycle transition was for population growth rate in terms of its elasticity, the less it was affected by herbivore damage. These results suggest that simple analyses of the magnitudes of effects on individual components of plant performance are poor predictors of the magnitude of total fitness effects and tolerance to herbivory.

Traditionally, the selective factors leading to the evolution of endothermy have primarily been related to locomotor performance, while the energy used for thermogenesis has been viewed as energy that otherwise could have been allocated to growth and reproduction (Bennett and Ruben 1979). In marked contrast, the reproductive hypothesis proposes that the primary benefits of endothermy are reproductive (occurring to growing embryos and juveniles), while thermogenesis represents an increase in the rate and amount of energy invested into reproduction. Thermogenesis is suggested to have functioned to speed and facilitate development and growth of embryos and juveniles. Both thermogenesis and parental feeding of young greatly expanded the energetic needs of the archosaurian and synapsid lineages. It is this expanded energetic investment into reproduction that may have represented the original basis for subsequent selection of individuals with expanded aerobic activity capacities. Thus, great aerobic capacity may correlate broadly with tetrapod endothermy because both traits are adaptations arising from reproductive selective pressures. A strong line of evidence supportive of the reproductive hypothesis is the convergent evolution of thermogenesis as an adaptation for reproduction in multiple lineages of insects, multiple lineages of plants, protists, and reptiles.",NA,NA

Classification trees based on geology, climate, land use, and topography adequately explained distribution but not abundance (canopy cover) of three widespread invasive species (Acacia cyclops, Acacia saligna, and Pinus pinaster).

The influence of environmental factors was then assessed on the residuals of the first model to determine how propagule pressure interacts with environmental factors.

We develop a structured resource/consumer/ natural enemy model in which the prey are exposed to attacks during a vulnerable life phase, the length of which depends on resource availability. With a single prey species, the model exhibits the ""paradox of enrichment,"" with unstable dynamics at high levels of resource productivity. We extend this model to consider two prey species linked by a shared predator, each with their own distinct resource base. We derive invasion and stability conditions and examine how enrichment influences prey species exclusion and coexistence. Contrary to expectations from simpler, prey-dependent models, apparent competition is not necessarily strong at high productivity, and prey species coexistence may thus be more likely in enriched environments. Further, the coexistence of apparent competitors may be facilitated by unstable dynamics. These results contrast with the standard theory that apparent competition in productive environments leads to nonpersistent interactions and that coexistence of multi-species interactions is more likely under equilibrial conditions.",NA,NA

In fact, conditions such as food availability and density at maturity, like conditions early in development, can generate cohort effects in mature stages.

The present iterated hawk-dove game predicts that in situations that are analogous to a prisoner's dilemma, animals should share the resources without aggression, provided that the number of simultaneously available food clumps is sufficiently large and the number of competitors is relatively small. However, given that the expected gain of an aggressive animal is more variable than the gain expected by nonaggressive individuals, the predicted effect of the number of food items in a clump - clump richness - depends on whether only the mean or both the mean and variability associated with payoffs are considered.

We studied the relationship between carotenoid pigments, immune function, and sexual coloration in zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), a species in which males incorporate carotenoid pigments into their beak to attract mates. We tested the hypotheses that increased dietary carotenoid intake enhances immunocompetence in male zebra finches and that levels of carotenoids circulating in blood, which also determine beak coloration, directly predict the immune response of individuals.

In fishes and reptiles, embryo nourishment encompasses a continuum from solely lecithotrophic to primarily matrotrophic. Matrotrophy has evolved independently from lecithotrophic ancestors many times in many groups. We assumed matrotrophy increased the number of offspring a viviparous female could gestate and evaluated conditions of food availability favoring lecithotrophy or matrotrophy. The matrotrophic strategy was superior when food resources exceeded demand during gestation but at a risk of overproduction and reproductive failure if food intake was limited.

The predator is efficient at exploiting its prey and has a saturating functional response; these two features combine to produce sustained population cycles over a wide range of parameter values. Two types of models of behavioral change are compared. In one class of models (""instantaneous choice""), the probability of acceptance of the poorer prey by the predator instantaneously approximates the optimal choice, given current prey densities. In the second class of models (""dynamic choice""), the probability of acceptance of the poorer prey is a dynamic variable, which begins to change in an adaptive direction when prey densities change but which requires a finite amount of time to approach the new optimal behavior. The two types of models frequently predict qualitatively different population dynamics of the three-species system, with chaotic dynamics and complex cycles being a common outcome only in the dynamic choice models. In dynamic choice models, factors that reduce the rate of behavioral change when the probability of accepting the poorer prey approaches extreme values often produce complex population dynamics. Instantaneous and dynamic models often predict different average population densities and different indirect interactions between prey species.

Forcible insemination is usually inferred from direct physical battles between the sexes and has been dismissed on intuitive grounds for many kinds of animals. For example, snakes have elongate flexible bodies (making it difficult for a male to restrain a female physically), males are typically smaller than females, and copulation requires female cloacal gaping to enable intromission. Male garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) do not display any overt aggression during courtship and simply lie over the female and exhibit rhythmic pulsating caudocephalic waves of muscular contraction; previous studies have interpreted this behavior as a mechanism for eliciting female receptivity. In contrast, we show that male garter snakes forcibly inseminate females. They do so by taking advantage of specific features of snake physiology, respiratory anatomy, and antipredator behavior. The snake lung extends along most of the body, with the large posterior section (the saccular lung) lacking any respiratory exchange surface. Rhythmic caudocephalic waves by courting male garter snakes push anoxic air from the saccular lung forward and across the respiratory surfaces such that females cannot obtain oxygen. Their stress response involves cloacal gaping, which functions in other contexts to repel predators by extruding feces and musk but in this situation permits male intromission. Thus, superficially benign courtship behaviors may involve cryptic coercion even in species for which intuition dismisses any possibility of forcible insemination.",NA,NA

But which sex should disperse? In polygynous species, females pay higher costs to inbreeding and thus might be expected to disperse more, but empirical evidence consistently reveals male biases. Here, we show that theoretical expectations change drastically if females are allowed to avoid inbreeding via kin recognition. At high inbreeding loads, females should prefer immigrants over residents, thereby boosting male dispersal. At lower inbreeding loads, by contrast, inclusive fitness benefits should induce females to prefer relatives, thereby promoting male philopatry. This result points to disruptive effects of sexual selection. The inbreeding load that females are ready to accept is surprisingly high. In absence of search costs, females should prefer related partners as long as δ < r/(1 + r), where r is relatedness and δ is the fecundity loss relative to an outbred mating. This amounts to fitness losses up to one-fifth for a half-sib mating and one-third for a full-sib mating, which lie in the upper range of inbreeding depression values currently reported in natural populations. The observation of active inbreeding avoidance in a polygynous species thus suggests that inbreeding depression exceeds this threshold in the species under scrutiny or that inbred matings at least partly forfeit other mating opportunities for males. Our model also shows that female choosiness should decline rapidly with search costs, stemming from, for example, reproductive delays.

Split sex ratios are common in ant populations and may result from such conflicts, with workers favoring the production of males in some colonies and of gynes in others. Such intercolonial differences may result from variations in relatedness asymmetries among colony members, but several examples are now known in which this hypothesis does not hold. We develop here a simple model assuming monogynous, monoandrous, worker-sterile, perennial colonies without dispersal restrictions. Workers may eliminate eggs of either sex and determine the caste of the female brood, but the queen controls the number of eggs of each sex she lays. In such conditions, we demonstrate that split sex ratios can result from queens adopting a mixed evolutionary stable strategy (ESS), with one option being to put a strict limit to the number of diploid eggs available and the alternative one to provide diploid eggs ad lib. In the former situation, workers should raise all diploid eggs as workers and release only male sexuals. In the latter, workers should adjust the caste ratio so as to reach the maximum sexual productivity for the colony, which is entirely invested into gynes. For a particular relative investment in gynes at the population level, between 0.5 (ESS under full queen control) and 0.75 (ESS under full worker control), an equilibrium is reached at which both strategies yield an equal genetic payoff to the queen. Male-specialized colonies are predicted to be equally abundant but less populous and less productive than gyne-specialized ones.

Here we provide predictions for species richness, species relative abundances, and community-level functional properties (productivity and space occupation) at the local and regional scales as functions of the proportion of dispersal between communities. Local (α) diversity is maximal at an intermediate level of dispersal, whereas between-community (β) and regional (γ) diversity decline as dispersal increases because of increased homogenization of the metacommunity. The relationships between local and regional species richness and the species rank abundance distributions are strongly affected by the level of dispersal. Local productivity and space occupation tend to decline as dispersal increases, resulting in either a hump-shaped or a positive relationship between species richness and productivity, depending on the scale considered (local or regional).

This diversity of microbial associates has important evolutionary and ecological implications. Most mutualisms evolve as balanced reciprocations that allow partners to detect cheaters, particularly when partners are potentially diverse and can be transmitted horizontally. Thus, environmental stresses that incapacitate the ability of partners to reciprocate can destabilize associations by eliciting rejection by their hosts.

In nature, such species are often specialized antagonists of one or both mutualists. Hence, these models can also shed light on the problem of when and how mutualisms are able to persist in the face of exploitation. We used spatial stochastic simulations to model the ecological dynamics of obligate, species-specific mutualisms between plants and pollinating seed parasite insects (e.g., yuccas and yucca moths) in the presence of one of two obligate antagonist species: flower-feeding insects (florivores) or insects that parasitize seeds but fail to pollinate (exploiters). Our results suggest that mutualisms can persist surprisingly well in the presence of highly specialized antagonists but that they exhibit distinctly different temporal and spatial dynamics when antagonists are present. In our models, antagonists tend to induce oscillations in the mutualist populations. As the number of per capita visits by antagonists increase, the system's oscillatory dynamics become more extreme, finally leading to the extinction of one or more of the three species. When the antagonists exhibit high per capita visitation frequencies and long dispersal distances, significant spatial patchiness emerges within these tripartite interactions. We found surprisingly little difference between the ecological effects of florivores and exploiters, although in general florivores tended to drive themselves (and sometimes the mutualists) to extinction at parameter values at which the exploiters were able to persist. These theoretical results suggest several testable hypotheses regarding the ecological and evolutionary persistence of mutualisms.

The predictions of this model have been the subject of recent debate. We present an explicit population genetic model for the evolution of a maternal-effect gene that biases offspring sex ratio. We show that, like local mate competition, sexual selection favors female-biased sex ratios whenever maternal condition affects the reproductive competitive ability of sons. However, Fisherian sex-ratio selection, which favors a balanced sex ratio, is an opposing force. We show that the evolution of maternal sex-ratio biasing by these opposing selection forces requires a positive covariance across environments between the sex-ratio bias toward sons (b) and the mating success of sons (r). This covariance alone is not a sufficient condition for the evolution of maternal sex-ratio biasing; it must be sufficiently positive to outweigh the opposing sex-ratio selection. To identify the necessary and sufficient conditions, we partition total evolutionary change into three components: (1) maternal sex-ratio bias, (2) sexual selection on sons, and (3) sex-ratio selection. Because the magnitude of the first component asymmetrically affects the strength of the second, biasing broods toward females in a poor environment evolves faster than the same degree of bias toward males in a good environment. Consequently, female-biased sex ratios, rather than male-biased sex ratios, are more likely to evolve.

Our analysis extends previous studies in that it includes competition of resources and competition for space. Also, juvenile dispersal is not given by a fixed probability but is made conditional on the presence of free territories in a patch, whereas individuals born in full patches will always disperse.

We found changes in community similarity to vary with the type and number of nonnative and native species, the historical degree of similarity among the communities, and, to a lesser degree, the richness of the recipient communities. Homogenization is greatest when similar species invade communities, causing either no extinction or differential extinction of native species.

Here we report that, in addition to the ""fixed"" (i.e., non-color-changing) green and brown morphs of H. regilla, there are some individuals that can change hue between green and brown. The distribution of color-change ability in our study population is bimodal, suggesting that ""color changers"" are a distinct morph rather than one extreme of a continuous distribution of color-change ability. Our findings suggest that background brightness, not hue, triggers color change in the newly discovered morph and that this change requires days to weeks to occur. Such slow color change is not well suited for making short-term changes in color as a frog moves between differently colored substrates. Rather, seasonal changes in habitat characteristics and/or microhabitat use are likely to maintain color-change ability.

Using a standard predator-prey model as a prototype for a cyclic population, we calculate the speed and amplitude of waves generated by a large landscape feature. This enables us to determine parameters for which the waves are stable; in other cases, they evolve into irregular oscillations. We then undertake for the first time a detailed study of the effects of the size and shape of a landscape feature on the waves that it generates. We show that size rather than shape is the key wave-forming property, with smaller obstacles generating waves with longer wavelength and waves from larger landscape features dominating those from smaller ones.

A major goal of this symposium is to broaden and shift this pairwise perspective and make it concordant with the emerging view that locally exclusive mutualisms between just two species are the exception and that many communities include guilds of mutualistic species on one or both sides of the interaction. Many pollination and seed-dispersal mutualisms have long been recognized as diffuse, but recent molecular analyses are revealing unrecognized partner diversity in mutualistic interactions previously thought to be locally species specific. Co-occurring species within a mutualist guild are unlikely to be ecologically equivalent in the way they locate, compete for, and/or reward partners, and so intraguild interactions have the potential to influence population dynamics and patterns of selection in species on both sides of the mutualistic interaction. To illustrate some of these potential complexities for population dynamics, I use simple path analytic models to show that positive pairwise interactions between mutualists do not necessarily translate into positive net interactions within a mutualism involving more than two species. For example, when there is intraguild competition for partners, or even for resources external to the mutualism, the presence of a lower-quality mutualist can negatively affect the partner population by reducing associations it can form with better mutualists. Variation in quality among potential partners is likely to place a premium on traits or behaviors that enhance association with better mutualists. More investigations are needed to determine how variation among interacting mutualists, with respect to characteristics such as longevity, dispersal capability, and competitive ability, influence population dynamics and selection in multispecies mutualisms.",NA,NA

Here I address this problem with two models. First, I consider the fate of a rare allele that improves fitness in the marginal habitat but reduces fitness in the core (source) habitat. Then I study the evolution of a polygenic character mediating a trade-off in fitness between the habitats. Both approaches led to qualitatively similar predictions. The effect of a difference in the dispersal rate between the sexes depends on the degree to which immigration from the core habitat boosts the reproductive output from the marginal habitat. This boost is slight if the marginal habitat is able to sustain well a population without immigration. In that case, both female- and male-biased dispersal is more favorable for adaptation to marginal habitats than equal dispersal of both sexes (assuming that the dispersal rate averaged over the sexes is kept constant). In contrast, if the marginal habitat is an absolute sink unable to sustain a population without immigration, the conditions for adaptation to that habitat are least favorable under highly male-biased dispersal and most favorable under highly female-biased dispersal. Under some circumstances, high average (male + female) dispersal is more favorable than low dispersal. Thus, gene flow should not be seen solely as thwarting adaptation to marginal habitats. The results are interpreted in terms of how male and female dispersal affects the relative rate of gene flow from the source to the sink habitat and in the opposite direction.

Second, resource reallocation to future fecundity is needed for such reproductive delays to evolve. Third, the reproductive delay can be optimized with respect to life-history traits (e.g., survival, growth) and the mating system (inbreeding depression). Our results largely validate these predictions. First, reproduction is significantly delayed in isolated individuals (""selfers"") as compared with individuals frequently exposed to mates (""outcrossers"").

The results demonstrate that both temporal and spatial variability in fitness interactions can cause partner species with tightly matched traits favored by unconditional mutualisms to be vulnerable to evolutionary invasion by alternative types. A new model presented here shows that an additional mutualistic species can have a similar effect and can even cause fitness interactions between the other two species to evolve. Under some conditions, the pairwise interactions can change unidirectionally from mutualistic to antagonistic, with virtually no evolutionary change in either partner species. In other cases, fitness interactions between the species pair can oscillate between mutualism and antagonism as a result of coevolution in the third species.

Females share parentage equally and have lower constraints on dispersal and lower survival rates compared with males, which is consistent with predictions from the concessions model.

We compiled correlation estimates of the bird density-patch area relationship from the literature and analyzed the data using meta-analysis. Combined correlation coefficients were significantly positive on islands but were not significantly different from 0 in fragments. Within-species comparisons also showed that correlations were consistently more positive on islands than in fragments. On islands but not in fragments, the densities of forest specialist species were more sensitive to area than were the densities of forest generalists, suggesting that specialists are more sensitive to changes in matrix quality. Migration status was only weakly associated with bird responses to island or fragment area. Thus, forest fragments do not function as true islands. We interpret this as the result of compensatory effects of the surrounding matrix in terms of availability of resources and enhanced connectivity (matrix quality hypothesis).

Theory predicts that organisms should grow to be larger in colder environments when growth efficiency decreases with increasing environmental temperature. Using data from 97 laboratory experiments, including 58 species of ectotherms, we found little evidence that growth efficiency is negatively related to environmental temperature within the thermal range that is relevant to the temperature-size rule. Instead, growth efficiency was either positively related or insensitive to environmental temperature in the majority of cases (73 of 89 cases for gross growth efficiency and 18 of 24 cases for net growth efficiency). Two possibilities merit consideration. First, high temperatures may impose constraints on growth that only arise late during ontogeny; this simple and potentially general explanation is supported by the fact that thermal optima for growth efficiency and growth rate decrease as individuals grow.

This paradigm is not universal, however, and we presently lack a framework for understanding why certain biophysical parameters are important only in some cases. One possibility is that the relevance of these parameters is determined by evolutionarily conserved life-history-scale patterns of resource allocation and acquisition. We evaluated this hypothesis by investigating the correlates of competitive success in two territorial insects that exemplify markedly different lifetime patterns of resource utilization. We found that in the bot fly Cuterebra austeni, an extreme capital breeding species that depends entirely on energy acquired during its immature stages, territorial residency was most strongly correlated with a size-independent measure of energetic availability.

Adult H. ustulata are able to supplement their larval-derived nutrient capital in the manner of an income breeder, and fuel reserves were independent of age and actually correlated negatively with residency in this species.

Using an analytical approximation, we show that matching traits will coevolve when the geometric mean interaction is mutualistic.

However, knowledge of the evolutionary potential for either of these traits in a field setting is limited. I developed a simulation model using local climate data and observed levels of phenotypic variation for nest-site choice and threshold temperatures in painted turtles (Chrysemys picta) with TSD. Both nest-site choice and threshold temperatures, and hence sex ratios, evolved slowly to simulated climate change scenarios. In contrast to expectations from previous models, nest-site choice evolved more slowly than threshold temperatures because of large climatic effects on nest temperatures and indirect selection on maternally expressed traits. A variant of the model, assuming inheritance of nest-site choice through natal imprinting, demonstrated that natal imprinting inhibited adaptive responses in female nest-site choice to climate change.

The competing species are identical in every way but their sexual system. Separation of the sexes increases the variances of pollen import and seed dispersal for the dioecious species. These variances propagate through subsequent reproductive processes and ultimately reduce mean recruitment as a result of nonlinear averaging (Jensen's inequality).

For instance, in several situations, the propagules of a parasite exploiting a predator species will achieve a higher host-finding success by encysting in a prey of the target predator than by other dispersal modes. In such a case, selection should favor the transition from a single- to a two-host life cycle that includes the prey species as an intermediate host. We use an optimality model to explore this idea, and we discuss it in relation to dispersal strategies known among free-living species, especially animal dispersal. The model found that selection favored a complex life cycle only if intermediate hosts were more abundant than definitive hosts. The selective value of a complex life cycle increased with predation rates by definitive hosts on intermediate hosts.

The prey population reproduces logistically, and the local population interactions follow the Holling Type II trophic function. On the scale of the population, our spatially explicit approach subdivides the predation process into random movement represented by diffusion, directed movement described by prey taxis, local prey encounters, and consumption modeled by the trophic function. Thus, our model allows studying the effects of large-scale predator spatial activity on population dynamics. We show under which conditions spatial patterns are generated by prey taxis and how this affects the predator ability to maintain the pest population below some economic threshold.

Equilibria and their stability depend on nutrient supply conditions. When nutrient supply increases, unusual results can occur, such as a decrease of prey density. This phenomenon occurs if, with increasing nutrient, predators sequester rather than recycle nutrients. Furthermore, despite use of a linear functional response for predators, high nutrient supply can destabilize equilibria. Responses to nutrient supply depend on the balance between assimilation and recycling of nutrients by predators, which differs depending on the identity of the limiting nutrient. Applied to microbial ecosystems, the model predicts that the efficiency of organic carbon mineralization is reduced when supply of mineral nutrients is low and when equilibria are unstable.

Ontogenetic niche shifts introduce stage structure in a population with different stages interacting with different communities and can substantially affect their dynamics. In this article, I use mathematical models to test the hypothesis that adaptive plasticity in the timing of ontogenetic niche shifts has a stabilizing effect on consumer-resource dynamics. Adaptive plasticity allows consumers in one ontogenetic niche to perform an early shift to the next ontogenetic niche if the resource density of the first niche is low. The early shift will reduce predation by the consumer on the scarce resource. On the other hand, adaptive plasticity allows consumers to delay their shift to the next niche if the resource density of the first niche is high. The delayed shift will increase the predation on the abundant resource. As a result, the scarce resource will tend to increase, and the abundant resource will tend to decrease. This causes density-dependent negative feedback in the resource dynamics, which stabilizes the consumer-resource dynamics. To test this hypothesis, I compare three consumer-resource models differing in terms of mechanisms controlling the timing of the ontogenetic niche shift: the fixed-age model assumes that the age at which the ontogenetic niche shift occurs is fixed; the fixed-size model assumes that the size at the shift is fixed; and the adaptive plasticity model assumes that the timing of the shift is such that the individual fitness of the consumer is maximized.

Focal plants were grown in groups of siblings, groups of plants that were themselves siblings but unrelated to the focal plants, and groups of plants with mixed genotypes. Significant group selection on plant size was observed only when the neighbors were siblings but not when they were unrelated. In sibling groups, individuals with heavier stems had higher fitness, and individuals growing with heavier but shorter neighbors also had higher fitness. Thus, individual and group selection on stem weight operated in the same direction. The detection of group selection in sibling groups can be attributed in part to an increased opportunity for group selection in these groups since sibling groups differed more from one another than the other group types. In addition, the quality of the selective environment in sibling groups may have differed from that for the other group types. Group selection was therefore more prevalent in the most genetically structured sample, in which responses to group selection are also most likely to occur.",NA,NA

However, ecological models often explore the influence of local biotic interactions where physical disturbance is included as a large-scale and imposed source of variability but is not allowed to interact with biotic processes at the local scale. In marine intertidal communities dominated by mussels, wave disturbances create gaps in the mussel bed that recover through a successional sequence. We present a lattice model of mussel disturbance dynamics that allows local interactions between wave disturbance and mussel recolonization, in which each cell of the lattice can be empty, occupied by a mussel bed element, or disturbed (which corresponds to a newly disturbed cell that has unstable edges). As in natural ecosystems, wave disturbance can also spread from disturbed to adjacent occupied cells, and recolonization can also spread from occupied to adjacent empty cells. We first validate the local rules from artificial gap experiments and from natural gap monitoring along the Oregon coast. We analyze the properties of the model system as a function of different oceanographic forcings of productivity and disturbance. We show that the mussel bed can go through phase transitions characterized by a large sensitivity of mussel cover and patterns to oceanographic forcings but also that criticality (scale invariance) is observed over wide ranges of parameters, which suggests self-organization. We also show that spatial patterns in the intertidal can provide a robust signature of local processes and can inform about oceanographic regimes. We do so by comparing the large-scale patterns of the simulation (scaling exponents) with field data, which suggest that some experimental sites are close to criticality.

However, maternal effects such as differential allocation may represent a mechanism promoting genetic sire effects, rather than an alternative to them. Here we report results from an experiment on the horned dung beetle Onthophagus taurus, in which we directly compare genetic sire effects with maternal effects that are dependent on sire phenotype. We found strong evidence that mothers provide more resources to offspring when mated with large-horned males. There were significant heritabilities for both horn length and body size, but when differential maternal effects were controlled, the observed estimates of genetic variance were greatly reduced. Our experiment provides evidence that differential maternal effects may amplify genetic effects on offspring traits that are closely related to fitness.

The evolution of these traits is constrained by trade-offs that account for costs of defense and attack strategies, in line with previous studies on the separate evolution of the host and the parasite. Considering shared control by the host and the parasite in determining the traits of the relationship leads to several novel predictions. First, the host should evolve maximal investment in defense against parasites with an intermediate replication rate.

Phylogenetic evidence suggests that monomorphic enantiostyly has evolved from a straight-styled ancestor and that dimorphic enantiostyly is derived from monomorphic enantiostyly.

We used numerical calculations to examine the evolution of monomorphic and dimorphic enantiostyly under different conditions of pollen transfer, inbreeding depression, and pollinator visitation. Our results demonstrate that in comparison to a putative straight-styled ancestor, both monomorphic and dimorphic enantiostyly function to reduce geitonogamous pollen transfer with a concomitant increase in pollen export. Our calculations suggest that the first stage in the evolution of monomorphic enantiostyly involves the deflection of the style only, followed by selection for reciprocity in anther position to promote more precise cross-pollination.

This description of selective forces reveals that the notion that genomic conflict leads to the spread of restorers is erroneous. By elucidating the effect of each selective force alone and in combination with the others, our approach shows why change in a single parameter, such as the degree of restorer dominance or the cost of restoration, can result in a myriad of opposing selective effects, making it difficult to test theoretical predictions in experimental systems. In particular, our approach allows us to identify the harmonic mean resource allocation between pollen and ovules and the attendant Fisherian selection as playing a critical role in the evolution of the restorer allele and gender polymorphism. We use this conceptual framework to propose empirical methods that emphasize the role of Fisherian selection acting in gynodioecious populations.

As the larvae of both pollinators and (at a later time) exploiters consume seeds, we examine the importance of intraspecific and (asymmetric) interspecific competition among and between pollinators and exploiters for achieving three-way coexistence. With weak intra- and interspecific competition, exploiters can invade the stable mutualism and coexist with the mutualists (either stably or with oscillations), provided the exploiters' intrinsic birthrate (bE) slightly exceeds that of the pollinators. At higher bE, all three species go locally extinct. When facing strong interspecific competition, exploiters cannot invade and coexist with the mutualists if intraspecific competition in pollinators and exploiters is weak. However, strong intraspecific competition in pollinators and exploiters facilitates exploiter invasion and coexistence and greatly expands the range of bE over which stable coexistence occurs. Our results suggest that mutualist/exploiter coexistence may be more easily achieved than previously thought, thus highlighting the need for a better understanding of competition among and between mutualists and exploiters.",NA,NA

Foray search was more efficient in detecting suitable habitat than was random dispersal in most landscapes and was less subject to energetic constraints. However, it also resulted in considerably shorter net dispersed distances and higher mortality per net dispersed distance than did random dispersal, and it would therefore be likely to lead to lower dispersal rates toward the margins of population networks.

The qualitative predictions of the model are most sensitive to the cost of the immune response and to the intensity of transmission. If transmission is weak or the cost of immunity is low, the system evolves to a coevolutionarily stable equilibrium at intermediate levels of investment (and, generally, at a low frequency of resistance). At a higher cost of immunity and as transmission intensifies, the system is not evolutionarily stable but rather cycles around intermediate levels of investment. At more intense transmission, neither host nor parasite invests any resources in dominating its partner so that no resistance is observed in the population.

It has been proposed that the long summer days in the north select for a reduced response to light by the circadian clock, which results in this declining rhythmic expression and, consequently, longer northern critical photoperiods. However, these patterns might also be due to direct, seasonal selection on the critical photoperiod itself, which results in a correlated reduction in the rhythmic component as a result of internal physiological constraints within the organism. Using standard light duration and selection experiments, we show that evolution of photoperiodic time measurement in the mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, results from the direct response of critical photoperiod to seasonal selection and a correlated response of the rhythmic component of photoperiodic time measurement.

We asked this question using a model of two logistically growing populations connected by migration in which both emigration and migration success were determined by the presence or absence of a corridor. We found that in the short run (e.g., during recovery from disaster), corridors are most effective for species with fast-growing populations that have low survivorship when dispersing through unsuitable (matrix) habitat. We also found that emigration rates and habitat-specific mortality rates are key determinants of the effects of corridors on population size. In the long term, corridors are most likely to benefit species with slow-growing populations that have low survivorship when dispersing through matrix habitat. Our results confirm the major conclusions from previous empirical studies of corridor benefits.

The additive genetic variation maintained in mutation-selection balance is reduced by any pattern of the epistatic interactions. The mutational variance, in contrast, is often increased. Large differences in mutational effects among loci emerge, and a negative correlation among (standard mean) locus mutation effects and mutation rates is predicted. Contrary to the common view since Waddington, we find that stabilizing selection in general does not lead to canalization of the trait. We propose that canalization as a target of selection instead occurs at the genic level. Here, primarily genes with a high mutation rate are buffered, often at the cost of decanalization of other genes. An intuitive interpretation of this view is given in the discussion.",NA,NA

The model predicts a variety of circumstances when the largest females remaining in a social group should not change sex in the absence of the dominant male, yet it also predicts that these same conditions should promote sex change in smaller females. If a large female's fecundity is markedly higher than the aggregate of the other members of her social group (i.e., there exists a skew in the size-fecundity distribution that raises a large female's expected reproductive success threshold), she should defer from sex change. Sperm competition can strongly lower the expectation of paternity obtained as a sex-changed male, and this also raises the threshold. The model suggests that deferral of sex change should be more common in species in which intense sperm competition is prevalent (such as fishes living in seagrass beds).

Theoretical models have explained how nuclear-cytoplasmic gynodioecy can be stable for certain assumptions. However, recent advances in our understanding of the genetics, population biology, and molecular mechanisms of sex determination in nuclear-cytoplasmic gynodioecious species suggest the utility of new models with different underlying assumptions. In this article, we examine different negative pleiotropic fitness effects of nuclear restorers (costs of restoration) using genetic and population assumptions based on recent literature. Specifically, we model populations with two CMS types and separate nuclear restorer loci for each CMS type. Under these assumptions, both overdominance for fitness and frequency-dependent selection at nuclear-restorer loci can support nuclear-cytoplasmic gynodioecy. Costs of restoration can be either dependent or independent of the cytoplasmic background. Seed fitness costs are more vulnerable to fixation of CMS types than pollen costs.

The theory makes four predictions that can be tested with this information. Herbivores can adapt to novel, more toxic chemicals by becoming specialists, or they can become generalists but at the cost of lower feeding success on any particular host. Thus, the first two predictions are as follows: herbivores should do better on chemicals that are present in their normal host, and this pattern should be stronger for specialists than for generalists. The ""escape and radiation"" aspect of the theory holds that if a plant taxon with a novel defense chemical diversifies, the chemical will become widespread. Eventually, herbivores will adapt to and disarm it. So the third prediction is that more widespread chemicals are less toxic than more narrowly distributed ones. Because generalists should not do as well as specialists on chemicals disarmed by the latter, the fourth prediction is that the third prediction should be more true for generalists than specialists and should depend on presence/absence of the chemical in the normal host. Multiple regressions of toxicity (herbivore mortality and final weight) on three predictor variables (chemical presence/absence in the normal host, specialism, and chemical floristic distribution) and relevant interactions were used to test these predictions. Chemical presence/absence in the normal host, the interaction between this variable and specialism, and chemical floristic distribution had significant effects on both measures of toxicity, supporting the first three predictions of the model. Support for the fourth prediction (a three-way interaction among all predictor variables) was evident for final weight but not mortality, perhaps because growth is more responsive to toxicity differences than survival.

Our models predict that androgenesis alleles often spread to fixation. If fixation causes the loss of females or female function in the population, population extinction occurs. Therefore, androgenesis alleles represent a new class of selfish genetic elements. Extinction is more likely in dioecious species than in hermaphrodites. Within dioecious species, extinction is more likely when androgenesis occurs via paternal apomixis (vs. fusion or doubling of haploid nuclei) and when females are the heterogametic sex (vs. male heterogamety). The apparent rarity of androgenesis compared to gynogenesis could be because androgenesis is harder to detect and more often leads to population extinction. Also, there could be greater evolutionary constraints on the origin of mutations for androgenesis.

In combination with limited movement, localized consumption makes the predator-prey dynamics more stable than the comparable ""well-mixed"" Rosenzweig-MacArthur model. Using a spatial correlation, one can directly compare a simplified version of the individual-based model with the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model. While this comparison allows the changes in the dynamics to be captured by the ""well-mixed"" Rosenzweig-MacArthur model, the parameters of the functional response are now dependent on the movement parameters, and so the functional response must be estimated statistically from the dynamics of the individual-based model. Yet this implies that aspatial models may work in a scale-specific fashion for spatial systems. Unlike many recent spatial models, the localized consumption and limited movement in the model presented here cannot produce coherent spatial patterns and do not depend on a patchy structure, as found in metapopulation models.

Data acquired from the fossil record and data derived from the evolutionary relationships of extant species are not similar, with each set exhibiting both strengths and weaknesses related to inferring evolutionary patterns. Consequently, expectation that general trends exhibited in the fossil record will correspond to patterns in extant groups is not necessarily warranted. Using phylogenetic relationships of extant species, we show that five of nine families of North American freshwater fishes exhibit an evolutionary trend of decreasing body size. These trends result from the basal position of large species and the more derived position of small species within families. Such trends may be caused by the invasion of small streams and subsequent isolation and speciation. This pattern, potentially influenced by size-biased dispersal rates and the high percentage of small streams in North America, suggests a scenario that could result in the generation of the size-frequency distribution of North American freshwater fishes.",NA,NA

Elasticities were then used to quantify the relative importance of α, ω, Pj, Pa, and F to λ and to test theoretical predictions regarding the relative influence on λ of changes in life-history variables. Neither α nor any other single life-history variable had the largest relative influence on λ in the majority of the populations, and this pattern did not change substantially when effects of phylogeny and body size were statistically removed. Empirical support for theoretical predictions was poor at best. However, analyses of elasticities on the basis of the magnitude (F) and onset (α) of reproduction revealed that α, followed by F, had the largest relative influence on λ in populations characterized by early maturity and high reproductive rates, or when F/α > 0.60. When maturity was delayed and reproductive rates were low, or when F/α < 0.15, survival rates were overwhelmingly most influential, and reproductive parameters (α and F) had little relative influence on λ.

We studied the dynamics of mate recognition in female túngara frogs (Physalaemus pustulosus) in response to a series of calls that were intermediate between the conspecific and each of five allopatricheterospecific calls: two that elicited recognition from females in previous studies and three that did not. This study shows that females perceive variation in allopatric mating signals in a continuous manner with no evidence of perceptual category formation. The strength of recognition is predicted by how different the target stimulus is from the conspecific call within a series of calls. But the differences in recognition responses among call series are not predicted by the similarity of the call series to the conspecific call. The latter result suggests that the strength of recognition of allopatric signals might be influenced by processes of stimulus generalization and past evolutionary history.",NA,NA

We apply the model to data on a lizard (Anolis cristatellus) and show that thermoregulatory behaviors likely inhibit selection for evolutionary shifts in thermal physiology with altitude.

These data conform to the evolution of lowered fitness in a population of defectors, as expected from the Prisoner's Dilemma of game theory.

Fungal endophytes of some cultivated turf and pasture grasses are well known for increasing plant performance and competitive abilities, especially under stress, and increasing resistance to herbivores, pathogens, and root-feeders by virtue of fungal alkaloids. The assumption of mutualism, however, has rarely been tested in native grasses, which often harbor high but variable frequencies of systemic asexual endophytes. We tested the effect of Neotyphodium infections for the native grass Arizona fescue in a 3-yr field experiment. We strictly controlled host genotype and manipulated soil moisture and nutrients. Infection generally decreased host growth in terms of plant volume, number of tillers, and dry mass of shoots and roots. Infected plants also showed decreased reproduction in terms of number and mass of seeds, and the seeds produced by infected plants had lower germination success than plants without their endophytes, suggesting that the negative effects of the symbiont are transferred to the next generation. Plant genotype strongly influenced host's growth and reproduction and interacted with the presence of the endophyte, but the interaction was usually in the direction of negative effects.

Later-breeding females may reuse previous nest sites, and their digging behavior is thought to subject previously buried eggs to mortality. Using game-theoretic models, we show that females can reduce this risk by allocating resources to longevity (the period between arrival and death) as opposed to eggs. Waiting before territory settlement is also expected if it allows females to conserve energy and delay senescence. The models demonstrate how these costs and benefits interact to select for a seasonal decline in longevity, a well-known phenomenon in the salmonid literature, and a seasonal decline in wait duration. Both of these predictions were supported in a field study of kokanee. Female state of reproductive maturity was the most important proximate factor causing variation in longevity and wait duration.

We assume that benefits of territories are monotonously related to the defended amount of divisible resources (hereafter called food). In contrast, no benefits are obtained without a nondivisible resource (hereafter called nest site) in the territory, while more than one nest site does not further increase the benefits. The optimal territory size depends on the relative abundance of these resources. With a low density of nest sites, the optimal territory size is small and includes only the nest site. If the density of nest sites is relatively large, the optimal territory size is high, and territories are contiguous. Competition for these different resources yields contrasting patterns of how populations are regulated. If there is mainly competition for nest sites, we expect density-dependent exclusion through territoriality and no density-dependent reproduction. When competition is mainly for food, we expect density-dependent reproduction because optimal territory size will be compressed at higher densities, resulting in lower reproductive success.

We construct a transactional skew model investigating under what conditions a subordinate in a multimember group is favored to develop into a morphologically specialized worker caste. Our model demonstrates that, contrary to former expectations, the ecological and genetic conditions favoring caste differentiation are far more restrictive than those favoring high skew. Caste differentiation cannot be selected in saturated, symmetrical relatedness groups unless the genetic relatedness among group members is extremely high. In contrast, it can be selected in the saturated, asymmetrical relatedness (parent-offspring) groups with complete skew. If we also consider the future reproduction of subordinates, caste differentiation is possible only after the group size reaches a certain critical point. Most importantly, caste differentiation in a parent-offspring group increases its saturated group size. The positive feedback between group size and the degree of caste differentiation can continue in principle until completely sterile worker castes emerge. Thus, at least in the case of parent-offspring groups, group size but not the degree of reproductive skew may be a better index of the level of social complexity. A scheme for the evolution of sterile worker castes that integrates the role of group size into the framework of reproductive skew theory is proposed.",NA,NA

However, the interaction between density dependence and those density-independent factors that are manifested as environmental noise is poorly understood. We are interested in the conditions under which noise interacts with the density dependence to cause amplification of that noise when filtered by the system. For a broad family of structured population models, we show that amplification occurs near the threshold from stable to unstable dynamics by deriving an analytic formula for the amplification under weak noise. We confirm that the effect of noise is to sustain oscillations that would otherwise decay, and we show that it is the amplitude and not the phase that is affected. This is a feature noted in several recent studies. We study this phenomenon in detail for the Turchin and LPA models of population dynamics. We find that the degree of amplification is sensitive to both the noise input and life-history stage through which it acts, that the results hold for surprisingly high levels of noise, and that stochastic chaos (as measured by local Lyapunov exponents) is a concomitant feature of amplification. Further, it is shown that the temporal autocorrelation, or ""color,"" of the noise has a major impact on the system response. We discuss the conditions under which color increases population variance and hence the risk of extinction, and we show that periodicity is sharpened when the color of the noise and dynamics coincide. Otherwise, there is interference, which shows how difficult it is in practice to separate the effects of nonlinearity and noise in short time series. The sensitivity of the population dynamics to noise when close to a bifurcation has wide-ranging consequences for the evolution and ecology of population dynamics.",NA,NA

For example, organisms may divide energy between reproduction and somatic growth and then subdivide reproductive resources. Genetic variation in allocation to pathways early in such hierarchies (e.g., reproduction) can cause positive genetic correlations between traits that trade off (e.g., offspring size and number) because some individuals invest more resources in reproduction than others. We used quantitative-genetic models to explore the evolutionary implications of allocation hierarchies. Our results showed that when variation in allocation early in the hierarchy exceeds subsequent variation in allocation, genetic covariances and initial responses to selection do not reflect trade-offs occurring at later levels in the hierarchy. This general pattern was evident for many starting allocations and optima and for whether traits contributed multiplicatively or additively to fitness. Finally, artificial selection on a single trait revealed masked trade-offs when variation in early allocation was comparable to subsequent variation in allocation. This result confirms artificial selection as a powerful, but not foolproof, method of detecting trade-offs. Thus, allocation hierarchies can profoundly affect life-history evolution by causing traits to evolve in the opposite direction to that predicted by trade-offs.",NA,NA

Evidence for individual specialization is available for 93 species distributed across a broad range of taxonomic groups. Although few studies have quantified the degree to which individuals are specialized relative to their population, between-individual variation can sometimes comprise the majority of the population's niche width. The degree of individual specialization varies widely among species and among populations, reflecting a diverse array of physiological, behavioral, and ecological mechanisms that can generate intrapopulation variation. Finally, individual specialization has potentially important ecological, evolutionary, and conservation implications. Theory suggests that niche variation facilitates frequency-dependent interactions that can profoundly affect the population's stability, the amount of intraspecific competition, fitness-function shapes, and the population's capacity to diversify and speciate rapidly.

To examine whether butterflies with the most specialized diets follow the pattern found across all butterflies, we repeated the analyses for 37 species of strict monophages and their food plants and found that plant and butterfly richness were similarly weakly associated after incorporating the environmental variables.

Emydids show a striking pattern of high species richness in eastern North America (especially the southeast) and low diversity in other regions. At the continental scale, species richness is positively correlated with the amount of time emydids have been present and speciating in each region, with eastern North America being the ancestral region.

We propose that a division of space that solves this conflict over resources is the outcome of a negotiation between foragers. We name this outcome the socially stable territories (SST). Using game theory we show that in a homogenous patch occupied by two interacting foragers, both individuals receive identical energy yields at the socially stable territories; that is, there is economic equity. Economic inequity can arise in a heterogeneous patch or from asymmetries in fighting abilities between the foragers. Opportunity costs play a role in reducing economic inequity. When the asymmetry in fighting abilities is very large, a negotiated division of space is not possible and the forager with lowest fighting ability may be evicted from the habitat patch.

In support of mutualism and kin selection, I found that reproduction of egg recipient G. solani benefits from brood enlargement, most likely because eggs and gregarious nymphs find safety in greater numbers. But contrary to both parasitism and mutualism, egg dumper reproduction was not improved by offspring abandonment. Indeed, dumpers laid smaller clutches than recipients, and dumpers did not convert a survival advantage into greater future reproduction.
