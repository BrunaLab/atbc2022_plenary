After five months, growth of P. auritum was significantly less under Cordia and Hyeronima than under Cedrela or in the open. The most severe growth reductions occurred under Hyeronima, the species with the highest leaf area index (LAI). Lack of a significant trenching response under Hyeronima suggests the competitive effects of this species were largely the result of shading. The competitive effects of Cordia, a species with relatively high fine root density and open canopy, were almost entirely below ground. Nonetheless, the effects of Cordia and Hyeronima on growth of P. auritum seedlings were equivalent when compared on a per-unit of tree canopy LAI basis. Lack of P. auritum growth suppression under Cedrela is likely the result of the open canopies and relatively low fine root densities of the Cedrela stands. P. phytolaccaefolium growth did not differ among tree overstories. Among tree species, differences in morphology can lead to differences in understory suppression, but these differences depend upon the understory species. -from Author",10,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA,NA
