The Amblyopinini include some forty species placed in five genera, and have been found almost exclusively in the für of small mammals in the Neotropics and Australia (Seevers 1955). This habit differs significantly from that of other members of the large and diverse family Staphylinidae, most of which are free-living predators. As a result of this, and reports of epidermal damage to the host, amblyopinines have been accepted to be obligate blood-feeding ectoparasités (Seevers 1955, Marshall 1981, Kim & Adler 1985). However, many reported behavioural facets appear to be inconsistent with this conclusion. For example, it has been reported that hosts ignore both the presence and movements of these beetles through their für and across highly sensitive areas such as the eyes and vibrissae (P. Hershkovitz, quoted in Seevers 1955). This suggests that the interaction between amblyopinines and their hosts cannot be simply interpreted as adversarial. © 1987, Cambridge University Press.

Carbon mineralization rates were estimated by measuring daily CO2flux from five termite mounds at monthly intervals for 12 months. Carbon flux from the mounds was found to be due to microbial activity as well as termite activity. It is conservatively estimated that the association of A. laurensis and the microbial population present in their mounds is responsible for between 4%-10% of carbon mineralized in this ecosystem, and the contribution of all termites together (mound builders and subterranean) may account for up to 20% of carbon mineralized. Regression analysis showed that rates of carbon mineralization in termite mounds were significantly related to mound moisture and mound temperature.

Of the 261 taxa, 84% were identified to species. Five per cent of the area was of the permanently wetter Akob soil series. The plot was topographically flat and lay about 3 km west of the plot on the Batu Anam soil series, described in an earlier paper. Data on the chemical composition of the three soils are summarized here from a survey in 1967. The vegetation on the Segamat series is of the Shorea-Dipterocarpus type of lowland dipterocarp forest. It has an unusually high abundance of the Euphorbiaceae (25% of trees) and a clear dominant species, Elateriospermum tapos. E. tapos, which regenerates profusely in the shade, grows up in small gaps and is strongly clumped, and appears well suited to the very friable, relatively nutrient-rich soil of the Segamat series, with lower soil-water holding capacity especially in dry periods. Forest on the Segamat series is floristically very different from that on the Batu Anam series. This is most likely due to large differences in soil properties, the latter being of lower clay content, less nutrient-rich and, having a greater soil-water holding capacity at least in dry periods. It was dominated by Dipterocarpaceae. Classification of quadrats on the Segamat series highlighted four classes; vegetation of the main E. tapos-dominated type on relatively dry soil (54% of plot area), vegetation on the wet Akob soil (21%), an association of shade-tolerant, mainly understorey trees beneath non-E. tapos-associated emergents (11%), and an association of long-lived, light-demanding pioneer trees of late-successional stages (11%); 3% of plot had no enumerated trees. Ordination showed that the plot was largely homogeneous with respect to edaphic factors but clearly displayed stages in forest succession. The possible dynamics of the Segamat forest are inferred in terms of species autecology. Two hypotheses are advanced to explain the composition of the Segamat forest: (a) a dynamic equilibirum, (b) a non-equilibrium recovery from a recent catastrophe. The latter was thought more likely. Compared with the more benign Batu Anam environment, where co-dominants might be ‘ecologically equivalent’, the more selective soil conditions on the Segamat leads to reduced equivalence, with accidents of regeneration playing a smaller role in the local distribution of the most abundant species. © 1987, Cambridge University Press.

Only 3% of shrubs examined had colonial Hemiptera feeding on growing shoots. Feeding punctures on leaves were common but the insects which produced them such as the Cicadellidae and various Heteroptera were scarce. Coccoidea and Aleyrodoidea were the dominant and ubiquitous Hemipterans, feeding primarily on the surface of the leaves. Psylloidea were relatively rare and Aphidoidea were not recorded. For the complete data set, which included all leaves examined, there were few significant correlations, either singly or in combination, between the various measures of insect abundance and the state of the 17 leaf characteristics recorded. However, when the data for young leaves were extracted there was evidence to suggest that the number of feeding punctures cm-2 of leaf and the number of coccids cm-2of upper leaf surface increased rapidly to a maximum as the young leaf aged and certain characters changed accordingly. Other more stable leaf characteristics such as hairiness, spininess, glossiness, etc. explained only a small additional amount of the total variance in Hemiptera abundance. © 1987, Cambridge University Press.

Experimental and control microhabitats were compared by complete censusing of macroscopic invertebrates 10 and 20 days after releases. Survival of T. haemorrhoidalis differed significantly among habitats and was reduced by desiccation in dry-season bamboos and in Aechmea nudicaulis and by the presence of a predatory damselfly (Odonata: Zygoptera) in bromeliads. Developmental rate differed among habitats in the wet but not in the dry season; rapid wet-season maturation was associated with increased prey abundance in Heliconia. Larvae of T. haemorrhoidalis consumed particular taxa and size categories of dipterous prey. Predation significantly reduced the abundance and skewed size-class distributions of Culicidae, Ceratopogonidac, Psychodidae, and pooled samples of Thaumaleidae plus Chironomidae. In bamboos, instar distributions of other mosquitoes were skewed in the presence of T. haemorrhoidalis even though a significant reduction in mosquito abundance was not detected. A decrease in species richness of aquatic Diptera was associated with intense predation by Toxorhynchites in Heliconia and A. nudicaulis. Toxorhynchites theobaldi was recognized as the naturally occurring predator in local bamboos, and released larvae caused significant reductions in abundance or size-class frequency shifts among three families of Diptera. Niche segregation between these sympatric Toxorhynchites is maintained by opposition preferences: the larger species, T. theobaldi, oviposits in bamboos and the smaller T. haemorrhoidalis occurs in plant bracts and axils. © 1987, Cambridge University Press.

In the present study two wetter (Northern, Northwestern) and three drier (Central, Eastern, Western) miombo subtypes were recognized. A survey of the woody flora of 94 old-growth and 58 coppice stands in the five miombo subtypes revealed some significant differences in species diversity among them. The floristic differentiantion of miombo subtypes was best achieved by the use of the Shannon species diversity index (H') and species density (number of species 0.1 ha-1or 0.4 ha-1). H' in miombo decreased from 2.247 in Northwestern to 2.136 in Northern, 2.052 in Eastern, 1.918 in Central and 1.824 in Western subtypes. Although species density was not significantly different between wetter miombo subtypes, this decreased in a similar fashion from 18.78 0.1 ha-1in North-western to 18.30 in Northern, 16.65 in Eastern, 14.79 in Central and 12.29 in Western subtypes. The low species diversity in Western drier miombo was attributed to the combined effects of low soil fertility and rainfall. Although the mean number of species per 0.1 ha plot was higher in coppice samples, species richness (d) and index of diversity (H') were lower than in old-growth samples. These results indicate lower species diversity in regenerating miombo. The dynamic aspects of species structure should therefore be considered in the future conservation of biological diversity in miombo woodland. © 1987, Cambridge University Press.

We examine regeneration and successional patterns in Omo Forest Reserve by comparing enumeration data taken before (1952) and after (1981) treatment of the forest by selective canopy opening and climber-cutting (Plot A), or clear-felling and burning (Walsh system) (Plot C). Before treatment, about 50 species in 25 families were found of stems >10 cm dbh, in 4.05 ha of the forest, the Euphorbiaceae contributing the greatest number of species while the medium-sized trees Dtospyros alboflavescens (Ebenaceae) and Strombosia pustulate (Olacaceae) contributed more than 40% of the stems. Twenty-eight years after treatment (1981) the number of species and families remained similar to those in 1952, although smaller areas (0.75 ha) were enumerated; the treated plots were, however, dominated by early succession species such as Macaranga barteri, Musanga cecropioides, Cleistopholis patens, Funtumia elastica and Fagara macrophylla, and lacked an abundance of the ‘economic’ species that treatment had been expected to induce; the medium-sized trees that were dominant in 1952 were still abundant in Plot A but not in Plot C. For stems >30 cm dbh tree diversity (reciprocal of Simpson’s index) was highest (15.7) in a 1952 plot and least (4.8) in the clear-felled plot enumerated in 1981; diversity of the 1952 plots, however, fell markedly to values lower than those for the 1981 plots when computation was based on all stems >10 cm dbh, presumably because of increase in abundance of small-stemmed species like Diospyros spp., Strombosia sp. and Rinorea sp., each represented by a large number of stems. Basal area was greatest (29.6 m2 ha-1) in the 1952 plots and least (12.7 m2ha-1) in the clear-felled plots enumerated in 1981, but the relative distribution of basal area and number of stems in size-classes was similar in all the plots. Mean annual increment, computed by dividing the mean diameter (7.50 cm) of the stems in the clear-felled plots by the number of years (28) over which they had grown, was 0.27 cm. Nauclea diderrichii dominated the seedling regeneration from the first year after clear-felling and burning (1954) till the sixth year (1960), when seedlings of the Meliaceae entered the regeneration list and overall seedling density was 395 per hectare. Among the plots assessed in 1981, the standing crop was greatest in an untreated Control plot (229.6 t ha”1) followed by Plot A (159.7 t ha’1) and Plot C (91.1 t ha”1), but the relative allocation of biomass to stem, branch, leaf, root and fruit fractions was comparable for all plots. The data arc discussed in relation to other Nigerian forest studies and it is suggested that the main qualitative features of structural organization and the species composition of the top canopy synusia of mature secondary rain forest may be determined quite early in the development of the stand. © 1987, Cambridge University Press.

Mortality rates were independent of size class. Mortality exceeded recruitment during the first 16 years to 1963, but was thereafter almost exactly balanced by recruitment. Recruitment rate increased significantly for the latter part of the study. Mortality was greater than average for understorey species and lower for emergents. Pioneer and late semi species together showed significantly higher mortality rates. Amongst the commoner species, emergent, late-seral and pioneer species showed the highest annual diameter growth rates with species averages over all size classes exceeding 3 mm yr-1; rates for main-canopy species were between 1.5 and 2.5 mm yr-1, and understorey species generally less than 2 mm yr-1.

Principal components analysis indicated a gradient of soil reaction and available phosphorus through the core of the plot. Ordination (DECORANA) of floristic data revealed that a floristic trend paralleled the soil trend. In the vicinity of a drainage line, at the western end of the core, soils were lower in available phosphorus, more acid, sandier and texturally more uniform with depth. Typical trees of femdsols were prominent on these soils but were replaced by species of ferric luvisols, especially members of the Sterculiaceae, on soils of superior nutrient status towards the eastern end. It is suggested that the soil gradients were not effects produced by the trees. Comparison of a 1946 data set with the 1974 data supported the view that the forest had been structurally and floristically stable over the interval between assessments.
