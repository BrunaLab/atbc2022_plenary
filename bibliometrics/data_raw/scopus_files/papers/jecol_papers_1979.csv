The pollen sequence studied extends from the present day to 9140 BP. Three local pollen zones with three subzones are delimited on the basis of numerical-zonation procedures. The most striking feature is the absence of any forest development throughout the Flandrian, presumably as a result of intensive exposure to westerly gales. -from AUthors",40,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,1
