The last cyclone caused most damage to canopy structure. Mortality in the 6-month interval spanning the first cyclone was 7.0% of all trees, while mean annual mortality for all other intervals (including those spanning other cyclones) was 1.4-2.2% year-1. Mortality varied between species but was independent of topography and geographical location. 3 Recruitment increased from very low rates (median 0.0% year-1) before the first cyclone to median values of 1.6-3.2% year-1 during 1971-79, i.e. following a lag period of 3.5-8 years after the first cyclone. Recruitment rates were higher on plots showing greater mortality rates during this cyclone. Recruitment and mortality rates were still higher in 1994 than they had been before the 1967-70 cyclones. 4 Mean annual mortality rates were positively correlated with mean annual recruitment rates across species. This relationship reflects a continuum of life-history characteristics and contributes to constancy in the relative abundance of the 12 species when the same sets of plots are compared over all measurement intervals up to 30 years. 5 We conclude that cyclone impacts have only short-term effects on the relative abundance of common tree species on Kolombangara, and do not therefore prevent the establishment of an equilibrium rank abundance hierarchy or create spatial variation in tree species composition. Differences in forest composition across Kolombangara are more likely to have been caused by differential anthropogenic disturbance linked to settlement patterns.",100,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Cyclone | Demography | Disturbance | Human impact | Long-term measurement | Relative abundance | Solomon Islands | Tropical rain forest,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,1

Freshwater habitats in cultivated and densely populated lowland regions of Europe have experienced profound changes during the last 100 years. We take advantage of the long interest in aquatic plants in Denmark to compare the submerged flora in lakes and streams in 1896 and 1996. 2. Most of the lakes which contained a diverse submerged vegetation 100 years ago now have the high phytoplankton biomasses and summer transparencies below 2.0 m characteristic of eutrophication. The majority of 17 lakes included in both old and recent studies have lost all or most of their submerged species. Species richness for those lakes that were vegetated did not, however, differ significantly between old and recent studies. 3. Species richness declined markedly in the 13 streams included in both studies. Over all sites, there was also a significant decline of species richness per locality. Potamogeton species declined from 16 to 9, despite an 8-fold increase in the number of sites surveyed. 4. Similar compositions and rank-abundances of Potamogeton species in lakes and streams studied 100 years ago reflect suitable growth conditions and mutual exchange of propagules. Today, low habitat diversity and frequent disturbance in streams and low recruitment from lakes favours only robust, fast-growing species capable of regrowth following weed cutting and dredging. 5. A positive interspecific relationship observed in the contemporary stream vegetation between mean local abundance and number of occupied sites was probably promoted by redistribution of plants as a result of disturbance and efficient dispersal in the interconnected stream network. 6. The freshwater macrophyte flora in north-west Europe presently includes a high proportion of rare species which are threatened by extinction. Both species typical for oligotrophic conditions (e.g. P. filiformis and P. polygonifolius) and another group of large, slow-growing species (e.g. P. alpinus, P. lucens, P. praelongus and P. zosterifolius), were once common but are now infrequent, while other transient species have remained rare (e.g. P. acutifolius, P. colouratus, P. densus and P. rutilus).

A species mixture at a site is described by a point on a plane with two traits as axes. Change along an environmental gradient is then represented as a trajectory across the trait-plane. Trajectories along different environmental gradients are compared. 3 We measured leaf width, specific leaf area (SLA) and mature canopy height for the 386 perennial species found at 46 sites spread along rainfall and soil total phosphorus gradients in south-eastern Australia. Each trait was lognormally distributed across species within sites, hence the mean of log10(trait) satisfactorily described the species mixture at each site. 4 Combinations of assemblage-mean leaf width with SLA followed similar trajectories as rainfall and soil total P decreased. For these traits in this setting, the method indicated that low rainfall and low soil P favour similar trait-combinations. 5 Mature plant height also decreased along both rainfall and soil P gradients, and thus was positively correlated with leaf width and SLA at the level of assemblage means. The rainfall trajectories involving height behaved differently from the soil P trajectories, especially at rainfalls below c. 400 mm year-1, where assemblage-mean height declined much further than at low soil P. 6 Across all species, traits were only very loosely correlated (r2 from 0.04 to 0.17). For leaf width and SLA, evolutionary divergences were positively correlated, both before and after cross-correlation with divergence in rainfall and soil P Was removed. This latter measures evolutionary divergence correlation within habitat. For height the picture was more complicated. Considering these within-habitat divergence correlations, species that were taller at maturity tended to have lower SLA and leaf width. This pattern is the reverse of the broad geographical correlation of assemblage means, showing that the patterns across assemblages result from species being selectively sifted from the regional flora into sites, not from evolutionary or cross-species correlations. 7 The trait-combination trajectory approach showed some commonalities between low soil nutrient and low rainfall habitats with regard to traits favoured in species occurring there, but also some differences. The approach has potential for clarifying which environmental factors can usefully be grouped together as 'stress', and which trait combinations can usefully be regarded as part of a syndrome favoured by stress.",333,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Ecological strategies | Environmental gradients | Leaf width | Plant height | Sclerophylly | Specific leaf area | Stress | Trade-offs,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,3

Beauv. is a perennial, tussock forming grass which is conspicuously successful as a pioneer in badlands in submediterranean areas. We analysed its population dynamics using a matrix population model that is intermediate between traditional demographic models and fully spatially explicit models. 2 Tussocks are considered as a set of spatial units, each classified according to the number and state (seedling, juvenile or adults) of the tillers it contains. The growth rate (Λi) determined from the model estimates the spatial spread of A. calamagrostis as a rate of increase in the number of occupied quadrats. 3 We constructed six projection matrices from data for populations on two substrate types, in 2 years with differing climatic conditions and considering the whole life cycle or eliminating sexual reproduction or vegetative multiplication. 4 All the matrices predicted growth rates greater than one. Sexual reproduction was an important process for spatial spread in A. calamagrostis, unlike many other perennial grasses. In contrast, new colonization by vegetative reproduction contributed little to spatial growth of populations, although some expansion may still be possible in the absence of sexual reproduction. 5 A. calamagrostis, like other tussock-forming plants, exhibits a conservative tactic of slow spread. Tiller dynamics serve mainly for consolidation and maintenance of the plant in already occupied space and sexual reproduction is the main way to ensure colonization of new safe-sites.

However, most of the taxa that were distinctive to either treatment or control seedlings occurred only once across the site, precluding statistical detection of potential ash effects on EM community composition. There were no significant effects of ash removal on plot-level mycorrhizal community richness or diversity, and there were no distinct treatment-related clusters in a principal components analysis. 3 Analysis of the combined data indicated that numbers of fungal taxa per seedling, numbers of successive root depth increments colonized by the same taxon, and distances to neighbouring seedlings colonized by the same taxon, were randomly distributed across the site for the majority of mycorrhizal fungi. These distributional patterns suggest that the post-fire mycorrhizal community structure on P. muricata arose primarily from Successful colonization by randomly distributed point-source fungal inocula within the upper mineral soil layer of the forest floor. 4 By comparison with pre-fire studies from similar P. muricata sites nearby, our data indicate that severe wildfire disturbance resulted in marked changes in mycorrhizal community composition, and a sharp increase in the relative biomass of ascomycetous fungi.",124,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Ash | Diversity | Fire | Fungi | Mycorrhizas | P. muricata | Spatial distribution,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,5

Perforation caused little mechanical damage. 3 Allometric methods were used to evaluate treatment effects on biomass allocation and morphology. 4 Inhibition of pressurized ventilation resulted in decreased allocation to below-ground weight and decreased rhizome penetration into the substrate in two of three experiments.

In the third experiment, growth clearly decreased in deep water, although inhibition of pressurized ventilation did not affect growth, biomass allocation or morphology at either of the water depths tested. 5 Decreased allocation to below-ground parts and decreased rhizome lengths may be adaptations to allow the oxygen concentration in roots and rhizomes to be maintained above a critical level when the oxygen supply is low. 6 Pressurized ventilation may improve the performance of P. australis but only under certain conditions (e.g. not when growth rate is low or the substrate has a high redox potential).",30,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Allometry | Biomass allocation | Convective flow | Oxygen | Rhizome architecture,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,6

The biomass of Equisetum plants was also correlated with edaphic characteristics of the C horizon. 4 The absorption of nutrients from the C horizon by Equisetum helped bring P and other minerals to the soil surface, increasing the amount of minerals in the O horizon and thus making them potentially available to other species, including Myrica gale, Salix spp., and Carex spp. Productivity in this community is limited by P and N, and the ability of Equisetum to act as a nutrient pump may help explain why its net primary productivity is high for a cold-temperate wetland.",37,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Biogeochemistry | Decomposition | Horsetail | Phosphorus | Potassium | Root distribution,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,7

The mean half-life of populations was estimated to be around 45 years. Most populations are small (a few m2) in area, with only a few as large as a hectare in size. 3. Population regulation occurs as a consequence of density-dependent seedling recruitment. This reduces population growth by up to 87%. The nature of this density dependence appeared to be essentially the same across sites and years. 4. Interactions with perennial vegetation also significantly affected population dynamics, through reducing seedling recruitment and survival, and on average depressed population growth by a further 30% at one site and by up to 96% in another population. 5. Plants were aggregated and densities were positively spatially autocorrelated. This tends to buffer patches against extinction. Mean seed production per plant, was also significantly spatially autocorrelated; however, the strength of this was minor. 6.

Comparison of the distribution of subplot densities with the results of a spatial simulation model suggested that disturbance at a relatively large scale (at least 20 × 20 cm) impacts on dynamics at the population scale. 7.

The pollen record was used as a template for the identification of synchronous levels between cores. 2 A non-random pattern of change in bryophyte macrofossils and humification was simultaneous between all four cores. Stratigraphic changes occurred independently of human land-use and were best interpreted as palaeoclimatic events. Remains of Racomitrium lanuginosum and Sphagnum papillosum, in conjunction with changes in peat humification, provided the clearest indication of past increases in climatic wetness ('wetshifts') to impact upon mire hydrology and ecology. 3 Eight wetshifts were identified and radiocarbon-dated, beginning at c. 3250, 2550, 2150, 1400, 1150, 875, 600 and 325 calibrated years BP (cal. BP). Seven of these wetshifts match closely with palaeoclimatic events from a range of mires previously examined in Britain and Ireland. We suggest that blanket mires may provide the best source of decade- to century-scale palaeoclimatic information in oceanic north-west Europe. 4 The proxy-climatic evidence indicates that: (i) the extinction of Sphagnum imbricatum at Kentra Moss (at c. 1400 cal.

Their establishment may therefore depend on coincidence of chance seed dispersal, favourable weather conditions and low rodent densities. 4 In addition, episodic burial by sand prevents most species from colonizing young dune ridges, while burial of seedlings by litter limits recruitment on older dune ridges with developing forest.

The objective of this study was to examine how increasing water depth in the field affects the aeration achieved by convective gas flow in an emergent aquatic sedge (Eleocharis sphacelata). 2. We compared internal pressurization, convective gas flow, changes in internal gas composition, and differences in plant morphology at three depths (0.75-0.90 m, 1.40 m, and 2.15-2.65 m) in an oligotrophic lake. 3. Internal pressures generated in the aerial tissue of the influx culms were similar at all depths, but the convective inflows increased with depth due to lower resistances to convective flow in the plants growing in deeper water. In contrast, rates of flow returning up the efflux culms decreased with depth, due to a decrease in ratio of influx:efflux culms with depth. 4. Respiration lowered the oxygen concentration in the stagnant internal gas at night, with predawn concentrations highest at the shallowest site and lowest at the deepest site. Low oxygen concentrations also persisted longer after dawn in plants at the deep site than at the other sites due to the large volume of stagnant gas that had to be expelled relative to the flow rates. 5. By 14.00 h, the stagnant gas had been flushed from the plants at all depths, and oxygen concentrations were close to atmospheric values throughout. The two factors apparently responsible for maintaining high oxygen concentrations when convective flow was operating were (i) morphological changes at the deep site that reduced the resistance to flow, and (ii) dissolution of carbon dioxide produced in respiration into the external medium. 6. The data indicate that the average oxygen concentration maintained internally over a 24-h cycle by convective flow decreases significantly with depth, suggesting that oxygen stress due to gas transport limitations may be one of the factors limiting depth penetration in this species and other emergent aquatic plants.",36,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Emergent macrophyte | Flooding | Oxygen | Respiration | Wetland,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,18

Salt marshes in south-west Spain are being invaded by Spartina densiflora, a South American introduction, although the native S. maritima still dominates many lower marshes. A transplant experiment was used to investigate the means by which physical and chemical factors may determine lower vegetation limits in the tidal frame. Both species were transplanted from a mid-level marsh to lower, unvegetated tidal flats. 2. The survival and growth of transplanted clumps and their constituent tillers were monitored on an elevational gradient. The photosynthetic competence of transplants was assessed by measurements of leaf gas exchange and the fast kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence. Submergence period, salinity, redox potential and sulphide concentration in the sediment were also examined at the transplant sites. 3. Neither species survived for a year at the lowest transplant point (+ 1.04 m relative to Spanish Hydrographic Zero). At +1.41 m elevation, S. maritima survived well but all clumps of S. densiflora died. At higher elevations (+1.46-1.67 m), clumps of both species had high survival rates. Tiller growth rates in surviving clumps of both species increased with elevation, but that of S. densiflora was more sensitive to low elevation. 4. S. maritima showed no impairment of photosynthetic performance, even at the lowest elevation; its rates of gas exchange were independent of elevation, as were its chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. In contrast, in S. densiflora the rate of CO2 uptake declined and stress to photosystem II (Fv/Fp) increased at lower elevations; both of these photosynthetic measurements were linearly related to sediment redox potential. Stomatal conductance did not vary with elevation. 5. S. maritima has a potentially wide elevational tolerance and an absolute lower limit substantially below that of S. densiflora. The progressively reduced growth and survival of S. densiflora at lower levels appear to result primarily from impairment of photosynthesis when root conditions are hypoxic. This effect is mediated through effects on the photochemical apparatus rather than on stomatal resistance to CO2 uptake. 6. These studies define lower limits to the fundamental niches of the two species in a Mediterranean-type salt marsh and thus provide a basis for future investigations of interactions between them.

We tested for differences between species and asked whether the differences were related to phylogeny, growth form or shade tolerance. 3 Among individuals not known to have resprouted previously, we estimate that the annual rate of resprouting is 1.7% for individuals in both small and large size classes (1-9.9 cm d.b.h. and > 10 cm d.b.h.). For small and large individuals, respectively, annual mortality of previously undamaged individuals is 2.2% and 1.5%, while that of resprouted individuals is 9.6% and 10.3%. This resulted in survival of 62% of resprouted individuals over 5 years, compared to 90% survival among individuals not known to have resprouted recently. 4 Resprouting rates varied by species and family, but little between growth forms. Species in the families Lauraceae and Piperaceae had high rates of resprouting. Resprouting was common across the spectrum of shade tolerance. 5 Damage to woody forest plants on Barro Colorado Island is frequent, and many species are able to respond by resprouting.

We used a combination of pollen records and landscape data to identify the timing and major pathways of this land-cover transformation. 2 Pollen assemblages dated to about AD 1800 were collected from 20 Danish lakes with a median size of 26 ha. Fossil pollen records for the interval 4500 BC - AD 1800 were compiled from 11 of these 20 sites and divided into 11 time units corresponding to major archaeological periods. 3 Land cover around the 20 sites was digitized from historical maps, dating from the same period as the pollen assemblages. Percentage cover of woodland, heathland, wetland and agricultural land within 2- and 5-km radii were calculated (calculations were also made within 10- and 20-km radii for woodland). Environmental data within 5 km of each site were collected from soil, geological and topographical maps. 4 The AD 1800 pollen assemblages formed three clusters characterized by either a dominance (> 20%) of Calluna (group A), a dominance (> 10%) of Fagus (group B) and a dominance of Poaceae with Fagus < 10% and Calluna < 20% (group C). Respectively, these clusters correspond well to sites where heathland is the dominant land cover, where it has a strong woodland element and where agricultural land is dominant with little, if any, woodland or heathland. 5 Direct and indirect ordinations suggest that the main variation in the pollen assemblages from the 20 sites is related to gradients in soil clay content and in the degree of landscape openness. Land-cover data from within a 2-km radius account for almost as much of the variation in pollen data as do land-cover data from within a 5-km radius. 6 Indirect ordinations of AD 1800 samples with the fossil records as passive samples reveal that long-term records from cluster B sites (the '1800 woodland type') show little landscape variation through time. Samples from cluster C sites (the '1800 agricultural area type') show the same starting point as cluster B but their development diverge to more open landscapes. Cluster A sites (the '1800 heathland type') either develop directly from rather wooded landscapes to heathland or by heathland expansion after initial development towards landscapes producing cluster C type pollen assemblages. 7 Chord distances between the AD 1800 sample and the (pre)historic samples at 10 long-term sites strongly suggest that the between-site variation in land-cover characteristic of the early 19th century was already in existence by 1000 BC. Direct ordination of the fossil samples using woodland cover at AD 1800 as an environmental variable and soil clay content as a covariable also indicates that the macro-scale land-cover patterns of the historical cultural landscape in Denmark has been present for more than 3000 years.",82,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Historical analogues | Holocene palaeoecology | Land-use history | Pollen representation | Pollen source area,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,23

Fragmentation of tiger bush landscapes in south-west Niger between 1960 and 1992 is evidenced by a reduction of percentage woody vegetation cover, changes in the spatial attributes of vegetation patches, and an increase in the spatial heterogeneity of the landscapes. The spatial patterns and dynamics of these landscapes were effectively captured using a combination of selected patch-based landscape metrics that measured specific aspects of the spatial pattern. 2. Derived from the spatial distribution of the alternating bands of vegetation and bare ground, lacunarity curves provide a particularly effective quantitative measure of the spatial pattern and dynamics of tiger bush landscapes in terms of percentage vegetation cover, spatial heterogeneity, and the domain of scale of the landscape. Lacunarity curves can be used to characterize landscapes in areas with different climates and topographic settings, and are an effective and parsimonious indicator of the fragmentation of tiger bush. 3. The dynamics of the vegetation bands during the fragmentation process was anisotropic. A significantly larger proportion of woody vegetation reduction occurred in the downslope than upslope portions of woody patches, while the opposite was true for woody vegetation expansion. These results corroborate the hypothesis that tiger bush bands migrate upslope due to the upslope-downslope resource gradient across the vegetation band. 4. Fragmentation of the tiger bush landscapes reduced retention of water on site, significantly increasing the landscape permeability to surface flow. When vegetation bands were well connected in 1960, no transects were found that allowed surface water percolation. That is, no path travelling through the bare ground areas was found to connect the upslope edge and downslope edge of any of the 200-m long transects, regardless of their width (50, 100 or 150 m). By 1992, within the same but now severely fragmented landscapes transects of all widths allowed water to percolate across them (44% if 50 m wide to 89% if 150 m wide).

Four main theories exist. The Stochastic theory sees species assembly as being random. The Humpty Dumpty/Alternative Stable States (ASS) theory suggests that a community may be unable to reassemble itself from its constituent species. The Deterministic theory suggests there will be convergence to one stable state. The Pre-adaptation theory is similar to the Deterministic theory but emphasizes that many species fit the stable state because of characters acquired elsewhere. 2 The reassembly of a flora into new communities in a different country, or its assimilation as a major component of such communities, offers a means to test these theories. The invasion of British plant species into New Zealand, and their reassembly into roadside communities there, is a good example of such a natural experiment. 3 Plant communities of NZ roadsides were compared to the communities of the British National Vegetation Classification (NVC). British roadside communities were also compared to the NVC as a control. New Zealand roadside communities provided a fit to the NVC communities of only 54.7% on average. After excluding species that are not present in NZ, and therefore could not possibly reassemble, the fit increased to 61.1%. British roadsides gave a 65.8% fit. The NZ figures are similar to the fit obtained with random data (58.7%), indicating that the NZ communities bear little relation to the ones formed by the same species in Britain. 4 Similarity between roadside communities in NZ and Britain was low, forming two almost distinct sets of communities. 5 Some of the predictions of the Stochastic, Humpty Dumpty/ASS and Deterministic models are borne out, but others are not. It is concluded that British species have reassembled into communities in NZ most of which are new, i.e. distinct from those that occur in the native range of the species in Britain.

We evaluated the role of environmental alteration vs. historical factors in controlling distributional patterns of Gaultheria procumbens, a woody, clonal understorey species with a pronounced restriction to areas that have never been ploughed, and near absence from adjoining areas that were ploughed in the 19th century. The demographic study was conducted in scrub oak and hardwood plant communities on an extensive sand plain, where it was possible to control for the effect of variation in environment prior to land use 3. The observed demographic effects were contrary to the hypothesis that persistent environmental alteration depressed demographic performance and limited the distribution of G. procumbens. We observed no overall effect of land-use history on stem density, stem recruitment or flower production. In fact, some aspects of performance were enhanced in previously ploughed areas. Populations in previously ploughed areas exhibited less stem mortality in scrub oak transitions, an increase in germination, seedling longevity and proportion of potentially reproductive stems in both plant communities, a trend for slower observed rates of population decline in both plant communities, and a higher projected rate of population growth in the scrub oak transitions. Thus, particularly in scrub oak communities, the lower abundance of G. procumbens in formerly ploughed than in unploughed areas contrasted with its performance. 4. The limited occurrence of G. procumbens in formerly farmed areas was explained instead by its slow intrinsic growth rate, coupled with limited seedling establishment. Lateral population extension occurred exclusively through vegetative growth, allowing a maximum expansion of 43 cm year-1. 5.

Pollen limitation or inbreeding depression in small populations are therefore more likely explanations for these patterns than is habitat quality. 3. Germination rate and survival of seedlings in a common environment was not related to population size in either species, although P. veris developed into larger rosettes when seeds were derived from large populations. This suggests that inbreeding depression occurs in small populations of P. veris. 4. In a factorial fertilizer-by-competition experiment with P. veris, offspring from larger populations grew significantly larger and responded more strongly to fertilizer. For this declining species genetic deterioration as a result of habitat fragmentation may therefore aggravate the effects of environmental changes such as habitat eutrophication. 5.

Mechanisms that link germination and emergence to environmental cues associated with seedling success (predictive germination) would be expected to evolve when seedlings have a greater mortality risk than seeds, but may be less important in perennial plants than in annual plants. 2. We investigated variation in predictive seedling emergence among divergent populations of a short-lived perennial desert grass, Digitaria californica, from sites that differed in climatic and edaphic factors. This species is native to environments in which the amount and duration of adequate soil moisture may control germination and seedling establishment success. 3. We utilized a special irrigation system that permits application of a range of amounts of water within a single experiment in a glasshouse. Emergence data were subjected to probit and survival analyses to describe differences among the populations in response to applied water. 4. Significant variation in predictive emergence was shown to exist among populations of D. californica when measured as amount of water required for 50% emergence following 3 days of water application, or as time required to achieve this level of emergence. Both climatic and soil characteristics were important with populations that originated from sites with less summer precipitation, and soils with higher water-holding capacity tended to have lower water requirements for emergence. 5.

The grass Festuca ovina is an important constituent of the species-rich 'alvar' grasslands on the Baltic island of Ȯland. Levels of allozyme polymorphism are high and variation is known to be correlated with habitat variation (soil moisture, pH and depth). 2. A 9-year field experiment on species diversity provided replicate plots (in three sites) that had been subjected to six different experimental treatments (control; N + P + K; P + K; N + K; K; water). 3. Samples of F. ovina were collected and analyses of deviance were used to investigate associations between allele frequencies, at each of four polymorphic loci, and the nutrient/water treatments. We also used the models to estimate predicted values for the alleles in different nutrient/water treatments and in interactions involving the nutrient/water treatments and additional explanatory variables (vegetation height and clipping). 4. There were significant allozyme frequency differences between samples of F. ovina from the six different nutrient/water treatments in the grassland experiment. Frequencies in the fertilized or watered plots had diverged from those in the control plots. There were also significant allele-habitat associations (after the removal of site effects), especially at the Pg1-2 locus. 5. Soil moisture was the only variable that was common to this study and an earlier study of variation in F. ovina in natural habitats. In natural populations, the Pgi-2-2 allele was significantly associated with soil moisture and was more common in dry habitats. Our findings that the frequency of the Pgi-2-2 allele was significantly affected by the nutrient/water treatments, and that it was rarest in the treatment that involved the addition of extra water, were therefore as predicted. 6.

We compared the spatial patterns of seed dispersal generated by frugivorous birds with those of seedling survival for the shrub Olea europaea. We examined the relative importance of dispersal in determining plant recruitment and tested whether the initial dispersal pattern persisted throughout recruitment. 2 We quantified the processes affecting each stage of regeneration (seed within a ripe fruit, dispersed seed, seedling and sapling) in different microhabitats, and evaluated transition probabilities between stages. We could then determine the overall probability of a seed in a ripe fruit becoming a sapling, and compare the probability of such an event occurring in different microhabitats. 3 Only 9.3% of the emerged seedlings reached the sapling stage, whereas 35.3% of the seeds were dispersed; 27.0% of dispersed seeds produced seedlings and 62.9% of saplings survived for 2 years. Seedling survival was therefore the critical link in regeneration. Water stress was responsible for more than 70% of seedling losses, which suggests that abiotic factors (mainly rainfall) may account for most of the fluctuation in recruitment in this species. 4 Neither post-dispersal seed predation nor germination caused changes in the initial spatial distribution of seeds, but differences in the requirements of seeds and seedlings then caused spatial uncoupling. The most favourable places for seeds were the worst for seedlings, and consequently frugivore-generated dispersal patterns differed from the final spatial pattern of recruitment. 5 Recruitment under conspecifics was nearly zero and dispersers are therefore crucial if recruitment is to occur. Their effect on the amount of recruitment was, however, overwhelmed by processes acting on the seedling stage. 6 For Olea europaea, the pattern generated by short-term recruitment dynamics persists in the long-term spatial distribution of saplings.",302,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Avian-seed dispersal | Biotic and abiotic factors | Microhabitats | Plant recruitment | Seed-seedling conflicts,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,32

The intensity of the above-ground competition was greatest in loam and least in sand sediments.

The theory is mechanistic and quantitative in nature leading to a variety of testable predictions. 3.

Experiments on competition between plant species are frequently designed without considering the analysis stage of the study. We argue that this omission may lead to over-complication of the issue of designing experiments. 2. An overwhelming number of studies have shown that the effects on performance of competition in plant mixtures may be described by simple (hyperbolic) regression models. The most natural view of the problem of measuring plant competition is therefore as a problem in regression. 3. Only with experiments designed explicitly to apply regression analyses can phenomena such as frequency dependence and the size dependence of measures of competition be identified. In contrast to previous assertions, this means that designs that are based around, or allow, regression analysis are the most robust as such effects may be tested for using appropriate statistics. 4. Experiments are probably most easily designed to measure competition as a function of the density of interacting species, rather than biomass. This is because the per unit biomass effect of competition on performance is a function of density. Competition measures based on biomass will hence be dependent on the density at which the experiment is performed. Furthermore, the most effective way to manipulate biomass is through changing species' densities. 5. In terms of economy of design, we would recommend simple additive series.

Three methods to estimate nutrient losses in bryophytes were evaluated: a conventional growth analysis technique, a retrospective analysis and a 15N-tracer approach. 2. Estimates for nitrogen retention varied between 3 and 10 years as a result of the different N pools considered by the three methods. Growth analysis results depended on the distinction between live and dead tissues, whereas retrospective analysis gave valuable information on N release from decaying segments but did not measure MRT within the living segments. Valid estimates of MRT were obtained by a 15N-tracer approach. 3. MRT and aNP of H. splendens were similar to values typically found in woody evergreen vascular plants. Efficient nutrient recycling and a relatively long segment life span were responsible for the long residence time of nitrogen. Feathermosses show efficient nutrient acquisition, nutrient recycling and acropetal transport; nutrient losses will therefore be small. 4.

We hypothesized that regeneration in these gaps would maintain and reinforce species' distribution patterns across the intertidal gradient in this mangrove ecosystem. 2.

The total area of forest in the gap-phase is currently 1.9%, with an annual formation rate of 0.23% year-1.

Our aim was to define an alternative mechanism of grass-tree coexistence in savanna ecosystems. The model we have built concentrates on life history-disturbance interactions between grasses and trees. 3. The model demonstrates coexistence for a wide range of environmental conditions, and exhibits long periods of slow decline in adult tree numbers interspersed with relatively infrequent recruitment events. Recruitment is controlled by rainfall, which limits seedling establishment, and fire, which prevents recruitment into adult size classes. Decline in adult tree numbers is the result of continuing, but low levels, of adult mortality. Both aspects of the dynamics are consistent with an established non-equilibrium mechanism of coexistence (the storage effect). 4.

Well-preserved stem cross-sections (n = 140) were recovered and the entire stand was mapped. 2. Stand reconstruction combined with pollen and sediment analysis revealed a pure spruce forest in the sandy lowlands surrounded by hills dominated by pine, oak and birch.

A general model of peatland dynamics is presented that emphasizes the interaction between water table depth and peat production. The model consists of two coupled, non-linear differential equations representing change in depth of peat and depth to the water table. Several simplified models are also considered to show the logical development of this model from previously published ones. The model provides an integrated view of how peatlands function over long time scales, by focusing on the non-linear interactions among peat production, decomposition and hydrology. 2. Analysis of the model shows that equilibrium peat accumulation and water table depth depend on the net water input to the peatland. In drier sites, peatlands with relatively deep water tables develop and the equilibrium peat depth increases with increasing water input. In very wet conditions, peatlands have water tables near the surface, peat accumulation is limited by low production rates, and equilibrium peat depth is lower than is possible in comparatively drier sites. Over a range of intermediate water balances, there are two simultaneous equilibrium states where deep, dry peatlands and shallower, wet peatlands can both occur. This sensitivity to water balance suggests that small changes in precipitation regime, such as are expected with climate variability and change, could rapidly convert peatlands that are now in equilibrium into either sources or sinks of carbon.",192,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Bog | Carbon storage | Climate change | Mire | Model | Peatland | System dynamics | Water,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,44

Forest edges, which are prominent features in the north-eastern United States landscape, may control the flux of organisms between forest and non-forest habitats. Previous studies have described edge structure rather than function, as determined by interaction with such fluxes. 2. The function of the forest edge may be linked to the structure of its vegetation. We tested this hypothesis by experimentally altering the structure of the vegetation at two deciduous forest edges in Millbrook, New York, USA. Intact and thinned plots were established at each edge and we determined whether the structure of the edges influenced the flux of herbivores, as measured by herbivore damage to transplanted tree seedlings. 3. Herbivore damage to seedlings at site 1 was affected by edge vegetation structure and by distance from the edge. The edge structure effect was due to herbivory by voles, which was significantly greater in the intact than in the thinned treatment. Regardless of treatment, voles damaged seedlings only on the edge and 30-40 m from the edge and did no damage in the forest interior (90-100 m), whereas deer damaged significantly more seedlings in the forest interior than on the edge. At site 2, where vole damage was concentrated on the edge, damage to seedlings was affected only by distance from the edge, not edge structure. 4. The two dominant herbivores, white-tailed deer and meadow voles, preferentially damaged different seedling species. In addition, tree seedlings browsed by deer resprouted more frequently than those clipped by voles. Our results suggest that both edge structure and distance from the edge influence herbivore activity and, as a result, influence the spatial arrangement, density and composition of populations of tree seedlings during regeneration in forest fragments.",144,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Edge permeability | Fragmentation | Meadow voles | Tree seedlings | White-tailed deer,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,45

Alliaria petiolata, a European biennial herb, is an important pest in temperate North American deciduous forests. Habitat resource structure has probably been important for invasion and proliferation of this species. 2. Alliaria was grown in an experimental garden at two densities (equivalent to 17 and 170 plants m-2), three nutrient levels (no, low, or high nutrient addition) and three light levels (ambient sunlight and two shading treatments) to determine the effects of environmental heterogeneity on growth, reproduction and resource allocation in both mature and rosette plants. 3. Overall, rosette growth and allocation patterns were significantly affected by all three variables tested. Low plant density, nutrient addition and high light availability resulted in plants with more leaves and greater dry weight biomass. Biomass allocation to shoots was greatest for plants in high-density and low-light treatments. Leaf chlorophyll content was significantly greater for plants in the two shaded treatments. 4. Mature plants also responded to environmental manipulation with significantly greater total dry weight biomass at low plant density, high light availability and with nutrient addition. Low density and high light availability resulted in significantly higher seed production. Plants in the lowest light treatment allocated significantly more biomass to shoot production and less to root production. Leaf chlorophyll content was lowest for plants in the highest light treatment and increased with nutrient addition at the two highest light treatments. 5. Plants growing at high density responded to nutrient addition and light attenuation in the same direction but with greatly reduced magnitude compared with plants growing at low density. The effect of irradiance was the most important determinant of all facets of growth and allocation patterns in both rosettes and mature plants. 6.

The downy oak Quercus humilis has recently recolonized the Causse du Larzac plateau in southern France. We studied the influence of the shrubs Buxus sempervirens and Juniperus communis on Q. humilis establishment, and of Buxus on the growth of established Q. humilis individuals. 2. Percentage germination of experimentally planted Q. humilis was higher under shrubs than in nearby open areas and higher on the north than the south side of the canopy. Germination where part of the canopy has been removed was similar to that away from the shrubs, suggesting that the facilitation mechanism is related to changes in microclimate rather than to a soil effect. 3. When exposed to sheep for 1 month, 100% of 326 unprotected oak seedlings were grazed, causing 44% mortality. The presence of Buxus and Juniperus improved seedling survival by protecting them against sheep grazing and summer drought. Predation by rodents was however greater under shrub cover. 4. The highest leaf dry mass of oak seedlings was recorded under Juniperus where light conditions seem more favourable for growth than under Buxus (direct effect) or in grassland (indirect effect). The growth of naturally established individuals of Q. humilis (in terms of total leaf mass per annual branch and width of rings) was lower under Buxus than in grassland but the values became similar once the canopy was overtopped. 5. The balance between positive and negative interactions varied in relation to the life stage of Q. humilis and the two shrub species. Regeneration of Q. humilis in open grassland was prevented by grazing. The protection offered by shrubs continues to offset the negative interference on growth, particularly under Buxus, so that plants could survive to overtop the shrub canopy and reach maturity.

The replacement series has been used widely to assess interference, niche differentiation, resource utilization, and productivity in simple mixtures of species. Correctly used, the approach can lead to some valid interpretations. In order to avoid criticisms, however, researchers should appreciate the assumptions and limitations of this methodology. 2. A replacement series contains confounded species density treatments. Replacement series experiments therefore provide collective results and cannot distinguish separate contributions to interference by the constituents of a mixture. 3. In a replacement diagram, trends in observed yields per species can be due to a multitude of possible levels of intra- and interspecific interference. Similarly, trends in expected yields per species do not represent specific levels of intra- and interspecific interference. A replacement series is therefore unsuitable for the quantitative evaluation of interference or niche differentiation. 4. A standard replacement series, but not a proportional replacement series, may be used to detect an imbalance between intra- and interspecific interference for a component of a mixture. If competition for resources is assumed or known to be the sole cause of interference, then such experiments yield a qualitative evaluation of complementary resource utilization by the mixture components. 5. The possibility of total density dependence impedes generalization from a replacement series result. Other biases, due to initial size and time of observation, may occur with replacement series and related experimental structures. 6. Results from a replacement series are of questionable value in predicting the long-term outcome of an association between species. 7. Replacement series are a valid setting, but not the only possible setting, for some kinds of yield comparisons. These include comparing productivity of monocultures with that of simple species mixtures. 8.

In species-rich mixed dipterocarp rain forest in Indonesian Borneo, we evaluated evidence for tree species associations with physical habitat variables (physiography for adults and seedlings, and light for seedlings). A total of 325 species were included in the analysis. 2. A stratified random sample of 28 tree and seedling plots (0.16 ha and 36 m2, respectively) was taken from a 150-ha study area on homogeneous parent rock (granite) between 110 and 270 m a.s.l. 3. In a principal component analysis (PCA), based on an abundance index of all tree species, plots segregated into three groups. These corresponded closely with the three physiographically defined habitat types assigned in the field: (i) plateaux with a deep humus layer, (ii) sharp ridges and upper slopes, and (iii) gullies and lower slopes near permanent streams. Segregation of plots by habitat was weaker when seedling (rather than tree) species abundance was used in the PCA. 4. In single species analyses, using Monte Carlo randomization tests, we found significant associations with the three physiographic habitat types in 17 out of 49 abundant species for trees, and in 5 out of 22 abundant species for seedlings. In PCA and single species analyses, weaker associations with habitat for seedlings than for trees suggest higher mortality of seedlings in 'suboptimal' habitats. 5.

Combining light and physiographic habitat associations, 20 out of the 45 abundant species were associated with at least one habitat factor as either adults or seedlings. 7. Thus, the distributions and abundances of many species are influenced by local heterogeneity in physical habitat variables.

Decomposability correlated strongly and inversely with initial lignin concentrations. 6. Proportional nutrient release from in situ litter was slower than mass loss, but nitrogen and phosphorus mineralization generally increased with increasing precipitation. 7.

We sampled moist tussock, snowbed and watertrack communities in three sites that differed in substrate age (11 000-4.5 million years since deglaciation) for a variety of environmental and vegetation data over one growing season. 2. Productivity, biomass and heterogeneity were not consistently correlated with species density. However, variation in canopy height was correlated with species density and richness in a unimodal fashion, suggesting that heterogeneity of the light regime may be important for maintaining higher species numbers. 3. The 11 000-year-old site supported more vascular plant species than the two older sites, primarily due to greater numbers of forb species on the youngest site. 4 Soil pH was significantly positively correlated with species richness (R2 = 0.82) and species density (R2 = 0.61). In general the species found on acidic substrates (pH < 5.5) also occurred on non-acidic substrates (pH > 5.5). 5.

When a species influences conditions at a site to promote recruitment of conspecifics, the community may remain dominated by that species until the next major disturbance.

Intact soil divots were collected from a hemlock stand in central Massachusetts, USA, and placed in shade-houses at either 1.5% or 60% full sun.

Emergence, survival and growth of seedlings arising from the soil seed bank were subsequently monitored. 3. Light availability had a very large influence on seedling regeneration dynamics. Birch (Betula spp.) seedlings were most sensitive of all species to light availability, with low light reducing emergence by 43% and substantially decreasing seedling growth (by 99%) and survival (by 94%). In contrast, light treatments had smaller effects on performance of other species [hemlock and white pine (Pinus strobus)]. Birch survival was also increased by nitrogen addition, but only in low light. Liming had only marginal effects on seedling performance. 4. Differential seedling responses to resource availability led to dominance of final seedling communities by hemlock in low light, unamended soils (i.e., under conditions naturally found in hemlock stands), but by birch in high light, as well as in low light, nitrogen-amended soils. 5.

Transplants were used to measure the impact of grazing, competition and soil fertility over two growing seasons. Three parts of the marsh were selected to represent different successional stages; Triglochin reached local dominance at intermediate biomass of salt-marsh vegetation. At each stage, three competition treatments (full plant competition, root competition only, and no competition) and three grazing treatments (full grazing, no grazing on Triglochin, and no grazing on Triglochin or neighbours) were applied to both seedlings and mature plants. 3. Competition and herbivory reduced biomass and flowering of Triglochin. The impact of grazing was strongest at the stage with the lowest biomass, while both herbivory and competition had a significant impact at the stage with the highest biomass. When plants were protected from direct herbivory, competition operated at all three successional stages. 4. Grazing reduced light competition when vegetation biomass was low or intermediate, but at high biomass there was competition for light even when grazing occurred. Herbivore exclusion increased the effects of plant competition. Except at low biomass, the negative impact of plant competition on Triglochin performance was greater than the positive effect of not being grazed. 5. Grazing played a minor role in seedling survival and establishment which were largely controlled by competitive and facilitative effects. 6.

Although poorly studied and understood, the post-dispersal movements and fates of seeds may affect critically the subsequent structure of plant communities, particularly in desert ecosystems where seeds can be the most abundant or only viable form of many plant species. We investigated the fate of experimental seeds of the desert mustard Lesquerella fendleri by examining seed dispersal and predation, and by quantifying the proportion of seeds that germinated and survived as seedlings in three different microsites within a New Mexico desert shrubland. 2. We found very limited seed dispersal but strong density-dependent seed predation by rodents. There was a significant and consistent microsite effect in the proportion of soil seeds germinating and seedlings surviving to the end of the experiments. We did not find a consistent micro site effect for soil seed persistence, but did find a positive correlation between soft seed persistence and soil seed germination. Overall, these results indicate that seed predation may strongly affect the distribution of the seed bank, and that the abiotic environment may largely determine the extent to which soil seed populations in turn affect the distribution of emerging surface plants. 3.

A 3-year experiment revolving nutrient addition and removal of one of two coexisting dwarf shrub species was conducted in two community types in a subalpine heathland on the northern Apennines (Italy). Vaccinium uliginosum occurred at all sites but was associated with the deciduous Vaccinium myrtillus at more sheltered nutrient-rich sites (HV community), and with the evergreen Empetrum hermaphroditum where the habitat was poorer and more exposed (EV community). Length of current-year shoots and fruit production of each species were determined in each of the 3 years, and standing crop at the beginning and end of the experiment. 2. The length of current-year shoots of both deciduous species, but not of the evergreen, varied considerably between years, presumably due to varying temperatures at the beginning of the three growing seasons. Fruit production also varied. 3. Fertilization promoted an increase in the length of V. uliginosum shoots at the HV community but not at the EV community. The removal of V. uliginosum enhanced shoot elongation in V. myrtillus (HV community) but reduced shoot elongation in E. hermaphroditum (EV community). Neighbour removal did not affect shoot length of V. uliginosum at either community. There were few treatment effects on fruiting of these clonal species. 4. The standing crop in untreated stands did not change during the experimental period. Changes in shoot length resulting from environmental manipulations were not accompanied by consistent variation in the standing crop of any species. Standing crop increased only for V. myrtillus after removing V. uliginosum at the HV community (same direction as shoot length). The standing crop of E. hermaphroditum did not change after removing V. uliginosum at the EV community, although shoot length was significantly reduced. The standing crop of V. uliginosum was unaffected by neighbour removal and was decreased by nutrient addition at both communities. 5. None of the shrubs appeared able to utilize more abundant resources to increase above-ground biomass. However, increased shoot length in nutrient-rich habitats gave V. uliginosum a superior ability to capture light compared with V. myrtillus, the latter being more successful when the coexisting competitively superior species was removed. This would support Grime's theory, indicating that competition becomes more important as soil resource levels increase.

The historical development of mire ecology and terminology is reviewed in relation to evolving concepts and perceptions, and the diverse schools and traditions of vegetation and habitat description and research. 2. Most ecological and floristic variation within north-west European mire vegetation is accounted for by three ecological gradients: the acid base-poor vs. neutral, base- and bicarbonate-rich gradient; the gradient in fertility related to availability of the limiting nutrient elements N and P; and the water level gradient. Effects of salinity and the spring-flush-fen gradients are of more local significance, usually easily recognized. Land use is an important additional factor. 3. The mineral-soil-water limit between ombrotrophic and minerotrophically influenced sites is not sharp, and cannot be related to consistent differences in either vegetation or water chemistry. It should be abandoned as a general main division within mires. 4. The most important natural division is between 'bog', with pH generally < 5 0, low Ca2+, and Cl- and SO42- as the main inorganic anions, typically dominated by sphagna, ericoids and calcifuge Cyperaceae, and 'fen', with pH generally > 6.0, high Ca2+ and HCO3-, vegetation rich in dicotyledonous herbs and 'brown mosses'.

Seed banks are dynamic entities, with input occurring through dispersal and loss occurring through germination and various sources of mortality. Measures of abundance of seeds in the soil at one point in time cannot distinguish those seeds destined to germinate or die in the next growing season from those entering the long-term seed bank, and cannot therefore reveal the proportion of seeds that are carried over from year to year. 2. We studied seed bank dynamics in a 2.5-ha deciduous forest gap by following the fate of a single year's cohort of seeds over 2 years. Seed input for 1 year, subsequent in situ germination and survivorship were measured at 60 locations. We examined how temporal changes in seed bank composition were affected by the presence of the dominant gap colonizing species Rubus allegheniensis. 3. Over the course of 2 years, both mean seed density and its variance declined. The temporal changes in density were not, however, accompanied by detectable changes in diversity. 4. Three species (R. allegheniensis, Phytolacca americana and Paulownia tomentosa) dominated the seed bank. Seed bank accumulation patterns in Rubus and Phytolacca showed contrasting responses to the presence of Rubus, with Phytolacca excluded from seed banks in such patches through reduced input and increased mortality. 5.

Reproductive components prior to seedling emergence were both closely linked and very similar between microsites within a site. Seedling survival and growth differed between microsites, being lowest in open areas. Recruitment patterns cannot therefore be predicted from seedfall. 3. Abundant seed production in 1996 was followed by successful germination and high seedling survival.

Although seed banks may often affect the colonization, succession and structure of surface plant communities, few studies have investigated the demographic relationship between seeds in the soil and above-ground plant populations over space and time. We examined this relationship in the perennial mustard Lesquerella fendleri between 1991 and 1994 within a New Mexico desert ecosystem characterized by open patches of soil (intershrub areas) interspersed with dominant creosote (Larrea tridentata) shrubs (subshrub areas). 2. For the first 2 years of the study, Lesquerella soil seed, surface plant and seed production densities were greater in subshrub vs. intershrub areas. Within the subshrub areas, there were more Lesquerella soil seeds and surface plants in the northern and central microsites, compared with the southern and perimeter microsites, respectively. The mean density of the subshrub seed bank did not increase following large inputs of new seeds (2400 seeds m-2) in the summer of 1992. In contrast, virtually all of the relatively modest Lesquerella intershrub seed production at this time (169 seeds m-2) appeared to survive, so that for the remainder of the study most soil seeds were found in the intershrub sites. This spatial reversal of seed bank densities preceded a similar switch in the relative densities of the Lesquerella sub- and intershrub surface plant populations in the last 2 years of the study. 3. This study supports the hypothesis that desert seed bank patchiness contributes to surface plant patchiness, but does not support the idea that seed banks are comprised primarily of seeds produced during favourable reproductive periods.

The standards for comparison (i.e. no interactions) were species' performance in monocultures at one of two sowing abundances (the combined monocultures method; CM) and in a low-density mixture of equal proportions of all species (the community density series method; CDS). 3. Proportional growth decreased with increasing initial abundance for all species community effects (relative biomass of each species) were generally weaker and more variable than individual effects. R increased linearly with abundance for only one species, while three species showed a quadratic response (of which two were negative). 4. Competitive hierarchies derived by the CM method differed with abundance, and we argue that the CDS method is likely to provide a more reliable comparison. 5. With CDS, competitive hierarchies were similar along the community abundance gradient, implying that non-linear competitive effects are not likely to be a mechanism of coexistence in this community 6. There were significant competitive effects on community composition, but not on diversity as measured by evenness.

The forest type maps showed a transition from mixed deciduous forest to coniferous forest consisting chiefly of Picea and Pinus. The stand-scale studies recorded the same general development despite site-specific trends. A detrended correspondence analysis displayed the successional trends of the stand-scale sites. All stands moved away from the rich deciduous forest represented by Alnus, Corylus, Quercus and Tilia via Betula and Carpinus to Picea and Pinus forest or, in two stands, to Fagus forest. 3. A rate of change analysis covering the last 3000 years showed that the changes recorded from the last 150 years were the most rapid, but represented the culmination of a transformation that was initiated 850 years earlier. These recent changes completely overshadowed the previous record. 4.

There was rapid decomposition in, and plant N capture from, the patches of lowest C:N ratio. Early in the experiment 13C was detected in the soil atmosphere and 15N in the shoots. No 13C enrichment was detected in the plant material. 3. The rate of root production was slowest in the most complex patch (L. perenne shoot material) but accelerated when patches were simpler and had lower C:N ratios.

Patterns in the distribution of seeds of the marine angiosperm Halodule uninervis were described over spatial scales ranging from a few centimetres to meadows separated by more than 120 km along the north-eastern coast of Queensland, Australia. Separate surveys examined how seed bank densities were related to: (i) the distribution of male and female plants (primary dispersal) and (ii) disturbances caused by turbulent water movement and the foraging of large marine vertebrates. 2. The distribution of seeds was extremely heterogeneous at very small scales of sampling (centimetres to tens of centimetres). Variation in seed abundance within individual meadows (87% of total variation in seed densities) was at least an order of magnitude greater than that among separate intertidal populations (13%). Densities of seeds were greatest in micro-topographic depressions where the overlying vegetation had been removed by directional water currents and the feeding activities of dugongs. Smaller disturbances that did not disrupt the cover of vegetation had no effect on seed abundance. Detailed mapping of the distributions of seeds and male and female reproductive shoots showed only a weak relationship between primary seed production and the seed bank, but revealed a pattern of seed distribution that was consistent with accumulation in linear depressions in the meadow. 3. The seed banks of intertidal sediments exhibit many similarities to those of physically dynamic desert sands.

The resident assemblage of sedges was censused along the same three transect lines and along a further 24 km of survey lines in the same forest. 4. The general state of a site was represented by the overall survival of the experimental implants at that site. The general environmental variance between sites provided a measure of environmental heterogeneity. This could be partitioned into a specific variance (mean environmental variance of species) and an environmental covariance.

The species diversity of the resident Carex assemblage was correlated with general environmental quality both among and within transects. 6. The three transects differed in structure.

Juvenile target plants of Chrysothamnus and Sarcobatus were planted into four sites along the gradient. Biomass was determined by destructive harvests over two growing seasons. At each site, interspecific relative competitive ability was assessed as the effect of Sarcobatus neighbours on Chrysothamnus targets compared to the effect of Chrysothamnus neighbours on Sarcobatus targets. Stress tolerance was assessed as the ability of each species to survive and grow, in the absence of neighbours, at different sites along the gradient. 3. The two species did not differ in the relative strength of plant-plant interactions, providing no support for the expectation that Chrysothamnus had greater competitive ability than Sarcobatus. Furthermore, there was no evidence for competition or facilitation, either interspecific or intraspecific, at any site in either year of the study. However, fertilization treatments demonstrated nutrient limitations, soil water reached limiting levels and root systems of targets and neighbours overlapped substantially. It is therefore surprising that plant-plant interactions among juveniles apparently play little role in the growth and survival of shrubs in this saline desert habitat. 4.

Sarcobatus juveniles grew best at the two most saline sites and survived at all sites, whereas Chrysothamnus juveniles grew best at a low-salinity site and did not survive at the most saline site.

Over time, the frequency distribution was bimodal for winter annuals but unimodal for summer annuals, a difference we attribute to the marked difference between the two communities in the temporal consistency of rank abundance of species.

Seeds of the parasite were sown into experimental plots containing 1, 2, 4, 8 or 32 plant species belonging to one or more of three functional groups (grasses, legumes and non-leguminous herbs). 2 We predicted that infection will reduce host biomass, total community biomass and resistance to invasion, particularly in host communities with low diversity, but that the performance of the parasite will be at its lower level in such communities. 3 The presence of the parasite caused an overall reduction in host biomass per plot, which was mainly due to a strong reduction in the biomass of grasses. As predicted, the effect was smaller in communities with greater functional diversity. However, total community biomass (including the parasite biomass) was increased by more than a third in infected communities of one or two host species, while the parasite had no effect on total biomass of species-rich communities. 4 Germination of the parasite was hardly influenced by the diversity of its host community, but early survival decreased with increasing number of functional groups and was lower in plots with legumes than without. However, our hypothesis that the performance of the surviving parasites would benefit from a high functional diversity of hosts was supported. Parasite biomass per individual and per m2 increased with the number of functional groups in the host community, as did reproductive potential. 5 Death of the parasite led to a higher proportion of bare ground in communities when the previously infected communities had low functional diversity, thus enabling subsequent colonization by weeds.",116,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Biodiversity effects | Ecosystem stability | Invasion resistance | Plant functional groups | Rhinanthus alectorolophus,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,77

Our observations, however, suggest that an alternate successional pathway is also likely, whereby gap-phase regeneration is dominated by lianas and stalled in a low-canopy state for many years. We investigated gap-phase regeneration in an old-growth tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) in Panama to test the following two hypotheses: (i) many gaps follow a pathway in which they remain at a low canopy height and are dominated by lianas and (ii) the paucity of trees in this pathway is a function of liana density. 2 We surveyed a total of 428 gaps of varying ages (c. 5, c. 10, and 13+ years old) and identified those which followed the conventional pathway of regeneration and others that remained stalled in a low-canopy state for many years and were dominated by either lianas or palms. Each of these pathways will likely have different successional trajectories that will favour the growth of a distinct suite of mature species and ultimately result in contrasting species composition. 3 The successional pathway of liana-dominated, stalled gaps is common throughout the forest. We estimate conservatively that 7.5% of the gaps that form each year will follow this pathway, probably due to the suppression of tree regeneration by lianas, and that many of these stalled gaps will persist for much longer than 13 years. Consequently, a high proportion of gaps in the forest at any given time will be stalled. Furthermore, liana tangles, which persist in the tropical forest understorey for extended periods of time, almost certainly originate in these gaps. 4 Liana abundance was positively correlated with pioneer tree abundance and diversity while negatively correlated with non-pioneer tree abundance and diversity. Thus, lianas appear to inhibit non-pioneer tree survival while indirectly enhancing that of pioneer trees. 5 Lianas are abundant in many types of tropical and temperate forests and a successional pathway involving liana-dominated, stalled gaps may therefore be frequent and widespread.",317,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Barro Colorado Island | Canopy dynamics | Forest succession | Panama | Species diversity,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,78

We also examined the effects of additional variables (principally elevation) as covariates in our neighbourhood analyses. 3 Both the spatial and initial neighbourhood analyses suggested strong intra- and interspecific density-dependent effects on tree survival. Douglas fir survival was significantly higher in less dense patches of conspecifics and non-random tree death led to regularly spaced survivors, as expected from intraspecific competition. The significantly lower survival of western hemlock in denser patches of Douglas fir and the resulting negative spatial association between surviving trees of these two species were consistent with interspecific competition. 4 Howewer, having controlled for the influence of elevation on tree survival (probably mediated by variation in soil moisture) in neighbourhood analyses, although the survival of the pioneer Douglas fir trees was still subject to strong density-dependent effects, variation in its density in the overstorey no longer appeared to influence the survival of the invading late-successional species. There was, however, evidence for asymmetric interspecific density dependence between the two late-successional species since western hemlock mortality tended to be higher in denser patches of western red cedar. 5 Our results emphasize the importance of considering confounding factors in studies that seek evidence for density dependence.",237,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Competition | Confounding effect | Logistic regression | Neighbourhood analysis | Population dynamics | Ripley's K function | Spatial pattern | Stand mapping,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,79

Each sequence represented a 25-year hayfield succession following cessation of fertilizer application in the Drentse A Nature Reserve (NL), where the vegetation has been studied since 1972. 2 The number of seeds of many late successional species showed a significant increase during succession with only two characteristic late species present in the seed bank of the early stage of each series. Most of the early successional species showed a decrease in the number of seeds, which paralleled their relative frequency within the vegetation. Overall, seed density and species diversity of the seed bank was higher in the wet than the dry chronosequence. 3 Mean values for seed longevity were calculated for each successional phase in each series using a published seed bank data base. When based simply on the presence of species, the seed longevity index decreased significantly during the wet-series succession in both surface and deeper seed banks and in the vegetation. When based on the relative frequency of species present, the index decreased significantly in both series but only in the surface seed bank and the vegetation. 4 Comparison with data for an ancient undisturbed wet hay meadow in England suggests that seed longevity of hayfield species is generally low. Similarity between seed bank and established vegetation was low in both the undisturbed British meadow (only 47%) and in the relatively young Dutch study sites (c. 50%). 5 The soil seed bank is unlikely to determine hayfield succession in the Drentse A Nature Reserve, since the composition of the soil seed bank tended to follow that of the above-ground vegetation.

Treated plants were therefore compelled to invest in defence without gaining any profit from the induction. 4 Treated plants achieved lower biomass than untreated controls, and developed fewer shoots and ears and therefore produced fewer seeds. The effects were most pronounced in plants that suffered from a shortage of nitrogen, and were observed only when pathogen resistance was induced during lateral shoot production. Later treatment revealed no significant effects. 5 We discuss whether the differences between treated and control plants can be interpreted as a consequence of allocation costs.

However, coexistence may be facilitated by prezygotic isolating mechanisms that reduce intercytotype mating and increase assortative mating. 2 We examined the ecological factors regulating intercytotype mating in Chamerion (formerly Epilobium) angustifolium by measuring floral morphology, flowering synchrony and insect foraging preferences in a mixed population within a diploid-tetraploid contact zone. We also calculated the minimum rate of between-cytotype mating from estimates of the frequency of triploid offspring. 3 Diploids had significantly shorter and narrower petals as well as shorter styles than tetraploids. Inflorescences were significantly taller in tetraploids than diploids, but the mean number of open flowers per inflorescence did not differ. Diploid and tetraploid flowering periods overlapped by 51%, with diploid stems flowering earlier. 4 In a plot of 20 diploid and 28 tetraploid stems that were flowering simultaneously, only 26% of all bee flights were between flowers on different stems. Of the total flights between inflorescences, only 15% were between different cytotypes. The combined effects of flowering asynchrony and insect foraging reduced the opportunities for intercytotype mating from 49% expected if mating is random to about 2% of the total number of pollinator flights. 5 A computer simulation indicated that the deficiency of pollinator flights between cytotypes was due largely to the spatial structure of cytotypes and limited pollinator flight distances within the observation plot. The frequency of triploid offspring produced during the period when both cytotypes were in flower was 6.6%, similar to the proportion of flights observed between flowers on different cytotypes (4%). 6 The results indicate that flowering phenology and insect behaviour (as influenced by clonal structure) have a significant effect on prezygotic mating isolation and triploid production, and may contribute to the maintenance of mixed cytotype populations in Chamerion angustifolium.",149,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Fireweed | Phenology | Pollinator behaviour | Polyploidy | Reproductive isolation | Triploids,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,83
