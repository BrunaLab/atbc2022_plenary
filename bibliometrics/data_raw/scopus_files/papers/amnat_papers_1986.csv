Natural selection operates on both the between-year dormancy and on non-seed-bank traits that affect the degree of specialization to conditions pertaining in different year types. An integrated model permits these 2 aspects of the life history to evolve simultaneously, and leads to predictions that are not attainable by considering the evolution of each in isolation. Changes in the survival probability of the between-year seed bank select for reinforcing changes in between-year dormancy and specialization. Changes in the probability of occurrence of different year types select for damping changes in between-year dormancy and specialization. Across a gradient in environmental quality, most change should occur in between-year dormancy, with little change in specialization. If between-year dormancy is fixed, however, a greater change in specialization should occur. The predictions of the model are discussed in terms of environmental gradients, seed bank versus non-seed-bank annuals, and a variety of plant traits modeled elsewhere that may be involved in specialization to different types of years. -Authors",NA,NA

These findings indicate habitat saturation. Reproductive success was highest in large territories and those with many trees. The amount of area covered by tree canopies also affected territory quality, particularly for large groups; groups with little of their territories covered by tree canopies were often unsuccessful. The existence of these large groups in territories where their reproductive success was relatively low may be another indication that the option of dispersing is somewhat restricted. Average reproductive success of individuals in small groups was about the same as it was for pairs, as was the reproductive success of large groups in high-quality territories. Thus, a pair in a high-quality territory could apparently allow one or more of their offspring to remain with them to breed as a group without suffering any reduction in future reproductive success. For newly mature birds, plural breeding seems to be a better option than remaining in the natal unit as nonbreeding helpers, even if the young birds must disperse and face the dispersal risk associated with habitat saturation. -from Authors",NA,NA

Fisher's sex-ratio model is expanded to incorporate the concept of a sex-specific helper payback. The result is an imbalance in the evolutionarily stable strategy sex ratio at the termination of parental care; the magnitude of the imbalance is proportional to the product of P, the fraction of the helper sex that actually acts as helpers, and alpha , the average magnitude of the helper contribution measured relative to that of either parent. This formulation leads to the testable hypothesis that the male-biased adult sex ratio found in most species of cooperatively breeding birds may be a result rather than a cause of the helping behavior. -Authors",NA,NA

Variation in total species density is strongly affected by variation in densities of the dominant species, which can change dramatically from year to year. Analysis of 24 longterm censuses from a wide variety of North American habitats shows that these are not characteristics of breeding bird assemblages in general. A single study, that of a Connecticut swamp that flooded in 2 of the 8 census years, conformed to the pattern set by the shrub-steppe avifauna. This study confirms that environmental perturbation can produce the variability found by Wiens and Rotenberry, but also illustrates the severity of perturbation necessary for the bottleneck model. Thus, the shrub-steppe avifauna may not be a good model for determining the role of competition in avian communities. Fitness-set analysis suggests that the dominant species in the shrub steppe may be limited by resources during winter. Competition during the breeding season is better measured by factors reflecting reproductive success instead of winter survival. The importance of exploitation competition in structuring communities is a function of the frequency with which ecological bottlenecks occur: a gradient of conditions can be described, ranging from severe annual resource limitation and intense competition to irregular catastrophes and little intervening competition. Knowledge of the natural history of the species of interest, especially the timing of resource limitation, is critical to designing proper tests of competition-based community theory. -Author",NA,NA

These observations, together with a recognition of the crudeness of the field techniques and the inadequacy of the study samples for Type II error considerations, indicate that even the strong disparities between resource indicators and bird densities in across-island comparisons do not necessarily negate a positive resource-consumer relationship as postulated in traditional resource-regulation theory.-from Author",NA,NA

Reproduction in two-sex models is a frequency-dependent nonlinear function (the birth or marriage function) of the relative abundance of males and females. The population dynamics resulting from 3 different two-sex, discrete-time, population-projection models are examined. For a large class of birth functions, models without inter-stage mate competition converge to a locally stable adult sex ratio. Formulae for the stable population structure, stable sex ratio, and reproductive value at equilibrium are derived. When individuals of different stages compete for mates, the equilibrium population structure may become unstable. A sequence of bifurcations then occurs, leading to periodic oscillations, quasi-periodic fluctuations, and chaos as the intensity of competition increases. When per capita fecundity is a sigmoid function of the relative abundance of the other sex, perturbations of the sex ratio may lead to extinction. -from Authors",NA,NA

In S. vesicaria, the number of fruits per flower was the only yield component consistently reduced below the control. In S. macrocarpa, responses to mild stress were reductions in the number of seeds per ovule and in seed weight, components of yield probably determined later than the number of fruits per flower. Severe stresses resulted in a change in flower number. Both the pattern and the amount of plasticity in yield components differed significantly between species. Differences in responses to the same stresses may represent different adaptations resulting from variation in the importance of each component of yield for the successful reproduction of the 2 species in slightly different habitats. Within species, half-sib families differed in the amount, but not in the kind, of plastic response. Each species appears to be genetically invariant for plastic response in the same yield component, fruit survivorship, even though the overall pattern of plastic response differed between the species. Perhaps developmentally early yield components are genetically fixed to be either variable or stable, and responses in developmentally later yield components are determined by the levels of change in the earlier yield components.-Authors",NA,NA

Beyond the eusociality threshold lies the continued evolution and elaboration of social systems. Two particularly important thresholds of advanced colony organization are marked by morphological commitment to caste: 1) a commitment to queen-worker dimorphism, and 2) a commitment to morphological diversity within the worker form. Queen-worker dimorphism is a defining character of highly eusocial caste systems. If morphological differences exist between queens and workers, the pattern of queen and worker development must diverge no later than the larval stage. Larvae must be able to translate their own developmental, especially nutritional, history into a development decision. The linking and coordinate expression of gyne characters are advantageous when intermediates are less fit than full queens or full workers. Once such a developmental system evolves, individuals become extremely vulnerable to control by other colony members that have an interest in their developmental fate. In highly eusocial Hymenoptera, queens use 2 principal mechanisms to control offspring development: direct control of nutrition (eg honeybees Apis) and interference with larval response to nutrition (eg Bombus terrestris, many ants). A 2nd major threshold in the evolution of morphologically complex caste systems is the addition of multiple physical worker castes. -from Author",NA,NA
