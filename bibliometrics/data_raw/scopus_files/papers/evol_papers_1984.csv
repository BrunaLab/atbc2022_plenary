This variety of C. humilis is visited by a diversity of insects but most commonly by a species in the family Empididae and several species of beeflies.

The 2 flower types also produce different odors, and their corollas may differ in patterns of UV reflectance. The changes in corolla color and/or the changes in other floral characteristics apparently serve as signals to discourage pollinators. Hand pollination experiments revealed that the flowers are self-incompatible and that the viability of the pollen and the receptivity of the stigma are substantially less in flowers with totally white corollas.

Thus Recent birds cannot provide us with sufficient clues to reconstruct the composition of early to mid-Tertiary S American faunas. Relatively few late Pleistocene genera and species have become extinct, so that reconstruction of Pleistocene faunas based on Recent taxa can probably represent a statistically accurate picture of the recent past. Reconstruction of faunal histories can be substantially improved, however, by consultation of the fossil record of the Pliocene and Pleistocene. Rates of faunal turnover, expressed as the average of estimates of origination rates (based on first appearances in the fossil record) and extinction rates (last appearances) of S American genera per million years, increased from the Miocene to the late Pleistocene.

Based on these findings, it is concluded that size and shape do not diversify in the same manner. These 2 processes should be considered as fundamentally different evolutionary events. It is the interaction of the evolution of size and shape that produces the shape-conservative groups that can vary greatly in size. The evidence for shape groups within families does not mean that the genus can now be precisely quantified as a certain amount of shape defined by intraspecific variation. Rather, the constraints on shape may vary from strong to weak, producing different levels of variation in shape that make the actual formation of genera difficult. Analysis predicts certain properties of the genus. 1) Decoupled (or adaptive zone) groups will exist that differ internally in size along an allometric growth curve; these groups may have been identified as genera by systematists. These groups will be shape conservative, but they will not always be monophyletic. 2) There do not have to be gaps between decoupled groups because gaps are a function of the magnitude of the decoupled jumps (or the nature of the adaptive zones).

For example, populations of G. difficilis are similar in diet to G. fuliginosa on islands where this species is absent.

A complete explanation thus requires conditions 1) for the evolution of delayed breeding, 2) for curtailment of cheating among helpers, and 3) for the evolutionary stability of queuing behavior. Delayed breeding can evolve when the eventual reproductive adantages compensate quantitatively for the delay in the onset of reproduction. For a population of stripe-backed wrens Campylorhynchus nuchalis in Venezuela, this condition for the evolution of helping is satisfied for males of all ages and for females to age 4. When helpers contribute to the increased fecundity of breeding members of groups, queuing for succession to breeding status in a group amounts to a special case of delayed reciprocity. The young that an individual helps to raise become the individual's helpers when it succeeds to breeding status in the group. Cheating by failing to help cannot spread, provided 1) demographic conditions favoring delayed reproduction and queuing for breeding remain the same for successive cohorts and 2) individuals queue for breeding positions. The evolution of this form of delayed reciprocity requires that queuing behavior satisfy the conditions for an evolutionarily stable strategy.
