Gorillas are the only important dispersers of this species: other primates consume the succulent mesocarp, but do not swallow the large seed; elephants do not eat Cola fruits. Observations of Cola seeds in gorilla faeces showed a very high germination rate and, despite initial high mortality, 18% of seedlings still survived six months after deposition. Survival of seedlings was significantly better in faeces left at nest-sites than in other areas of the forest: 40% of seedlings were viable at nest-sites six months after deposition.

Habitats surveyed were unlogged forest, selectively logged forest, ‘capoeira’ (scrub regenerating on cleared land), cropficlds, and an isolated 35 ha forest ‘island’. All habitats were within a few kilometres of each other. Many bird species were found to occur in all or most habitats, although the similarlity of the species assemblages dropped with increasing levels of disturbance of the natural vegetation. Certain understorcy insectivorcs common in unlogged forest were rarely observed in other habitats; disturbed areas contained higher numbers of flycatching insectivorcs or birds feeding on both insects and fruit, some of which were open-country rather than forest species. The avifauna of the forest ‘island’ was more similar to that of regenerating scrub than to that of tall forest, and the persistence of forest species was attributed to their ability to move to and from nearby continuous forest areas.

In primary forest, saplings and trees of these genera arc uncommon and have low growth rates. For the six years following disturbance by logging, a Macaranga population was characterized by high rates of diameter growth and recruitment. Eleven years after disturbance, seedling and sapling abundance had declined sharply. In contrast, the Mallotus population was stable in size class distribution and increased slightly in total population size during the 11 years after logging. Growth rates of Mallotus trees increased after logging but were still much less than Macaranga trees. A morphological comparison shows that most Macaranga species, in contrast with Mallotus species, have large hollow twigs that are occupied by ants and have larger, hairier, thicker, more toothed leaves with longer petioles, axillary inflorescences with more flowers, infructescences with more fruit, fruits that are smaller in size and smaller seeds. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.

Howlers consumed the fruits of 35 species of plants. The seeds of 28 of these were dispersed by the monkeys. The majority (≥90%) of the seeds dispersed by monkeys were destroyed by rodents. Rapid relocation and burial of dung by dung beetles resulted in accidental relocation and burial of large numbers of seeds shortly after deposition. Faecal clumps (20 mg) remained on the ground for an average of only 2.5 h (range 1–3 h). Ball rolling beetles transported balls up to 5.0m from the site of deposition (range 1–5 m). Burrowing and ball-rolling dung beetles buried seeds at depths ranging from 2.5 to > 12.0cm. The deeper a seed is buried, the less likely it is to be found and eaten by rodents. Eighty percent of the species used by Alouatta as sources of fruit at Los Tuxtlas benefited by the dispersal and post dispersal service provided by howlers and dung beetles respectively. Seasonality in dung beetles abundance in the forest may influence the number of seeds per species escaping post-dispersal predation during the year. Dung beetles play not only an important ecological role in the recycling of matter and energy in the ecosystem, but also in the process of rain forest regeneration.

Total abundance and diversity within the plot data are strongly seasonal and peak in the late wet season. Both are positively correlated with litter volume and moisture. Most of this variation is due to seasonality of reproduction, as indicated by patterns of occurrence of juveniles of the most abundant species. These results indicate that the plot sampling method does not sample the entire fauna adequately. Since this technique has been used to study other tropical forest litter herpetofaunas, however, comparison with other studies may be useful.

Rats were found on 29 of these islands. Rat abundance was not correlated with island size or isolation, in contrast to temperate rodents, and may be due to the highly patchy nature of tropical forests and the differing floristic compositions of the study islands. Rat occurrence on islands was related positively to island size and negatively to island isolation. All islands greater than 2.1 ha contained spiny rats, whereas most islands less than 0.9 ha did not contain rats. The relationship between occurrence, size, and isolation are illustrated by a three-dimensional response surface. Results suggest that colonization and extinction regularly occur on these islands and that (1) larger islands with year-round fruit production, regardless of isolation, will have persistent populations of rats, (2) small isolated islands will never or only very rarely have rats owing to a lack of a year-round food source and the difficulty of immigration, and (3) small near islands frequently will have rats when fruits are present. No other species of mouse- or rat-like rodents were captured on the islands.

We hypothesized that, in a soil with little moisture retention capacity, irregular rainfall patterns would result in large fluctuations of water supply and, in the early wet season, drought episodes could cause seedling death. This hypothesis was tested in a seasonal tropical forest in Mexico where seedling density is low and the soil consists of almost pure sand with a low water retention capacity. Various patterns of simulated rainfall were applied in the forest to seeds and seedlings of three common tree species. Overall very little difference in germination and seedling survival was observed between the various rainfall treatments. The results showed that rainfall patterns and the soil texture may interact in a much more complex way than was initially hypothesized, and that water availability to seeds and seedlings is not necessarily predictable. The absence of seedlings of the three tree species might be better explained by high seed predation and low light level in the understorey. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.

Oviposition started within 12 days after peak anthesis, and continued within any one tree for 11–39 days. Host trees of N. shoreae flowered over a 75 day period. Intraspecific flowering synchrony was high but different species flowered sequentially. The behaviour of N. shoreae and the period of the oviposition ‘window’ strongly suggest that this pre-dispersal fruit-predator ‘tracks’ the sequence of flowering shown by its host species.

The frugivorous phyllostomid bat Carollia perspicillata is closely associated with specific fruits which are found and picked in flight, then eaten at a feeding roost. Each fruit eaten corresponds to a single flight. An apparatus designed for this study permits the simultaneous tracking of 10 bats equipped with double rhythm transmitters (slow rate corresponding to resting position and rapid rate to flying bouts). (1) The number of flights, (2) the percentage time spent flying and (3) the range of activity were recorded for different categories of animals during two periods of fruit production. Heavier males displayed high activity, while other males, non-breeding females and females in early pregnancy displayed a similar pattern of flying behaviour. Full-term pregnant females and lactating females performed almost as many flying bouts as non-reproductive females, but these flights were much shorter. This unexpected feeding strategy can be interpreted as a means of shifting energy to reproductive effort from exploratory behaviour (non-breeding females performed longer flights which combine the survey of environment and the fruit collection). This strategy, based upon the optimization of flying bouts, is in contrast to those of non-flying mammals and probably is only compatible with periods of high food production. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.

These species showed similar growth rates in a range of microhabitats. Gap dynamics were simulated by transferring plants between three environments: beneath a closed canopy, a small gap, and a large gap. Plants of all three species were able to adjust their morphology and growth rates in response to changes in light availability. Growth rates increased when plants were moved to a (larger) gap, and decreased when plants were moved to a more shaded environment. Shade-grown plants were able to acclimate faster to increasing light availability than sun-grown plants to decreasing light availability. Also, plants moved from shady to sunny conditions showed higher relative growth rates than sun control plants, whereas sun-grown plants when moved to the shade showed lower relative growth rates than shade control plants. Species differed in their response to gap dynamics. Omphalea could not acclimate morphologically to shading, but reacted faster than the other species in response to the occurrence of a large gap. Acclimation potential seemed to be related to plasticity in physiological rather than in morphological traits.

A comparative analysis of earth worm populations in seral Khasi pine forest represented by Pinus kesiya 5- and 35-year old stands, and a climax broad-leaved mixed forest represented by a sacred grove was done at altitudes of 1500m in Meghalaya in north-east India. Tonoscolax horaii occurred under all forest types whereas Amynthas diffringens and Eutyphoeus festivus were confined to pine forest stands only. Perionyx sp. and Drawida assamensis were restricted to the sacred grove. T. horaii had larger numbers in all three different forest types. This species offers possibilities of vermiculturc for biologically improving soil fertility in manmade ecosystems because of its wide range of tolerance. Generally earthworm populations were more active during the monsoon season; A. diffringens was however, more active during the winter, thereby conferring an advantage on this species as it was enabled to avoid competition during the monsoon season when other species dominate. Earthworm activity was generally higher in the sacred grove than in the pine forest stands. Population size was significantly correlated with soil moisture, temperature and pH. Wormcasts had a higher pH and nutrient status than the soil. In the highly leached soils of the humid tropics where there is a large concentration of fine root biomass in the surface soil layers, earthworm activity is beneficial because it helps incorporate detritus into the mineral soil rapidly and locally concentrates nutrients in the surface layers. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.

Both are facultative zooplanktivores in the reservoir, feeding mostly on planktonic crustaceans, insects (chiefly chironomids), some higher plant material, detritus and even fish scales (A. bimaculatus).

Despite the availability of other seed types (legume seeds in particular were abundant), all five seed-harvesting species studied are specialists in that they store only grass seeds. Depot experiments, in which seeds were placed along foraging trails, also indicate a preference for grass seeds over legume seeds. At least for some ant species the handling efficiency of legume seeds may be less than that of grass seeds. Marked differences in seed composition of granaries were observed among different seed-harvesting ant species and among colonies of the same species at different sites. All ant species studied, except Pheidole sp. 1, stored only one type of grass seed in granaries at any site despite the availability of other seed types. This contrasts with studies conducted elsewhere in Australia in which generalist foraging by seed-harvesters was found to be common. With the possible exception of Pheidole, dietary specialization does not appear to arise from a low diversity or abundance of seed supplies. In addition to differences in seed preferences, species of seed-harvesting ants also exhibited some differences in temporal foraging behaviour and some partitioning of resources may be occurring among these co-occurring species. Temporal overlap in foraging, however, was much greater than dietary overlap. The viability of granary seeds was very low for three ant species suggesting that seeds stored by these ants were largely predated rather than dispersed. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.

Minor year-to-yeFar variation in litterfall was attributed to incidence of severe storms, and drought. Lianes were responsible for about 17% of leaf litterfall in spring, 21% in the summerpeak, and 40% in autumn, more lianes than trees being deciduous. Leaf litter production by 23 individual species of liane, in relation to their basal area within the main site, was, on average, 15 times as great as that by 34 tree species, but declined more steeply between the species-groups of early and later succession. Tendrillar lianes, unlike twiners and scramblers, were confined to the ‘early’ successional group, and their foliage was spread across canopy surfaces, maximizing light interception. It was concluded that this contributed to greater production of leaf litter, per unit basal area, by tendrillar than by other climbers, and to the successional decline in leaf litterfall from lianes. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.

Fauna were most abundant in forest floor soil and associated litter. However, media suspended in the canopy and particularly those trapped in bromeliad shoots were most densely populated, while the diversities of the arboreal and terrestrial soil fauna were indistinguishable. Rates of leaf litter decomposition in the arboreal and terrestrial soils were similar, but the arboreal soils contained higher concentrations of mineral nutrients and carbon. Implications of these findings for the definition of soil in humid tropical forests, and related differences between temperate and tropical forests are discussed. The similarities in diversity and differences in species composition between arboreal and terrestrial soil fauna raise questions concerning the evolution of tropical soil fauna, as well as the estimate of global biotic diversity. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.

Grazing insects (mainly lepidopteran larvae) consumed, on average, 10.3% of the leaf area on K. candel, with >90% of the leaves suffering <30% loss. Natural median leaf longevity was significantly different between winter and summer-exposed leaves, being, respectively, 423.2 and 269.6 days. Observations showed that herbivore damage caused a reduction of leaf longevity, as severely damaged leaves were abscissed before intact, older leaves on the same branch. Experimental leaf area removal suggested that leaf life span reduction was significantly influenced by leaf age and degree of damage. However, the reduction was only significant (>40 days) when area loss was >40%. Leaves produced in summer were also more sensitive to damage than those produced in winter. As <5% of the leaves suffered >40% of area removal by insect grazing in nature, insect herbivory is considered an unimportant regulator of leaf litter dynamics for K. candel. At this intensity level, herbivory consumes 2.8-3.5% of the net above-ground primary production of the mangrove. There was also no significant difference in the final number of leaves and twigs produced by the branches with various degrees of leaf area removal. Other observed impacts of insects on the structure and function of the K. candel mangal arc discussed. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.

Both rates were similar to those found in studies of other forests with a marked seasonal rainfall pattern. However, rates were much lower than those of tropical forests where there is little seasonality in rainfall, A major finding was that the highest rates were during the transition between dry and wet seasons, implying that wetting and drying may be an important initiator of soil nitrogen flux. Felling had little effect on either process up to a gap size of 2500 m2. In the forest-savanna study, nitrogen mineralization was lower in the savanna in all seasons, but in the wet season when the savanna soils were water-logged NH4+-N was immobilized. Experimental additions of nutrients identified two important results; first that added NH4+-N was quickly immobilized rather than nitrified this may be an important nutrient conservation mechanism, and second that soil calcium appeared to be a limiting factor, either directly or through a pH effect. © 1991, Cambridge University Press.
