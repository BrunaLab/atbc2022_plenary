The heads of isolated spermatozoa were of homogeneously high electron density, and had a slightly curved end; in longitudinal sections these zones were composed of a compact homogeneous DNA, covered by a nuclear envelop, cell membrane and small amounts of acrosomal material. The middle piece contained the modified centrioles in the junction zone and flagella microtubules. In transverse sections as well as in replicas, this region consisted of 10 pairs of microtubules and 9 dense fibers surrounded circularly by the mitochondria (mitochondrial sheath)."

Forty-five minutes after injection, the maximum fall in arterial pressure (-23.5% relative to preinjection values) was seen and recovery was not complete by the end of the 180 min observation period. The extract was also given to pre-hypertensive SHR and normotensive rats. The fall in blood pressure was more conspicuous in the two SHr groups and was not accompanied by changes in cardiac frequency in any group. This would appear to rule out either a direct or indirect involvement of the heart in regard to the observed hypotension."

Almost all the broad spectrum anthelmintics influenced males, females and free-living stages at different levels and showed good activity with EC50 values varying from about 0.0002 and 0.0007 mg/l for pyrantel pamoate and tricofenol piperazine respectively to about 8.47 and 7.6 mg/l for morantel tartrate and amoscanate respectively. Certain drugs (emetine, praziquantel and suramin) exerted their effect either on male or female or free-living stages at 10.0 mg/l level. It is concluded that either sex or life-cycle stage alone may not be an effective criteria for screening of anthelmintics which have been employed at large; and females of nematodes (in particular those of N. americanus) should be taken into account for proposing EC50 as they were found to require relatively highest EC50 level in almost all the instances studied presently."

Neutralizing ability of antivenom was expressed as ED50 (effective dose 50%), defined as the antivenom/venom ratio at which the activity of the venom is reduced 50%. Antivenom is highly effective in the neutralization of lethal, hemorrhagic, hemolytic, hyaluronidase, and caseinolytic activities of B. asper, B. nummifer, and C. d. durissus venoms. In the case of B. nummifer venom, neutralization of fibrinolytic effect was only partial, whereas this activity was adequately neutralized when studying the venoms of B. asper and C. d. durissus. The venom of A. bilineatus was adequately neutralized by the antivenom, with the only exception of hemolytic effect that was reduced only partially. However, in quantitative terms, a relatively large volume of antivenom was required to neutralize some effects induced by A. bilineatus venom. Regarding edema-forming activity, antivenom neutralized efficiently the venoms of B. asper and A. bilineatus, whereas that of B. nummifer was neutralized only partially; on the other hand, edema induced by the venom of C. d. durissus was not neutralized at all. Immunochemical results indicate a close immunological relationship between venoms of B. asper, B. nummifer and C. d. durissus collected in Honduras and Guatemala with those of the same species collected in Costa Rica. Interspecies comparison, however, showed variation between venoms obtained from different species.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

It is concluded that the chronic treatment with diazepam did not produce any visible ultrastructural effects in the secretory cells of the adeno hypophysis; maybe because the diazepam has a short life time and due to the small effect of the diazepam metabolites in this species."
