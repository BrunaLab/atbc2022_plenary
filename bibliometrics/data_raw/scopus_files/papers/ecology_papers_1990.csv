Beginning in autumn, however, larval densities decline because of wet-season storms and high discharge. The authors found a strong relationship between spring (post wet season) density of late-instar H. borealis and various hydrologic parameters of the preceding wet season. Of eight hydrologic parameters used as indices of disturbance, total wet-season rainfall and peak discharge together accounted for 42% of the variation in H. borealis density. In most years, storms and associated disturbance reduce late-instar H. borealis density below levels of larval competition; this counteracts earlier competition among middle instars that occurs during low-flow conditions. In drought years, however, densities may not be reduced as severely by wet-season storms and competition may continue until emergence. In this case, competition can reduce individual fitness, but because of high adult densities during these mild-disturbance conditions the reproductive capacity of the population is unaffected. -from Authors",90,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA,NA

Since 1906 the frequency of fire has decreased dramatically. The fire regime appears to be controlled by abiotic conditions. The high-frequency fires of variable intensity primarily affect xeric habitats. The less frequent, intense (possibly crown) fires that affect the entire island may depend on stand development from a less susceptible pine and hardwood forest towards a more typical spruce-fir boreal forest in more mesic habitats.

Overall rates of lizard activities (movements, feeding, and social displays) were similar between morning and evening activity, but at 37°, rates of metabolism and water loss were greater and sprint speed was lower relative to these rates at 33°, suggesting that substantial resource and performance costs may have been imposed by the observed higher evening activity Tb. The author compared the morning and evening distributions of available operative environmental temperatures (Te). In the morning, lizards had access to a wide range of Te (30°-60°); a large fraction of the Te distribution was <36° at the time of peak morning activity. During the morning, a hypothetical increase in Tb to within the interval 36°-38° would have allowed lizards to occupy <10% more of the available thermal microclimates. But in the evening, most of the available microclimates were in the interval 36°-38° (>90% depending on the exact time), and microclimates below 36° were unavailable until just before dark. The available Te distributions in the evening forced lizards to accept a higher activity Tb, and concomitantly higher metabolic and water loss rates, and lower locomotor performance, ore remain inactive in crevices and caves. Thus in the evening, and not in the morning, the gain in usable home range due to accepting a higher Tb was great, and the lizards exploited this fraction at an increased Tb only in the evening. -from Author",103,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,11,NA,NA

Fragment survival and reattachment was temporally variable in survivorship experiments; 1-yr survivorship of 6-branch fragments ranged from 0.0-0.23. Fragments with 6 branches tended to have higher 1-yr survival rates than either 1- or 18-branch fragments.

Large (>20 cm tall) colonies had yearly survivorship of 0.95 over a 4-yr period. Growth rates were extremely variable among colonies, and many colonies suffered partial mortality and decreased in size between years. Partial mortality was most likely caused by grazing. A simple model of colony growth indicates that, due to their initial size, fragment-formed colonies have up to a 25-fold greater chance of reaching reproductive size than do larval recruits. The advantage of large fragment-formed colonies can be attributed to the higher mortality experienced by small colonies and the high probability of negative growth, which keeps small colonies in the high-mortality region of the life table.

The data for such a response curve typically are gathered by sequential sampling of the same plant or animal; analysis should explicitly allow for this repeated-measures design. The authors address statistical treatment of response curves and illustrate the correct alternatives that are available. Four different statistical methods for analyzing response curves are considered: analysis of variance with repeated measures (ANOVAR), multivariate analysis of variance with repeated measures (MANOVAR), a nonparametric split-plot analysis (NP split-plot) and parametric comparison of models fitted to the data by nonlinear regression. Analyses of the CO2 dependence of photosynthesis in the C4 grass Echinochloa crus-galli following chilling are used as examples of these different methods. ANOVAR, potentially the most powerful analysis, makes stringent assumptions about the variance-covariance structure of the data. Within limits these assumptions can be relaxed and a corrected significance level used. When the variance-covariance structure badly violates the ANOVAR assumptions, MANOVAR or NP split-plot are viable alternatives. Use of MANOVAR frequently is limited by small sample sizes and the tendency for the number of levels of the treatment factor to exceed the sample size. The NP split-plot is based on simple assumptions and could be widely used. Comparison of curves fitted by nonlinear regression is also distribution free and provides an interesting alternative when responses are amenable to fitting. -from Authors",558,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,23,NA,NA

Early samples correctly predicted higher order interactions would be seen on tadpole growth, but failed to predict their direction because the biological interactions changed over time.

This requires that young arrive at wintering sites earlier than adults and that residents of all classes arrive earlier than their transient counterparts. These predictions were tested by comparing first-capture dates of juncos at Bloomington, Indiana, which is north of the latitudinal midline of the junco's winter range. Residents were not caught earlier than transients, however, and adults were caught earlier than young among transients and probably also among residents. The fact that some sex-age classes tend to winter south of others predicts that at a northern capture site the classes that migrate farthest should be commoner among transients than among residents.

Seedling mortality of most species was much lower than previously found for alpine ecosystems, rarely exceeding 50% even after 2 yr. On the borrow area mulch increased survival, probably through microenvironmental amelioration. The nutrient pulse from fertilization increased mortality of several species, presumably by creating uplant nutrient demands in excess of availability during year 2.

Hence 2 common assumptions, that nitrifying bacterial are poor competitors for NH4+ and that microbial immobilization of NO3- is insignificant, are not correct for this grassland system. Soil heterogeneity probably results in NH4+ availability to NH4+ oxidizers at some microsites, while NO3- assimilation by heterotrophic microorganisms occurs at other microsites where NH4+ is not available. Relatively high rates of NO3- production and consumption in an ecosystem with an annual mean hydrologic loss of NO3--N of only 3.3 kg/ha indicate the importance of NO3- in the internal N cycle of this ecosystem.

A simple diffusion model demonstrates the dependence of NH4+ availability on soil moisture. Population decline during the dry season may result from both desiccation stress and a lack of substrate availability for maintenance energy of the population.

As a result, the presence of isopods significantly increased survival of salamanders when fish were also present. -from Authors",84,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,64,NA,NA

In figs, flowering is synchronous within a tree and the specialist pollinators/seed predators can only survive briefly away from trees. Consequently, population-level flowering asynchrony must extend year-round for pollinators to persist locally. In repeated stochastic simulations using phenological traits of Ficus natalensis, a median of 95 trees was required to produce an asynchronous sequence that could maintain local pollinator populations for 4 yr. However, many trees in those simulated populations were either male-sterile (10%) or both male- and female-sterile (35%), because their sexual phases were not well timed with the opposite phases of other trees. Sterility within a population approached zero at 2-3 times the critical population size. Both the predicted critical population size and frequency of success of the trees within it depended strongly on the duration of reproductive episodes and the intervals between episodes. Doubling the length of time over which individuals could donate pollen resulted in a 39% decrease in critical population size and a 27% increased likelihood that individuals would achieve at least some reproductive success. -from Authors",100,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,65,all,All Open Access

During fall senescence, plants in stands thinned to the lowest density (2 plants/m2) showed a significantly greater decline in volume than those in denser stands (58 and 102 plants/m2). During periods of high growth, lower density plants showed significantly greater gains in volume and were the only plants that became reproductively mature. In winter when volume was lowest, the proportion of individuals in the smallest size classes decreased as treatment density increased; the summer when volume was greatest, the predominance of small individuals increased as treatment density increased. New recruits of Pterygophora as well as other macroalgae were observed only in lower density stands. Lower density plants also had higher levels of epiphytes. The distributions of the white sea urchin Lytechinus anemesus and 2 sea hares (Aplysia californica, A. vaccaria), the most conspicuous grazers during this study, were correlated with Pterygophora density. Lytechinus were significantly more abundant in low-density plots, while Aplysia spp. were common only in high-density plots. Both grazers appeared to remove substantial amounts of biomass, and there was no obvious effect of stand density on the amount of plant tissue lost as a consequence of grazing. If density can strongly influence patterns of growth and reproduction in this alga, a likely mechanism is competition for light at high density. The relative importance of light competition at higher densities, however, probably varies with other factors such as nutrient dynamics, abrasion, and grazing. The degree to which dominance and suppression are expressed in high density stands of marine algae most likely varies with species architecture and depth. -from Author",87,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,66,NA,NA

Females produced larger fruit as well as more fruit. Females allocated 4.7 times as much biomass as males on fruit production.

The morphs also differed in the timing of their growth, each morph growing less during the phase in which its reproductive costs were highest. Despite the greater allocation by females to reproduction, the morphs grew the same amount over the entire reproductive cycle. This may be a result of the fact that females produced more leaves earlier in the season, which enabled them to accumulate more resources than males. Defoliated shoots on females fruited, but did not grow relative to controls, and defoliated shoots on males grew, but did not fruit.

These ratios were not correlated with moisture or nutrient conditions of the sites and for more mesic sites, ratios did not appear to be affected by age of stands. The more xeric sites showed greater male bias in sex ratios with age of stand. Within the xeric sites, the sex ratio of regularly flowering trees was more male biased than the ratio of trees at 1st reproduction. Although data appear to support resource allocation theory predicting more male-biased ratios in older or poorer habitats, the male-biased sex ratios did not result from measurable differences in sex expression of trees originating from sprouts vs. seeds, sex-related differences in size at first reproduction, or sex-related differential mortality, or because of patterns of sex lability. Differences in sex ratio were of minor importance in reproductive success of individuals in the xeric plots given the lack of reproduction from seed. Reproduction from seed was higher in mesic areas, but sex-related differences in life history characteristics were not evident. The similarity of ratios in a diversity of habitats and through time suggests that the ratios may reflect the underlying genetic patterns of sex expression, rather than subsequent responses to the environment. -from Author",26,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,108,NA,NA

Urine deposition in May had little effect on aboveground production of S. scoparium except during July when S. scoparium was most active. Urine deposition date and plant phenology appear important in determining changes in species composition. Following urine deposition, aboveground N concentrations of P. pratensis and S. scoparium were higher on patches relative to conspecifics off patches, an increase greater in P. pratensis. The large increase in P. pratensis biomass following urine deposition is probably related to its relatively large response to increased soil N availability and its rhizomatous habit. Root N concentrations were higher on urine patches. Poa pratensis on urine patches initiated growth earlier in the season and postponed senescence relative to plants off patches. Aboveground production following clipping was greater on urine patches and N concentrations in regrowth of both species were higher than concentrations in plants not previously clipped.

Optimal foraging theory is used to suggest how each of these components of the predation process might depend on prey density. Explorations of simple models suggest that these types of adaptive variation are often consistent with type-2 responses, but generally result in shapes that differ significantly from the disc equation. The consequence of using a constant-parameter disc equation model when it is inappropriate is limited ability to predict functional responses in altered circumstances, eg in the presence of a 2nd prey.

Biomass allocation was determined on a species-by-species basis for 46 species common at different times during succession. This showed a similar pattern of increasing proportional root allocation and declining proportional reproductive and stem allocation during succession. These changes were accompanied by an increase in total soil N and a decrease in light penetration to the soil surface during succession. Increasing root allocation and decreasing reproductive allocation suggest that succession on these nutrient-poor soils is the transient dynamics of colonization and competitive displacement, with later successional species being superior N competitors because of higher root allocation. Allocation trade-offs between root stem, leaf and seed can lead to initial dominance by species with high seed and leaf allocation, presumably because of greater colonization and/or maximal growth rates.

The modeling contains algorithms for influences on tree establishment and growth including temperature, water stress, light tolerance, and site quality. The model was used to predict 200 yr of forest succession for 5 different disturbance regimes. This allowed comparison of patterns of basal area by species, of duff and fuel accumulation, and of fire intensities among the following scenarios: 1) no fires (fire suppression), 2) consistent fire intervals of 10, 20 and 50 yr, and 3) a natural fire regime of variable intervals reconstructed from fire scarred trees. Frequent fires (10 and 20 yr intervals) were simulated to be of low intensity, resulting in scorch heights of 0.5-3.0 m. These fires prevented Douglas fir saplings from surviving and becoming part of the overstory. Simulation results for the 10 and 20 yr fire intervals were similar to those for the natural fire regime, based on fire occurrence between AD 1600-1900. However, the occasional long fire intervals within the natural fire regime allowed greater regeneration success for ponderosa pine. Fires at regular intervals of 50 yr were more severe and resulted in a decrease of western larch Larix occidentalis after 150 yr, with a corresponding increase in ponderosa pine. Douglas-fir slowly increased in basal area and became established in the overstory after 200 simulation years. The no-fire scenario allowed Douglas-fir to achieve dominance in the understory, and eventually in the overstory, thereby limiting survival of ponderosa pine and western larch regeneration.

Adults demonstrated the ability to lift and transport food payloads substantially larger than the mean feed mass. Energetic considerations suggest that there is strong selection for parents to decrease the feeding frequency and increase feed mass, to some limit imposed by either the limits of the parents' delivery capabilities, or the limits of the chick's food receiving (swallowing) capabilities (the volume a chick can ingest in one feeding bout). In fact, the limits of the chick's swallowing capabilities occur well before the parents' delivery limits are reached, and thereby set the feed mass at a weight and volume that is easily within the adults' lifting and transporting capabilities. The mean feed mass is viewed as reflecting a particular ""target' payload mass that parents strive to collect as quickly as conditions, and their own individual foraging abilities, will allow, and is a practical compromise between the short-term interest of the chick and those of the adult. While paretns are able to collect an abundance of food for their single chick, their pelagic foraging creates an intermittent, or ""feast or famine' feeding situation for the chick, which promotes the characteristic developmental pattern of slow growth and large fat accumulations. -from Author",37,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,146,NA,NA

Multivariate analyses of habitat ordinations (nonmetric, multidimensional scaling) were used to characterize the habitat breadth and habitat position of each of the avian species. Breadth is the range of structural types of habitat that a species occupies. Position is a measure of the ""representativeness' of the typical habitat type occupied by a species relative to the entire sample of habitat types. There was a significant inverse correlation between breadth and position. The models were used to try to account for this inverse relationship and related statistics, including the amount of co-occurrence between species. Three models based on the geographic proximity of sites provided reasonable representations of the observed patterns, except for co-occurrence, which all models consistently underestimated. Many distributional patterns observed for this avifauna could be accounted for by using simple site-selection algorithms, and by assuming that species behaved independently. The major source of variation unaccounted for by the models was a consistent underestimation of levels of co-occurrence between avian species, which may mean that further modelling may require interdependence rather than independence of species. -from Authors",9,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,147,NA,NA

A significant effect of roach density on cladoceran biomass was observed over the experimental period. By the end of the experiment, the biomass of zooplankton was low in all enclosures except those without roach, and the mean size of 2 zooplankters, Bosmina and cyclopoid copepods, decreased with increasing roach density. 0+ perch shifted from pelagic zooplankton to benthic macroinvertebrates as roach density increased. The roach density at which 0+ perch shifted top feed on benthic prey decreased over time, but occurred at the same density of pelagic prey. The proportion of zooplankton in the diet of 1+ perch and roach also decreased with increasing roach density, with 1+ perch totally dropping zooplankton from their diet and roach shifting to plant and detrital material. Over time, roach increased its utilization of plant and detrital material. Density dependence was found in growth rates of roach and 0+ perch as well as 1+ perch. The main competitive effect of roach occurred during the first half of the experiment, related to roach's high consumption of plant material at all roach densities at the end of the experiment and to the low water temperature during the 2nd half of the 3 month experiment. -from Authors",280,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,148,NA,NA

The tanks also contained zooplankton (mainly Daphnia), which were the main food supply of the smaller instars of Notonecta. The resulting overwintering populations converged towards the appropriate equilibrium densities, via density-dependent and food-dependent fecundity and then cannibalism, but populations overshot their equilibria, producing overconvergence. In natural populations such overconvergence might tend to produce 2-yr cycles in abundance. Overconvergence resulted from the insensitivity of the survivorship of the original adults (at least over the short term) to differences in food supply between treatments, allowing them to continue to affect (via cannibalism and reproduction) the eventual density of the new overwintering population.

Because their ranges differ, the species experience different thermal environments, but they are nearly identical in several measures of thermal physiology. Body temperatures of active lizards varied little with altitude, although air temperatures decrease substantially over this range. Both species compensated behaviorally for variation in thermal environments by varying basking frequency and microhabitat use. By thermoregulating, lizards maintained body temperatures that favor high levels of locomotor performance and other physiological functions. S. occidentalis was almost completely arboreal at low elevation; lizards of both species were partly arboreal, partly terrestrial at intermediate elevation; and S. graciosus was mainly terrestrial at high elevations. Thus, the species converged in microhabitat use where sympatric. These shifts in microhabitat use parallel altitudinal changes in the spatial location of thermally suitable microhabitats and in habitat structure.

These parameters all focus on selected species pairs within the community rather than considering the community as a whole. Fleming and Partridge (1984) (see 86L/5345) proposed a parameter for examining flowering phenologies that focuses on 1 species pair at a time. They compared the observed overlap between members of a particular species pair with the distribution of possible overlap values for this pair from randomly constructed communities. A 2nd parameter, the overlap between a particular species and all other species combined, was used in a similar way. Using these parameters will always result in acceptance of the null hypothesis when in fact a segregated flowering pattern exists, and may lead to acceptance of the competition hypothesis when in fact the null hypothesis is true. A community-level parameter, mean pairwise overlap, makes neither of these errors. Simberloff and Boecklen (1981) (see 82L/7479) used a family of parameters to examine the competition hypothesis that there is a constant difference in log body size (= a constant ratio of body sizes) between adjacent species ranked according to body size. Their parameters focus on the relative magnitude of the differences between 2 pairs of adjacent species, such as the 2 pairs with the smallest and largest log body size differences. These parameters may not always recognize a community with competitive displacement, and may mistake a clumped community for one with displacement. Several community-level parameters are shown to have greater power in discerning competitive displacement. -from Author",46,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,168,NA,NA

Mean number of taxa per site per year was 6.8 for ants and 3.6 for pollinators. The ant assemblage varied more than the pollinator assemblage, particularly spatially. The ant assemblage varied more through space than through time (means of the proportional similarities for pairwise comparisons of assemblages were 0.37 and 0.51, respectively), while the pollinator assemblage varied equally through space and time (means of the proportional similarities were 0.53 and 0.50, respectively).

In each assemblage there was a single taxon that was the least variable, in both time and space, in its relative abundance. Results, coupled with previous findings of significant variation among mutualist taxa in the magnitude of their beneficial effects, indicate that plants may be subject to highly variable selection by their mutualist assemblages. The most beneficial antguard was consistently rare; the most beneficial pollinator was abundant in one site-year but rare or absent in most site-years. The taxon that was consistently abundant was not an efficient pollinator.

Turnover lengths are significantly less than those at the 6th order site, but much greater than observed in other rivers of similar size, probably because most of the organic carbon export in this river is dissolved organic carbon, which is less efficiently retained. At 5 sites along the Ogeechee River continuum ranging from 2nd-6th order, GPP, CR and P/R increased with stream order, yet P/R was always <1, and net daily metabolism was always negative and became more negative with increasing stream order.

Among mature coho salmon in Carnation Creek males outnumbered females but females were larger, and the male-female sex ratio varied directly with the female/male size ratio. Mean female size was constant over 16yr, while male size varied inversely with the male/female sex ratio. Females apparently had higher mortality rates than males; the difference in mortality rates appeared to increase as the animals neared maturity. Sex- and size-ratio data from other coho salmon populations indicate that there are 2 general population types: 1) males outnumber females, and females are larger at maturity; 2) the sexes are equally abundant and equal in size. The authors propose that the range of size for successful reproduction in coho salmon is set by conditions in the breeding environment, and that the range differs for males and females because of the different roles that the sexes play in reproduction. The sex-specific constraints on reproductive size lead to sex-specific foraging strategies and risk-taking. Interpopulation differences in size and sex ratio are determined by differences in physical characteristics of the breeding environment, spawning population density, and the relative riskiness of ocean nursey areas.

During much of the 6-mo ""dry' season (total rainfall: 200-400 mm), sustained combustion was possible in this community within 24 h following and in the second-growth forest after 8-10 d. In contrast, sustained combustion was not possible in the primary forest even after prolonged rainless periods. Only a small percentage of the standing vegetation would likely survive even a low-intensity, surface fire. Even though the autogenic factors in primary forest of the E Amazon create a microcliamte that virtually eliminates the probability of fire, they are currently a common event in disturbed areas of Amazonia. As many as 8 × 106 ha burned in the Amazon Basin. -from Authors",477,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,204,NA,NA

Model parameters were: energy content of the prey, energy cost of predation, and handling time. All variables were positive exponential functions of clam size. The different measures of prey value (or profitability) provided contrasting prey rankings. Both net and gross rates of energy intake [(Benefit-Cost)/Time and Benefit/Time, respectively] predicted that the largest clams were the most profitable. Energetic efficiency (Benefit/Cost) predicted that the smallest clam sizes were the most profitable. Prey-size selection experiments showed that crabs always ate more clams from the smallest clam size class offered. Predictions from the energetic efficiency model thus provide the best fit to results. Use of energetic efficiency as a currency requires energy cost to be limiting over the animal's lifetime. Claw damage as a consequence of fatigue failure (breakage of a structure due to repeated loading), is proposed as a limiting cost. The ecological effects of claw breakage in decapods are evaluated with reference to growth, molting ability, regeneration load, and reproductive success. -from Authors",113,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,205,NA,NA

Variation in flower size was caused by variation within genets and, more drastically, by temperature fluctuations. The hawk moth Enyo lugubris visited flowers from time of anthesis until sunrise, when bumble bees Bombus pennsylvanicus arrived. Flower morphology affected pollen deposition during single hawk moth visits, single bumble bee visits, or unlimited hawk moth and bumble bee visits. The morphological variables with strongest effects differed in each case, and could be related to the foraging technique of each pollinator. Floral morphology affected pollen removal from flowers more than it influenced pollen receipt. Hawk moths could potentially fully pollinate I. trichocarpa before pollen from later rising bumble bees could send tubes to ovules, but tube growth rate increased with rising morning temperatures. Thus, ovules could potentially have been fertilized by a mixture of pollen deposited by hawk moths and by bumble bees. Low morning temperatures excluded hawk moths entirely from I. trichocarpa pollination, by delaying anthesis. On cool mornings, flowers opened in time to receive bumble bee visits only. -from Author",101,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,206,NA,NA
