Adult males defend individual host-plants as mating territories. Preferred shrubs, used as territories each year, are distinguished by low concentrations of the phenolic compound nordihydroguaiaretic acid. Adult males suffered high mortality on ""avoided' shrubs due to starvation and consequent desiccation. Mortality of females did not differ between preferred and ""avoided' shrubs, but between 7-14 days post-eclosion females grew at significantly slower rates on avoided shrubs. The low growth rates of females on avoided shrubs were attributable to low conversion rates of digested food. Adult males that survived on ""avoided' shrubs, and both male and female nymphs, showed similar reduction in conversion rates of digested food. Certain substances in the foliage of ""avoided' Larrea shrubs presumably have a toxic effect on metabolic processes in L. coquilletti. Variation in host-plant quality had both a direct effect on the growth of male L. coquilletti and an indirect effect on their expected encounter rates with females.

Predation pressure on egg masses created unpredictably changing oviposition environments for females, which deposit only one mass in summer. A simple model, based on the Levins fitness set approach, is described for anlysing the pattern of geographical variation. The new approach to oviposiiton site selection focuses away from the use of instantaneous fitness values as a measure of adaptiveness and towards the use of long-term fitness values measured in unpredictably changing environments.

Overall, infestation markedly reduced the rate at which clutches were laid by a female searching within a host tree. Egg infestation decreased the probability that a female 1) bored with her ovipositor after landing on a fruit and 2) deposited a clutch once oviposition-boring was initiated, and 3) deposited additional clutches at new sites on the fruit before leaving. Egg infestation also decreased duration of an oviposition (and thus probably clutch size) and tended to decrease the persistence with which a female foraged on fruit. Infestation had no effect on the persistence with which a female foraged within a tree or on the rate at which a female landed on fruit. A simple rule of thumb for response by Mediterranean fruit flies to egg infestation is presented. This rule implies that different foraging traits such as clutch size and giving up time are mechanistically related and should not be treated independently in foraging theory. Both survival to pupation and the expected fecundity of survivors decreased progressively as egg density in host fruit was artificially increased, suggesting that progeny deposited in egg-infested fruit have lower fitness than progeny deposited in uninfested fruit. -from Authors",45,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,6

Stability in population size in summer was produced by low densities. Instantaneous rate of population change per week was negatively correlated with initial population size during periods when numbers normally increased. Density dependence accounted for up to 61% of variation in instantaneous rate of population change. Intrinsic mechanisms contributing to this effect are likely to include variation in rates of reproduction and dispersal with density of overwintered males and females. Following greater peak abundance the rate of decline over winter was less severe, atrributable to the positive influence of increased food supply on abundance in autumn and early winter and survival of mice over winter. There was no evidence of density dependence in the chronology of the termination of the spring decline or the onset of autumn increase. The end of the autumn increase was negatively related to initial autumn density, ie peak abundance was later following lower densities in late summer. Density-dependent effects during the increase phase of the annual cycle are sufficient to regulate population size by promoting population recovery from very low summer densities and limiting peak abundance in early winter.

On arrival in Scotland, after an early onset of winter in Svalbard in 1986, paired adult geese were in poor body condition; the poorest of the 8 yr for which data are available.

Females returning to Scotland with broods were heavier than those that had nested (brood patch present) but had no young in winter. This population has recently shown a density-dependent decline in recruitment. Despite the fact that density-related factors had acted earlier in the breeding cycle, competition between families on the rearing areas still resulted in a reduction in recruitment through mortality of young on migration; the density effect was magnified by early onset of winter in 1986.

However, particularly large or small guilds on single tree species tended to contain at least one particularly large or small taxon as well, indicating that outsized guilds resulted from the presence of outsized taxa rather than a uniform swelling or shrinkage of all taxa in a guild.

Annual survival of adults (mean 6%) was high during average conditions but lower in both drought years and during an epizootic. Males survived slightly better than females. Survival did not vary with age among adults, but survival of juveniles was lower (mean 35%) and twice as variable as adult survival. Mockingbirds bred in response to rainfall, producing up to 5.2 fledglings per breeding female each season (mean 2.3). Clutch size, number of clutches and total production of fledglings increased in wet years. Helpers attended 34% of all nests and increased production of fledglings by 19%. Differential mortality produced variation in the adult sex ratio. Breeding by males was constrained by the relative scarcity of females, and the proportion of males acting as helpers varied correspondingly because non-breeding males most often helped. The proportion of females breeding did not vary with adult sex ratio, because non-breeding males most often helped. The proportion of females breeding did not vary with adult sex ratio, because polygyny occurred in 2 yr when females predominated, and most of the few females that helped also bred. Variation in natality and survival caused substantial variation in population density, but the density of breeders remained relatively constant (CV=21%) compared to density of non-breeders (CV=93%).

The analysis also reveals clear signs of koa being density-dependent, and falling into 2 distinct relationships depending on the density of potential eggs per leaf. A simple model of the whitefly population on one bush study, based on this analysis, predicts alternative stable equilibria, which are in accord with the observed populations. Additional density dependence is detected from the analysis of a more detailed set of data on the leaf-to-leaf survival from egg to adult stages. This density dependence tends to shift from a direct relationship in years of relatively low whitefly density to inverse density dependence when total whitefly densities are high. A more detailed model of the whitefly dynamics is developed assuming a population in which the adults distribute their eggs from leaf to leaf according to a negative binomial distribution with the degree of clumping inversely related to population size. The rapid increase and subsequent decline in whitefly densities over 14 yr is discussed in the light of evidence connecting the population increase to changes in the amino acid concentration in the leaves. Viburnum whitefly and its host-plant are both introduced species in S England and are at the edge of their geographical range. Several features of the whitefly dynamics may result from this.

Despite seasonal fluctuations in total population density, the density of large polychaete individuals was stable and the total population biomass was of similar magnitude in the 2 species. Size-frequency distributions followed a similar pattern through the year, with recruitment of young seen in the austral spring. Different size groups of Halosydna had similar levels of dispersion throughout the year, but Pseudonereis showed a wide variation in dispersion among size groups, with large sizes demonstrating more strongly aggregated patterns. Overlap in space between the species was smaller than that within either of the species. Interspecifically, the pair involving larger size groups tended to have lower values of spatial overlap. The Semimytilus bed supported more population biomass of both polychaete species than the Perumytilus bed, though the density of Pseudonereis was not significantly different between the 2 habitats. Large individuals (of Pseudonereis, in particular) were scarce in the Perumytilus bed.

Realized fecundity of cinnabar moth was density-independent at 3.3 egg batches per female, <67% of potential fecundity based on pupal dissection. Larval survival depended on the ragwort shoot biomass available at oviposition and the mean size and spacing of plants; emigration began earlier from small plants, and density-dependent mortality occurred during dispersal. Survival was low when spring was late and plants were small at oviposition, when egg batch density was high and fewer plants were available during larval dispersal, and after years of high flowering when the larger, flowering rosettes died back. Plant recruitment was not related to flower production or moth abundance in the previous year, and may be microsite limited. Weather and rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus disturbance influenced plant recruitment from seed and from perennating rootstocks of large plants. Defoliation did not increase plant death rate. Seedling abundance did not peak following years of peak ragwort seed production. The key factors of ragwort-cinnabar moth interaction appeared to be autumn and spring rainfall and the timing of spring growth. Autumn and spring rains encouraged ragwort growth, and caused insect abundance to peak 1 yr after host biomass. Early spring growth, and large plants at egg-laying, reduced larval competition. The interaction between the plant and herbivore is asymmetric.

Settled species exploiting relatively predictable resources associated with their peat and grassland habitats flew less. Of the Settled species, those living in peat showed least flight activity. In their expansive and continuous habitat flight is not necessary between subpopulations. Limestone species flew more than expected for the relative permanence and stability of their habitat. Flightless species were limited to limestone outcrops large enough to support stable populations. Small colonies of flying species survived by regular dispersal between outcrops, and by receiving airborne immigrants from lowland grasslands to the west. Both flightless and flying Limestone species recorded on the outcrops had a positive species-area relationship consistent with island biogeographical theory. Higher species richness on the larger outcrops is attributed to the positive influences of area per se and to increased habitat heterogeneity. For flying species, the greater interception area presented to immigrants by a larger outcrop may also be a contributing factor.

In contrast to Coquet, the Shetland birds brough their young a very high proportion of small fish, and lost a high proportion of their large prey to conspecific kleptoparasites; they also foraged at a higher rate and brought less energy per chick per hour. Chicks in Shetland colony grew at a slower rate and the majority died in the first week of life. Breeding success on Coquet was good. In both areas, adults lost weight during the breeding period.

Other species, suitable as hosts (invertebrate diet, accessible nests) but rarely used by cuckoos, showed just as much rejection of model eggs unlike their own or stronger rejection than the most strongly rejecting of current favourite hosts. Two results suggest that the egg discrimination by suitable hosts has evolved in response to cuckoo parasitism. 1) Species unsuitable as hosts (thus with no history of interaction with cuckoos) mainly showed little if any rejection of model eggs unlike their own; 2) meadow pipits and white wagtails in Iceland, where they are isolated from cockoos, showed significantly less discrimination against eggs unlike their own than in Britain, where they are parasitized. Species with smaller bills suffered greater rejection costs (own eggs damaged) and were more likely to reject model eggs by desertion than species with larger bills, which tended to reject by ejection.

High parasitism rates did not occur in years of high nest failure during laying. This suggests that more parasitism occurs as a response to a lack of suitable nest sites than occurs as a consequence of nest failure. Nest parasitism was higher at times when a higher than average proportion of young birds did not attempt to nest. Nest parasitism had no measurable effect on the hatching success of host eggs. On average, hatching success of parasitic eggs was lower than that of host eggs, primarily due to poor timing of laying by parasites relative to onset of incubation.

However, males spent more days at the colony so over the whole season female energy expenditure is only 3.5% above males. Scaled mass-specific average DEE is 18% greater for macaronis than gentoos, chiefly because of the energy costs of offshore foraging trips.
