First, plant roots and soil microbes have a long history of interaction that is centered on the reciprocal acquisition of carbon by microbes and nitrogen by plants. Predators within the rhizosphere alter these interactions in ways that benefit plants but also influence the dynamics of other Species within ecosystems and processes that are important to ecosystem function and stability. These same Predators regulate their prey in a traditional ""top-down"" manner but in doing so alter the release of nutrients that may limit plant productivity and thereby affect plant growth in a ""bottom-up"" fashion as well. Second, much attention has been given to the importance of specific interactions, or, as presented within this series, genes and/or gene products as critical control points. We suggest that control should be viewed within the framework of interactivity. The interdependence between the aboveground and belowground realms can be explained in terms of the patterning of trophic interactions within the rhizosphere and the influence of these interactions on the supply of nutrients and rates of nutrient uptake by plants. While specific interactions may be important, it is the patterning of these interactions intoassemblages of species that share similar growth rates and habitats that is the salient feature of the rhizosphere that confers stability, affects nutrient retention, and regulates aboveground and belowground dynamics.",193,Journal,re,Review,100,4,4,Nutrient dynamics | Rhizosphere | Soil food webs | Stability | Trophic structure,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA,NA,NA

As yet, however, only a few have been identified. Signals, by definition, contain information, react with a receptor, and elicit a response. Signals may thus represent the highest level of evolved response in rhizosphere communities and, in that sense, occupy a supreme control point. At the same time, some signals may function as modulators of downstream responses, rather than on/off switches. To assess these possibilities, several interactions between plants and soil organisms are described, starting with the molecular interactions between leguminous plants and symbiotic bacteria of the family Rhizobiaceae, one of the best-characterized plant-microbe associations in the rhizosphere. We then examine other interactions between plants and soil organisms for overlap and/or connections with the rhizosphere signals utilized in the legume-Rhizobium symbiosis. Whether information currently available reflects the interaction of the organisms in nature or only in the laboratory has not always been determined. Thus, the key ecological issue of how important some of the signals are under field conditions remains to be addressed. Molecular tools now available make this task less daunting than in the past, and thus a new age of experimental field ecology may soon burst forth in rhizosphere studies.

Belowground available volume accounted for 67% and 79% of the variance in first- and second-year Prosopis seedling growth and survival, respectively. Available volume in the vertical dimension was more important than that in the horizontal dimension. Trials spanned years with contrasting annual precipitation, suggesting that root competition occurs in years of near-average as well as below-average annual rainfall. Spatial heterogeneity in canopy gaps and belowground biomass was also quantified in a Schizachayriuim-Paspalum grassland matrix and evaluated with respect to Prosopis seedling establishment. Of the 100 grid points encountered in four grass stands, 62% were unoccupied; and 50% of these exceeded 80 cm2 (∼10 cm diameter). Gaps ≥ 10 cm in diameter were sufficient for successful Prosopis germination and survival after one (40%) and two (15%) growing seasons. Herbaceous root biomass was statistically comparable among stands, but point-specific biomass varied three orders of magnitude (<50 g/m2 to >3000 g/m2). In addition, root biomass was temporally variable, ranging from a mean (± 1 SE; g/m2) of 768 (86) in a year of below-average annual rainfall (1996; 721 mm) to 1108 (104) in a year of roughly average annual rainfall (1995; 1032 mm). It is often assumed that grasslands dominated by productive, late seral species will be resistant to woody plant encroachment; and that grazing, by reducing the ability of grasses to competitively exclude woody seedlings, makes grasslands susceptible to tree/shrub invasion. However, given the substantial annual variation in belowground biomass observed in this study, it seems reasonable that ungrazed grasslands may be more susceptible to woody plant encroachment in some years and more resistant in others. Furthermore, given the substantial spatial variation in aboveground gap area and belowground biomass, there may be numerous low-competition microsites for woody plant seedlings within ungrazed grasslands. A high degree of temporal and spatial variability in gap area and belowground biomass may therefore help explain successful establishment of woody seedlings in ungrazed or lightly grazed, late seral grasslands in the absence of fire. We found no correlation between aboveground structure and belowground biomass at scales of 1-10 m2.

Understanding the long-term effects of habitat fragmentation on tropical plant community structure is critical to predicting how alterations to the landscape will impact tropical biodiversity. The objective of this study was to examine fragmentation effects on the composition, abundance, and species richness of epiphyllous (leaf-inhabiting) bryophytes. I conducted this research in an experimentally fragmented forest reserve in central Amazonia where data on the distribution and abundance of 65 bryophyte taxa were analyzed from 16 1-ha sample plots located in continuous forest and fragments. Epiphyll communities inhabiting small (1- and 10-ha) fragments exhibited lower species richness, abundance, and among-site compositional variation than those from 100-ha fragments and continuous forest plots. Reduced epiphyll diversity in small fragments is not simply a statistical artifact of low epiphyll densities, but rather due to a disproportionate loss of regionally common taxa. In contrast, rare taxa responded marginally to fragmentation, and in most cases were more abundant in fragments than in continuous forest habitat.

Canopy structure, aboveground mass, leaf nitrogen content, and leaf photosynthesis were determined for individual shoots of the dominant grass Miscanthus sinensis (a C4 species) and for four forb species (all C3). These data were used to calculate net daily carbon gain of individual shoots in absolute terms, per unit leaf area, and per unit above-ground biomass (Pmass). Pmass in turn, is an important component of growth per unit mass (relative growth rate, RGR). Miscanthus shoots had a higher total carbon gain and a higher Pmass than shoots of the other species. The greater Pmass of Miscanthus shoots was not because they captured more light per unit mass (Φmass), but because they achieved higher rates of photosynthesis per unit of absorbed light (Plight; Pmass = Φmass X Plight). The latter was mainly due to the higher leaf photosynthetic capacities per unit nitrogen associated with the C4 pathway of this species Among the forbs, Potentilla freyniana had the highest Pmass, even though it was the shortest, most shaded species in the stand. This high Pmass was because its shoots had relatively high leaf-area-to-mass ratios (resulting in high Φmass) and low rates of dark respiration (resulting in high Plight). Sensitivity analysis of our model showed that relative to the other species these traits enable Potentilla to achieve high carbon gain in the shade but not at high light. It also showed that the traits of Miscanthus enable it to achieve relatively high carbon gain at high light but not at low light. Another sensitivity analysis revealed that an increase in leaf area and associated light capture of shoots, while keeping their total canopy nitrogen constant and thus reducing their leaf N content and associated photosynthetic capacities, reduced the estimated carbon gain for most of the shoots in the stand. These results indicate that interspecific differences in carbon gain per unit mass in this stand were more closely associated with differences in leaf physiology than with structural differences that determine light capture.",44,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,C 3 | C 4 | Canopy structure | Coexistence | Grassland | Interspecific competition | Leaf area ratio | Miscanthus sinensis | Niche | Nitrogen use efficiency | Photosynthesis,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,5,NA,NA,NA,NA

We used laboratory experiments to investigate the potential assembly pathways in a small pool of protist species. Mapping the paths of assembly involved two steps: testing the ability of every possible species combination to persist, and testing each persistent community for its capacity to be invaded and changed by every other species from the pool. We then compared the properties of assembly in the experimental system with those predicted by theoretical models. We found that the number of community states and assembly paths was much smaller than theoretically possible, but that the system nonetheless had quite a complex range of assembly behaviors. There were many alternative paths to most communities, but overall, the species pool had just one state to which the paths eventually led. This absorbing state involved an oscillation between two communities, driven in part by a catalytic species that could persist in neither of them. Catalytic species have the property of invasion, changing the resident community, and then going extinct. In the species pool used here, only the predatory species acted as catalysts. Several communities capable of long-term persistence were unreachable by sequential assembly. One community had the property that it could not be reassembled from the species it contained (a ""Humpty-Dumpty"" community).

Current consensus is that both forces play a role, but it is poorly known if these forces act differently on herbivores in the same assemblage and what factors underlie this variation. Using manipulative experiment's with an assemblage of sap-feeding phytophagous insects (six species of planthoppers, leafhoppers, and heteropteran bugs) inhabiting intertidal Spartina marshes, we examined the association between herbivore behavior, risk of predation, and ultimately the relative impact of top-down (wolf spider predation) and bottom-up (host-plant nutrition) factors on the population density of each sap-feeding herbivore. A factorial experiment on open Spartina islets in the field (two levels of plant nutrition crossed with two levels of spider predation) showed that bottom-up and top-down manipulations differentially affected the various sap-feeders. Overall, bottom-up effects dominated in this sap-feeder community, whereby the density of all six sap-feeders increased when the nitrogen content of Spartina was elevated. By contrast, wolf-spider addition significantly suppressed populations of only the Prokelisia species and had little impact on the other four sap-feeder species in the community. Functional-response experiments and behavioral studies revealed that certain species (Prokelisia planthoppers) were at much higher risk of attack by wolf spiders than other sap-feeders in the assemblage and that risk of predation was associated with a species' particular ""escape/defensive behavior."" Moreover, risk of spider predation was roughly linked to the strength of top-down impacts in the field, because species with ineffective escape behaviors and a high risk of spider attack (Prokelisia planthoppers) were the only sap-feeders whose populations were suppressed by spider predation in the field. Thus, specific behavioral characteristics of the sap-feeders on Spartina influenced risk of predation and the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up impacts on their population dynamics. Notably, all herbivores in this system were positively influenced by elevated plant nutrition, only the common sap-feeder species (Prokelisia planthoppers) were adversely affected by spider predation, and it was the rarer sap-feeders in the assemblage that were least impacted by predation.

Four plots had nematode predators added to the soil, while four control plots had no nematodes added. Cascading effects on lupine growth and fitness occurred quickly. The nematode halved herbivore densities in three months, increased lupine trunk growth by 67% within eight months, and increased seed set by 44% in three months.

Through simulation and analysis of a stochastic spatial model, we argue that the likelihood of persistence via the classical scenario is strongly affected by some basic properties of within-patch successional dynamics whose importance has not been emphasized in metapopulation theory: the distribution of successional stage durations, and whether patches are ""refractory"" vs. immediately available for recolonization after an extinction has occurred. These properties are tied to the biological causes of extinction (e.g., demographic accident vs. regular successional changes) and patch recovery (e.g., recolonization by a host species vs. regeneration of an exhausted resource base).

The red-spotted toad (Bufo punctatus) in the southwestern United States and Mexico commonly inhabits wetlands that have become much smaller and fewer since the late Pleistocene. This study tests two predictions based on metapopulation theory, that the incidence of habitat patch occupancy is directly related to patch size and that it is inversely related to patch isolation, and a third, potentially competing hypothesis, that patch occupancy is influenced by local environmental conditions. In a 20 000 km2 area. of the eastern Mojave Desert, 128 potential habitat patches (primarily springs) were identified and surveyed for local environmental characteristics and presence/absence of B. punctatus. Patch size metrics reflected extent of water and riparian vegetation of several types. Patch isolation metrics were based on nearest-neighbor distances, calculated both as Euclidian distance and distance via connecting drainage channels. B. punctatus was found at 73% of the sites, including all of the 16 historic (pre-1970) sites. Patches were generally quite small, with water extending a median distance of only 200 m and median area of 72 m2. Median nearest-neighbor distances among patches were 1.8 km Euclidian distance (range: 0.4-22.0 km) and 6.8 km via drainage channels (range: 0.5-64.9 km). Based on stepwise multiple logistic regression, the incidence of patch occupancy increased significantly with patch size and was also significantly related to elevation, latitude, and four metrics that were associated with rocky terrain, periodic scouring water flows, and ephemeral water. In contrast, incidence of patch occupancy was not significantly related to patch isolation. These findings are consistent with a ""patchy population"" model, rather than the classical equilibrium metapopulation model, implying frequent dispersal among patches and virtually no local extinctions. We speculate that B. punctatus in the Mojave Desert today occurs primarily in a patchy population or populations within mountain ranges that are isolated from patchy populations in other ranges.

Hence, seedlings may not obtain any net benefit from a CMN maintained by competitively superior, mature plants. In a controlled greenhouse experiment, we showed that the presence of a mycorrhizal adult plant does not improve the growth of seedlings, although solitary seedlings benefit from mycorrhizae. Seedlings of the perennial, mycorrhizal, subarctic herbs Antennaria dioica, Campanula rotundifolia, Sibbaldia procumbens, and Solidago virgaurea were germinated alone or in the vicinity of an adult established Sibbaldia plant.

We tested for seed limitation and explored the role of litter accumulation in explaining effects of recent grazing history on seedling establishment, species diversity (richness and evenness), and plant productivity in a subhumid grassland ecosystem in Texas, USA. We added seeds and removed litter in a factorial treatment arrangement (seeds added, litter removed, seeds added and litter removed, and control [no seeds added nor litter removed]) within each of five fields: currently grazed, no grazing for 1-2, 2-3, or 6-7 yr, and an unplowed prairie remnant. Seeds from each of 20 native species were added to replicated 1-m2 plots in each field during each of two growing seasons. Adding seeds increased seedling emergence in all fields, but this increase was much greater when litter was removed, especially in ungrazed fields. Counter to our expectations, seedling emergence increased with time since grazing when litter was removed and was greatest in fields not grazed for 1-3 yr when litter was present. As expected, light availability at the soil surface decreased with time since grazing. However, soil water availability to 15 cm depth increased with time since grazing, suggesting that limits on seedling emergence changed from water to light with time since grazing. Aboveground productivity during the second year of the study was significantly reduced following seed additions in the four fields along the grazing gradient, primarily because of a decrease in the productivity of C4 grasses. Species diversity decreased with time since grazing. Seed additions slightly increased species richness but decreased species evenness in fields located along the grazing gradient, resulting in no net effect on diversity. In the more species-rich prairie remnant, seed additions had no effect on aboveground productivity or species richness or evenness.

A critical but untested assumption Of this Claim is that reductions in fecundity by individual plants actually result in demographic vulnerability at the population level. I tested this ""recruitment limitation hypothesis"" using three years of census data from 13 populations of the Amazonian understory herb Heliconia acuminata, which I integrated with empirical estimates of seedling establishment into matrix demographic models. I asked: (1) How much recruitment is necessary for λ > 1? (2) What are the projected values of λ for H. acuminata populations in fragments and continuous forest, given empirical estimates of seedling emergence? (3) What are the actual values of λ for populations in fragments and continuous forest, and why might projected and estimated values of λ differ? (4) What other demographic stages contribute to λ, and how are these affected by fragmentation? Simulation models suggest that extreme reductions in recruitment are necessary for population declines, and empirical estimates of seedling establishment were frequently below these thresholds. As a result, Heliconia acuminata populations in fragments are projected to shrink at a rate of 1-1.5% per year, while those in continuous forest are projected to grow 2.3-4% per year. Annual censuses, however, indicated populations in both continuous forest and fragments grew at rates well in excess of those projected by matrix models. This discrepancy is due to higher-than-predicted seedling numbers. While elasticity analyses indicated transitions related to growth and survivorship actually made the greatest proportional contribution to λ, these results suggest that dispersal into fragments is common and helping populations overcome the negative demographic consequences of reduced seedling establishment. Additional demographic studies of plant populations in fragmented areas are urgently needed to identify other potential mechanisms responsible for population declines.

D. pulex population growth rates were measured in three treatments: (1) predators/competitors excluded, (2) competitors present and predators excluded, and (3) competitors and the predator Chaoborus present. The experiment was conducted twice in the growing season. In contrast to the top-down view, effects of competition outweighed effects of predation but were variable among ponds (being strongest in those ponds/times in which Daphnia relative abundance was low, and weakest when Daphnia were dominant). Competitor interaction strength was also temporally variable, increasing later in the season. Several potential determinants (biotic and abiotic) of variable competition intensity were explored using regressions. Only the C:P ratio of edible algae showed a significant relationship; negative effects of competition increased as algae became more phosphorus limited, in keeping with recent stoichiometric models.

Cafeteria experiments showed that Myrmecocystus depilis, M. mimicus, and Aphaenogaster cockerelli prefer protein resources to seed resources.

We found that there was considerable variation among sites in the arrangement of species, and that variation could be attributed to variation in resource availability and in the effect of particular species among sites.

A significant fraction of plant photosynthetic carbon may be used by these associated microorganisms, both to support their beneficial activities and for microbial growth and reproduction. Because many microbial individuals are associated with each individual plant, the individual benefit to a microbe that allocates more resources to its own reproduction (thereby allocating less to fixing N2, supplying P, or producing antifungal metabolites) would exceed its individual loss from any resulting reduction in collective benefits (mainly plant carbon substrates). An initially rare ""free rider"" mutant strain might therefore be expected to displace its more cooperative parental strain. Yet, the mycorrhizal and legume-rhizobium mutualisms have persisted (often coexisting with ""cheating"") for millions of years. This paper discusses the importance of microbial cooperation (with plants and with other microbes) and possible reasons for its evolutionary persistence in the rhizosphere. In undisturbed soils, spatial structure can favor kin selection, but this may be counterbalanced by the increased likelihood that future competitors will be among the beneficiaries of current cooperation. In loose associations, direct fitness benefits to microorganisms may explain the evolutionary persistence of activities (e.g., production of antifungal compounds) that can benefit plants as a side effect. In closer, more symbiotic, relationships, host sanctions against individuals or clones that fail to perform their symbiotic function may be more important.

They function as organs responsible for structural support, for acquisition of mineral and water resources, and for fostering of symbiotic bacteria and fungi. They also sustain a complex food web of pro-karyotes and eukaryotes in, on, and near the root. In addition to these well-known functions, roots have a recently discovered role with potentially profound coevolutionary implications for the rhizosphere food web, as well as for terrestrial ecological communities in general. Roots are both a source and a receptor of molecular signals important for mutualistic bacteria and perhaps other soil organisms. Fluid-borne rhizosphere compounds flow in the opposite direction from airborne signals that emanate from plant shoots. The powerful transpiration stream around roots naturally concentrates molecular data in a cafeteria of information about the surrounding soil. These molecular signals, such as N-acylated homoserine lactones and phenazines produced by bacteria, can be interpreted simultaneously by multiple species as well as by the root. We propose a model of multitrophic molecular signals in the rhizosphere that implies multiple roles of roots, as hosts, regulators, and sustainers of terrestrial productivity. We suggest a framework of regulation in the rhizosphere that functions through molecular ""control points."" We define control points as regulatory elements that are operated on by selection processes to confer fitness on individual organisms and thereby have effects that propagate through other trophic levels. Identification of a control point creates a hypothesis that can be tested to assess the quantitative significance of that regulatory element. Some control points may transmit or perceive signals between organisms, but others probably integrate changing environmental conditions or external resources into individual life histories and community functions. The promise of understanding the new molecular signals is that genes must closely underlie these control points. This could offer ecology access to the power of molecular biology and allow a deep understanding of the evolutionary significance of these phenomena. One major strength of rhizospheres for addressing these issues is that realistic ecological interactions can be examined in a restricted microcosm under environmentally controlled conditions with organisms whose genomes have been completely defined and/or partially modified.",61,Journal,re,Review,100,4,4,Mutualism | Regulation | Roots | Signals,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,27,NA,NA,NA,NA

Further to previous reports of ""giant cannibals"" in this species, we show that Lembadion is able to gradually adjust its size to the size of its prey. Large size acts as an inducible offense, since large morphs have an increased gape-size and can exploit a wider food range than small morphs. Despite these benefits, large morphs reduce their size whenever small prey is available. This suggests that their fitness is governed by a trade-off. We experimentally demonstrate this trade-off by showing that, when offered small prey, large morphs achieve lower volume-specific feeding rates and lower maximal population growth rates than small morphs. Both results highlight that large morphs suffer demographic costs that make them inferior in small-prey environments.

However, there have been very few empirical studies quantifying engineering effects in different biological systems. In this study, we examined the effect of shelter-building caterpillars on the species richness and guild structure of leaf-chewing herbivores occupying individual white oak (Quercus alba) saplings. For each of two years, we disrupted leaf-tie formation on 93 white oak saplings during a three-week period in early summer that coincided with the peak in leaf-tie construction by the most common leaf-tying caterpillar, Pseudotelphusa sp. (Gelechiidae). We then created artificial leaf ties on 62 of these saplings by clipping together adjacent pairs of leaves (10% of the foliage) on each tree. For 31 of these trees, we also placed a single Pseudotelphusa caterpillar into each artificial tie to examine possible non-engineering effects associated with the caterpillar in addition to its shelter-building activity. One month later, removal of leaf ties had reduced the average density of leaf ties present on a tree by 61% (1999) and 54% (2000). This effect persisted throughout the season, indicating that no species assumed the engineering role of Pseudotelphusa sp. once it was removed. The decrease in shelter availability significantly decreased mean cumulative species richness of leaf-chewing insects by 38% (1999) and 14% (2000) compared to the two artificial tie treatments (with and without caterpillars initially), which did not differ from one another. Herbivore community composition also differed significantly between the removal and artificial tie treatments in both years, due to increased species richness of leaf-tying caterpillars (1999 and 2000), sawflies (1999 only), and beetles (2000 only) on trees with artificial ties.

Fossil pollen and charcoal preserved in seven lakes confirm a close link between landform and the pre-European distribution of vegetation. Pine forests, dominated by Pinus rigida, were closely associated with xeric outwash deposits, whereas oak - hardwood forests were associated with landforms having finer grained soils and variable topography. In general, fire was much more abundant on Cape Cod than most other areas in New England, but its occurrence varied geographically at two scales. On the western end of Cape Cod, fires were more prevalent in pine forests (outwash) than in oak - hardwood forests (moraines). In contrast, fires were less common on the narrow and north-south trending eastern Cape, perhaps because of physical limits on fire spread. The most rapid and substantial changes during the past 2000 years were initiated by European settlement, which produced a vegetation mosaic that today is less clearly tied to landform. Quercus and other hardwood trees declined in abundance in the early settlement period in association with land clearance, whereas Pinus has increased, especially during the past century, through natural reforestation and planting of abandoned fields and pastures. An increase in fossil charcoal following European settlement suggests that fire occurrence has risen substantially as a result of forest clearance and other land uses, reaching levels greater than at any time over the past 2000 years. Although fire was undoubtedly used by Native Americans and may have been locally important, we find no clear evidence that humans extensively modified fire regimes or vegetation before European settlement.

Most efforts in this area have focused on the density-mediated, or lethal effects, of predators on prey density. Recently, there has been growing interest in trait-mediated indirect interactions (TMIIs): the presence of a predator in the environment influences the interaction between two other species (prey and their resource) by altering a trait of the prey species. For example, waterborne cues released by predators can cause changes in prey species behavior, such as feeding rates, thereby altering the impact of the prey species on their resources. Thus, TMIIs represent the non-lethal effects of predators that contrast with the more traditional emphasis on lethal indirect effects. Marine ecologists are just beginning to explore the role of TMIIs in their systems. We examined whether risk cues released by a ubiquitous crab predator (Carcinus maenas) influence the abundance of two dominant species in the rocky intertidal zone (barnacles [Semibalanus balanoides] and fucoid algae [Ascophyllum nodosum]) by altering the behavior of two of its snail prey (Nucella lapillus and Littorina littorea). We found that the presence of green crab risk cues can have strong cascading indirect effects on the abundance of barnacles and fucoid algae. N. lapillus exposed to risk cues consumed up to 29% fewer barnacles compared to conspecifics feeding in the absence of risk cues, whereas L. littorea exposed to risk cues consumed 459% fewer fucoids compared to conspecifics feeding in the absence of risk cues. These cascading interactions appear to reflect suppression of snail feeding by predator risk cues. In both food chains, snails exhibited more refuge-seeking behavior and grew less in the presence of risk cues. Our experiments suggest that TMIIs may have an important and underappreciated influence on species interactions that shape community dynamics on rocky intertidal shores.",209,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Barnacles | Community structure | Crab predator | Food chains | Fucoid algae | Indirect effects | Plasticity | Prey species behavior | Rocky intertidal zone | Snails | Trait-mediated indirect interactions,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,42,NA,NA,NA,NA

The hypothesis that light demand and adult stature of tree species within a community, independently of each other, determine species' architectural traits was tested by comparing 53 Liberian rain forest tree species. We evaluated whether species differed in their tree height, crown depth, and crown diameter, when compared at a standardized size of 15-cm diameter at breast height, and how their architecture changed early during ontogeny. Tree height was positively correlated with adult stature and light demand. By producing a relatively slender stem, large-stature species are able to rapidly reach their reproductive size, at a low cost for construction and support. Light-demanding species need a slender stem to be able to attain or maintain a position in the canopy. Both crown depth and crown diameter were negatively correlated with adult stature, but not with light demand. This is in contrast with the hypothesis that shade-tolerant species should have a shallow crown to reduce self-shading in a light-limited environment. Investing energy in height growth rather than lateral crown growth allows a rapid vertical stem extension, but crown diameter has to be sufficiently small to reduce the risk of mechanical failure. All architectural patterns were maintained during ontogeny. The key factors driving interspecific differences in tree architecture are the costs of height extension and mechanical stability.

Using the proposed justification, we show that, for large sample sizes, the estimator is also valid under an alternative condition, i.e., species that are represented the same number of times in the initial sample have equal relative abundances in the community. This condition is statistically justified from a Bayesian approach, although the estimator exhibits moderate negative bias for predicting larger samples in highly heterogeneous communities.

Specifically, whenever superior plant competitors spread to form dense stands, they will be found and attacked by their specialist insect enemies. This will decrease host plant abundance, causing a reduction in standing crop biomass, which will indirectly increase subordinate competitors and plant species richness. In this study, we found that a native, specialist chrysomelid beetle (Trirhabda virgata) in an old-field community decreased total standing crop biomass, leading to an increase in plant species richness. This reduction in biomass was due solely to a reduction in the biomass of the beetle's host plant, meadow goldenrod (Solidago altissima), which was the dominant plant species in this community. Our results demonstrate that when a superior competitor increases in density, the per-stem impact of herbivores increases due to a buildup of these herbivores in high-density host patches. Specifically, we found that as goldenrod density increased, the perstem abundance of Trirhabda virgata also increased. In turn, species richness increased as the negative effect of insects on goldenrod biomass increased. Recent research suggests that litter accumulation could negate or cancel the effect of herbivorous insects on plant communities because litter accumulation increases with standing crop biomass, causing a decline in Species richness. The litter accumulation hypothesis states that, in productive communities, the increase in the abundance of the superior competitor will lead to a dense accumulation of plantlitter, causing a decline in species richness. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that as the biomass of the dominant plant species increased, litter mass also increased. In turn, species richness decreased as the negative effects of litter on stem density increased. Interestingly, the effect of litter on stem density depended on whether insects were present. Our results suggest the potential for a general rule: specialist insect herbivores will function as classic keystone species in plant communities whenever host species form large, dense aggregations if host plants are dominant species.",43,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Goldenrod | Herbivory | Insects | Litter | Old-field community | Resource concentration hypothesis | Solidago altissima | Trirhabda virgata,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,49,NA,NA,NA,NA

Four types of experimental plots with six treatment combinations of deep and shallow soil at reduced-, ambient-, and enriched-N availability formed the basis of this study. The soil responses to the experimental treatments were examined over three years, and patterns in diversity and productivity were examined in year 3. The soil depth treatment did not significantly affect soil carbon (C) and N pools or ANPP and diversity. A pulse amendment of C added to the soil prior to planting increased soil microbial biomass and decreased potential net N mineralization rates to effectively reduce N availability throughout the study. Nitrogen availability declined over time in nonamended soils as a result of plant establishment, but adding fertilizer N alleviated the increasing immobilization potential of the soil. The level of ANPP was lowest and diversity highest in the reduced-N treatment, whereas the enriched-N treatment resulted in high productivity, but low diversity. As a result, diversity was inversely correlated with productivity in these newly established communities. The same mechanism invoked to explain decreased diversity under nutrient enrichment in old-field ecosystems and native grasslands (e.g., reduced light availability with increased production) was supported in the restored prairie by the positive relationship between ANPP and intercepted light, and a strong correlation between light availability and diversity. The effects of nutrient availability on plant community composition (diversity and richness) were due primarily to the responses of prairie species, as the productivity of early successional, nonprairie species was less than 1% of total ANPP after three years of establishment.

Daphnid food and adult trout predators were substantially more abundant in pelagic than in littoral habitats. Age-0 trout used all habitats in populations without adult trout predators, whereas age-0 trout were observed only in the less profitable littoral habitat in populations with adult trout. Consequently, mean fall mass of age-0 trout in the presence of predators was almost half that observed in populations without adult trout. Despite the shift in habitat use, age-0 trout experienced 90% mortality when adult trout predators were present, in comparison to only 36% mortality when absent. We conclude that the commonly observed habitat shifts by fish at risk of predation, observed at smaller scales, do in fact occur at the whole-system scale over long time intervals.

In heterogeneous environments, this variation can occur at multiple spatial scales. We used likelihood-based approaches to examine the strength of evidence in data for models of herbivore functional response to spatial variation in plants. These models represented different hypotheses about plant characteristics controlling intake rate, including biomass, bite mass, plant density, and the composite effects of plant density and bite mass. Models were fit to observations of the food intake rate of elk (Cervus canadensis), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus), domestic rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and lemmings (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus) feeding in plant patches where plant density and plant mass ranged over at least two orders of magnitude. The model representing composite effects of bite mass and plant density had more support in the data than any competing models (Akaike weight for the composite model > 0.999). Maximum-likelihood estimates of parameters in the composite model closely resembled independent, direct estimates, giving credence to the mechanisms represented by the model. The composite model portrayed a distance threshold (d*, in meters) distinguishing mechanisms regulating functional response. When plant spacing exceeded this threshold, intake rate was regulated by plant density. When the plant spacing was less than the threshold, intake rate was controlled by bite mass. Based on earlier work, we show that the threshold d* scales with body mass (M, in kilograms) as 7.1M0.06. This relationship illustrates that: (1) spatial pattern of plants at patch scales may influence intake rate only when plants occur at very low density; (2) herbivores of very different body mass respond to heterogeneity in a remarkably similar fashion; and (3) variation in leaf-scale characteristics controlling bite mass interact with plant spacing at patch scales to influence herbivore functional response.",71,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Bite mass | Foraging | Functional response | Herbivores | Heterogeneous environments | Intake rate | Mammals | Model selection | Patch | Plant spacing,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,52,NA,NA,NA,NA

We report here results of an unusual opportunity to directly investigate the relationships among the size and distribution of colonies of Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), the degree of overlap of colony-specific foraging areas, and the availability of kittiwake prey, principally Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) and sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus), in Prince William Sound, Alaska, 1995-1999. Aerial surveys to assess prevalence of prey schools visible at the surface (the kittiwake mode of prey search) allowed quantification of prey availability in foraging areas. Foraging areas and foraging ranges were determined by radio telemetry. Large colonies occurred as far apart as physically possible and not within foraging range (∼40 km) of one another; only small colonies occurred within the respective ranges of large colonies. Foraging range, foraging trip duration, and area of foraging grounds were related positively to colony size. Down to the finest scale (1.5 nautical miles, or 2.8 km), the presence-absence of foraging kittiwakes was related to where prey schools were likely to occur, rather than there being a direct relationship between densities of kittiwakes and observed prey schools. Annual variation in school density did not alter the relationship between colony size and size of foraging grounds, i.e., more abundant prey did not reduce the size of the foraging ground. Importantly, the quality of foraging grounds (prevalence of fish schools at the surface) decreased with colony size. We conclude that the density of foraging kittiwakes within Prince William Sound has reached a limit: additional birds would compromise access to prey, probably by passive foraging interference. This pattern would explain why overall numbers of breeding kittiwakes in the Sound have remained relatively stable during the past few decades, whereas several colonies have dramatically increased in size and others have decreased or disappeared.",95,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Ammodytes hexapterus | Black-legged Kittiwake | Clupea pallasi | Colonial seabird | Colony geographic structure | Colony size | Foraging density | Foraging range | Interference competition | Pacific herring | Pacific sand lance | Rissa tridactyla,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,56,NA,NA,NA,NA

We investigate the response of MBO emission to water stress, ambient temperature, and the aging of needles in field grown Pinus ponderosa (ponderosa pine). Photosynthetic rates and MBO production capacities of P. ponderosa were measured over the course of a season on saplings at a site that experienced summer drought and at a site that received supplementary water. In addition, a water-stress alleviation experiment was performed in which drought-stressed P. ponderosa seedlings were re-watered at the end of the season and pre-/post-alleviation photosynthetic rates and MBO production capacities were compared. Over the season photosynthesis declined while MBO production capacity tracked changes in ambient temperature linearly both over the entire season and on a day-to-day basis.

These consequences represent extended phenotypes, i.e., the effects of genes at levels higher than the population. Using diverse examples from microbes to vertebrates, we demonstrate that the extended phenotype can be traced from the individuals possessing the trait, to the community, and to ecosystem processes such as leaf litter decomposition and N mineralization. In our development of a community genetics perspective, we focus on intraspecific genetic variation because the extended phenotypes of these genes can be passed from one generation to the next, which provides a mechanism for heritability. In support of this view, common-garden experiments using synthetic crosses of a dominant tree show that their progeny tend to support arthropod communities that resemble those of their parents. We also argue that the combined interactions of extended phenotypes contribute to the among-community variance in the traits of individuals within communities. The genetic factors underlying this among-community variance in trait expression, particularly those involving genetic interactions among species, constitute community heritability. These findings have diverse implications. (1) They provide a genetic framework for understanding community structure and ecosystem processes. The effects of extended phenotypes at these higher levels need not be diffuse; they may be direct or may act in relatively few steps, which enhances our ability to detect and predict their effects. (2) From a conservation perspective, we introduce the concept of the minimum viable interacting population (MVIP), which represents the size of a population needed to maintain genetic diversity at levels required by other interacting species in the community. (3) Genotype x environment interactions in dominant and keystone species can shift extended phenotypes to have unexpected consequences at community and ecosystem levels, an issue that is especially important as it relates to global change. (4) Documenting community heritability justifies a community genetics perspective and is an essential first step in demonstrating community evolution.

However, state variables are often chosen based on convenience or necessity; only rarely are they tested for importance and accuracy when individuals vary. We examined whether matrix projection models, a common choice in population modeling, provide accurate predictions when individuals vary in a population. With both density-dependent and density-independent formulations, we tested whether matrix projection models that used size as a state variable captured the dynamics of populations projected with an individual-based simulation (or i-state configuration model). We varied the initial size distribution of individuals, the degree to which individual growth was size dependent, the tendency for positive correlations in growth through time, and the amount of stochasticity in growth, and we asked what conditions affect the accuracy of matrix models. Stochasticity alone did not compromise the predictions of matrix models; rather, only populations with individual variation generated by strong size-dependent growth and growth correlations were poorly described by matrix models. Otherwise, matrix models captured the trajectories of populations with a fair degree of accuracy.

The susceptibility of these hybrids ranged several orders of magnitude and affected the population dynamics of A. parapopuli across the five years of study. Populations grew exponentially on susceptible hybrids in every year, eventually reaching a mean of ∼140 galls per tree. In contrast, populations fluctuated around low densities (0.01-0.87 galls per tree) on their parental host species. Low gall densities on parental trees resulted in high annual extinction rates (mean = 62%) for mite populations on individual parental trees, in contrast to low annual extinction rates (mean = 7%) for mite populations on hybrid trees. We detected significant differences in gall population growth rates (intrinsic rate of increase, r) among hybrid genotypes across four years of study, ranging from r = 0 to r = 1.5, demonstrating that plant genotype influences a fundamental component of population dynamics. We argue that plant genotype should also impact metapopulation dynamics, because plant genotype affected the number of available colonists and directly affected mite extinction rates.

A multivariate logistic model indicated that, although fire history had the greatest effect on stand susceptibility to spruce beetle outbreak, dominance of neighboring stands by spruce as well as elevation were also important predictors of outbreaks.

Prehistoric shrubland landscapes are hypothesized to have exhibited fine-grained age-patch mosaics in which fire spread was limited by the age and spatial pattern of fuels. In contrast, I hypothesize that fires during extreme weather conditions have been capable of burning through all age classes of the vegetation mosaic. Using the mapped fire history (1911-1995) of Los Padres National Forest, I analyzed burning patterns for hundreds of fires using a geographic information system (GIS). To estimate the degree of age dependency exhibited by the fire regime at different spatial scales, I employed methods of fire frequency analysis (i.e., fitting a generalized Weibull function to fire interval distributions). Statistics were also calculated using a temporal breakpoint of 1950 to assess possible effects of suppression. Results indicated that shrubland fires have frequently burned through young age classes of vegetation, exhibiting a minimal degree of age dependency. Findings were not scale dependent and were consistent for all but one region of the study area. The anomalous region exhibited a more rapid increase in the hazard of burning with fuel age, reflecting a moderately age-dependent fire regime; this difference probably resulted from the fact that the region is somewhat sheltered from extreme fire weather that commonly affects other shrublands. Exposure to extreme fire weather therefore appears to override the sensitivity of a fire regime to fuels characteristics at the landscape scale. Fire suppression has affected characteristics of smaller fires much more than those of larger fires. Since 1950, there has been a decrease in size and an increase in the number of smaller fires. Findings support the claim that fire suppression could offset ecological risks posed by increasingly frequent human-caused fires m specific areas, but with a net decrease in annual burning rate of ∼14% across the landscape. Findings contradict the assertion that, in the absence of fire suppression, large fires would be constrained by more complex age-patch mosaics on the landscape.",137,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,"Chaparral shrublands | Crown fire ecosystem | Disturbance regime | Fire frequency | Landscape mosaic | Los Padres National Forest, California | Suppression",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,63,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using repeated surveys of nymph number we found that the effect of the ants on nymph number varied among sites through time. When total new adult production was examined, however, no such interaction between ants and location was evident. Aggregations displayed strong negative density-dependent adult production. Thus, while in some sites ants had a greater positive effect on nymph survivorship, aggregations at those sites produced proportionately fewer adults because of negative density dependence.

In this paper, we argue that the balance between trees and grasses is, to a large extent, determined by the indirect interactive effects of herbivory and fire. These effects are based on the positive feedback between fuel load (grass biomass) and fire intensity. An increase in the level of grazing leads to reduced fuel load, which makes fire less intense and, thus, less damaging to trees and, consequently, results in an increase in woody vegetation. The system then switches from a state with trees and grasses to a state with solely trees. Similarly, browsers may enhance the effect of fire on trees because they reduce woody biomass, thus indirectly stimulating grass growth. This consequent increase in fuel load results in more intense fire and increased decline of biomass. The system then switches from a state with solely trees to a state with trees and grasses. We maintain that the interaction between fire and herbivory provides a mechanistic explanation for observed discontinuous changes in woody and grass biomass. This is an alternative for the soil degradation mechanism, in which there is a positive feedback between the amount of grass biomass and the amount of water that infiltrates into the soil. The soil degradation mechanism predicts no discontinuous changes, such as bush encroachment, on sandy soils. Such changes, however, are frequently observed. Therefore, the interactive effects of fire and herbivory provide a more plausible explanation for the occurrence of discontinuous changes in savanna ecosystems.",520,Journal,ar,Article,100,12,12,Alternate stable states | Browsing | Bush encroachment | Fire | Grazing | Herbivory | Positive feedback | Savanna | Stability | Tree-grass balance,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,69,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

R. esculenta is a superior larval competitor, and adult females are about three times more fecund than R. lessonae. This suggests that, in the absence of some balancing advantage to R. lessonae, R. esculenta should drive the parental species locally extinct, closely followed by itself. We measured annual survival rates over six years at two widely separated ponds using modern capture-mark-recapture methods to test whether differences in adult survival might contribute to the persistence of the water frog system. We marked 856 adult frogs and recovered 182 at least once. The data did not deviate significantly from the assumptions of the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model at either pond. There were no detectable differences in recapture probabilities between taxa, but females were, overall, less likely to be recaptured. Survival was higher for R. esculenta in all but one year. Therefore, some mechanism other than adult survival must be invoked to explain the persistence of this unusual breeding system. There was considerable year-to-year variation in survival, ranging from 6% over the winter of 1996-1997, to 98% over the winter of 1995-1996.

Pollen movement has primarily been studied as a function of the direct relationships between plants and pollinators; however, nonpollinating floral visitors, such as some nectar robbers, may have indirect effects on pollen dispersal by altering plant - pollinator interactions. Theory predicts that nectar robbing should have indirect positive effects on plants by increasing pollen dispersal distance and reducing self-pollen transfer (geitonogamy) and inbreeding through changes in pollinator behavior associated with reduced nectar rewards. Here I experimentally tested the indirect effects of the nectar-robbing bumble bee, Bombus occidentalis, on the distance of pollen movement among plants and levels of pollen movement within plants (estimated using powdered fluorescent dyes as pollen analogues) using the self-incompatible, hummingbird-pollinated host, Ipomopsis aggregata. Empirical results did not fully support the theoretical predictions. Heavy levels of nectar (>80% of available flowers robbed) had no effect on the mean and mean-squared distance of dye dispersal within populations. However, hummingbird pollinators were 50% more likely to depart from a population after visiting a plant with low robbing relative to a plant with high robbing, suggesting that pollen dispersal among populations might be reduced in plants with high robbing relative to plants with low robbing. Heavy nectar robbing reduced levels of self-dye transfer by one-half. However, when I manipulated robbing levels and access to self-pollen, the costs associated with increased robbing and reduced pollinator visitation (e.g., reduced seed production) outweighed any advantages associated with reduced geitonogamy. Taken together, these results suggest that the negative indirect effects of robbing on plant reproduction through decreased pollinator visitation and changes in pollinator departure from plants far exceed any positive effects associated with decreased geitonogamy.

WLPs were common at Cocha Cashu in the mid-1970s. In 1978, the species vanished from the entire region and did not reappear until 1990. To assess the impacts of the presence-absence of WLPs on Astrocaryum recruitment, we conducted transect counts of both the number and spatial distribution of palm seedlings in 1978 (when WLPs were present), in 1990 (after a 12-yr absence of WLPs), and in 1999 (after 10 yr of recovery). Other factors affecting recruitment, such as climate variability, differences in tree fecundity, and fluctuations of vertebrate and invertebrate seed predators were also examined as alternative hypotheses for any changes in seedling spatial distribution and abundance. In the absence of WLPs, the density of Astrocaryum seedlings increased 1.7-fold, and the spatial distribution of seedlings with respect to safe sites was significantly altered. After the return of WLPs to the study area, seedling density dropped to its former level, and the spatial distribution of seedlings with respect to safe sites returned to the same pattern found 21 yr earlier in 1978. None of the other factors investigated varied systematically with the census intervals. These results demonstrate that the absence of a single, albeit important, member of a diverse seed predator guild can have a major impact on the demography of a common tree species.

Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which species avoid competition for nutrients in nutrient-poor but species-rich communities remain poorly understood. I used a model system, the carnivorous pitcher plant Sarracenia alata, to measure competition for nutrients. In a field competition experiment, I increased the potential for nutrient-niche overlap between established juvenile pitcher plants and their non-carnivorous neighbors by denying a unique source of nutrients (prey) to pitcher plants. Contrary to predictions based on nutrient-niche complementarity, prey exclusion did not reduce the performance of pitcher plants competing with non-carnivorous neighbors. Hence, differences in nutrient-source specialization did not explain the coexistence of Sarracenia alata and its non-carnivorous neighbors in the field. Instead, prey exclusion reduced the positive growth response to increased light following the removal of neighbors. By reducing allocation to pitchers in the presence of neighbors, pitcher plants appeared to reduce their demand for nutrients when shaded. I hypothesize that carnivorous plants avoid competition with non-carnivorous plants by using changes in the light environment to cue adjustments in their demand for nutrients. I suggest that such plasticity is adaptive in any long-lived perennial plant that periodically experiences simultaneous pulses of light and nutrients during its lifetime (e.g., as might occur in fire-prone habitats).",32,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Belowground competition | Dry matter allocation | Niche theory | Nutrient stress | Pitcher plants | Plasticity | Sarracenia alata,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,78,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although many watershed studies have suggested depletion of available calcium (Ca) pools, interpretation of ecosystem Ca mass balance has been limited by the difficulty in obtaining mineral weathering flux estimates. While many studies have suggested that weathering flux is insufficient to maintain available soil pools, measurements of concomitant changes in available soil pools are rare. Here, we critically examined application of the Ca:Na ratio method in interpreting the long-term Ca budget of six northern hardwood watershed ecosystems at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, Woodstock, New Hampshire, USA. Storage of sodium (Na) in biomass and secondary minerals and on cation exchange sites was low enough so that net ecosystem Na loss was essentially equivalent to mineral weathering flux. Mineral chemistry and mass balance considerations constrained the Ca:Na ratio of weathering products to a sufficiently narrow range that spatial and temporal changes in the ecosystem Ca:Na ratio could be interpreted as changes in contribution of available Ca pools to ecosystem loss. Depletion of available Ca pools was greater in the three experimentally manipulated watersheds with aggrading biomass compared to three reference watersheds with relatively mature forest conditions. Although accelerated loss of Ca in the first few years following disturbance has been documented by prior studies, this study suggests that excess Ca loss continues for at least three decades after treatment, with no evident trend toward the conditions shown in the reference watershed. It is not likely that changes in previously quantified Ca pools account for this sustained loss, suggesting that a previously unstudied Ca pool or release mechanism may be important in ecosystem response to disturbance. Possible sources include Ca oxalate, which is known to accumulate in forest soils, but has not been considered in the context of an ecosystem mass balance.",101,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Ca:Na ratio | Calcium cycle | Disturbance | Forest ecosystems | Mineral weathering | Nutrient cycling | Sodium mass balance,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,79,NA,NA,NA,NA

Site fidelity did not differ between sexes, but territory fidelity was higher for males than for females. Mate fidelity, age, and brood parasitism by cowbirds had little effect on site and territory fidelity. Nesting success on Prothonotary Warbler territories was predictable between years, and individuals benefited by returning to territories where two broods were produced or by dispersing from territories where no broods were produced. These results support the decision rules hypothesis and demonstrate a causal relationship whereby individuals use their own reproductive experience at a site to assess the current and potential future quality of the location and then respond accordingly by returning or not returning.

We sampled externally feeding Lepidoptera in mesquite-oak savanna habitats of southeastern Arizona (USA) to assess the ecological and evolutionary determinants of parasitoid community structure. We focused on parasitoids in the family Tachinidae (Diptera) due to their dominance as larval parasitoids of macrolepidoptera at our site.

Characteristics of host habitat and body size had no significant effect on tachinid species richness. Tachinid parasitism rates were higher for abundant, hairy, non-aposematic, and gregarious hosts. Hymenopteran parasitism rates were low and variable with only host family explaining a significant amount of variation.

A module life cycle graph was constructed, including all the possible transitions between four module states: apically growing (G), apically dormant (D), apically arrested (A), and branching (J). Transitions (module level) were translated to the module population growth rate λ. (tree level) and related to the variance in λ among 18 different trees. This variance was also related to light availability (1-60% of ambient PAR) and tree height (5-30 m). Three module life cycle pathways (or loops) were dominant in their contributions to λ: persistent apical dormancy (D→D), biannual apical growth (G→D→G), and biannual branching by dormant modules (J→D→J). This suggests that biannual or even slower module production rates predominate in the module life cycle. The positive covariance between biannual loops seems the result of synchronization in apical and axillary activity. Slow production rates and synchronization allow trees to accumulate carbon, flush massively, and escape from herbivore attacks, and at the same time allow the tree to replace its leaves. The variance in λ (V(λ)) among trees was low.

We show that larval size can have equally important carryover effects in a colonial marine invertebrate. In the bryozoan Bugula neritina, the size of the non-feeding larvae has a prolonged effect on colony performance after metamorphosis. Colonies that came from larger larvae survived better, grew faster, and reproduced sooner or produced more embryos than colonies that came from smaller larvae.

Understanding the relative importance of these two classes of factors in controlling within-patch species richness is particularly important when patches are created via ecosystem engineering. In such cases, factors affecting the population dynamics or behavior of a single species could indirectly affect species richness if richness is controlled primarily by landscape-level factors. We used a combination of experimental mesocosms and field observations to determine whether species richness in beaver wetlands in the Adirondack Mountains (New York) is more strongly controlled by the position of the wetland in the landscape or by within-wetland hydrology. Drainage rate had a significant effect on both richness and composition in mesocosms, with well-drained treatments having significantly higher richness than poorly drained treatments. Seed germinated from the seed bank in sediments collected from different ponds showed relatively small differences in richness or community composition in mesocosms, suggesting a comparatively small effect of dispersal limitation on species richness. Experimental results were mirrored in a survey of 14 meadows over two years, which indicated that variability in water table depth was consistently a significant predictor of species richness, while meadow area and isolation showed little relation to richness. The survey also suggested that the number of years since beaver had abandoned a site was a significant predictor of the number of species found in beaver meadows.

These species came from an arid environment, a subalpine environment, and a temperate coastal environment.

There was no significant relationship between seed mass and survivorship through predispersal seed predation either cross-species or across phylogenetic divergences in any of the vegetation types, or in the compilation of data from the literature.

In particular, the paradigm that shredders of vascular plant litter dominate food web processes may not apply to many wetlands where shredders are rare and microalgae more abundant. This issue is complicated by potential consumption of floes of dissolved organic matter (DOM) released from living plants, and of exopolymer secretions (EPS) from both autotrophic and heterotrophic microbes. In Wyoming, we used gut contents and stable isotopes to investigate organic matter sources for the dominant invertebrates in oligosaline (0.5-5 g/L total dissolved solids) and mesosaline (5-18 g/L) wetlands. We examined the trophic importance of microalgae vs. macrophytes in wetlands with and without emergent vegetation (Scirpus acutus), with different growth forms and species of submersed plants (Chara spp. vs. Potamogeton pectinatus), with dominance by different microalgal types (phytoplankton, epiphyton, epipelon), and with different primary consumers (mainly amphipods vs. chironomid larvae). In all wetlands studied, guts of the major primary consumers contained little or no macrophyte tissue, but rather mostly amorphous detritus (organic particles with no recognizable cellular structure). Values of δ13C indicated that organic matter entering foodwebs was not from submersed macrophytes, but that emergent plants might be a source of DOM or EPS in amorphous detritus. However, in some wetlands, amphipods eating mainly amorphous detritus had the same δ 13C values as chironomids eating a much higher fraction of diatoms, indicating that amorphous detritus was derived mainly from diatoms. Patterns of temporal change of δ13C in consumers, seston, and emergent plants supported this interpretation. We conclude that microalgae rather than macrophytes provided most organic matter for these food webs via amorphous detritus. Amorphous detritus is often thought to have poor nutrient quality and low assimilation efficiency, but this idea may not be true if amorphous detritus is largely floes of labile DOM/EPS. Our results suggest that characterizing the origin and nature of amorphous detritus is key to understanding variations in macroinvertebrate production among saline wetlands and a broad range of wetland types.",45,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Algal forms | Amorphous detritus | Dissolved organic matter | Exopolymer secretions | Invertebrate food webs | Invertebrate gut contents | Macrophytes | Organic matter sources | Saline wetlands | Stable isotopes | Wetland food webs,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,98,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

An untested corollary of this prediction is that diversity within resource patches should decrease with increasing intraspecific aggregation. The recently derived species-aggregation relationship provides a general formulation of this prediction: as intraspecific aggregation increases within a geographic area, the species richness within samples of the area decreases. We tested this prediction by compiling and analyzing 76 data sets of arthropod species distribution and abundance. For each data set, we determined the mean amount of intra- and interspecific aggregation and three types of within-sample or local species diversity: species richness, evenness, and dominance.

We performed a field experiment to investigate how the movement of a delphacid planthopper (Prokelisia crocea) among discrete patches of prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata) is affected by the composition of the matrix (mudflat, native nonhost grasses, and the introduced grass smooth brome [Bromus inermis]). Within each matrix type, marked planthoppers were released onto experimental cordgrass patches that were made identical in size, isolation, and host plant quality. We found that the emigration rate (planthoppers lost per patch per day) was 1.3 times higher for patches embedded in the two nonhost grass matrix types than for patches in mudflat. The rate of immigration (immigrants per patch per day) into patches isolated by 3 m was 5.4 times higher in the brome than in the mudflat matrix. Patches in the native grass matrix had intermediate immigration rates. In addition, a survey of planthopper distributions in nature revealed that both the within- and among-patch distributions of the planthopper were related to the composition of the matrix. Within patches, individuals accumulated against mudflat edges (relative to patch interiors) but not against nonhost grass edges. Among patches, incidence and density increased with the proportion of the matrix composed of open mud. The matrix was equal to that of patch geography (size and isolation) in its ability to explain the distribution of the planthopper. We suggest that the low permeability of the mudflat relative to a nonhost grass edge may explain these planthopper distributional patterns. Also, because natural cordgrass patches in mudflat were richer in nutrients than those in nonhost grasses, planthoppers may have been more likely to remain and build up densities on the former patches.

Our goal was to quantify the reproductive assurance benefit of autonomous selfing and the stochastic nature of pollinator-mediated pollen receipt using three wild populations of the annual species Collinsia verna (Scrophulariaceae) over three years. The timing of autonomous self-pollination in C. verna ranges from competing to delayed, with more than half of the autonomous pollen arriving late in floral life. Floral density, identity of insect floral visitors, and visitation rate varied within and among years, with significant variation in pollinator community between years within populations. Pollinator failure reduced fruit set within and among populations across years. However, reproductive assurance selfing increased fruit set on average by 8% overall and up to 30% in one population. Despite this fitness benefit, fruit set (=Σfruits/Σflowers) estimated in pollinator-exclusion cages was significantly less than the fruit set in paired open-pollinated plots. In a series of experiments, we found no difference in fruit set from self- vs. outcross pollen, ruling out early inbreeding depression. However, flowers, hand-outcrossed at the same time that autonomous selfing naturally occurs, produced significantly more fruits relative to flowers that received pollen only through autonomous selfing. These results suggest that pollen type (self/outcross) is less important to fruiting success than is the timing or efficiency of autonomous pollination relative to vector-mediated pollination.

However, large spatial and temporal variation in natural available food supply is not always paralleled by proportional changes in energy demand by breeding birds. This necessarily results in variation in the supply-demand ratio and the amount of food available per unit mass of nestling. Because reproductive performance should respond to increases in available supply as a saturation curve, reaching a plateau above a certain threshold of food supply, we predict that variation in supply should change the intensity of selection on reproductive traits. We first tested this prediction using long-term data on nestling growth and survival in Blue Tits (Parus caeruleus) breeding over a gradient of habitat richness in Corsica, France. This long-term data analysis evaluates the effect of variation in food supply available to breeding tits using three surrogate variables: interannual variation in peak caterpillar abundance (caterpillar frass fall), offset between breeding date and peak caterpillar abundance, and natural variation in clutch size. We also used an experimental brood size manipulation (±3 chicks) to test the effect of varying brood demand on nestling growth. Results of the long-term data analysis show that all three variables affect fledging mass and fledging success in poor habitats, while only fledging mass is affected by variation in offset in rich habitats. Moreover, mean annual fledging success and fledging mass is strongly affected by annual variation in peak caterpillar abundance at low levels of abundance, but these effects disappear when food becomes abundant (saturation threshold level of 373 and 560 mg frass·m-2·d-1 for fledging success and fledging mass, respectively). Brood size manipulations confirm these results. In rich habitats, breeding birds can raise three extra chicks without any apparent effects on chick growth, while in poor habitats, chick growth is significantly reduced with brood enlargement.

Little, however, is known of how a resource pulse influences community assemblages for periods longer than one growing season. This study, repeated twice and in two different habitats on a mid-Atlantic Spartina alterniflora salt marsh, showed that a one-time nitrogen (N) subsidy can have not only significant within-year effects on plant primary production and herbivore and natural enemy abundance, but can also have long-term effects on plants and arthropod food web structure. Spartina plants exhibited significantly greater biomass for 2-3 yr and elevated percentage of N for up to two years following the nutrient pulse, an effect that had direct positive effects on herbivores that were sensitive to variation in plant N content.

In contrast, wolf spider (Lycosidae) densities were elevated in fertilized plots only within the same season as the initial fertilization pulse.

Nutrient enrichment of these grasslands can have a significant impact on carbon losses through the decomposition process. We investigated the effects of long-term (12-yr) experimentally increased N and/or P supply on litter production and on the chemistry and decomposition of bulk litter from two grasslands differing in soil nutrient status. Potential aboveground litter production in the controls of a P-rich low-productivity riparian grassland was lower than that in a N-rich high-productivity peat grassland and increased with enhanced N supply. Nutrient treatments did not enhance litter production in the high-productivity peat grassland. The concentrations of phenolics in bulk litter from the peat grassland, dominated by sedges, were 2-3 times higher than those in the riparian grassland that was dominated by herbs and grasses. At both sites increased nutrient supply had no detectable effect on phenolics concentrations. All P-related litter chemistry parameters reflected the higher soil P status of the riparian grassland. P fertilization had a greater effect on litter chemistry in the P-deficient peat grassland than in the P-rich riparian grassland. At both sites, there was no change in overall litter chemistry in response to N fertilization, except for higher lignin concentrations in the peat grassland litter. Both short-term (8 wk) litter incubations in the laboratory and a 3-yr litter bag study in the field showed that riparian grassland litter decomposed faster than litter from the peat grassland. The long-term nutrient additions had no significant effects on the decomposition of the bulk litter of each grassland type. Regression analysis on the combined data of the two sites showed that phenolics, and to a lesser extent, P-related litter chemistry parameters, exerted a strong control on both litter respiration and litter mass loss. Our study shows that long-term experimental nutrient additions do not lead to increased decomposition rates in grasslands and that the initial plant community litter quality is the main determinant of carbon losses through the decomposition process. The results of this study suggest that nutrient enrichment will likely affect ecosystem carbon balance more by affecting litter production than by affecting litter decomposition rates.",76,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Carbon sinks | Decomposition | Grasslands | Lignin | Litter chemistry | Nutrient limitation | Polyphenols | Respiration,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,107,NA,NA,NA,NA

These predators typically employ two alternative behavioral strategies for locating resource patches: direct visual or olfactory detection, and indirect detection (local enhancement) by sighting other predators that are already exploiting a patch. We developed a model of direct detection and local enhancement in seabirds that predicts how foraging success varies with behavioral strategy, seabird densities, and prey swarm density and detectability. Application of the model to Black-browed Albatrosses foraging for Antarctic krill near South Georgia suggests that local enhancement is generally a highly effective foraging strategy, and that the fraction of time albatrosses spend in feeding flocks should show strong interactions between prey and conspecific densities. To test these predictions, we analyzed survey data collected near South Georgia in January-March 1986. Our analysis suggests a strong Allee-type density dependence in foraging success that was qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with model predictions.

These models and a third, the dispersion (ideal free) economy model, assumed that kleptoparasites had perfect information regarding the quality of opportunities for kleptoparasitism. The other two models did not make this assumption. These producer-scrounger models assumed that some kleptoparasites (producers) discovered opportunities, while others used producers to reduce the costs of foraging.

We compared typical group size, and the influence of group size on intake rate and the success of kleptoparasitic attempts, with the predictions of these models.

We tested this hypothesis for Ammophila arenaria (Poaceae: European beachgrass), an aggressive plant invading the coastal dunes of California, USA, by comparing the demographic effects of belowground pathogens on A. arenaria in its introduced range to those reported in its native range. European research on A. arenaria in its native range has established that soil-borne pathogens, primarily nematodes and fungi, reduce A. arenaria's growth. In a greenhouse experiment designed to parallel European studies, seeds and 2-wk-old seedlings were planted in sterilized and nonsterilized soil collected from the A. arenaria root zone in its introduced range of California. We assessed the effects of pathogens via soil sterilization on three early performance traits: seed germination, seedling survival, and plant growth. We found that seed germination was reduced by 12-16% in nonsterilized soil compared with sterilized soil; similarly, seedling survival was reduced by 7-13%. Both root and shoot biomass decreased in the nonsterilized soil treatments compared with sterilized soil, by as much as 81% after 6 wk of growth. A comparison of the introduced and native ranges failed to show a demographic release from natural enemies; biomass effects of pathogens after 6 and 12 wk of growth were nearly equal between studies in California and The Netherlands. Identification of pathogens and inoculation experiments with fungi from the nonsterilized soil revealed several common fungal pathogens, whereas virtually no pathogenic nematodes were found. Therefore, we found a partial escape from enemies (i.e., pathogenic nematodes were absent in the introduced range), although there was no demographic release.

While some disturbances may be highly stochastic (e.g., flooding or landslides), other types of disturbance are closely linked to the current successional state of the community (e.g., fire or herbivory). For example, when herbivores preferentially feed on early successional species they may generate conditions favorable for these species and thus create a positive feedback. Positive feedbacks may create multiple stable equilibria within plant communities. We demonstrate the presence of these positive feedbacks using experiments conducted in a restored California grassland. We found that pocket gophers (Thomomys bottae) preferentially forage in areas dominated by annual species, and gopher foraging activity increases the abundance of annual plants. We use a Markov chain model to identify how the foraging behavior, dispersal behavior, and population dynamics of territorial herbivores can structure a plant community across multiple spatial scales. The model is loosely based on the biology of pocket gophers, though it is general enough to be applicable to other territorial herbivores with foraging preferences. We find that a foraging preference for early successional species can generate multiple plant communities that persist within a herbivore's territory. If juveniles are selective when searching for territories during their dispersal phase, then herbivores can also generate persistent and distinct plant communities over larger spatial scales. In this case, fixed regions of the landscape may become occupied by herbivores for long periods (many herbivore generations) and be composed of a range of successional plant species, whereas the remaining landscape is abandoned by herbivores and becomes dominated by late successional species.

In this study, we investigated the genetic structure of a well-documented, invading population of Argentine ants in the Jasper Ridge Biological Preserve in northern California to examine the dispersal distances of reproductives, the direction and mode of population expansion, and changes in the genetic differentiation among nests over time. Using microsatellite data, we measure both traditional FST statistics and multi-locus genotype assignment distances to determine the patterns of genetic structure at three spatial scales: population-wide gene flow, population substructure, and mixing between neighboring nests. At the population level, there was little viscosity across the Jasper Ridge population, suggesting recent rapid expansion and/or considerable long-distance gene flow, presumably mediated by winged males. The pattern of genetic structure across distance indicates that the scale of queen dispersal was limited to less than 100 m. At the level of population substructure, hierarchical F statistics measures were low across subpopulations, locations within subpopulations, and nests. However, multi-locus genotype assignment tests revealed significant structure between subpopulations and between locations. Genetic distances between nests were lower within locations than between locations, indicating that nests are most closely related to neighboring nests and that the expansion of subpopulations is primarily due to the local budding of new nests from existing nests at the invasion front. At the level of nest connectivity, the genetic differentiation among neighboring nests was associated with the time since invasion. As the invasion proceeds, nearby nests tend to be less closely related, indicating that extensive local mixing does not occur among more established nests. Our results show that the genetic structure of nests was not homogenous across unicolonial populations. Instead, the patterns of genetic structure reflect the limitations of and barriers to the dispersal of Argentine ant reproductives, the demographic history of the Jasper Ridge invasion, and changes in the genetic and ecological environment during the course of the invasion.",43,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Argentine ants | Dispersal | Genetic structure | Invasions | Linepithema humile | Micro-satellites | Social structure | Supercolony | Unicoloniality,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,114,NA,NA,NA,NA

We compared results of the response of plant secondary chemistry to changes in environmental conditions against two contrasting hypotheses: (1) the carbon:nutrient balance hypothesis (CNBH) and (2) the photoinhibition hypothesis. Nutrient and light levels affected relative growth rate and leaf area ratio of seedlings. Electron transport rates and optimum photochemical efficiencies indicated different rates of carbon fixation between treatments, consistent with levels of chlorophyll and xanthophyll pigments. Nonphotochemical quenching and xanthophylls per unit chlorophyll were negatively correlated with total chlorophyll content. Consistent with the photoinhibition hypothesis, levels of leaf phenolics (flavonols, hydrolyzable tannins, and sideroxylonals) per unit chlorophyll were also negatively correlated with total chlorophyll content. In contrast, phenolic levels on a dry-mass basis were not consistent with predictions of the CNBH; they were better explained as a response to severity of photoinhibition than by reallocation of resources from growth to defense. Total essential oil and cineole levels were positively correlated with nitrogen levels, but there was an interaction in their response to nutrients and light. Thus, levels of essential oils were not well predicted by the CNBH. Sideroxylonal and cineole levels were not correlated, and we hypothesize that different processes and requirements drive their production. Intake of seedlings by possums and pademelons was not directly negatively correlated with levels of hydrolyzable tannins, sideroxylonals, or essential oils. An interaction of the costs of these compounds against benefits of nitrogen levels may explain patterns in intake. We suggest that, while environmentally induced levels of carbon-based plant secondary metabolites have consequences for herbivory, photoinhibition may drive the adjustment of levels of leaf phenolics in response to variation in light and nutrients.

We examined the effect of fire interval on initial postfire lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm.) density in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) following the 1988 fires. We asked whether postfire propagule abundance, measured as prefire percent serotiny, varied with fire interval and could explain patterns in postfire succession. The response of lodgepole pine density to variation in fire interval was explained by spatial and temporal variation in prefire serotiny. At low elevations, postfire lodgepole pine recruitment correlated strongly with prefire percent serotiny, which varied nonlinearly with prefire stand age. As a result, postfire lodgepole pine densities varied nonlinearly with fire interval. In contrast, at high elevations serotiny was low, varied little with stand age and did not influence postfire lodgepole pine densities, although, fire interval was still a significant predictor of postfire densities. At high elevations, fire interval varied nonlinearly with postfire lodgepole densities, presumably due to the temporal variation in propagule abundance from open cones in adjacent unburned stands. Temporal variation in stand-level serotiny at low elevations was best explained by age of individual trees. Logistic regression indicated that trees expected to be serotinous had a low probability of exhibiting serotiny at a young age, with increasing probability as trees matured up to 140 yr. This increase in serotiny with tree age likely accounts for the initial increase in stand-level percent serotiny with stand age at low elevations. The spatial variation in serotiny was correlated with variation in historical fire regimes. Fire interval models derived from lower elevations in YNP indicate that fire occurred historically at 135-185-yr intervals, whereas at higher elevations fires occurred at 280-310-yr intervals.

In temperate latitudes, interactions with climate, especially temperature, may affect both plants and their animal mutualists. Winter-flowering plants allow assessment of biotic influences on the evolution of flowering time because temperature is unlikely to select directly for this uncommon reproductive behavior. In northwestern Patagonia, the hemiparasitic mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus flowers from early fall, through the cool winter, to late spring. This species is pollinated by the hummingbird Sephanoides galeritus, and its seeds are dispersed by the marsupial Dromiciops australis. In two populations during two years, I analyzed seasonal variation in pollination, fruit production, and fruit removal. Hummingbird visitation was lowest in winter and late spring, and flowers opening during those periods showed reduced pollination and fruit set, partly due to pollinator limitation, compared to flowers that opened during fall or early spring. Fruits that ripened during summer (January-March) had a higher chance of being removed than fruits ripening during either spring or fall, due to their overlap with the period of maximum disperser activity. Timing of flower opening was strongly associated with fruit maturation time and with fruit removal rates. Thus, even though flowers that opened during winter exhibited only moderate fruit production, their fruits benefited from high fruit removal and seed dispersal in mid to late summer. These results suggest that the activity period of this plant's disperser, in combination with a lack of strong pollination constraints, probably governed the evolution of flowering phenology in this mistletoe.

This factor restricted the snakes to west-facing cliff tops, and there only to an optimal subset of rocks that received adequate irradiance.

This nonlinear relationship between parasite loads and body condition was apparently due to indirect costs of reproduction in control woodlots, where there was a direct relationship between male reproductive effort (relative testis size) and parasite loads. This relationship was not found in supplemented woodlots. Most individuals were breeding actively at the end of winter. Males had larger testicles, and females showed an advanced breeding, and probably enhanced survival and larger litter sizes, in supplemented woodlots. Individual mice wintering in Mediterranean fragmented forests are thus food limited, and directed most of the extra provided food resources to reproduction without losing body condition or antiparasite abilities.

To address this problem for three vertebrate species (Northern Bobwhite [Colinus virginianus], Ring-necked Pheasants [Phasianus colchicus], and eastern cottontails [Sylvilagus floridanus]), we examined spatially subdivided, long-term (1966-2001), seasonal (January, April, July, and October), time-series data from the Kansas Rural Mail Carrier Survey, USA. All three species have range boundaries in Kansas, with population abundances declining toward the periphery of their ranges. We quantified the strengths of density-dependent and density-independent processes affecting the dynamics of 10 populations of each species ranging from low (peripheral) to high (central) mean abundance using first-order autoregressive models that incorporate measurement error. For all three species, peripheral populations with lower mean abundance tended to have greater population variability. This pattern could potentially be explained by peripheral regions experiencing either weaker density dependence or greater environmentally driven density-independent fluctuations in per capita population growth rates. In general, density dependence did not vary among geographic regions, although there was a trend for smaller, peripheral populations to exhibit stronger density dependence. Density-independent variability in per capita population growth rates was higher in peripheral populations. Furthermore, density-independent fluctuations in per capita population growth rates were weakly correlated with temperature and precipitation and were highest for the period October through January, identifying fall as the period of greatest environmentally driven variability in population dynamics. Per capita population growth rates fluctuated in moderate synchrony among regions, especially for more abundant, nonperipheral populations in close geographical proximity. The strong density-dependent and stronger density-independent processes in smaller, peripheral populations suggest that the greater variability in peripheral populations' densities is caused by greater population sensitivity to environmental fluctuations. This may make peripheral populations more likely to go extinct and leads to the prediction that, if these species decline to the point of becoming endangered, this decline will be accompanied by a contraction in their geographical ranges.",137,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Autoregressive models | Density dependence | Density independence | Eastern cottontail | Northern Bobwhite | Population variability | Range periphery | Ring-necked Pheasant | State-space model,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,121,NA,NA,NA,NA

At each of the three sites benthic communities were exposed to three different radiation treatments: photosynthetically active radiation alone (PAR; 400-700 nm), PAR+UVA, and PAR+UVA+UVB. Relative to the site with no canopy, UVR was 88% and 66% lower, and PAR was 83% and 49% lower at sites with full and partial canopy, respectively. Late summer increases in UVR to the streambed caused by declines in water level and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were also lower at sites with high canopy. Sites with less canopy shading had greater algal accrual, decreased biomass of total invertebrates, mayflies, and stoneflies, and reduced invertebrate community diversity compared to the heavily shaded reach of the stream. UVR produced taxon-specific community responses that varied across sites and increased with increasing UVR as summer progressed. At the full canopy site UVR had no impact, and the final (day 91) biomass and diversity of invertebrates was highest, and algal biomass lowest. Higher UVA radiation under reduced canopies inhibited algal accrual but had little effect on algal community composition. The biomass of several invertebrate taxa (e.g., Dicosmoecus spp., Limnephilidae) and community diversity were reduced by both UVA and UVB. Less sensitive taxa (e.g., Paraleptophlebia spp., Paraleptophlebidae) were inhibited only by the highest UVB levels in late summer when water transparency to UVR was greatest. Inhibition of grazers by UVR appeared to indirectly increase algal accrual, particularly at the partial canopy site. Our results indicate that riparian shading may moderate UVR effects on benthic communities, mainly through impacts on invertebrates with indirect effects on algae.

In dryland rivers, unpredictable flooding interspersed with low flows and drying drive their ""boom and bust"" ecology. During drying, aquatic habitats contract and fragment. Flooding connects and expands habitats, triggering productivity booms in waterbirds, fish, and plants. Microinvertebrates form the base of the food web and also flourish after floods, but their colonization pathways remain unknown. To determine the relative contribution of floodwater-transported propagules vs. emergence of in situ resting stages from inundated sediments, we studied short-term recruitment of microinvertebrates after flooding in the dryland Darling River, Australia. Lakes open to transported and emerging in situ microinvertebrates were compared with lake and laboratory microcosms closed to transported microinvertebrates. Floods imported most early colonists to floodplain lakes. In situ emergence from sediments was less important until weeks later but potentially sustained production over a longer period of inundation. Some taxa primarily colonized lakes via emergence whereas others were only transported to lakes. A spatially nested ANOVA approach spanning patches within lakes to among reaches revealed contrasting variability across hierarchical scales for taxonomic richness and densities of microinvertebrate taxa. This was most marked at the reach scale, possibly reflecting seasonal patterns in flooding. Microinvertebrate colonization sequences in the Darling River flood-plain rely on connectivity between habitats during flooding. Ecological connectivity was greater at small spatial scales (patches within lakes 100-1000 m, among lakes 104-105 m) than at larger spatial scales (reaches 105-106 m).

Variations in net ecosystem exchange across the region were controlled by differences in the net uptake of CO2 due to photosynthesis, rather than by differences in ecosystem respiration. Daytime CO2 uptake was related mainly to site differences in leaf area index, whereas nighttime CO 2 efflux was related to leaf area index and soil moisture. Temperature had no effect on regional patterns of ecosystem respiration during the growing season. Regional variations in surface conductance were largely explained by the water content of the moss-soil layer. Water vapor and CO 2 fluxes were poorly coupled because water vapor exchange was determined largely by evaporation from mosses, whereas CO2 exchange was controlled by vascular plant activity. This is in contrast to the close correlation between maximum rates of surface conductance and CO2 assimilation that is observed at the global scale. The results also suggest that the relationship between the maximum rates of surface conductance and stomatal conductance in arctic tundra departs markedly from the global pattern, because the moss layer dried more readily than a moist soil.

The environment provided by S. tenacissima (tussock treatment) improved the survival and physiological status of planted P. lentiscus seedlings. The elimination of shade and competition from S. tenacissima significantly decreased and increased, respec-tively, seedling performance as compared to the tussock treatment.

The latter was also important, especially after major rainfall events. In contrast with previous studies, both the water inputs from runoff and the soil chemical fertility were found to have a relatively weak effect in the interaction under study.

Previous field experiments have shown that larvae of Lestes damselfly species segregate along the entire gradient of pond permanence and predator presence and that differential predation risk and life history constraints together shape their distribution. Here, we report laboratory experiments that identify key differences in behavior and physiology among species that structure their distributions along this gradient. The absence of adaptive antipredator behavioral responses against large dragonfly larvae and fish of Lestes dryas, the only species to inhabit predator-free vernal ponds that dry each year, is consistent with its high vulnerability to predation and probably the key trait that excludes it from parts of the gradient with predators. The reciprocal dominance of two other Lestes species in permanent waters dominated by either dragonflies or fish can be explained by the lack of effective antipredator behaviors against dragonflies and fish, respectively. Maximal growth rates did not differ among Lestes along the gradient. However, in the natural predator environment of vernal ponds (only conspecific cannibals), the vernal-pond Lestes had higher growth rates than the other Lestes suggesting that this excludes other Lestes from vernal ponds. Similarly, Lestes species that inhabit temporary ponds (i.e., ponds that dry intermittently every few years but not every year) had a higher growth rate than the fishless permanent-pond Lestes in the presence of the syntopic dragonfly predator. These growth differences among Lestes in predator treatments were not due to differences in food intake, but due to differences in physiology. The vernal-pond Lestes converted more assimilated food into body mass compared to the other Lestes in the presence of conspecific larvae, and the temporary-pond Lestes had a higher conversion efficiency than the fishless permanent-pond Lestes in the presence of the syntopic dragonfly predators. In contrast, reductions in growth rate within species in the presence of syntopic predators were both physiologically and behaviorally mediated.

We explored how these factors affect the distribution and abundance of the exotic crayfishes Orconectes rusticus and O. propinquus and the native O. virilis at both the site-specific and whole-lake scales in northern Wisconsin lakes. During summer 1990, we quantified crayfish, fish predators, and fish diets in cobble and macrophyte sites in Trout Lake, comparing resulting patterns to those in 21 lakes surveyed during summer 1987. Within and across lakes, fish abundance was unrelated to habitat. Within Trout Lake, O. rusticus and O. propinquus were common in both cobble and macrophyte. Orconectes virilis was restricted to macrophyte, probably due to strong displacement by the invaders in cobble. Across lakes, O. rusticus increased where habitat was more than 16.7% cobble, O. propinquus was generally rare, and O. virilis abundance was unrelated to cobble. Crayfish were generally small in cobble and large in macrophyte, perhaps because of habitat-specific, size-selective fish predation or because large crayfish leave cobble when it no longer provides refuge. Orconectes virilis, the largest of three congeners, may have a size refuge in macrophyte but not in cobble. Across lakes, O. rusticus was only abundant when fish biomass was low; O. virilis abundance varied positively with fish. Effects of fish predation and habitat on the ability of invaders Orconectes rusticus and O. propinquus to establish and replace O. virilis appear to be scale dependent. At local (site-specific) scales, cobble likely interacts with selective predation for O. virilis to allow the invaders to establish and replace the native. At the lake-wide scale, high cobble facilitates invaders but predation may curb their successful dispersal and establishment at new sites.

In this study, I investigated the influence of a termite-generated spatial mosaic in resource productivity on the dynamics of competition and coexistence in a guild of four acacia ants that reside on Acacia drepanolobium. Near termite mounds, both new shoot production of A. drepanolobium and densities of litter-dwelling invertebrates (an important food source of the acacia ants) are higher than in ""matrix"" habitats between mounds. This resource variation is spatially correlated with the outcome of competition among acacia ants for host trees; near the mounds, competitively dominant species are more likely to supplant subordinates, whereas the likelihood of subordinates replacing dominants on host trees increases with distance from mounds. Variation in competitive outcomes among patch types appears to result from.differential responses among acacia ant species to resource heterogeneity. Analysis of average tissue δ 15N levels indicated that acacia ant colonies near termite mounds had higher ratios of animal prey in their diets than colonies in matrix areas. Bait trials and analysis of average nest size in mound and matrix habitats suggest that competitively dominant species are disproportionately successful in exploiting higher prey densities near termite mounds. Increased dietary uptake of nitrogen-rich prey may fuel more rapid colony growth in competitively dominant acacia ants, resulting in more pronounced asymmetries in colony size between dominant and subordinate species in mound areas. Because colony size asymmetry is a key determinant of interspecific competitive outcomes, colonies of subordinate species near termite mounds may be more vulnerable to aggressive take-overs by dominants. In lower-productivity matrix habitats, increased tolerance to low-resource conditions may afford subordinate species greater persistence.

Here we report how these same two herbivores, the mesophyll-feeding scale insect Matsucoccus acalyptus and the stem-boring moth Dioryctria albovittella alter litter quality, dynamics, and decomposition in this ecosystem. We measured aboveground litterfall, litter chemical composition, and first-year litter decomposition rates for trees resistant and susceptible to both herbivores and for susceptible trees from which herbivores had been experimentally removed for 16-18 years. Both herbivores significantly increased nitrogen concentration and decreased lignin:nitrogen and carbon:nitrogen ratios of aboveground litter. Herbivory by scale insects also increased litter phosphorus concentration and annual needle litterfall mass. Consistent with its increased chemical quality, litter from herbivore-susceptible trees decomposed more rapidly in the first year. These results suggest that herbivory may increase nutrient cycling rates in this system by altering the chemical quality of litter, a mechanism that augments the nutrient acceleration hypothesis. The distribution of trees resistant and susceptible to the two herbivores at our site, and their associated variation in litter quality and decomposition, likely creates a mosaic of litter quality and nutrient cycling rates at the landscape scale.

As a result, defense mechanisms may evolve to prevent overexploitation by both partners. Selection for the evolution of defenses intrinsic to the interaction may be unnecessary, however, under particular ecological conditions. I examined the interaction between the pollinating yucca moth Tegeticula cassandra and its host plant Yucca filamentosa to determine whether extrinsic factors are important in promoting stability in this mutualism. Yuccas can selectively abscise fruit with high egg loads for moth species that damage ovules during oviposition into the locule. Female T. cassandra, however, lay eggs less than a millimeter beneath the tissue surface and fail to damage ovules, circumventing this mechanism of selective abscission. Consequently, yuccas are unable to regulate egg loads by T. cassandra, and moths are free to lay many eggs. Despite this, only 5-11% of T. cassandra eggs survive to exit the fruit as mature larvae. I tested the hypothesis that T. cassandra survivorship is regulated by the extrinsic factors dehydration and predation. While exclusion of potential predators seemed to have no effect on survivorship, moth eggs in flowers with experimentally increased vapor pressure had significantly greater survivorship compared to controls. Survivorship of a closely related locule-ovipositing species was unaffected by either predator exclusion or changes in vapor pressure.

In this paper, we model the effect of size-dependent shifts in competitive ability on the coexistence of canopy-forming and understory coral species, and we predict how these shifts influence patterns of community structure along large-scale gradients in disturbance and recruitment limitation. We consider three models, representing a gradient from purely hierarchical competition in which the canopy-former is dominant, to competition involving standoffs and reversals between the understory species and juvenile canopy-formers. Analysis of these models leads to two key conclusions. First, as competition becomes less transitive, coexistence may be promoted or inhibited, depending upon the extent to which the canopy-former can sustain itself by clonal propagation. Specifically, when clonal growth alone is adequate to sustain the canopy-former, increasing nontransitivity promotes coex. istence. When it is not, nontransitivity inhibits coexistence. Secondly, size-dependent non-transitivity dramatically changes how gradients in disturbance and recruitment affect species coexistence. In contrast to hierarchical interactions, standoffs and reversals do not show an ""intermediate recruitment"" phenomenon, in which coexistence is facilitated at intermediate levels of recruitment. Moreover, under hierarchical competition, the dominant always benefits more than the subordinate as recruitment is increasingly facilitated. Under standoffs and reversals, however, increasing recruitment often favors the canopy-former at some levels of disturbance, but the understory species at other levels of disturbance.

The relationships among morphology, water flow, and photosynthesis were examined for five algal species representing three functional forms of marine macroalgae at Santa Catalina Island, California, USA. The relationship between surface area/volume ratio (SA/V) and rates of biomass-specific net photosynthesis (NP) across functional-form groups was examined to test the hypothesis that NP is related positively to SA/V. The rate of NP increased with increasing SA/V across functional groups. This relationship then was examined within a functional group for two species, Dictyopteris undulata and Zonaria farlowii, which are morphologically variable among sites. Flow measurements and morphometric analysis of thalli of D. undulata and Z. farlowii at two wave-exposed and two wave-protected sites indicated that intraspecific morphological variation corresponded to variation in wave exposure. A field experiment that manipulated rates of flow in situ resulted in morphological changes in D. undulata and Z. farlowii, indicating that water motion was responsible for the observed morphological plasticity. To examine the interaction between morphology and water flow on algal physiology, NP was estimated for morphotypes of D. undulata and Z. farlowii from wave-exposed and wave-protected sites. At saturating photon flux densities, NP was affected significantly by flow speed, particularly for morphotypes from the wave-protected site. For these morphotypes, increased flow speeds resulted in sustained, then decreased NP as flow speeds exceeded 17 cm/s, suggesting that water flow may affect NP at low flow speeds by mitigating mass transfer limitation and at high flow speeds by changing light interception and flow within the compacted thallus. The plasticity of morphologies and the interaction of these morphotypes with flow may represent a trade-off between maximizing NP and reducing the susceptibility of the thallus to mechanical damage and/or dislodgement by hydrodynamic forces.",71,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Algae | Dictyopteris undulata | Flow | Functional form | Marine macroalgae | Morphology | Photosynthesis | Plasticity | Zonaria farlowii,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,134,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using 15 years of data on the abundances of songbirds at four replicate forest sites in New Hampshire, USA, we addressed two main questions: (1) Are forest bird populations synchronous at the scale measured (tens of kilometers), and if so, (2) what environmental factors are responsible for the synchrony? Nine of the 10 bird species we examined exhibited significant spatial synchrony across the four sites. Within nesting and foraging species groups, tree nesters and foliage gleaners exhibited the highest spatial synchrony. Long-distance (Neotropical) migrants exhibited higher spatial synchrony than did short-distance migrants or year-round residents. Synchrony within and among six species of long-distance, migratory, insectivorous birds was correlated with synchronous fluctuations in the abundance of lepidopteran larvae, a primary food type during the breeding season, which in turn have been shown to be influenced by El Niño/La Niña global climate patterns. Abundances of year-round resident species were related to another large-scale climatic phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation. Winter weather can have both direct (e.g., via temperature-mediated mortality) and indirect (e.g., via winter food availability) effects on year-round resident species. We do not believe that predation on adults or nests accounted for the observed synchrony. Dispersal among regional populations in this system may have played a role but is likely a product of the influence of regionally synchronous caterpillar fluctuations on bird reproduction. Long-term regional population trends may have contributed to the observed synchrony for some species, but we do not consider these trends to be primary factors.

Ecologists routinely conduct experiments where the data from each replicate are short time series of estimated population abundances structured by stage, species, and/ or other information, and the conventional test for treatment effects uses a general linear model (GLM) such as analysis of variance (ANOVA). However, GLMs do not incorporate demographic relationships between abundances through time. An alternative is to use population-dynamics models as frameworks for statistical hypothesis testing. This approach requires general methods for fitting structured population models that can incorporate both process noise (stochastic dynamics) and observation error (inaccurate data). This paper presents such methods and compares them to GLMs for testing population-dynamics hypotheses from experiments. The methods are Monte Carlo state-space likelihood methods, including a basic Monte Carlo integration method and a recently developed Monte Carlo kernel likelihood method. Three simulated examples of population-dynamics experiments were used to compare analysis with a population model to ANOVA, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and repeated-measures ANOVA. The examples considered manipulations of host-plant growth conditions, causing decreased survival and increased fecundity; predator addition to investigate a behaviorally mediated change in prey demography; and changed host-plant growth conditions with a more complex model for herbivore dynamics than the one used for analysis. For the first example, a population model gave much higher statistical power than any of the ANOVA methods and provides greater biological insight. For the second example, ANOVA models are not suited to test for the behavioral effect, but a population model detected it with high statistical power. The third example suggests that even incorrect biological structure can provide better inferences than omitting all biological structure. The likelihood methods presented here make analysis with structured population models feasible for a wide range of models incorporating process noise and observation error, thus offering higher statistical power and greater biological insight for population-dynamics experiments.",59,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,"Kernel density estimation | Measurement error | Monte Carlo maximum likelihood | Population dynamics | Population model fitting | Process error | Stage-structured demography | State-space model, nonlinear | Statistical power",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,137,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite the existence of several alternative hypotheses, constraints imposed by nutrients are often assumed to explain the function of food mixing by omnivores and herbivores. However, few studies have actually addressed this issue through rigorous tests of multiple hypotheses.

The body of evidence supports lower (but nonzero) parasite virulence to vectors than to plant or invertebrate hosts, but not to vertebrate hosts. We consider why this might be by assessing evolutionarily stable strategies for an insect parasite that can infect both predator and prey (or vector and definitive host) and can have distinct virulences in these two potential hosts. In a homogeneous environment, the parasite is predicted to be equally virulent to predator and prey. However, in a patchy environment it is predicted to become benign toward the more mobile of the two potential hosts, provided interpatch movement of free parasites is low and competitive displacement among strains in a patch is weak.

In eight 12-ha experimental landscapes, we examined how corridors affect the impact of invertebrate, rodent, and avian seed predators on pokeweed, Phytolacca americana. Over 13 months in 2000 and 2001, we quantified the effects of patch shape, connectivity, and predator type on the number of seeds germinating in the field (germinants), seed removal, and the viability of remaining seeds. Corridors did not affect the number of P. americana germinants in experimental exclosures or the viability of seeds remaining in exclosures. However, corridors affected the removal of seeds in a predator-specific manner: invertebrates removed more seeds in unconnected patches, whereas rodents removed more seeds in connected patches. Seed removal by birds was similar in connected and unconnected patches. Total seed removal by all seed predators was not affected by corridors, because invertebrates removed more seeds where rodents removed fewer seeds, and vice versa. Overall, seed predation significantly reduced the number and viability of remaining seeds, and reduced the number of germinants in 2000 but not in 2001. The abundance of naturally occurring P. americana plants in our experimental patches in 2000 decreased with increasing seed removal from exclosures but was not related to viability or germinants in 2000, suggesting that seed removal may shape the distribution and abundance of this species. Complementary patterns of seed removal by rodents and invertebrates suggest that corridors alter the effects of these predator taxa by changing the relative amounts of edge and core (nonedge) habitats in a patch.

Our objective was to model inputs to the eggs from stored reserves and from local food plants in Greater Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica) breeding in the high Arctic, using a new approach based on stable-isotope signatures. Snow Geese and their eggs were collected during laying from 1999 to 2001 (N = 66 females and 110 eggs). We analyzed the isotopic signature (δ13C and δ15N) of egg constituents (lipid-free yolk, yolk lipid, and albumen), goose tissues (lipid-free breast muscles, abdominal fat, and whole liver) and of the food plants eaten by laying geese in the Arctic (graminoids and forbs). We applied a two-isotope mixing model approach to delineate nutrient input to eggs quantitatively. Differences in the isotopic signature of endogenous reserves and arctic food plants were relatively large (5.3-8.0‰ for Δδ13C and 7.5‰ for Δδ15N) because reserves were accumulated in southern staging areas where geese feed in farmlands and estuarine habitats. The percentage of egg nutrients derived from exogenous sources (food consumed in the Arctic) was higher than from endogenous (body) reserves and varied little among the three years. Isotopic signatures indicated that endogenous reserves contributed 33% of lipid-free yolk nutrients, 27% of albumen, and 20% of yolk lipid, on average. Isotopic signatures of egg constituents of individual females were more strongly related to those of liver than endogenous sources (breast muscles or abdominal fat), indicating that the endogenous isotopic signature was diluted by a dietary input in the liver. We also found evidence of seasonal variation in the use of endogenous reserves. Late-laying females apparently invested proportionally more endogenous reserves in their eggs than did early layers, but not those laying larger clutches. We conclude that Greater Snow Geese use a mixed capital/ income breeding strategy.

Because earlier studies have shown that variability is selectively disadvantageous for long-lived iteroparous species, fitness components whose variation has greatest impact on the population growth rate are expected to be canalized against temporal variability. We present here a test for such a canalization of fitness components most influential for population growth. If canalization occurs, (1) within a given population the variance of canalized fitness components should be less than that of noncanalized components, and (2) among populations an inverse relationship should occur between the potential demographic impact of fitness components and their temporal variability. We tested these hypotheses using data on age-dependent survival of ungulates. As expected for long-lived vertebrates, elasticities and sensitivities of adult survival were consistently higher than for juvenile survival. In support of the canalization hypothesis, the variance of juvenile survival with low potential demographic impact on fitness was consistently higher than the variance of adult survival with high potential demographic impact on fitness, in all of 22 ungulate populations for which long-term demographic monitoring data were available. However, a negative covariation between potential impact on fitness and temporal variation could also be accounted for by alternative hypotheses, the lower resistance of growing individuals to environmental ""insults,"" or reduced adult phenotypic variability due to selective mortality of juveniles. To differentiate between canalization of adult survival and frailty/selective mortality of juveniles, we included five populations of small mammals. We then found a negative relationship between the relative potential impact of age-dependent survival on fitness and the relative variability of age-dependent survival, especially for populations faced with high environmental variation. This remained true after correcting for differences in mean survival of juveniles and adults and was independent of phylogeny. Although more data are required to extend the hypothesis to other taxonomic groups, we conclude that available data support the idea that adult survival of ungulates is canalized against temporal variation. Therefore, contrasted responses of juvenile and prime-age survival to environmental variation in ungulates may be adaptive and could be viewed as a bet-hedging strategy.",401,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Bet-hedging | Canalization | Elasticity | Fitness components | Life history | Sensitivity | Stochastic environment,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,147,NA,NA,NA,NA

An earlier cessation of breeding in the younger females suggests an age-specific trade-off of summer reproduction and winter survival for parous females. Inter- and intraspecific competition seemed to work additively on the year-born females through direct interference. By selectively reducing survival of younger breeders, interspecific competition could influence age distribution and population growth of breeders toward the end of the breeding season. Because old, over-wintered females are not surviving to the next nonbreeding season, the lower survival of young breeders through interspecific competition might impact greatly the structure of the breeding population at the start of the next breeding season, thus altering population growth patterns.",17,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Age structured populations | Bank voles | Bimodal age distribution | Clethrionomys glareolus | Competition | Life history | Microtine rodents | Senescence,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,148,NA,NA,NA,NA

For this purpose we developed a new approach that allowed us to quantify the performance of defoliated plants relative not only to the performance of undamaged plants, but also relative to the estimated performance of hypothetical defoliated plants that do not exhibit any mechanisms of compensatory growth. The latter provides a way to quantify the adaptive value of compensation with reference to a hypothetical noncompensating alternative state. C. elegans plants were grown in a greenhouse at two light levels (5% and 16% of natural daylight) and subjected to five defoliation treatments (a control and four levels of defoliation). Defoliation was repeated every three months. Growth analysis revealed that defoliated plants allocated considerably more mass to the production of leaf laminas (flam) than control plants, at the expense of allocation to other organs, particularly reproductive structures. Average growth rates per unit leaf area (NAR) and per unit plant mass (RGR), both measured on the basis of above-ground mass, increased with the level of defoliation at high light but not at low light. We estimated that the increases in flam and NAR enabled C. elegans to compensate for part of the potential loss in performance caused by defoliation, even in cases where their RGR values were lower than those of control plants. Sensitivity analysis indicated that changes in NAR contributed more to this compensation than f lam, but the importance offlam increased with defoliation level and with decreasing light availability. The degree of compensation was higher in the high- than in the low-light treatment, suggesting that the possession of traits associated with compensatory growth may be more important in sunny than in shaded environments. The degree of compensation differed depending on the measure of performance. Defoliated plants fully compensated for the potential reduction in lamina growth but compensated for <20% of estimated loss in reproductive output. Since survival of C. elegans plants appears to be strongly associated with their total leaf area, the greater compensation for lamina growth is important in relation to population dynamics.",81,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Biomass allocation | Chamaedorea elegans | Compensatory growth | Defoliation | Growth analysis | Herbivory | Non-timber forest products | Reproductive allocation | Specific leaf area | Tropical rain forest,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,151,NA,NA,NA,NA

During a seven-year study, we gathered information on natal dispersal of 751 individuals and on 24 explanatory variables that evaluated individual traits, conspecific cues in terms of colony size, and different ecological and populational features. We examined separately whether or not individuals changed colonies and how far they moved. Dispersal from the natal colony was high (83%), and dispersers covered a median distance of 7225 m (range 112-136 500 m). The probability of natal dispersal decreased with the size of the natal colony and with the distance to the nearest colony, but not with the distance to unoccupied buildings, in the year of recruitment. Moreover, the shorter the distance to the nearest colony, the shorter the distances that individuals dispersed, particularly to large colonies (>10 pairs). These results support the conspecific attraction hypothesis. Accordingly, the probability of recruiting in the natal colony increased with the proportion of philopatric adults, although beyond a threshold individuals were prevented from recruiting by the more dominant adults in a despotic way. The timing of arrival from the wintering grounds was positively related to the probability of colony change, especially in males. To the extent that this variable is related to the phenotypic quality of individuals, it reinforces the idea that natal dispersal is shaped by intraspecific competition in crowded colonies. Males showed lower frequencies of colony change and dispersed shorter distances than did females, as explained by the different role of the sexes in nest acquisition and defense.

These relationships, however, are difficult to interpret because of confounding factors that may independently determine the abundance of vertebrates and their resources. Moreover, verifying links between vertebrate and resource abundance is complex because human perception of resource abundance may differ from that of nonhuman vertebrates and because manipulating resource abundance on an ecologically meaningful scale is difficult. We studied the dependency of frugivores on fruit abundance in eastern Amazonian floodplain forests dominated by one species of palm tree (Euterpe oleracea) from which people harvest fruit. We first compared spatial and temporal use by frugivorous parrots of four sites dominated by E. oleracea and four sites with no E. oleracea. Parrots spent 48-92% more time in the former, where their activity over the fruiting season mirrored the abundance of fruits. To test whether fruit abundance was the mechanism underlying these patterns, we removed fruit at two intensities in replicated 1.8-ha plots, and then monitored responses of frugivorous birds and mammals. High-intensity removal (75% of ripe fruit harvested) significantly reduced the number of frugivorous bird individuals by 29% and the length of frugivorous bird visits by 68%, relative to controls. In contrast, low-intensity removal (41% of ripe fruit removed) had no impact on these metrics. Frugivore species richness did not differ among treatments and controls, but the composition of the frugivore community was altered by harvest, with the presence of 11 species being linked to fruit abundance. Nonfrugivorous birds did not respond to either intensity of fruit harvest. The number of fruit-eating mammal species was 58% lower in both the low- and high-removal treatments, relative to control plots. These results verify that fruit abundance influences the species composition of frugivore communities and the abundance and foraging behavior of individual species. They also document short-term dependency of fruit-eating mammals on fruit abundance.

However, an extensive literature suggests that contemporary climate constrains terrestrial taxonomic richness over broad geographic extents. Here, we review the empirical literature to examine the nature and form of the relationship between climate and richness. Our goals were to document the support for the climatically based energy hypothesis, and within the constraints imposed by correlative analyses, to evaluate two versions of the hypothesis: the productivity and ambient energy hypotheses. Focusing on studies extending over 800 km, we found that measures of energy, water, or water-energy balance explain spatial variation in richness better than other climatic and non-climatic variables in 82 of 85 cases. Even when considered individually and in isolation, water/ energy variables explain on average over 60% of the variation in the richness of a wide range of plant and animal groups. Further, water variables usually represent the strongest predictors in the tropics, subtropics, and warm temperate zones, whereas energy variables (for animals) or water-energy variables (for plants) dominate in high latitudes. We conclude that the interaction between water and energy, either directly or indirectly (via plant productivity), provides a strong explanation for globally extensive plant and animal diversity gradients, but for animals there also is a latitudinal shift in the relative importance of ambient energy vs. water moving from the poles to the equator. Although contemporary climate is not the only factor influencing species richness and may not explain the diversity pattern for all taxonomic groups, it is clear that understanding water-energy dynamics is critical to future biodiversity research.

In order to better understand the potential role of hemiparasites in these processes, a comparison of leaf and litter tissue quality, nitrogen (N) resorption, and decomposability with those of a wide range of other plant groups (involving a total of 72 species and including other groups with access to alternative nutrient sources, such as nitrogen fixers and carnivorous plants) was undertaken in several sub-arctic habitats. The foliar N concentration of hemiparasites generally exceeded that of co-occurring species. Further, hemiparasites (and N fixers) exhibited lower N resorption efficiencies than their counterparts with no major alternative N source. As a consequence, annual and perennial hemiparasite litter contained, on average, 3.1% and 1.9% N, respectively, compared with 0.77-1.1% for groups without a major alternative N source. Hemiparasite litter lost significantly more mass during decomposition than many, but not all, co-occurring species. These results were combined with those of a litter trapping experiment to assess the potential impact of hemiparasites on nutrient cycling. The common sub-arctic hemiparasite Bartsia alpina was estimated to increase the total annual N input from litter to the soil by ∼42% within 5 cm of its stems, and by ∼53% across a site with a Bartsia alpina stem density of 43 stems/m2. Our results therefore provide clear evidence in favor of a novel mechanism by which hemiparasites (in parallel with N-fixing species) may influence ecosystems in which they occur.

Marine iguana foraging patterns are closely linked to the tidal cycle, and they feed exclusively on macroalgae. The Galápagos Islands are characterized by seasonal currents that impact water temperature and ultimately algal abundance, which is known to affect iguana body condition and survival. In our study, marine iguanas preferred Gelidium sp., which had the highest nutritional quality (nitrogen content, carbon content, and C:N ratio) of the three species of macroalgae on which they feed. Nutritional quality in Gelidium changed predictably with increasing sea surface temperature, peaking around the median iguana copulation date. Similarly, foraging behavior changed around the time copulations began. To test if consistent relationships existed among food quality, water temperature, and breeding life history, we used seven years of data from this population and found that breeding occurred earlier in years when the mean December sea surface temperature was warmer. Although iguanas might cue directly on changes in sea surface temperature, given the frequency and intensity of El Niño events in the Galápagos, this hypothesis is unlikely. Rather, our results suggest that marine iguanas may use subtle changes in food quality (particularly energy content) associated with seasonal, but annually variable, changes in water temperature as a cue to initiate breeding.

We experimentally evaluated these effects using the nonrewarding bumblebee-pollinated orchid Anacamptis morio and associated nectar-producing plants at a site in Sweden. Pollination success (estimated as pollen receipt and pollen removal) in A. morio was significantly greater for individuals translocated to patches of nectar-producing plants (Geum rivale and Allium schoenoprasum) than for individuals placed outside (∼20 m away) such patches. These results provide support for the existence of a facilitative magnet species effect in the interaction between certain nectar plants and A. morio. To determine the spatial scale of these interactions, we correlated the visitation rate to flowers of A. morio with the density of sympatric nectar plants in 1-m 2 and 100-m2 plots centered around groups of translocated plants, and at the level of whole meadows (∼0.5-2 ha). Visitation rate to flowers of A. morio was not correlated with the 1-m2 patch density of G. rivale and A. schoenoprasum, but showed a significant positive relationship with density of these nectar plants in 100-m2 plots. In addition, visitation to flowers of A. morio was strongly and positively related to the density of A. schoenoprasum at the level of the meadow. Choice experiments showed that bees foraging on the purple flowers of A. schoenoprasum (a particularly effective magnet species) visit the purple flowers of A. morio more readily (47.6% of choices) than bees foraging on the yellow flowers of Lotus corniculatus (17% of choices). Overall similarity in flower color and shape may increase the probability that a pollinator will temporarily shift from a nectar-producing ""magnet"" plant to a nonrewarding plant.

A prerequisite for this evolutionary scenario is initial coexistence (on the same or different trophic levels) of the consumers subsequently involved in omnivory. Evolution of omnivory should also be favored by prior asymmetries in consumer interactions. I use a dynamic model to explore conditions for coexistence of two consumers depending on a single biotic resource in simple food webs of increasing asymmetry between consumers: (1) pure resource competition, (2) resource competition with unidirectional interference, (3) omnivory, and (4) pure predation. If consumers are energy limited, omnivory is unlikely to evolve from a competitive system, because stable coexistence of two consumers on a single resource is impossible, even if there is a trade-off between resource exploitation and interference abilities. Initial coexistence of two consumers is easier to achieve, if the species are arranged in a food chain. If costs of diet generalization are low, selection should then favor the inclusion of the resource in the top consumer's diet. In systems with high resource carrying capacity, the intermediate consumer will then, however, be frequently driven to extinction - in which case omnivory is not maintained. Low nutritional quality of the resource can stabilize the omnivory system and allow three-species coexistence at high resource carrying capacities. Low nutritional quality of the resource may also create conditions for the evolution of omnivory from a competitive system. If the content of an essential nutrient in resource biomass is dynamic, stable coexistence of two competitors becomes possible if both are limited by the nutrient content of the resource. In this case, selection may favor the evolution of omnivory, because competitor biomass is usually of higher nutritional quality than resource biomass.

These patterns may be explained by indirect facilitation. Indirect facilitation has been mainly explored using models, and too few experimental studies have been conducted to understand the conditions under which it is likely to occur. We test here the indirect facilitation model in natural openings of subalpine forests and explore the relationship that may exist between species response to indirect interactions and life-history traits of target seedlings. Two evergreen conifers (Picea abies and Abies alba) and two deciduous broad-leaved angiosperms (Fagus sylvatica and Acer pseudoplatanus) that dominate the mixed mesic forests of the northern external French Alps were planted in a tall forb community invading natural forest openings. Seedlings were grown for three growing seasons, with and without competing forbs, and with and without a 50% shade cloth, simulating the relatively open canopy of the surrounding forests. The direct effects of shade were negative for all four species, but the conifers were much more negatively affected by shade than the angiosperms. Shade strongly reduced aboveground biomass of competing forbs, which improved the availability of nitrogen for the tree seedlings. However, because the indirect positive effect of competition release was outweighed by the direct negative effect of light reduction, the net effect was negative for all four species. Species' responses to the indirect effects of shade were correlated with species traits; additional competition was the highest for the most conservative and shade-intolerant species, Picea, and the lowest for the most nutrient-demanding and shade-tolerant species, Acer.

Because of logistical difficulties, we actually know little about the sizes and shapes of zones of influence belowground. Here we advocate obtaining data on plants' belowground zones of influence, including the length and distribution of lateral roots, in order to understand better how plants respond to their abiotic soil environment and to other plants. We provide several examples from recent work. First, we present an analysis of a large global data set which shows that maximum lateral root spread correlates with canopy size but that, for a given canopy size, maximum lateral root spread is greater in and environments and in coarse textured soils. Second, we use an experiment with the weedy annual Abutilon theophrasti to show how using nutrient analogs as tracers yields information about lateral root distributions within populations. In our experimental populations, the belowground zone of influence extended well beyond the closest neighboring plants. Overlap in zones of influence increased in nutrient patches. Third, we propose a new conceptual model of belowground zones of influence based on these and other data sets. The model assumes that the probability of resource uptake or competing with a particular neighbor declines with distance from the stem but that considerable uptake at great distances from the stem is still possible. It also allows for plasticity in root distributions as might occur in spatially heterogeneous soils.

Based on short-term experiments and analyses of the dynamics of nonstructured models, trait-mediated indirect effects resulting from flexible behavior have been suggested to have major effects on population and community dynamics. We use physiologically structured population models (PSPMs) to account for and assess the importance of flexible behavior in population models where individuals differ substantially in size. We investigate a consumer-resource system in which a size-structured consumer feeds on two resources that are present in two habitats differing in predation risk (pelagic open water vs. littoral vegetation). We compare two flexible rules that individuals might use to trade off foraging gains and size-dependent mortality risks in the two habitats. One rule maximizes the ratio of growth over mortality, and the other optimizes the expected instantaneous biomass increase. As a result of strong population feedback, the dynamics and habitat use are qualitatively the same for both rules when open-water mortalities are low, and indeed differ little from a case in which individuals use the two habitats in a fixed proportion. At higher open-water mortalities, the consumers using the two flexible rules show high-amplitude population cycles, whereas consumers using a fixed rule cannot persist. Overall, our results suggest that the behavioral rule used by individuals may be of minor importance, whereas the population feedback is of major importance. In nonstructured models, increased persistence induced by flexible behavior co-occurs with destabilization, as we find here, but the mechanisms behind this pattern are different, driven by cohort cycles rather than by the paradox of enrichment. We argue that extrapolating from experimental data which describe short-term experiments may overemphasize or misrepresent the long-term, population-level effects of flexible behavior.

Typically, model predictions are extremely sensitive to estimated parameters, resulting in risk estimates that are very imprecise. Therefore, careful consideration of uncertainty is warranted when reporting PVA predictions. Here, we survey some simple and general simulation-based methods for assessing the uncertainty in model-based forecasts. We then illustrate how these methods can be used for incorporating parameter uncertainty when reporting estimates of extinction risk, using a PVA model developed from data on Pacific Chinook salmon stocks. Several researchers have suggested that relative assessments between management options will be more stable than estimates of extinction risk and population growth rate. We illustrate how the uncertainty in relative assessments can be quantified in a rigorous way. Finally, we show how Sobol' indices can be used to ask: ""Where is the uncertainty coming from?""

Although documented thoroughly under captive conditions, CG has rarely been studied in wild populations. In their first years of life, oceanic-stage loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) have relatively little control over their geographic position or movements and thus have an extremely stochastic lifestyle with great variation in food availability and temperature. This environmental variation results in variable growth rates. We evaluate somatic growth functions of oceanic-stage loggerheads from the eastern Atlantic based on skeletochronology that allowed us to assign age and cohort to each individual. We demonstrate CG in these turtles based on three different analytical approaches: changes in coefficients of variation in size-at-age, generalized additive model regression analyses of somatic growth, and linear regression of age-specific growth rates. As a result of CG, variation in size-at-age in these juvenile loggerheads is substantially reduced. Thus, size is a better predictor of age than expected based on variation in growth rates. CG decreases with age, apparently as loggerheads gain greater control over their movements. In addition, we have evaluated for the first time in wild sea turtles the time-dependent nature of somatic growth by distinguishing among age, year, and cohort effects using a mixed longitudinal sampling design with assigned-age individuals.

Recently developed multistrata capture-recapture models allow the estimation of dispersal probabilities from the analysis of recaptures or recoveries of marked individuals. Despite their undoubted efficiency at estimating dispersal rates, their contribution to the investigation of dispersal processes at the individual level is presently limited by a lack of flexibility in their parameterization. In this paper, a new parameterization of these models is presented in which the probability of leaving the site of origin and the probability that an emigrant settles on a given recipient site are modeled separately. This parameterization is then used to address the influence of local perturbations on site fidelity and settlement decisions of emigrants in a subdivided population of Blackheaded Gulls, Larus ridibundus. The parameterization introduced here accurately describes dispersal probabilities whenever they result from a two-step decision-making process (i.e., when choice of a settlement site only occurs after a decision has been made to leave the current site).

Multiple species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can coexist in terrestrial ecosystems, and co-occurring plants can differ in their response to colonization by these different fungi. However, the range of mycorrhizal plant-growth responses that can occur within communities has not been determined. In the present study, I crossed a large number of plant and fungal species that co-occur to determine the range of responses that can exist within an ecosystem. I also crossed exotic fungal isolates vs. local plant isolates and local fungal isolates vs. exotic plant isolates to determine whether the range of plant growth responses differs when using foreign genotypes. The data indicate that plant growth responses to mycorrhizal inoculation within an ecosystem can range from highly parasitic to highly mutualistic. In this study, the direction and magnitude of the response depended on the combination of plant and fungal species. No plant did best with the same fungal isolate. The range of responses was greatest when using local plants and fungi. Whereas parasitic and mutualistic responses were also detected when using foreign plant or fungal genotypes, the range of responses was significantly reduced, as was the relative frequency of positive responses. Overall, this study suggests that, within ecosystems, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi can function along a continuum from parasitism to mutualism, and that extreme responses are more common when using locally adapted plants and fungi.

We show that the prey-to-predator species ratio is resistant to change. We determined that ratios were about 3:1 for 50 lakes with diversity ranging from 5 to 58 taxa, and with a total combined fauna of 140 insects, crustaceans, and fish. The prey-to-predator ratio range (1.25:1 to 5.20:1) was only 9% of the potential range. Ratios were not related to chemical, thermal, or physical characteristics of lakes. Ratios were generally the same for fishless lakes, for lakes with one or two introduced predators (salmonids), and for lakes with more complex communities with up to 14 predators including five fish species. For the simplest model, this suggests that when a fish species is introduced and becomes established in a lake there is a fundamental ecological compensatory adjustment with either a three species increase in the diversity of prey or the loss of a predator (but no change in diversity). However, we show more complex prey-predator ratio changes occur because certain keystone species regulated community structure and prey diversity. When the keystone fish (a predatory salmonid) was removed from five lakes, the penultimate littoral predator (lake chub) occupied both the pelagic and littoral zones. Consequently, amphipod density decreased, chironomid density increased, and total zooplankton and benthic diversity increased by 31% or 7.8 taxa per lake on average.

These estimates could provide insights into rates of migration in response to climate change and rates of alien invasions. LDD information is not available for parameterization of current models because it is hard to obtain. We combine a new stochastic model with a flexible framework that permits assimilation of evidence that might be derived from a range of sources. Results are consistent with the prediction of traditional diffusion that population spread has a finite asymptotic velocity. Unlike traditional diffusion, spread is not well described by the mean; it is erratic. In contrast with deterministic models, our results show that inherent uncertainty, rather than parameter sensitivity, thwarts informative forecasts of spread velocity. Analysis shows that, because LDD is inherently unpredictable, even full knowledge of LDD parameters might not provide informative estimates of velocity for populations characterized by LDD. Although predictive distributions are too broad to provide precise estimates of spread rate, they are valuable for comparing spread potential among species and for identifying potential for invasion. Using combinations of dispersal data and the estimates provided by dispersal biologists that derive from multiple sources, the model predicts spread rates that are much slower than those from traditional (deterministic) fat-tailed models and from simulation models of spread, but for different reasons. Deterministic fat-tailed models overestimate spread rate, because they assume that fractions of individuals can rapidly occupy distant sites. Stochastic models recognize that distant colonization is limited to discrete individuals.

Pre-dispersal seed predation, resulting in the destruction of developing seeds, may allow resource reallocation to the production of subsequent flowers. Silene latifolia, the white campion, is subject to pre-dispersal seed predation by noctuid moths. In order to determine the potential for resource reallocation in S. latifolia we conducted a greenhouse experiment in which female plants were subjected to three levels of pollination (0%, 50%, or 100%) and simulated pre-dispersal seed predation (0%, 50%, or 100% of total fruit production). We assigned 10 plants to each of the seven treatments (0% pollinated had no fruit); in total, 1490 flowers were measured for flower size and scored for date of flowering and longevity. Flower size decreased over the course of the experiment. Average daily production was 12.2 flowers per plant on non-pollinated plants, but only 4.3 flowers on 100% pollinated plants. Chi-square results showed that simulated seed predation resulted in additional flowering bouts later in the course of the experiment. Time series analysis showed that the time between flowering bouts was also influenced by predation. Plants with 0% predation had an average lag time of 29.5 days, whereas plants with 100% simulated seed predation had a lag period of 20.1 days. Flower longevity of non-pollinated flowers increased in plants that had flowers pollinated but experienced no seed predation. Simulated predation resulted in a decrease in floral longevity. These results suggest that plants reallocate resources to the production of new flowers after the destruction of fruits; thus, flowering phenology is influenced by pollination and seed predation.

First, we expect that genotype-by-environment interactions will be ubiquitous in biological systems. Second, while antagonistic pleiotropy is implicated in some cases of ecological specialization, other mechanisms also seem to be at work. Third, while negative frequency-dependent selection can maintain ecological diversity in laboratory systems, a mechanistic (biochemical) analysis of these systems suggests that negative frequency dependence may only apply within a narrow range of environments if resources are substitutable.

The model has previously been shown to adequately predict radiation absorption, production, and soil water balance in humid savannas. Using field measurements quantifying the spatial variations in grass NPP, the model was found to predict correctly the effect of tree abundance on grass NPP. Model simulations showed that annual photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), absorption efficiency, NPP, and transpiration of the tree layer increased with increasing tree density and decreased with increasing tree aggregation; the grass layer showed the opposite trends. Total NPP (tree plus grass) remained stable for all tree densities and decreased slightly for aggregated tree distributions. Total transpiration increased with tree density and was not affected by tree aggregation. Changing the tree size distribution had no effect on radiation absorption or on carbon and water fluxes. This study showed that fine-scale vegetation structure can influence NPP and water fluxes. As such, it should be taken into account when assessing the functioning of tree-grass systems. However, the detailed fine-scale structure of the tree layer is rarely available for savanna ecosystems. Thus we assessed the reliability of two common descriptors of savanna vegetation, leaf area index (LAI) and tree canopy cover, to predict PAR absorption, NPP, and evapotranspiration. Neither of these descriptors could adequately predict all the simulated effects. However, tree canopy cover can be used to reasonably estimate radiation absorption and carbon fluxes, whereas LAI is a good predictor of water fluxes.

We examined patterns of variation in vascular plant and bryophyte species composition among 150 1-m 2 plots distributed semi-randomly over 11 Norwegian boreal swamp-forest localities. Swamp forests are species-rich islands in an otherwise species-poor forest landscape. For each plot, 53 environmental variables were recorded. By using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA), we found that ∼20% of the explainable variation in species composition was due to swamp-forest affiliation, in addition to the ∼35% that was due to environmental differences between swamp-forest localities. The uniqueness of the species composition of each swamp forest was also emphasized by analyses of compositional dissimilarity. Plots were significantly more dissimilar if situated in different swamp forests than if situated in the same swamp forest, after environmental differences had been corrected for. The lack of any significant relationship between compositional dissimilarity and geographical distance or swamp-forest area indicated that this pattern was not mainly due to recent successful dispersal and establishment events. We argue that the distinctness of swamp forests, in particular, those richer in species and soil nutrients, is due to a combination of factors among which randomness in establishment in gaps (""windows of opportunity"") and persistence of established clonal species are important. Furthermore, we argue that the probability for successful recruitment may have been higher in previous time periods than it is today.

In this study, I examined the roles of biotic and abiotic factors in setting the local range limits of Mazzaella parksii (formerly Mazzaella cornucopiae). In Washington State, this turf-forming red alga occurs almost exclusively in a discrete high intertidal band on north-facing, wave-exposed shores. I investigated the mechanisms underlying these distributional patterns via a series of intra- and extra-limital transplant experiments coupled with manipulations of interacting species and abiotic stress. The upper limit of Mazzaella was set by physiological stress; turfs transplanted above the natural Mazzaella zone bleached and died over the course of a few months. Mazzaella's, lower limit was set by herbivory; turfs transplanted below the natural zone were consumed in treatments accessible to grazers but thrived in herbivore-exclusion plots. South-facing transplants at the same intertidal height as the natural north-facing Mazzaella zone declined regardless of interspecific interactions, indicating that Mazzaella's upper limit is lower on south-facing shores. However, the position of the herbivore-deter-mined lower limit was similar between aspects. South-facing transplants could survive below the natural Mazzaella zone if the grazer-determined lower limit was extended downshore by herbivore exclusions or at Mazzaella's natural intertidal height (i.e., the height at which it persists on north-facing surfaces) if the physiologically determined upper limit was extended upshore by experimental shades. In the absence of such experimental modifications, Mazzaella was effectively excluded from south-facing shores because its upper limit had converged on its lower limit. Thus, abiotic factors and biological factors interact to set the horizontal distributional limits of this alga. This conceptual model is consistent with Mazzaella's distribution at a variety of spatial scales and has broad implications for both spatial patterns and temporal trends in the distribution and abundance of species.",85,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Desiccation | Herbivory | Intertidal height | Lottia spp. | Mazzaella parksii | Range limits | Species-specific responses | Substrate aspect | Transplant experiment | Zonation,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,179,NA,NA,NA,NA

An experimental approach was used to directly manipulate plant diversity in the field, while holding other environmental factors constant. Species loss was simulated by establishing grassland communities of 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, and 0 plant species, composed of 3, 2, or 1 functional groups (grasses, legumes, and non-legume herbs). Every diversity treatment was replicated with several different species mixtures. Nitrate leaching was determined by continuous extraction of soil solution below the rooting zone and modeling of seepage rates. The concentration of nitrate in the soil solution was highly variable within each level of diversity. In bare ground plots and several low-diversity mixtures containing legumes, nitrate concentrations were higher than the official European Union threshold value for drinking water of 50 mg/L, with maximum values of up to 350 mg/L measured in Trifolium pratense monocultures. Total annual loss of nitrate was unaffected by the number of plant species or functional groups, but it was highly dependent on the specific species composition of the communities, and plots with legumes lost significantly more nitrate than plots without them. Aboveground biomass had no influence on nitrate loss, whereas leaching was negatively correlated with increasing root biomass. The abundance of legumes within a community, litter decomposition rates, and net nitrification were all positively correlated with total nitrate loss. However, in those communities containing legumes, leaching decreased with increasing diversity, because higher species richness led to a reduction in legume dominance, to a reduced nitrate supply through nitrification, and to a complementary uptake of nitrate by grasses and non-leguminous herbs. Based on these results, we expect that increasing the diversity of non-leguminous species or functional groups would reduce the risk of nitrate leaching in low-diversity grass-clover mixtures of ley-farming systems, while allowing for a more efficient exploitation of the beneficial fertilization effect provided by legumes.",209,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,BIODEPTH | Biodiversity | Ecosystem functioning | Ecosystem processes | Functional groups | Grassland | Legumes | Nitrate leaching | Species richness,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,180,NA,NA,NA,NA

A three-species IGP system with larvae of the dragonfly Anax junius as IG (top) predators, larvae of the dragonfly Plathemis lydia as IG prey (intermediate predators), and fathead minnow hatchlings (Pimephales promelas) as shared prey was used to estimate the contribution of the following three factors to shared-prey mortality rate in combined predator treatments: (1) the trophic effect of the IG predator on IG prey density; (2) the effect of reduced shared prey consumption by the IG prey in the presence of the IG predator; and (3) the effect of alternative prey for the IG predator. These factors were integrated into a model of multiple predator effects. To quantify minnow mortality, P. promelas were exposed to A. junius only, P. lydia only, A. junius and P. lydia, or neither in a two-by-two factorial design. Additional treatments, in which one or both predators were unable to feed, were used to isolate behavioral (activity level) changes in dragonfly larvae. When predators preyed in combination on P. promelas their impact was less than that of the summed effects of the two predators, each in the absence of the other - a result termed risk reduction. A. junius consumed a significant number of P. lydia when they were present (i.e., IGP), and behavioral interactions between A. junius and P. lydia were asymmetric. The presence of A. junius caused P. lydia to become less active, while the presence of P. lydia elicited a diet shift in A. junius to include some P. lydia. Interactions between predator species, specifically IGP, influenced prey survival. Trophic and behavioral effects of IGP were similar in magnitude. These results highlight the importance of trophic and behavioral interactions in predator-prey systems and also suggest that effects of multiple predators may not be predictable based on the sum of individual effects.

I tested the model across multiple species, using a taxonomically diverse community of arthropods found on exposed tree trunks in northern Germany. I sampled 14 arthropod species from different microhabitat types (various cryptogam species and crevice types) and quantified the microhabitat-niche breadths of species by Simpson index. Then, I used multiple regression analysis across phylogenetically independent contrasts to examine the relationship between microhabitat-niche breadth and traits that can control search time (degree of residence on the trunks, tolerance of abiotic stress, speed of movement, generation time). I found that microhabitat specialists had longer generation times, spent more of their life on the trunks and could move faster than generalists. This allowed specialists to search the trunk for a longer period of time than generalists and to require less time to traverse a given search distance. These three findings supported the Time-Limited Disperser Model. However, specialists were no more tolerant of abiotic stress (i.e., desiccation) than were generalists. That is, specialists could not search the trunk during more adverse climatic conditions than could generalists, contradicting the Time-Limited Disperser Model.

Macrocystis pyrifera planktonic zoospores were quantified from seawater samples pumped on numerous dates in 1999 from just above the substratum at various sites in the Point Loma kelp forest, southern California, USA. Zoospore collections were made at a site in the forest interior approximately three times per month from late February through mid-November. Sample collection overlapped with complete demographic surveys of the local population (100 m2) to determine local reproductive output. Temporal variability in zoospore supply was strongly correlated with relative changes in the density .and size structure of local reproductive adult sporophytes; 76% of variability in zoospore supply was explained by local reproductive output. This tight coupling between zoospore supply and local reproduction appeared to be driven by low-displacement, oscillating currents in the forest interior due to the cumulative drag of adult sporophytes, which kept zoospores close to their release site. High coupling between zoospore supply and local reproduction was validated at two additional interior sites separated by 1 km; 78% of variability in zoospore supply was explained by local reproductive output at these sites. Due to lower sporophyte densities, however, the forest edges experienced rapid, unidirectional currents that appeared to transport zoospores far from their release site, effectively decoupling zoospore supply from local reproduction; only 38% of variability in zoospore supply was explained by local reproductive output at these sites.

One answer to this question is that such differences might generally evolve in allopatry, as different species adapt to divergent environmental conditions, and any differences that thereby accumulate might subsequently enable coexistence in sympatry. Alternatively, coexisting species might generally diverge in sympatry, because of selection to reduce competition for food (character displacement). Here we evaluated these two causes of character divergence by asking which hypothesis better explains differences in feeding morphology between tadpoles of two species of spadefoot toads, Spea bombifrons and S. multiplicata. We found that, in natural ponds containing both species, S. multiplicata almost always developed into a smaller, round-bodied tadpole with normal sized jaw muscles used for feeding on detritus at the pond bottom (the ""omnivore"" morph), whereas S. bombifrons almost always developed into a larger, flat-headed tadpole with greatly enlarged jaw muscles used for feeding on crustaceans in open water (the ""carnivore"" morph). By contrast, in all but one of 18 similar ponds containing a single species, both species expressed both phenotypes. Divergence between species in morph production appears to have evolved in sympatry: when we compared population means for each of four key trophic characters, we found that no allopatric population of S. bombifrons was as carnivore-like as the sympatric S. bombifrons, and, for three of four characters, no allopatric population of S. multiplicata was as omnivore-like as the sympatric S. multiplicata. In contrast to significant differences in trophic characters, we found no divergence between allopatric and sympatric populations in a character not directly involved in feeding on detritus or crustaceans (overall body size). These data, together with our earlier experimental work, reveal that coexisting S. bombifrons and S. multiplicata have diverged from one another in resource use and in phenotypic features associated with resource use because of selection to reduce competition for food (i.e., character displacement). Spea tadpoles, therefore, are one of few systems for which both experimental and observational evidence link phenotypic divergence to resource competition, thereby providing a model for understanding why coexisting species often differ phenotypically.",56,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Character displacement | Competition | Divergent selection | Geographic variation | Local adaptation | Phenotypic plasticity | Spea bombifrons | Spea multiplicata,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,186,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Japanese dace fed on both benthic algae and invertebrates when ayu were absent, and predominantly on invertebrates when ayu were present. The presence of Japanese dace reduced the number of invertebrates and increased algal biomass (chlorophyll a) through trophic cascades, but the effects of respiration and excretion of dace did not notably increase algal biomass probably because the water continuously pumped into the pools was already nutrient rich. The growth rate of ayu was enhanced in the presence of Japanese dace due to increased algal biomass. In contrast, as the number of ayu increased, the growth rate of Japanese dace was reduced because of the exploitation of benthic algae and occasional attacks by ayu on dace. The relationship between ayu and Japanese dace is not merely competitive, but partly indirect contramensalism through trophic cascades.

We examined losses of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and base cations across a four-million-year substrate age gradient of Hawaiian montane tropical forests, with the goal of understanding how losses depend on changes in biotic demand, weathering, and atmospheric sources. We were particularly interested in whether losses of nutrients that are not subject to traditional mechanisms of biotic availability could influence ecosystem fertility and nutrient limitation over time. Over a three-year period we sampled nutrient outputs in soil solutions below the active plant-soil system and small streams, gaseous N losses (NO, N2O, and N2), and pools and transformations of N in soils. Weathering was the major determinant of ecosystem losses of P, of base cations and Si, and of ecosystem acid-base status. Sharp reductions in weathering inputs after 20 000 years of forest development caused dramatically lower outputs of P (∼65% reduction), Ca2+ (∼99%), and Si (∼94%), to rates that matched inputs from dilute sea-salt and dust aerosols. Internal production of organic acids, in combination with low weathering, caused highly acidic soil waters (pH < 5.0) with elevated Al (up to 300 μg/L) and Ca:Al ratios (<0.3) below values considered critical thresholds for many plant species. Long-term N and P interactions were more complex than predicted by the Walker and Syers model, with important influences of N and P loss pathways that were not subject to direct biotic availability. While losses of available forms of dissolved N and P, and N gases followed (as predicted) ecosystem nutrient availability, significant dissolved organic N (DON) and dissolved organic P (DOP) losses occurred independent of ecosystem N or P status. DON losses were not sufficient (relative to external inputs) to sustain N limitation beyond 20 000 years, while dissolved P losses remained large enough to maintain P limitation in older forests. Forests developed high N:P loss ratios over time (>300 on mass weight basis) due to efficient P recycling and unexpectedly high N throughputs (4-9 kg N·ha -1·yr-1) by either N fixation and/or N deposition.",199,Journal,re,Review,100,3,3,"Acidity, soil waters | Base cations | Calcium | Ecosystem evolution over geologic time | Forest ecosystems and biogeochemical processes | Hawaiian montane tropical forests | Nitrogen and nitrogen oxide | Nutrient cycles and nutrient limitations | Phosphorus | Silicon",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,188,NA,NA,NA,NA

Belowground litter inputs (dead roots, mycorrhizae, and exudates) are larger than aboveground litterfall in many systems. Chemical quality and diameter primarily control decomposition for coarse roots, but these patterns do not hold for finer classes of roots, which are frequently colonized by mycorrhizae. Though mycorrhizal status is known to drastically alter root chemistry, morphology, life span, and exudation, it has never been explicitly considered as a factor affecting root decomposition. We hypothesize that mycorrhizal status substantially influences fine root decomposition rates. Both ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can change root properties but do so in different ways. Dominant tree species of most cold and temperate forests rely heavily on EM associations. EM fungi form massive structures that envelop fine roots. Roots infected by ectomycorrhizae have higher nitrogen concentrations than nonmycorrhizal roots, which would be expected to increase decomposition rates, but much of this nitrogen is bound in recalcitrant forms, such as chitin, so the net effect on decomposition is difficult to predict. AM fungi lack elaborate, macroscopic structures and may not alter root chemistry as profoundly. In addition to mycorrhizal roots, external fungal hyphae can contribute significantly to ecosystem carbon budgets and thereby influence rates of soil carbon turnover. Hyphae have commonly been considered a rapidly decomposing carbon pool, though this has never been demonstrated experimentally. If hyphae are produced at the expense of rapidly decomposing root exudates, then the net effect of hyphal litter production might be to reduce soil microbial activity and overall carbon cycling rates. Based on known differences in morphology and chemistry, EM hyphae may be more recalcitrant than AM hyphae. In summary, we submit that mycorrhizal status could substantially influence fine root decomposition and soil carbon processing rates, potentially explaining some of the variation observed within and among individual plant species and ecosystems.",208,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Arbuscular mycorrhiza | Carbon cycling | Decomposition | Ectomycorrhiza | Feedbacks | Fine roots | Hyphae,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,189,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulate organic matter, and associated microbes, are available in caves, but the relative importance of these foods is unclear. We examined trophic structure and the roles of particulate organic matter and DOM retained in epilithic biofilms in three cave streams using natural abundance isotopes (13C and 15N) and 13C tracer additions. Natural abundance 15N ratios showed that cave animals occupied two trophic levels: primary consumers and predators. Epilithic biofilms and animals were highly enriched in 15N, suggesting that dissolved organic matter from surface soils was incorporated into epilithon and supported stream food webs, even when coarse particulate organic matter (CPOM) from the surface was abundant. We conducted 28-day 13C-acetate tracer additions to trace the use of epilithon carbon in the food webs. The tracer13C acetate was rapidly taken up in the streams at uptake velocities (0.5-22.8 × 10-5 m/s) and uptake rates (0.04-0.23 mg m-2 h-1) similar to those in surface streams. Epilithon was highly labeled and epilithon turnover time was relatively long (10.0-16.7 d), showing that C from DOM was immobilized in biofilms and thus available to invertebrates, which also became labeled with tracer by the end of the experiment. Several snails (Fontigens tartarea, Gyraulus parvus, and Physa sp.) that fed directly on epilithon were highly enriched with tracer 13C. Other primary consumers (Gammarus minus and Caecidotea holsingeri) fed on a combination of epilithon and fine particulate organic matter. Predators in the streams (Stygobromus emarginatus, S. spinatus, and Macrocotyla hoffmasteri) also became labeled with 13C, indicating that biofilm C was passed through the entire food web.

We propose here that these patterns are also influenced by phenological effects on offspring quality. Furthermore, we hypothesize that there are cross-generational trade-offs between parental and offspring components of parental fitness influencing the evolution of reproductive phenology. To test our hypothesis, we examined the multigenerational effects of flowering and fruiting phenology in Plantago lanceolata. Offspring of 30 families were transplanted into field plots to measure the effects of onsets of flowering and fruiting, duration of fruiting, percentage fungal infection, and damage by grasshoppers on total seed production, our measure of the within-generational component of parental fitness. To gather information about cross-generational contributions to parental fitness, we assessed the quality of offspring produced at different times in terms of seed mass and germination. Families significantly differed in flowering and fruiting onsets. Larger plants began flowering earlier, and earlier flowering plants matured fruits earlier and produced fruits for a longer time. Significant family-mean correlations among these traits suggest that selection on any one trait will change all three traits. A negative family-mean correlation between fruiting onset and seed production suggests that we can expect an antagonistic trade-off in response to selection on these two traits. Early fruiting significantly reduced seed predation by grasshoppers and increased seed production. In contrast, late-maturing seeds were significantly heavier and germinated more rapidly than did early-maturing seeds produced by the same plants. The directions of the multigenerational effects support the hypothesis that there are cross-generational trade-offs between parental and offspring components of parental fitness.

This paper examines latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in species richnesses of corals and reef fishes in the Indo-Pacific domain and compares them with gradients predicted by a mid-domain model in which geographic domains are located at random between the latitudinal and longitudinal boundaries of this region. We test for significant differences between observed and predicted species-richness patterns, and we identify regions that are enriched or depauperate in species, relative to expectation. In addition, we move beyond previous mid-domain analyses by directly comparing observed spatial distributions of geographic ranges with those predicted by a mid-domain model. This comparison indicates precisely how species-richness anomalies are produced by nonrandomness in the distribution of species ranges. For both corals and fishes, large and statistically significant differences exist between observed latitudinal and longitudinal species-richness gradients and those predicted by mid-domain models. Longitudinally, species richness is markedly higher than predicted along the African coast and, to a lesser extent, within the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA), and it is markedly lower than expected in the eastern Pacific. Latitudinally, species richness becomes increasingly higher than predicted as one moves from the equator to the tropical margins; then it becomes sharply lower than predicted beyond the tropics. Unexpectedly, differences between observed and predicted spatial distributions of range endpoints and midpoints reveal a pattern of nonrandomness that is highly congruent with the hypothesis that gyres in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, with the IAA forming a porous boundary between them, have a major influence on Indo-Pacific species-richness patterns.

To perform artificial selection, the phenotypic trait of interest is measured on a population, and the individuals with the most extreme phenotypic values are bred to produce the next generation. The change in the mean of the selected trait across each generation is the response to selection, and other traits can also evolve due to genetic correlations with the selected trait. Artificial selection can directly answer the question of how quickly a trait will evolve under a given strength of selection. This kind of result can help ecologists determine whether range or niche boundaries are determined by a lack of variation for a key phenotypic trait or trade-offs due to genetic correlations with other fitness-related traits. In a related approach, controlled natural selection, the organisms are not selected according to their values for a given trait, but rather are allowed to evolve for one to several generations under experimentally imposed environmental treatments such as temperature, light, nutrients, presence or absence of predators or competitors, etc. The results of this kind of study can tell us how quickly a population can adapt to a given environmental change, either natural or anthropogenic. Finally, artificial selection can create more variation for measurements of natural selection or can be coupled with QTL mapping; both these combinations provide new insights into adaptation.

The long life span expectancy of an adult dormouse (averaging nine years) is the prerequisite for the infrequent breeding strategy adopted by this rodent species to cope with an unpredictable food source.

Since little is known about the consequences of neglecting this variation, we examined the temporal response of male red-spotted newts, Notophthalmus viridescens, to conflicting female pheromones and damage-release alarm chemicals signaling predation. After a single exposure in both the laboratory and field, males were attracted to female odor and avoided conspecific alarm chemicals. Response to these combined cues depended on time after exposure, with males initially avoiding, and then being attracted to, the cue combination. This response shift was due to the resource and risk declining at different rates, and female odor accelerating male recovery from antipredator behavior. In the laboratory, males suppressed activity when exposed to alarm chemicals alone but increased their activity when female odor was added. Iterative exposures through the breeding season revealed that, as male mate search activity declined, male avoidance of alarm chemicals increased, but alarm chemical production appeared unchanged. Thawing dates differed between ponds of the same and different populations, which offset levels of mate search activity and consequently alarm chemical avoidance. As a result, simultaneous pond surveys made it appear as though there was geographic variation in reproductive and predator-avoidance behaviors. However, when thawing dates were aligned, the time courses of reproductive and predator-avoidance behaviors for the ponds coincided, demonstrating that observed site differences were predominantly due to different behavioral onsets, which would have gone overlooked had the larger temporal scale not been considered. These results indicate that temporal variation can be easily mistaken for geographic variation in behavior, increasing the potential for data interpretation errors.

We measured tree abundance patterns and a suite of environmental and disturbance factors expected to regulate these patterns in 0.05-ha plots distributed throughout the Hubbard Brook Valley.

One species, Betula alleghaniensis, did not exhibit significant residual spatial autocorrelation in its spatial pattern of abundance. The other six species exhibited abundance patterns with highly significant residual spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that factors other than environment and disturbance are needed to adequately explain their spatial patterns of abundance. The range and normalized sill semivariogram values from the residual spatial autocorrelation of the different species were consistent with a role of seed dispersal distance and root sprouting in regulating patterns of abundance of several tree species in the HBEF.

We estimated stochastic population growth rate (a measure of viability) using a matrix-selection method, in which whole observed matrices were selected at random at each time step of the model. In addition, we drew matrix elements (transition probabilities) at random using various statistical distributions: beta, truncated-gamma, truncated-normal, triangular, uniform, or discontinuous/observed. Recruitment rates were held constant at their observed mean values. Two methods of constraining stage-specific survival to ≤ 100% were also compared. Different methods of incorporating stochasticity and constraining matrix column sums interacted in their effects and resulted in different estimates of stochastic growth rate (differing by up to 16%). Modelers should be aware that when constraining stage-specific survival to 100%, different methods may introduce different levels of bias in transition element means, and when this happens, different distributions for generating random transition elements may result in different viability estimates. There was no species effect on the results and the growth rates derived from all methods were highly correlated with one another.

These interacting factors were incorporated into a model to estimate the rate and extent of seasonal incursions of disease from southern into northern areas of the United States. The model indicates a practical limit for long-distance dispersal (LDD) of a plant pathogen, which depends strongly on its fecundity and on its ability to survive in the atmosphere. Two classic plant diseases, stem rust of wheat and tobacco blue mold, are used to illustrate the model. Both diseases appear to spread northward on average at about the same rate as the seasonal advance of the ""green wave"" of available susceptible host tissue. The near concordance of the disease wave and the green wave underscores two important points. First, it suggests that disease spread over long distances may be limited more often by pathogen establishment than by LDD. The green wave also reduces the stochastic variability and speed of disease spread by presenting a barrier to potential long-distance, low-probability dispersal events. Second, it helps to focus attention on alternative pathways for disease spread and on possible unappreciated niches for overseasoning, both of which can have important implications for disease control strategies.",155,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Atmospheric turbulence | Discontinuous spatial distribution of host | Disease wave front trajectories | Dispersal wave | Effective dispersal | Long-distance dispersal | Models | Peronospora tabacina | Puccinia graminis,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,209,NA,NA,NA,NA

The best-fit and most parsimonious models suggested that (1) survival was constant among years, but varied by stage; (2) dormant individuals suffered significantly higher mortality and were more likely to become dormant in future years than sprouting or flowering individuals; (3) flowering individuals had significantly higher survival and were more likely to flower in the future than sprouting and dormant individuals; and (4) sprouting individuals had a significantly higher stage transition to dormancy from the vegetative state than to any other state.

An early transition to piscivory may increase growth, decrease mortality, and therefore enhance lifetime fitness. Although much is known about the extent and causes of variation in the timing of the shift to piscivory among species and among cohorts within a species, little is known about the extent and causes of variation in the timing of the switch to piscivory among individuals within a single cohort. Here, I link otolith age and growth analysis to direct diet and stable isotope analyses to examine variation in the timing of the transition to piscivory and its causes among individual members of the 1994 largemouth bass cohort in Paul Lake, Michigan. Stable isotope and direct diet analyses indicate that only a few members of the 1994 cohort were able to shift to and sustain piscivory in their first summer of life (early piscivores), while most cohort members would have to wait until their second summer of life to become piscivorous (late piscivores). Significant differences in growth rate between early and late piscivores emerged shortly after 18 June, the first date of possible piscivory by early piscivores, after which early piscivores began to grow at rates nearly twice that of late piscivores. Otolith and stable isotope analyses combined indicate that an early hatching date was necessary, but not sufficient, to explain variation in the timing of the transition to piscivory. All early piscivores were hatched early in the summer, but many early-hatched members of the 1994 cohort did not shift to piscivory in their first summer of life. A combination of at least 10 days of variation in hatching dates and higher-than-average growth rates was required for early piscivores to switch to and sustain piscivory in their first summer of life. Individuals that were able to make the early transition to piscivory most likely benefited from both increased survival and fecundity over much of their life, the combination of which would confer a substantial fitness advantage upon individuals able to make the early transition to piscivory.",201,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Cannibalism | Growth | Intraguild predation | Largemouth bass | Micropterus salmoides | Niche shifts | Ontogeny | Otolith | Piscivory | Size-structured predation | Stable isotopes | Survival,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,211,NA,NA,NA,NA

Subterranean plant feeders and pathogenic microorganisms interfere with basic functions of plant roots, such as resource uptake, storage of reserves, and anchoring of plants in the soil, but concepts and theories on control of herbivores and pathogens, such as the Green World Hypothesis, have been developed and applied almost exclusively for the aboveground subsystem. Root herbivores and pathogens affect spatial and temporal patterns in natural plant communities, and whether these patterns are cyclic or irreversible depends on characteristics of the root feeders, interactions with other soil or aboveground organisms, and the rate of changes in the abiotic environment. Established plants can tolerate root herbivores and pathogens at densities that are lethal to their offspring. Dispersal by seeds or rhizomes allows new cohorts to become established before root herbivores or root pathogens colonize and develop, but it provides only temporal release of plants from their natural enemies. Permanent release from root herbivores and pathogens contributes to plant invasiveness. I propose to expand the concept of plant-soil feedback by including plant defense belowground. Many plant secondary compounds are synthesized in the roots, and these chemicals could affect root herbivores, root pathogens, and their natural enemies.

This paper seeks to identify suitable procedures for empirical analyses on the influence of variance and mean intensity of predictor ecological variables on spatial and temporal patterns in natural populations. A survey of the ecological literature indicates that temporal variability in studies of disturbance and in analyses of consumer-resource interactions is generally expressed in terms of frequency of events. This is inappropriate, as frequency confounds the variance with the mean effect size of a process. A possible solution to the problem involves experimental designs in which levels of intensity and those of variability are chosen independently over explicit spatial or temporal scales and treated as fixed, orthogonal factors. Examples are offered for various scenarios of consumer-resource interactions along with indications for statistical tests of hypotheses.

Tuber production was highest for the mild-temperate genets, irrespective of locality where the genets were grown. Selection coefficients indicated that populations at the European center of the species distribution perform better than all other populations, at all sites. However, marginal populations showed changes in life-history traits, such as compressed life cycles in the north and true perenniality in the south, that may allow them to perform better locally, at the limits of their distribution range. Our results thus suggest that local adaptation may overlap spatially with center-periphery gradients in performance caused by genetic factors (such as genetic drift and inbreeding in range-marginal populations).

Unfortunately, knowledge of the patterns and causes of crop-size variation is limited, and most studies have examined only single species in a single mesic environment. We examined long-term patterns of acorn crop sizes for five species of shrubby oaks in three xeric upland vegetative associations of south-central peninsular Florida for evidence of regular fruiting cycles and in relation to winter temperature and precipitation. Counts of acorns on two white oak species (Quercus chapmanii and Q. geminata) and three red oak species (Q. inopina, Q. laevis, and Q. myrtifolia) were conducted annually from 1969 to 1996 (except in 1991) on grids in southern ridge sandhill, sand pine scrub, and scrubby flatwoods associations. As the result of the dissimilar timing of reproductive events in species of red and white oaks and individual species responses to climatic variables, annual acorn production of red and white oak species in a given vegetation association were not synchronized, which dampened the variability of combined annual acorn production. Consequently, acorns were produced with reasonable abundance every year by at least one species. Oaks of nearly closed-canopy scrub produced fewer acorns than similar-sized oaks of the same species in the more open-canopied sandhill and scrubby flatwoods, suggesting light limitation. We identified regular cycles of acorn production that ranged from 2 to 2.4 yr for white oak species and from 3.6 to 5.5 yr for red oak species and found evidence that annual acorn production is affected by the interactions of precipitation, which is highly variable seasonally and annually in peninsular Florida, with endogenous reproductive patterns. Multiple regression models using precipitation variables accounted for as much as 74% of crop-size variation in Q. inopina, 65% in Q. laevis, 60% in Q. chapmanii, and 44% in Q. geminata, but only 29% for Q. myrtifolia.

Herbivores foraging in these ecosystems may become nutritionally stressed during an annual dry season when both forage quality and quantity are reduced. Additionally, the locations of water sources may impose a landscape-scale constraint on dry-season herbivore distributions. We used logistic regression to analyze 13 years of aerial census data collected in the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, and evaluated hypotheses regarding the relative influences that surface water, forage quality, and forage quantity exert on the dry-season, landscape-scale distribution patterns of eight herbivore species. Hypotheses regarding the degree of correlation between species' distributions and distance to water were developed using previous observations of species' relative water dependence. We also developed hypotheses regarding species' responses to the trade-off that may occur between surface-water constraints and nutritional requirements when either forage quality or quantity is reduced. In general, we expect an increase in species' mean distance to water as a result of individuals mitigating limitations in nutritional requirements (i.e., intake quality or quantity) by foraging farther from water. Our analyses suggest that the trade-off between nutritional requirements and surface-water constraints that species face varies according to the species' water dependence, size, and gut morphology. Of the four grazers considered in our analyses, waterbuck distributions appear to be constrained primarily by surface-water availability. Distributions of buffalo, a large ruminant grazer, suggest that individuals face a trade-off between nutritional requirements and surface-water constraints when forage quantity is reduced. Alternatively, distributions of wildebeest, a smaller ruminant grazer, suggest that individuals face this trade-off when access to high-quality forage is limited. In comparison to buffalo and wildebeest, the strength of this trade-off is moderate for zebra, a nonruminant similar in size to wildebeest, when either forage quality or quantity is reduced.

Theory predicts that dispersal by resident stream organisms is necessary to offset the loss of individuals to downstream drift. However, there is a lack of empirical data linking dispersal and drift to local population dynamics in streams, leading to uncertainty regarding the general demographic significance of these processes and the power of drift to explain observed dispersal patterns. I assessed the contribution of dispersal along a first-order stream to population dynamics of the headwater salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (Plethodontidae). I conducted mark-recapture surveys of two contiguous 500 m long sections of a study stream in June, July, and August of 1999, 2000, and 2001. Movement by G. porphyriticus larvae and adults showed a strong upstream bias in the study stream, as well as in 11 other streams that I surveyed. Using mark-recapture models and Akaike's information criterion for model selection, monthly probability of dispersal from the downstream section to the upstream section of the study stream (mean ± 1 SE) was estimated to be 0.02 ± 0.01. The probability of dispersal from the upstream section to the downstream section was 0.00 ± 0.00. Monthly survival probabilities did not differ between sections. Estimated monthly population growth rates were 1.01 ± 0.01 in both sections. Net dispersal from the downstream section to the upstream section contributed to the equality of population growth rates. Additionally, reproduction and individual condition were lower in the upstream section, suggesting that population stability and growth there (i.e., λ ≥ 1.0) may have been dependent on immigration from downstream. Similar interactions between dispersal and variation in local demographic rates along the stream continuum may underlie the distribution and abundance patterns of other organisms at multiple spatial scales. Greater empirical understanding of these interactions will improve conservation of stream biota. The strong upstream bias of G. porphyriticus movement suggests that dispersal is not a response to downstream drift.

A nutrient-mediated increase in periphyton (algae attached to plant surfaces) is often described as being responsible for the loss of plants from shallow lakes, yet this violates the stochastic assumptions of alternative equilibria. To determine if periphyton is capable of forcing a switch between these communities, the factors governing the success of aquatic plants were surveyed in 17 plant-dominated shallow lakes in Norfolk (United Kingdom) that varied in nutrient concentration and fish biomass. In these lakes, plant biomass was negatively related to the density of periphyton. However, the density of periphyton on the plants was correlated with the density of grazing invertebrates, not nutrient concentration. In turn, the biomass of fish determined the density of invertebrates. This cascade from fish to periphyton via invertebrates appeared to be evident even though plant-dominated lakes are heterogeneous and complex. Under conditions of plant dominance, periphyton appeared to have a stronger influence on plant growth than phytoplankton. Our data support a model where, within the range of nutrients where alternative equilibria are possible, fish are the prime determinants of community structure in shallow lakes, through a cascading effect of predation on grazing invertebrates influencing the biomass of periphyton and hence, plants.

Our understanding of the selection pressures that may maintain these color polymorphisms has primarily been confined to one set of organisms - pollinators. Yet, selection on flower color may also be driven by other agents, such as herbivores, especially in cases where pollinators and herbivores are using the same or correlated traits to select plants. A wealth of studies have documented pollinator preference for anthocyanin-recessive color morphs (A-; yellow and white flowers) of wild radish, Raphanus sativus, over anthocyanin-dominant morphs (A+; pink and bronze flowers); yet, differences in pollination alone do not explain the maintenance of the flower color polymorphism. Here, we ask whether variation in flower color in R. sativus influences the preference and performance of herbivores for A- flower color morphs vs. A+ flower color morphs in four types of herbivores (generalist and specialist Lepidoptera, slugs, aphids, and thrips). We found that all herbivores except for aphids and thrips preferred flowering A- color morphs compared to A+ morphs of R. sativus. Furthermore, all herbivores except larvae of specialist and generalist Lepidoptera performed better on A- color morphs. Differences in plant secondary chemistry may play a role in differential herbivore preference and performance on the anthocyanin flower color morphs. Chemical analyses of leaf secondary compounds (indole glucosinolates) revealed that A+ color morphs produced higher concentrations of indole glucosinolates than A- morphs in the presence of herbivore damage. Therefore, herbivores may exhibit lower preference for A+ color morphs, and these morphs may support lower herbivore performance because they are heavily defended once damaged. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to document differential preference and performance of herbivores for different flower color morphs. Previous studies have shown that increased herbivore damage can have profound negative direct and indirect effects on the reproduction of R. sativus. The data presented here suggest that differential preference and performance of herbivores for R. sativus color morphs may counter selection on flower color exerted by pollinators.",163,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,"Anthocyanins | California, USA | Flower color polymorphism | Herbivory | Plant-insect interactions | Raphanus | Wild radish",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,226,NA,NA,NA,NA

The system provides a rapid test of conservation theory and can aid in planning for large and expensive studies. The investigation subjected the sawtooth grain beetle, Oryzaephilus surinamensis (L.), to five experiments in which population abundance was monitored over time. Metapopulations were created by connecting adjacent vials of flour with rubber tubes. The metapopulatrons were arranged in rings, and food was replenished at two-week intervals. The experiments examined populations in (1) habitats becoming increasingly fragmented, (2) dynamically fragmenting structure with concurrent loss of resources over time, (3) static structure, dynamic resource loss and differing numbers of patches, (4) static structural arrangements with dynamic resource loss that mimic resource deterioration and destruction, and (5) static arrangements of connected fragments with an equal total amount of food in a few large patches or several small patches. Time series of stage-specific abundances were compared in repeated-measures ANOVA. The results show that populations respond in nonlinear ways to both the amount of food and area provided. Within a confined area, when food is plentiful, individual interaction limits population abundance. When the amount of food is reduced, population abundance becomes food dependent. Immediate increase in immature abundance was a characteristic of fragmentation while a delayed reduction of adults was characteristic of food reduction.

During outbreaks, trees often suffer partial or complete defoliation for two or more successive years, yet most studies have examined induced resistance following only one season of defoliation, which may not reveal its full impact on herbivores. In a field experiment, 40 trees from each of two clones of trembling aspen, Populus tremuloides, were severely defoliated for one, three, and four years in succession by experimentally manipulating densities of an outbreak folivore, the forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria. Treatments were applied such that the individual and combined effects of RIR and DIR on the fitness of the forest tent caterpillar could be assessed independently. In field assays, defoliation treatments did not affect larval development time and only marginally affected survival. However, fecundity in both clones was significantly reduced by a single season of defoliation .concurrent with the bioassay (effects of RIR), by three consecutive years of defoliation prior to the year of the bioassay (effects of DIR), and by four consecutive years of defoliation (combined effects of RIR and DIR). There were no differences among the three defoliation treatments, indicating that the effects of DIR and RIR combined were not greater than each acting alone. Reductions in fecundity were less than half those observed during natural outbreaks, suggesting that other factors also must contribute to declining fecundity during the collapse of outbreaks. Short-term laboratory bioassays indicated that defoliation effects observed in long-term field assays were not due to changes in relative growth rate (RGR) of second instars or final-instar males, which were unaffected, possibly because of increased relative consumption rates (RCR). Defoliation treatments decreased RGR of final-instar females in laboratory bioassays, despite elevated RCR. Both defoliation treatment and aspen clone influenced parasitism by tachinid flies that detect hosts through volatiles released from leaves damaged by caterpillars. Parasitism was highest on trees defoliated concurrently with the larval bioassay. However, there were no differences between trees defoliated prior to the bioassay and control trees, indicating that effects on parasitism were not due to defoliation-induced changes in host quality per se. Thus, there were no additive interactions between DIR and parasitism that would amplify delayed density-dependent effects on population dynamics. Spatial responses of these tachinids to host density or to current defoliation rather than the defoliation history of the trees may enhance the stabilizing effect of RIR on population dynamics. Conversely, differences in parasitism among clones could contribute to spatial variation in tent caterpillar population density. Neither defoliation effect on host quality nor parasitism was sufficient to slow reproductive rates to levels observed in declining outbreaks in nature, suggesting that single-factor explanations for tent caterpillar population dynamics are unlikely.",34,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Defoliation | Induced resistance | Malacosoma disstria | Parasitoids | Plant-herbivore interactions | Population dynamics | Populus tremuloides | Tachinid flies | Tent caterpillars | Top-down and bottom-up | Tritrophic,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,228,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mycorrhizae generally facilitate plant uptake of nutrients from the soil. However, mycorrhizal associations are known to vary in their mutualistic function, and there is currently no metric that links AM functioning with fungal colonization of roots. Mycorrhizal structures differ in their physiological and ecological functioning, so changes in AM allocation to intraradical (inside roots) and extraradical (in soil) structures may signal shifts in mycorrhizal function. We hypothesize that the functional equilibrium model applies to AM fungi and that fertilization should reduce allocation to arbuscules, coils, and extraradical hyphae, the fungal structures that are directly involved in nutrient acquisition and transfer to plants. This study compared AM responses to experimental N enrichment at five grasslands distributed across North America. Samples were collected from replicated N-enriched (and some P-enriched) and control plots throughout the growing season for three years. Intraradical AM structures were measured in over 1400 root samples, extraradical hyphal density was measured in over 590 soil samples, and spore biovolume was analyzed in over 400 soil samples. There were significant site X N interactions for spore biovolume, extraradical hyphae, intraradical hyphae, and vesicles. Nitrogen enrichment strongly decreased AM structures at Cedar Creek, the site with the lowest soil N:P, and it increased AM structures at Konza Prairie, the site with the highest soil N:P. As predicted by the functional equilibrium model, in soils with sufficient P, relative allocation to arbuscules, coils, and extraradical hyphae was generally reduced by N enrichment. Allocation to spores and hyphae was most sensitive to fertilization. At the mesic sites, this response was associated with a shift in the relative abundance of Gigasporaceae within AM fungal communities. This study demonstrates that N enrichment impacts mycorrhizal allocation across a wide range of grassland ecosystems.

Therefore, we need to move to the next step and understand how organisms respond to combinations of environmental changes. Recent studies of predator-induced plasticity have addressed how prey respond to different combinations of predators. I briefly review 22 studies of combined predator effects on prey phenotypes and identify four factors that make it difficult to interpret the results of these studies: (1) uncontrolled prey consumption, (2) a low number of prey traits, (3) a low number of predator combinations, and (4) confounded predator composition and total predator density. I address these challenges in an experiment that examined how wood frog tadpoles (Rana sylvatica) altered 12 behavioral, morphological, and life historical traits in response to four different caged predators (Erythemis, Belostoma, Dytiscus, and Anax). The predators were present alone at low density, alone at high density (2x), or combined into six pairwise combinations. When each predator was alone (at either low or high density), tadpoles discriminated among different predators and produced predator-specific phenotypes. The doubling of predator density rarely induced more extreme prey phenotypes. When predators were combined, the tadpoles generally developed phenotypes that were similar to those induced by the more risky predator alone (90% of all traits examined, at either low or high density). These results suggest that tadpoles perceive the risk of combined predators as being similar to the risk of the most dangerous predator in the pair, and not as a summed or averaged predation risk. The actual risk from these predator combinations remains to be tested. This appears to be the first study to take a comprehensive approach that controls prey consumption, examines a large number of prey traits, uses a large number of predator combinations, and separates the effects of predator composition and predator density.

Soil-dwelling microorganisms are diverse, and interactions with plants vary with respect to specificity, environmental heterogeneity, and fitness impact. Two microbial processes that may exert key influences on plant community structure and dynamics are microbial mediation of niche differentiation in resource use and feedback dynamics between the plant and soil community. The niche differentiation hypothesis is based on observations that soil nutrients occur in different chemical forms, that different enzymes are required for plant access to these nutrients, and that soil microorganisms are a major source of these enzymes. We predict that plant nutrient partitioning arises from differential associations of plant species with microbes able to access different nutrient pools. Feedback dynamics result from changes in the soil community generated by the specificity of response in plant-microbe interactions. We suggest that positive feedback between plants and soil microbes plays a central role in early successional communities, while negative feedback contributes both to species replacements and to diversification in later successional communities. We further suggest that plant-microbe interactions in the soil are an important organizing force for large-scale spatial gradients in species richness. The relative balance of positive feedback (a homogenizing force) and negative feedback (a diversifying force) may contribute to observed latitudinal (and altitudinal) diversity patterns.

We conclude that the relationship between morphologically defined dispersal syndrome and long-distance dispersal is poor. This relationship is poor because the relationship between the morphology of dispersal units and the multiple processes that move seeds are often complex.

One of these is the speed with which a population can invade a new habitat. This invasion wave speed can be calculated from information on demography (in the form of a stage-structured matrix population model) and dispersal (in the form of a distribution of stage-specific dispersal distances). Wave speed complements population growth rate (X) as an index of population performance in conservation biology. Here we present a new way to calculate the sensitivity of wave speed to changes in short- and long-distance dispersal - indeed, to dispersal at any distance - using the order statistics of the dispersal distribution. This makes it possible to examine the effects of changing the distance dispersed by the longest-dispersing individual, the shortest, the median individual, etc. We apply the method to data on the Pied Flycatcher in the Netherlands, the Starling in the United States, and the Sparrowhawk in England and the Netherlands. We find that wave speed is vastly more sensitive to changes in the uppermost percentiles of the dispersal distribution than to changes elsewhere. The sensitivity results make it possible to carry out life table response experiment (LTRE) calculations, which quantify the contribution of demography, short-distance dispersal, and long-distance dispersal to interpopulation differences in wave speed. We find that 30% of the difference in wave speed between the Pied Flycatcher and the Starling is due to demography and about 70% to dispersal. Most of the dispersal effects come from the top 10% of the dispersal distribution. In contrast, 86% of the difference in wave speed between the two populations of Sparrowhawks is due to differences in demography, and about 14% to differences in dispersal. Again, most of the dispersal effects are due to the upper percentiles of the dispersal distribution.

Observations of mayflies in mesocosms provided no evidence that predator cues induced antipredator behaviors, such as reduced activity or increased crypsis. Surprisingly, late instar larvae swam more frequently in the presence of trout cues during the middle of the day, a behavior that could increase their vulnerability to visually feeding predators. Thus, larvae did not exhibit any traits expected to increase survival in the presence of trout cues.

In other words, we know that plant traits can vary widely for a given genotype, but we know little about the importance of trait-mediated interactions (TMI) among plants. Here, we discuss three major factors that affect the expression of phenotypic plasticity: variation in the abiotic environment, variation in the presence or identity of neighbors, and variation in herbivory. We consider how plastic responses to these factors might affect interactions among plants. Plastic responses to the abiotic environment have important consequences for conditionality in competitive effects, to the point of causing shifts from competitive to facilitative interactions. Because plants show a high degree of plasticity in response to neighbors, and even to the specific identify of neighbors, phenotypic plasticity may allow species to adjust to the composition of their communities, promoting coexistence and community diversity. Likewise, plastic responses to consumers may have various and counterintuitive consequences: induction of plant resistance, compensatory growth, and increased resource uptake may affect interactions among plants in ways that cannot be predicted simply by considering biomass lost to consumers. What little we know about TMI among plants suggests that they should not be ignored in plant community theory.

Theory suggests that the fraction of propagules that terminate dormancy each year should be <100% when recruitment success varies temporally. Moreover, the fraction of propagules that resumes development should vary across habitats that differ in the probability of successful recruitment or the probability of survival during dormancy. We tested these predictions by using dormant eggs from five populations of the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia pulicaria that differ in their ability to recruit to and persist in the water column. In two separate experiments, newly produced dormant eggs were incubated in situ for one year at various sites on the bottom of the lakes. A series of reciprocal transplants among four of these populations separated the effects of lake-specific environmental cues from the genetic and maternal effects of the different populations. Additional eggs were incubated in the laboratory under photoperiod-temperature combinations representative of those in the field. We found that the annual hatching fraction ranged from 6% to 50% among lakes, and that hatching fraction was primarily driven by environmental cues rather than being a result of the source of the eggs. However, laboratory incubations demonstrated significant differences among populations in the trajectories of the hatching curves, and a much higher rate of hatching than the field incubations.

Simulations demonstrated that population size and species diversity correlated with dispersal and increased downstream, but only if fecundity and death rates were such that neighborhoods within the system depended on external propagule input for their persistence. Highly effective downstream dispersal and some upstream dispersal were also required. If these demographic and dispersal criteria were met, communities with intense competition and inhibition still developed downstream increases in diversity. Additionally, in such systems, directional dispersal could favor species coexistence since upstream neighborhoods provided a refuge for inferior competitors.

We compared the soil properties and root distribution in shafts excavated into five mature nests and at 15 m distanced from each nest mound. We evaluated the nest effects on vegetation measuring the stem diameter growth of nine tree species and predawn leaf water potential of the tree species, Banara guianensis, along a gradient of increasing distance from the nest mounds. The growth of seedlings (Cecropia sp.) in pots containing different proportions of mineral soil and organic matter removed from nest refuse chambers was also compared. The deep soil beneath A. sexdens nests at different depths (100, 200, and 300 cm) presented a low (fivefold, P < 0.01) resistance to penetration and was rich in Ca (three- to fourfold, P = 0.06-0.02), K (7-14-fold, P < 0.05), and Mg (two- to threefold, P = 0.09 for 200 cm depth) when compared to non-nest soil. These changes in nest soil properties were accompanied by increases in coarse root biomass (>2 mm diameter, three- to fourfold) and fine root biomass (<2 mm, 10-50 fold). However, stem diameter growth was generally not affected by distance from the nest. The growth of Cecropia sp. seedlings in a pot experiment was favored by the addition of organic matter from the refuse chambers. Banara guianensis trees experienced greater water stress (low predawn water potential) close to the nest mound, perhaps indicating increased competition for soil water that may have accompanied the proliferation of roots of several species in the nest.

Patches currently occupied by parents are more likely to be infected than distant, potentially unoccupied, patches, thus advantaging dispersal.

We found that herbivory strongly reduced both density and growth of recruits for both species, whereas nutrient supply had minor effects on growth of Lobophora variegata recruits and no detectable effects on Sargassum fissifolium recruits. Notwithstanding the dominance of herbivory over nutrient effects, herbivory was not uniform, but varied both between species and among response variables (density and size), and was apparently stronger for nutrient-enriched plants. Our data demonstrate that the relative importance of bottom-up and top-down processes may depend on the species, circumstances, and life-history processes under consideration.

The ergosterol (fungal biomass) and starch concentration of fine roots, however, slightly declined in defoliated trees.

The dominant tubercle morphotypes were slightly more abundant in the control than in defoliated trees. In contrast to the relatively weak effects on vegetative ectomycorrhizae, reproduction declined near the defoliated pines. Average sporocarp numbers and, consequently, the relative fungal investment to reproduction of the estimated total fungal biomass were more than three times higher near controls than defoliated trees in the first treatment year. Defoliation also reduced the diversity of ectomycorrhizal species producing sporocarps. Mutualistic fungal symbionts may thus alter their reproductive investment in response to restrictions on host resources.

Here, we measured simultaneously a large suite of traits on damaged and undamaged siblings in 10 families of greenhouse-grown Raphanus raphanistrum plants. Traits measured were: leaf area, root biomass, shoot biomass, photosynthetic rate, trichome density, total glucosinolate concentration, flowering rate, petal size, total number of flowers, and total number of seeds. Pieris rapae larvae were used to damage plants to 50% leaf area removal. Using multiple regression, we examined which traits were the best predictors of tolerance. We considered both male tolerance (relative number of flowers produced by damaged and undamaged sibs) and female tolerance (relative number of seeds produced). We found that, generally, resistance traits were better predictors of both male and female tolerance than tolerance traits. Interestingly, we found that male and female tolerance were not correlated, and that male tolerance was significantly less variable than female tolerance. We also found that measurements of traits postdamage (induced state) were more informative than measurements on undamaged plants (constitutive state).

In particular, diel vertical migration by juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) has received considerable attention. We studied how changes in the light environment affect juvenile sockeye DVM in Alaskan lakes through changes in foraging rates and predation risk. Using hydroacoustics to track temporal changes in fish distribution, we found clear patterns of DVM and a strong, significant correlation between the mean depth of the sockeye and the amount of light at the lake surface. However, we could not detect diel changes in the depth distribution of fish large enough to be sockeye predators. Given a lack of diel vertical migration in the zooplankton community, it appears that juvenile sockeye were not simply tracking their food supply. Calculations of the in situ light experienced by individual juvenile sockeye suggested that they migrate to maintain a constant light environment. This light environment allowed the sockeye to exploit an antipredation window whereby they could forage on zooplankton while reducing the odds of visual detection by their predators. Furthermore, this antipredation window was continuous in early summer, but was split into two discrete time periods during the crepuscular hours in late summer. These data support the hypothesis that changes in habitat use by juvenile sockeye salmon reflect a dynamic strategy to minimize the ratio of predation risk to foraging gain that changes dramatically over the course of diel cycles in pelagic ecosystems.",134,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Antipredation window | Diel vertical migration | Feeding rate vs. predation risk | Foraging gain | Kokanee | Light environment | Oncorhynchus nerka | Predation risk | Sockeye salmon,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,259,NA,NA,NA,NA

We applied geometric morphometrics to describe the preference of pollinator species for different guide shapes. Our results revealed striking differences in the floral phenotypes preferred by insects and hummingbirds. Insects visited flowers with corollas 1.25-fold larger and guides 1.72-fold larger than the hummingbird species did. While insects preferred flowers with nectar guides pointing toward the corolla tube, the hummingbird preferred flowers with heart-shaped nectar guides. Most of the floral preferences shown by pollinators translated into significant linear and nonlinear selection coefficients. When selection was analyzed on a per-flower basis and for female fitness, corolla size was under positive directional selection, and nectar guide size and shape were under disruptive selection. Because the insect and hummingbird pollinators showed a strong segregation in their daily activity time, we suggest that current disruptive selection on the nectar guide phenotype can result from the differential availability of the rewarding floral variants over a day.

I addressed these questions by examining predator-induced plasticity in gray treefrog tadpoles (Hyla versicolor). Using aquatic mesocosms, I reared tadpoles with a constant absence of predators, a constant presence of predators, and the addition or removal of predators at three different times during their larval period. Tadpoles changed their phenotypic strategy over ontogeny; early in ontogeny they responded to predators by hiding, reducing their activity, and developing relatively deep tail fins. Later in ontogeny the tadpoles no longer employed behavioral defenses but relied on a combination of greater mass, deeper tails, and shorter bodies. The phenotypic changes were inducible throughout most of ontogeny, suggesting that there were few developmental windows. Activity, tail depth, and body depth were highly reversible early in ontogeny but less reversible later in ontogeny; because hiding was only used early in ontogeny, I could not assess its reversibility.

However, interactions between established residents and incoming juveniles may affect juvenile persistence in species-specific ways and could therefore impose a degree of determinism on future community structure. Using 16 spatially isolated communities of coral reef fishes, I conducted two experiments to determine how prior residency by two guilds of fishes affected juvenile recruitment. Each experiment factorially manipulated the presence and absence of two guilds: resident piscivores (groupers and moray eels) and interference competitors (territorial damselfishes). In the first experiment, guilds were manipulated via selective removals, and subsequent recruitment (larval settlement minus mortality) was monitored for 44 days. In the second experiment, guilds were placed within large cages to prevent direct resident-juvenile interactions, while allowing for any cues produced by enclosed fishes, thereby testing whether incoming larvae used resident-derived cues to select or reject settlement sites. Colonizing juveniles were collected from each reef over 42 days to prevent confounding resident- and recruit-derived cues. In the first experiment, piscivores inhibited recruitment of a damselfish (Pomacentridae) and a surgeonfish (Acanthuridae), and enhanced recruitment of a wrasse (Labridae). In contrast, territorial damselfishes inhibited recruitment of the damselfish and the wrasse, and enhanced recruitment of the surgeonfish. Observations of early recruitment patterns suggested that recruitment differences were established rapidly during the night or dawn periods shortly after settlement and before each daily census. In the second experiment, there was no evidence that larvae used resident-derived cues to select settlement sites, suggesting that recruitment differences in the first experiment resulted from differential mortality caused by direct resident-recruit-interactions rather than differential larval settlement. These results demonstrate that interactions between established residents and newly arrived juveniles can have a strong influence on juvenile persistence, and that such interactions appear to be strongest within hours of larval settlement.

However, experimental studies examining the importance of apparent competition in the field are sparse, especially in plant-herbivore systems. In this study, I examined the role of a beetle herbivore, Erynephala maritima, in mediating the indirect effects of an abundant host plant, Salicornia europaea, on a less common host species, Atriplex patula var. hastata, in New England salt marshes. To examine these relationships, I manipulated plant density (plants with vs. without neighbors) and composition (conspecific neighbors vs. Salicornia neighbors) surrounding focal Atriplex plants, as well as the presence or absence of herbivores in a field experiment. Densities of both beetle eggs and larvae were significantly greater in plots with Salicornia, suggesting that its presence increases patch location or selection by herbivores. Higher insect densities resulted in significantly higher levels of herbivore damage to Atriplex within Salicornia-addition plots compared with high- and low-density Atriplex plots. Thus the identity, and not just density, of neighboring plants is important in determining levels of herbivory. Increased herbivore damage in Salicornia-addition plots resulted in a concomitant decrease in Atriplex survival and reproductive output. Furthermore, the negative effect of Salicornia on Atriplex survival and fruit production only occurred in the presence of herbivores, indicating that competitive effects are indirect rather than direct. Thus, Salicornia has a strong apparent competitive effect on Atriplex. Cross-site surveys suggested that the pattern of increased herbivore damage to Atriplex associated with increases in local Salicornia density is common and widespread. Overall, the results suggest that the apparent competitive effect of Salicornia is likely a major determinant of patterns of Atriplex abundance both between habitat patches and across marsh zones.",53,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Apparent competition | Associational susceptibility | Atriplex patula var. hastata | Density-dependent predation | Erynephala maritima | Insect herbivory | Salicornia europaea | Salt marsh,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,264,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we explore whether models of positive interactions developed in southern New England can be applied to geographic scales. Salt marsh plants may interact positively by ameliorating harsh physical conditions such as salinity stress. Because marsh porewater salinities are higher in low- vs. high-latitude marshes, we tested the hypothesis that positive interactions are increasingly important at low latitudes. Previous work supported this hypothesis at the regional scale: within New England, positive interactions were rare in Maine but common in Rhode Island. We conducted parallel experiments in Georgia and Alabama to determine whether similar results would be obtained in a geographic comparison. Nine species of salt marsh plants were transplanted into control plots or plots with neighboring vegetation removed, in three marsh zones, at two sites each in Georgia and Alabama. Removing neighbors increased porewater salinities; nevertheless, plants usually performed best in neighbor-removal treatments, indicating that most interactions were competitive rather than facilitative. Several mechanisms might explain these results. For widely distributed species, southern individuals may be more salt tolerant than northern conspecifics. We tested this hypothesis by comparing the salt tolerance of northern and southern conspecifics of three species in a common garden experiment. In two species, southern plants were more salt tolerant than northern conspecifics. Although this pattern may explain the rarity of facilitation in the south for some species, it cannot explain our overall results because few species were studied in both geographic regions. The most likely explanation for our results is that northern marsh floras are dominated by salt-sensitive species that are likely to be facilitated by neighbors, whereas southern marsh floras are dominated by salt-tolerant species that are unlikely to benefit substantially from neighbor amelioration of soil salinities. These results illustrate the difficulties inherent in extrapolating results from even well understood systems to different geographic locations or scales.

One assemblage occupies vernal ponds lacking large dragonfly predators and fish; four are largely confined to temporary ponds that typically contain dragonfly predators; one dominates fishless permanent ponds and lakes where dragonflies are the top predators; and one dominates permanent ponds and lakes where fish are the top predators. We determined the role of life history and predation in maintaining this striking pattern by conducting a series of transplant experiments in the field and a laboratory experiment manipulating presence and absence of local predators. Life history (1) shaped the ability of species to cope with drying regime, thereby excluding temporary-pond Lestes from vernal ponds and permanent-water Lestes from temporary ponds, and (2) generated size differences among species due to differences in the timing of hatching. This mediated the exclusion of temporary-pond Lestes from permanent water bodies through asymmetric intraguild predation by permanent-water Lestes. Dragonfly predation on permanent-water Lestes had an indirect positive effect on the survival of temporary-pond Lestes; however, this effect apparently is too small to allow coexistence of both Lestes groups. Predation by large dragonfly larvae excluded the Lestes species of vernal ponds from temporary ponds, and differential vulnerability to large dragonfly larvae and fish shaped the reciprocal dominance of L. eurinus and L. vigilax in fishless and fish-containing permanent water bodies, respectively.

Understanding the fundamental components defining these communities is essential if conservation and restoration are to be successful. We examined the structure of plant-pollinator communities in a dynamic Mediterranean landscape, comprising a mosaic of post-fire regenerating habitats, and which is a recognized global hotspot for bee diversity. Each community was characterized by a highly skewed species abundance distribution, with a few dominant and many rare bee species, and was consistent with a log series model indicating that a few environmental factors govern the community. Floral community composition, the quantity and quality of forage resources present, and the geographic locality organized bee communities at various levels: (1) The overall structure of the bee community (116 species), as revealed through ordination, was dependent upon nectar resource diversity (defined as the variety of nectar volume-concentration combinations available), the ratio of pollen to nectar energy, floral diversity, floral abundance, and post-fire age. (2) Bee diversity, measured as species richness, was closely linked to floral diversity (especially of annuals), nectar resource diversity, and post-fire age of the habitat. (3) The abundance of the most common species was primarily related to post-fire age, grazing intensity, and nesting substrate availability. Ordination models based on age-characteristic post-fire floral community structure explained 39-50% of overall variation observed in bee community structure. Cluster analysis showed that all the communities shared a high degree of similarity in their species composition (27-59%); however, the geographical location of sites also contributed a smaller but significant component to bee community structure.

To investigate how changes in land use and climate might affect future chlorophyll conditions in these lakes, we created a nonlinear model for lake chlorophyll that considers the effects of these factors. Parameters were estimated for northern Wisconsin lakes. We show that resilience of the clear-water state in a single lake is maximized when P inputs are low, DOC is high, and angler pressure is low. We simulated a population of lakes to understand the current distribution of chlorophyll and resilience across lakes in the landscape. Under current conditions of land and lake use in the area, the model indicates that most lakes in the region are resilient clear-water lakes. Low chlorophyll levels, however, do not guarantee resiliency. Resilience shows a bimodal distribution suggesting that, with stochastic shocks or changing conditions, more lakes could shift to a high chlorophyll state that is costly to remediate. We also simulated a limnological comparative study to determine what conclusions would be drawn from a common research method if lacustrine ecosystem dynamics are indeed faithfully generated by our model. We show that phosphorus input will most often appear to be the most significant driver of lake chlorophyll levels, despite the fact that all mechanisms (including DOC and grazing) drive the dynamics.

However, ecologists have often overlooked the consequences of this variation for local communities by assuming that species occupying similar trophic positions are functionally similar. There have been few experimental tests of this important assumption. We tested the assumption of functional similarity by comparing the effect of six different predators (three fish and three salamander species) on an ensemble of larval anuran prey. Our experiment identified substantial variation in the impact of different predators on a variety of responses. Differences among predators in their selection of prey caused the structure of the larval anuran ensemble to vary continuously as opposed to producing discrete alternative states. Predators also differed in their ability to suppress either the total number or biomass of anurans. Thus, performance of larval anurans was dependent upon the identity of the predator. Moreover, the identity of predators judged similar and their degree of similarity depends on the specific response variable. In our study we found no predominance of weak or strong interactors, as predators appear to be evenly distributed along a gradient of interaction strengths. Knowledge of the identity of the species occupying a particular trophic position is crucial to predicting the impact of that trophic position on a community.

Such dispersal protects seeds from attack by species-specific bruchid beetles by (1) covering them in protective fecal material and (2) placing them in sites distant from conspecific adult tree aggregations, where beetles are less active. Endocarps distant from parent patches survived bruchid attack at a significantly higher rate than those in parent patches, as did in-feces endocarps compared to clean endocarps. A significant interaction effect between distance from patches and feces treatment showed that feces conferred protection to seeds within a parent patch but did not appear to confer additional protection to seeds already protected by distance from the parent patch. A mesoscale map compiled from aerial photography, satellite imagery, and air- and ground-truthing revealed an aggregated pattern of M. maripa palms associated with tapir latrine sites, supporting the view that long-distance seed dispersal by tapirs is responsible for the generation of palm patches and potentially important in forest-savanna boundary dynamics.

In this paper, we identify several mechanisms by which herbivores can indirectly affect decomposer organisms and soil processes through altering the quantity and quality of resources entering the soil. We show that these mechanisms are broadly similar in nature for both foliar and root herbivory, regardless of whether they operate in the short term as a result of physiological responses of individual plants to herbivore attack or long-term following alteration of plant community structure by herbivores and subsequent changes in the quality of litter inputs to soil. We propose that a variety of possible mechanisms is responsible for the idiosyncratic nature of herbivore effects on soil biota and ecosystem function; positive, negative, or neutral effects of herbivory are possible depending upon the balance of these different mechanisms. However, we predict that positive effects of herbivory on soil biota and soil processes are most common in ecosystems of high soil fertility and high consumption rates, whereas negative effects are most common in unproductive ecosystems with low consumption rates. The significance of multiple-species herbivore communities is also emphasized, and we propose that if resource use complementarity among herbivore species or functional groups leads to greater total consumption of phytomass, and thus greater net herbivory, then both positive and negative consequences of increasing herbivore diversity for belowground properties and processes are theoretically possible. Research priorities are highlighted and include a need for comparative studies of herbivore impacts on above- and belowground processes across ecosystems of varying productivity, as well as a need for experimental testing of the influence of antiherbivore defense compounds on complex multitrophic interactions in the rhizosphere and the significance of multiple herbivore species communities on these plant-soil interactions.",719,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Decomposition | Ecosystem function | Herbivores | Multitrophic interactions | Nutrient mineralization | Plant litter | Root herbivores | Soil biota | Soil fauna,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,274,NA,NA,NA,NA

The dominant soluble-N form differed greatly between grasslands. Inorganic N (especially nitrate N) dominated the soluble N pool of the highly productive improved grassland whereas amino acid N was the dominant soluble N form in the low-productivity unimproved grassland. There was no difference in the amount of 15N taken up by plants from the two N forms in either grassland. However, our data indicate that amino-acid N was taken up directly by plants of both grasslands and that more N was captured in this way by plants of low-productivity grassland where amino acids were the dominant soluble N form in soil. Our data from both grasslands also indicate significant microbial competition for added 15N from both N sources, but especially in the low-productivity grassland where the bulk of 15N added was sequestered by the microbial biomass. A significantly greater amount of added 15N was captured by the microbial biomass in the unimproved than in the improved grassland, and substantially more 15N was detected in the microbial biomass than in plant tissue in the unimproved grassland. On the basis of our findings, we predict that subsequent microbial turnover and release of this N into the plant-soil system is the major pathway for plant N capture in these temperate grasslands.

Using a new application of laser and digital video imaging technologies, we quantified cercarial movements in still water and in simulated field flows. In still water, downward swimming in response to light, irrespective of intensity or source, and gravity brought larvae to the bottom three-times faster than gravitational sinking alone.

The mean downward swim speed (0.59 cm/s at 24°C) was three times faster than turbulent fluctuations (w′ = 0.23 cm/s), indicating that cercariae overpowered eddies to reach the bed. When flume flows simulated rare storm events (μ* = 0.8 cm/s, w′ = 0.95 cm/s, occurring ≤1% of the time), turbulence overwhelmed behavioral effects and homogeneously mixed larvae throughout the water column.

There was also a significant effect of dominant grass species on the utilization of heather within 50 cm of the grass-patch edge, with utilization around Agrostis/Festuca patches (most, preferred) being greater than around Nardus-dominated patches, and lowest around patches of Molinia. The greatest contribution to variation in heather utilization was at the smallest scale, and variance components decreased as spatial scale increased, making it impossible to predict local heather utilization (i.e., at the scale of individual plants and of individual bites by foraging ungulates) from large-scale parameters alone, such as herbivore density.

An historical contingency model based on biogeographic region explained 58% of the variance. A combined climate-region model accounted for 78% of the variance, but 52% comprised the overlap between these effects. This suggests that further resolution of contemporary vs. historical processes at the global level will require the inclusion of phylogenetic information. Regional-extent regression models suggest a latitudinal shift in constraints on diversity; measures of ambient energy (potential evapotranspiration and mean annual temperature) best predicted the diversity gradient at high latitudes, whereas water-related variables (actual evapotranspiration and annual rainfall) best predicted richness in low-latitude, high-energy regions. Intraregional spatial autocorrelation analysis confirmed that climatic models adequately describe geographic richness patterns at all but the smallest spatial scales resolved by the analysis.

By contrast, in marine systems, dispersal at regional scales may drive local dynamics, because many species may have large mean dispersal distances. To assess variation in marine dispersal scales, we estimated mean dispersal distances from genetic isolation-by-distance slopes. Estimates ranged widely, from a few meters to hundreds of kilometers. Dispersal differed among taxonomic groups (macroalgae, invertebrates, and fish) and among species in different functional groups (e.g., producers and herbivores). Differences in dispersal scale have important implications for marine community dynamics, reserve design, responses to large-scale perturbations, and evolution of interacting species. To place genetic estimates of marine dispersal in context, we compared them to other measures of dispersal in the ocean and to estimates of dispersal on land. Maximum scales of dispersal by sedentary marine species exceeded maximum estimates of terrestrial plant dispersal by at least one to two orders of magnitude. Direct and genetic estimates of terrestrial plant dispersal were comparable to estimates of marine plant dispersal. Rates of marine macroalgal range expansion, however, far exceeded spread rates of terrestrial plants. Terrestrial plant spread rates were more similar to those of short-dispersing marine organisms that lack secondary dispersal by drifting adults. Genetic estimates of dispersal by different functional groups suggest that herbivores typically disperse much farther than their plant resources both on land and in the sea, although the timing, frequency, and consequences of dispersal may differ in the two systems. Terrestrial herbivores have more flexible dispersal behavior than marine organisms that disperse each generation by planktonic transport of larvae. Our results validate some long-standing views about the greater dispersal potential of species in the ocean, but also highlight the extreme heterogeneity in dispersal scale among marine species.

However, these experiments have been hindered by the fact that the traits most important to adaptation and speciation may be fixed within populations. Experimental hybridization offers a means to circumvent this problem since crosses can be made between populations or species that differ for the trait of interest. Here, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this approach, review results from published studies, and suggest strategies for future experiments. Advantages associated with this approach include the ability to ""generate"" variation for traits of interest, as well as the increased sensitivity of selection assays because of the wider range of trait values characteristic of segregating hybrids. Moreover, experimental hybridization can be extended to crosses between near-isogenic lines, allowing the effects of major quantitative trait loci (QTLs) to be dissected in a well-defined genetic background. Limitations include widespread linkage disequilibrium created by hybridization, possible cosegregation of hybrid incompatibilities, and the large number of variable traits likely to affect hybrid fitnesses. Even with these limitations, this basic approach has been remarkably successful. We now know, for example, that many morphological differences between divergent populations or species are under selection and that the selection gradients may be surprisingly large. Also, small genetic changes in premating barriers may have large effects on assortative mating. With respect to discussions about the role of hybridization in evolution, experiments indicate that some hybrid trait combinations may be advantageous, particularly when the hybrid populations are placed in a new environment. Future studies seem likely to combine selection measurements with genetic mapping of the QTLs underlying the selected traits.

Cross-transfer experiments demonstrated that this plastic response in egg size is reversible. Interestingly, this pattern parallels an almost universal temperature-induced developmental response in ectotherm body size. In both cases, however, we do not yet understand the underlying mechanisms or the potential adaptive significance. By cross-transferring the experimentally manipulated eggs between temperatures, we showed that the larger eggs produced at a lower temperature had a higher hatching success, and yielded larger hatchlings with a slightly higher probability of reaching maturity and shorter larval development time (at the lower temperature) compared to the smaller eggs produced at a higher temperature. Overall, the lower temperature was slightly more detrimental for smaller than for larger eggs. The slight differences in survival across temperatures, together with more substantial differences in fecundity, indicate that it could pay off to produce fewer but larger offspring (with increased fitness) at a lower temperature, but more and smaller offspring at a higher temperature where offspring survival was generally high. Our data present for the first time evidence that selection may favor larger eggs at a lower temperature, and thus that a plastic response of egg size to temperature in ectotherms could be adaptive.",170,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Acclimation | Bicyclus anynana | Butterfly egg size | Ectotherm body size | Egg cross-transfers | Egg size | Lepidoptera | Life-history plasticity | Offspring performance | Reproductive allocation | Temperature,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,282,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we describe an experimental evaluation of the effects of season and vegetation on annual N cycling in the understory heath vegetation of a subarctic birch forest. Our approach was to follow the partitioning of an isotopically enriched 15NH4Cl addition between microbes, plants, and the soil solution at intervals through winter, and in the following summer. To investigate the direct influence of vegetation on ecosystem N cycling, the isotope was added to control plots and to plots from which plants had been removed early in the previous growing season. Our results indicate that the dynamics of both microbial carbon and N were similar in treatment and control plots, suggesting that the presence of intact plants had negligible influence on seasonal patterns of microbial growth or N accumulation in the soils of this ecosystem. Instead, ecosystem N cycling was dominated by a substantial turnover of recently acquired N from microbes during the winter-summer transition that corresponded to a significant increase in understory plant 15N uptake. Vascular plant 15N uptake and accumulation in belowground tissue was substantial at the onset of winter, but ceased once full winter conditions developed. By contrast, there was a rapid resumption of vascular plant N uptake and strong allocation to aboveground tissue at the onset of summer. Vascular plant types varied strongly in 15N enhancement, depending on physiological differences in N uptake capacity as well as differences in biomass. In particular, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Vaccinium myrtillus, and the herbs exhibited strong 15N acquisition capacities, despite their relatively low biomass. We found no consistent evidence that the evergreen vs. deciduous leaf habit contributed to species differences in N uptake capacity. Species capacity for allocation of 15N to new shoot tissue was closely correlated with aboveground production per unit total N and tended to be greatest in herbs and V. myrtillus, suggesting that inherent physiological capacities for N uptake and tissue allocation are important determinants of species productivity. Our results suggest a hierarchy of controls on annual N cycling. The importance of wintertime influences on annual ecosystem N cycling was indicated by ongoing net mineralization by microbes beneath snow cover and a critical N release from microbes during the winter-summer transition. By contrast, plant N uptake was confined to the snow-free season. Thus, seasonal environmental changes caused a rapid microbial turnover of recently acquired N that then became available for plant uptake in the subsequent growing season. Although vascular plant species appeared to compete strongly with each other to acquire this N, neither their presence nor their total N uptake appreciably affected microbial N-cycling activity. Together, these results suggest that season exerts primary control on annual N cycling in this ecosystem, and that its effect on microbial N turnover is a major process supplying N to plants. By comparison, the effects of understory vegetation on N cycling were small within the time frame of this experiment.",90,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,15 N isotope | Annual N cycling | Birch forest | Heath | Microbial N cycling | Productivity | Seasonal effects | Species traits | Spring thaw | Subarctic | Understory vegetation | Vaccinium spp.,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,283,NA,NA,NA,NA

Ecological models ignore most forms of variability, because they make statistical models complex, and they pose computational challenges. Variability associated with space, time, and among individuals that is not accommodated by demographic models can make parameter estimates and growth rate predictions unrealistic. I adapt a hierarchical approach to the problem of estimating population growth rates and their uncertainties when individuals vary and that variability cannot be assigned to specific causes. In contrast to an overfitted model that would assign a different parameter value to each individual, hierarchical models accommodate individual differences, but assume that those differences derive from an underlying distribution - they belong to a ""population.""

Unfortunately, the scale and predictability of larval dispersal and its regulation by physical circulation remains unknown due largely to the impossibility of measuring dispersal in open marine environments. Here we exploit strong genetic differentiation among marine mussel populations in southwest England to measure larval dispersal among adjoining genetic patches. This approach allows estimates of larval dispersal over relatively great distances. We combine these measurements with results from a high-resolution model of coastal circulation to test the hypothesis that larval dispersal is regulated by physical circulation. We show that larval dispersal typically occurs over distances of ∼30 km but in some cases was at least 64 km.

In three field experiments, we manipulated the parasitoid, then the generalist predator guild, and finally both classes of natural enemy, and recorded resulting impacts on pea aphid population control. The parasitoid caused little immediate reduction in aphid population growth but caused a large decline after a delay corresponding to the generation time of the parasitoid. In contrast, the generalist guild caused an immediate decline in the aphid population growth rate. However, the generalists did not exert density-dependent control, so aphid densities continued to increase throughout the experiment. The third field experiment in which we simultaneously manipulated parasitoids and predators investigated the possibility of ""nonadditive effects"" on aphid control. Densities of parasitoid pupae were 50% lower in the presence of generalist predators, indicating intraguild predation. Nonetheless, the ratio of parasitoids to aphids was not changed, and the impact of the two types of natural enemies was additive. We constructed a stage-structured model of aphid, parasitoid, and predator dynamics and fit the model to data from our field experiments. The model supports the additivity of parasitoid and predator effects on aphid suppression but suggests that longer-term experiments (32 d rather than 20 d) would likely reveal nonadditive effects as predation removes parasitoids whose response to aphid densities occurs with a delay. The model allowed us to explore additional factors that could influence the additivity of parasitoid and predator effects. Aphid density-dependent population growth and predator immigration in response to aphid density would likely have little influence on the additivity between parasitism and predation. However, if a parasitoid were to show a strong Type II functional response, in contrast to A. ervi whose functional response is nearly Type I, interactions with predators would likely be synergistic.

Theory predicts that induced defenses should be costly in the absence of a predator threat. No costs have been found for these defenses after metamorphosis. In this study, we tested for induced defenses in western toads, Bufo boreas, and measured larval and postmetamorphic consequences of these responses. Larvae were raised in either the presence or absence of nonlethal predator cues. Defense responses to these larval treatments were measured during the larval stage and shortly after metamorphosis using both predator bioassays and quantification of the putative chemical defense common in toads, bufadienolides. We found no differences in larval morphology, growth rate, or development rate between the predator and control treatments. In the larval bioassays, some types of invertebrate predators consumed significantly fewer of the B. boreas larvae that were reared with predator cues compared to the control treatments. Bufadienolides were not present in B. boreas larvae. In the postmetamorphic bioassays, tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) had longer handling times when consuming B. boreas that had developed in larval environments without predator cues compared to predator-treatment B. boreas. However, postmetamorphic B. boreas from predator cue larval environments had significantly higher concentrations of bufadienolides than did those from larval environments without predators, suggesting that these defenses are ineffective against tiger salamanders.

We examined whether the soil community associated with P. serotina trees has continued negative effects on seedling growth. P. serotina seedlings and saplings were harvested after being followed for 1-3 years in the field, and above- and belowground biomasses were measured. Linear regression models including distance to adult P. serotina tree, conspecific seedling density, and seedling age explained 13.9% of the variation in biomass. Distance and age were positively correlated with total biomass, while density was negatively correlated with total biomass. A similar model for saplings established prior to the beginning of the study, and of unknown age, predicted 11.3% of the variation in total biomass, with distance to adult positively correlated with biomass. To separate the effects of distance from density and remove confounding environmental factors, seedlings were grown in the greenhouse at high or low density in soil collected 0-5 m or 25-30 m from adult P. serotina trees. Half of the soil collected at each distance was sterilized by autoclaving. The experiment was repeated in 1998 and 1999, and in both years there was a significant sterilization-by-distance interaction. Sterilization of soil collected close to the tree resulted in higher root:shoot ratios, while sterilization of soil collected away from the tree resulted in lower root:shoot ratios. This suggests that soil biota vary with distance to adults and that elimination of soil biota changes plant allocation patterns differentially with distance. Distance-dependent effects of soilborne pathogens may continue beyond seedling mortality and suppress juvenile growth.

Patchy provision of soil-based resources can affect the location of root biomass, as roots often proliferate in nutrient-rich patches. Root system size is important in determining whether plants access nutrient-rich patches, and the proportion of root systems located within such patches. This proportion will alter as growth proceeds. Species with small root systems have a limited ability to place roots in nutrient-rich patches even when they are very close. Of four species with different root system sizes, the growth of the species with the smallest root system was significantly limited by being located in nutrient-poor substrate even when nutrient-rich substrate was only 3.5 cm away, whereas three species with larger root systems were not disadvantaged. Both in the laboratory and in the field, root density is higher in nutrient-rich patches, and such patches can contain roots of many plants. Recent work showing that plants can respond to non-self roots sharing the same nutrient supply suggests that competition will be more severe in nutritionally patchy substrates than in homogeneous environments with the same overall nutrient supply. Taken together, these facts lead to the prediction that inter- and intraspecific plant interactions will be influenced by patterns of nutrient supply. We present evidence supporting this prediction, and indicating that population and community structure are also affected by patterns of nutrient supply. Significant differences in population yield, plant size distribution, and mortality have been recorded between populations growing under patchy and uniform conditions. Plant communities grown from identical seed inocula, with the same overall nutrient supply, provided in different spatial and temporal patterns, differed by up to 44% in total biomass, up to 70% in root biomass, and differed in species composition.

Mechanisms responsible for maintaining these state differences were studied by manipulating various features of their boundary regions. Urchins in the barren areas had significantly smaller gonads than those in adjacent kelp stands, implying that food was a limiting resource for urchins in the barrens. The abundance of drift algae and living foliose algae varied abruptly across the boundary between kelp beds and barren areas. These observations raise the question of why urchins from barrens do not invade kelp stands to improve their fitness. By manipulating kelp and urchin densities at boundary regions and within kelp beds, we tested the hypothesis that kelp stands inhibit invasion of urchins. Urchins that were experimentally added to kelp beds persisted and reduced kelp abundance until winter storms either swept the urchins away or caused them to seek refuge within crevices. Urchins invaded kelp bed margins when foliose algae were removed but were prevented from doing so when kelps were replaced with physical models. The sweeping motion of kelps over the seafloor apparently inhibits urchins from crossing the boundary between kelp stands and barren areas, thus maintaining these alternate stable states. Our findings suggest that kelp stands are able to defend themselves from their most important herbivores by combining their flexible morphology with the energy of wave-generated surge.

However, interrelations between ordination techniques and diversity measurements are seldom explicated and are mainly ignored by many field ecologists. This paper starts from the notion of the species occurrence table, which provides a unifying formulation for different kinds of taxonomic data. Here it is demonstrated that alternative species weightings can be used to equate the total inertia of a centered-by-species occurrence table with common diversity indices, such as species richness, Simpson diversity, or Shannon information. Such an equation defines two main ordination strategies related to two different but consistent measures of species diversity. The first places emphasis on scarce species and is based on Correspondence Analysis and species richness (CA-richness strategy). The second, in which abundant species are prominent, relies on Non-Symmetric Correspondence Analysis and Simpson diversity (NSCA-Simpson strategy). Both strategies are suitable for measuring α and β diversity by analyzing the centered-by-species occurrence table with respect to external environmental or instrumental variables. In this paper, these two strategies are applied to ecological data obtained in a Neotropical rainforest plot. The results are then discussed with respect to the intrinsic characteristics of the community under analysis, and also to the broad classes of floro-faunistic data used in ecology (i.e., data gathered from museum or herbarium collections, exhaustive inventories in a reference plot, or enumeration through species-by-relevés tables).

However, if a species reacts to the presence of a second species by altering its phenotype, then the trait changes in the reacting species can alter the per capita effect of the reacting species on other species and, consequently, population density or fitness of the other species. Such trait-mediated indirect interactions can reinforce or oppose density-mediated effects and have been largely overlooked by community ecologists. We first briefly develop the case for the broad mechanistic basis for TMIIs and then review the direct evidence for TMIIs in various permutations of simple three- to four-species food webs. We find strong evidence for quantitatively significant effects of TMIIs in a variety of aquatic and terrestrial systems. We further highlight those few studies that address the question of the relative magnitudes of density- and trait-mediated effects and the role of species densities in their transmission. These studies indicate that trait effects are often as strong or stronger than density effects.

Ponds (patches) differed in the presence or absence of trout. Densities of late instar larvae were more than an order of magnitude greater in fishless ponds. Estimates of adult production, migration, and oviposition rate were used to determine whether the difference in larval abundance between pond types was more consistent with a source-sink or balanced dispersal model. Patch quality among ponds (estimated by the emergence rate of adults) varied from 0 to ∼3900 individuals m-2yr-1, and was significantly lower in ponds with trout. Survivorship of adult females in the regional terrestrial habitat was low (1.7%). Consistent with the predictions of source-sink theory, local recruitment to the next generation was not related to local emergence. Moreover, comparison of emergence and recruitment revealed that some ponds were net exporters of females (sources) and others were net importers (sinks). Ovipositing females did not avoid ovipositing in ponds with trout. Overall, the data were consistent with a source-sink dynamic because patches differed in quality, and because there was net migration of individuals from sources to sinks.

Furthermore, most studies have been unable to separate the influence of juvenile survival and age-specific breeding proportions on recruitment. We used a recently developed approach, based on capture-mark-recapture methods, in which local recruitment is analyzed in a multistate model with an unobservable ""nonbreeder"" state. The data are drawn from a long-term study of a long-lived, arctic-nesting bird, the Greater Snow Goose (Chen caerulescens atlantica), and include marking and recaptures of female goslings and breeding adult females of unknown age between 1990 and 2000. The model considers four parameters: the probability that an individual aged i with no breeding experience starts breeding (ai), juvenile and adult apparent survival (Φ), and capture probability of breeders (p). The flexibility achieved allows us to assess the influence of environmental conditions encountered during early life and at breeding on juvenile survival and the probabilities of starting to breed at a given age. Recruitment was a gradual process (probability of starting to breed at age 2 yr = 0.25 [95% CI, 0.12-0.45]; at age 3 yr = 0.57 [0.20-0.87]) and was completed by age 4 yr (i.e., all remaining immature females started to breed at that age). Juvenile survival was higher in early-hatched than in late-hatched females. Juvenile survival varied considerably among cohorts, but our environmental covariates could not explain these differences. Probabilities of starting to breed were less variable, except in lemming crash years, when they were considerably reduced. Snow cover at breeding or hatch date did not affect probabilities of starting to breed. These results suggest that environmental conditions can have an impact on life histories of birds in seasonal environments, but that variations in juvenile survival probably account for most of the fluctuation in the proportion of birds from a cohort that recruit into the breeding population.

Results from these dispersal studies were used to predict the natural distributions and to characterize the spatial population structure of P. crocea. Planthopper emigration loss per patch increased linearly with the density of female conspecifics and was nonlinearly related to patch size (small > large > intermediate sized patches). Planthopper spatial spread was diffusive and 2.7 times faster among cordgrass patches in a heterogeneous habitat (patches embedded in nonhost vegetation) than within a homogeneous habitat (pure cordgrass). Immigration by planthoppers was an increasing function of patch size but was independent of patch isolation (at the scale of this study). The natural distribution of planthoppers in a prairie fragment, obtained from a survey of 146 cordgrass patches over five generations, was well predicted from the dispersal experiments. Planthopper densities and patch occupancy rates were positively correlated with patch size (cordgrass patches ≥0.8 ha were continually occupied), but uncorrelated with patch isolation. Based on this survey; the rate of patch extinction was 21% per generation, highest in small and moderately isolated patches, and approximately equal to the recolonization rate per generation. Finally, the dynamics of local patch populations were asynchronous, even for patch pairs < 10 m apart.

Under this model, predators act in a predictable manner to suppress herbivore populations, freeing plant populations from the strong effects of herbivory. However, empirical work has recently demonstrated that many predators exhibit trophic-level omnivory, consuming both herbivores and other predators. This creates a problem for terrestrial ecologists: predator function is indeterminate, because predators may operate from either the third trophic level (""intermediate predators"") or the fourth trophic level (""omnivorous top predators"") and have opposite effects on herbivore and plant populations. Here we attempt to use a basic understanding of the foraging behavior of predators and their prey to make predictions about predator function. A simulation model produces four predictions: (1) actively foraging predators may be effective regulators of sedentary herbivore populations; (2) sit-and-wait predators are unlikely to suppress populations of sedentary herbivores, but may act as omnivorous top predators, suppressing populations of widely foraging intermediate predators and thereby increasing, herbivore densities; (3) among widely foraging predators attacking a common herbivore prey, predators that are large relative to the body size of their prey will be more mobile, and therefore more vulnerable to predation by sit-and-wait omnivores, compared to predators that are similar in size to their prey; and (4) widely foraging omnivores, unlike sit-and-wait omnivores, are unlikely to disrupt herbivore population suppression generated by intermediate predators, and may instead enhance herbivore suppression. These predictions appear to explain the results of several experimental studies of the function of predatory arthropods in terrestrial ecosystems.",55,Journal,re,Review,100,2,2,Biological control | Food webs | Foraging behavior | Generalist predator | Herbivore population suppression | Higher order predation | Indirect effects | Individual-based model | Intraguild predation | Omnivory | Trophic cascades,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,310,NA,NA,NA,NA

We assembled all available biomass time series for a well-documented predator-prey couple, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), to test whether the temporal dynamics of these populations are consistent with the ""top-down"" or the ""bottom-up"" hypothesis. Eight out of nine regions showed inverse correlations of cod and shrimp biomass supporting the ""top-down"" view. Exceptions occurred only close to the southern range limits of both species. Random-effects meta-analysis showed that shrimp biomass was strongly negatively related to cod biomass, but not to ocean temperature in the North Atlantic Ocean. In contrast, cod biomass was positively related to ocean temperature. The strength of the cod-shrimp relationship, however, declined with increasing mean temperature. These results show that changes in predator populations can have strong effects on prey populations in oceanic food webs, and that the strength of these interactions may be sensitive to changes in mean ocean temperature. This means that the effects of overfishing in the ocean cascade down to lower trophic levels, as has been shown previously for lakes and coastal seas.

We tested these predictions by comparing exotic and native species diversity of vascular plants across five spatial scales in riparian and upland plant communities in the southern Appalachians. We found a positive relationship between species diversity and exotic invasion in riparian areas at large scales (100 m2), which graded into a negative relationship at small scales (0.01 m2).

We examined how heterogeneity in understory cover, mineral nutrients, and moisture and their interactions with canopy gaps contribute to the coexistence of three common, co-occuring tree species. We measured survival and height growth of 1080 seedlings of Acer rubrum (red maple), Liriodendron tulipifera (yellow poplar), and Quercus rubra (red oak) that were planted in one of five understory treatments: removal of understory vegetation, trenched, trenched plus removal of understory vegetation, fertilization, and a control. Understory treatments were replicated in 12 paired gap and canopy environments. Survivorship varied among species, with Q. rubra having the highest probability of surviving beyond the 1135-day experiment (probability = 0.64), followed by A. rubrum (probability = 0.27) and L. tulipifera (probability = 0.07). Although canopy gaps and understory treatments had large effects on survivorship, species survival rankings changed little across microenvironments; Q. rubra had the highest survival in all microenvironments. In contrast to survival, L. tulipifera had a relative growth rate for height that was three times greater than that of A. rubrum and Q. rubra in high-resource microenvironments. There was broad overlap among species in relative growth rates in trie remaining seven microenvironments, with no clear top-ranked species. Differences in seedling growth and survival across these 10 microenvironments may contribute to the coexistence of two of the three species studied, L. tulipifera and Q. rubra, but not A. rubrum, Q. rubra had higher survival than A. rubrum and L. tulipifera in all microenvironments, but L. tulipifera tended to grow faster than A. rubrum and Q. rubra in high-resource microenvironments. Despite the generally poor performance of A. rubrum, it was the only surviving species in some quadrats at the end of the experiment, indicating that stochastic effects, in conjunction with broad niche overlap, may also contribute to species coexistence.

To determine the historical role of fire on western Vancouver Island (British Columbia, Canada), we constructed a long-term spatially explicit fire history and examined the spatial and temporal distribution of fire during the Holocene. Two fire-history parameters (time-since-fire [TSF] and fire extent) were related to three landscape parameters (landform [hill slope or terrace], aspect, and forest composition) at 83 sites in a 730-ha low-elevation (less than ∼200 m) area of a mountainous watershed. We dated fires using tree rings (18 sites) and 120 soil-charcoal radiocarbon dates (65 sites). Comparisons among multiple radiocarbon dates indicated a high probability that the charcoal dated at each site represented the most recent fire, though we expect greater error in TSF estimates at sites where charcoal was very old (>6000 yr) and was restricted to mineral soil horizons. TSF estimates ranged from 64 to ∼12 220 yr; 45% of the sites have burned in the last 1000 yr, whereas 20% of the sites have not burned for over 6000 yr. Differences in median TSF were more significant between landform types or across aspects than among forest types. Median TSF was significantly greater on terraces (4410 yr) than on hill slopes (740 yr). On hill slopes, all south-facing and southwest-facing sites have burned within the last 1000 yr compared to only 27% of north- and east-facing sites burning over the same period. Comparison of fire dates among neighboring sites indicated that fires rarely extended >250 m. During the late Holocene, landform controls have been strong, resulting in the bias of fires to south-facing hillslopes and thus allowing late-successional forest structure to persist for thousands of years in a large portion of the watershed. In contrast, the early Holocene regional climate and forest composition likely resulted in larger landscape fires that were not strongly controlled by landform factors.

We observed that, in the absence of predators, slower growing pipevine swallowtail (Battus philenor) larvae had higher mortality compared to faster growing larvae during the unseasonably cool spring temperatures of 1998. However, this was not true for the warmer spring of 1999. Laboratory experiments showed that the probability of surviving a chill coma increased with larval mass.

Both species exist among discrete patches of prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata), the sole host plant of P. crocea. Based on out-planted cordgrass pots bearing host eggs (to assess parasitism) or sticky leaves (traps for adult A. columbi), I found that the distribution of adult female A. columbi and pattern of ovipositions within a cordgrass patch were strongly matrix dependent. Female densities were 59% lower on the edge than interior of patches embedded in a mudflat matrix, but were evenly distributed within patches embedded in a matrix consisting of either native grasses or the exotic grass smooth brome (Bromus inermis). In contrast, parasitism was higher in the interior than edge for patches in all three matrix types. The lack of correspondence between A. columbi density and parasitism was attributed to differences in oviposition behavior: A. columbi parasitized 71% more hosts per capita in the interior than edge for patches embedded in nonhost grasses, but equal numbers on the edge and interior of patches embedded in mudflat. Matrix-dependent differences in the within-patch distribution and oviposition behavior of A. columbi can influence the distribution of parasitism risk and host-parasitoid stability at the patch level. Matrix composition also affected the pattern of movement through the matrix and the colonization of nearby cordgrass patches. Anagrus columbi females emigrating from a mudflat-embedded patch were captured at very low, but constant, numbers with distance out into the matrix, suggesting that they were reluctant to enter or remain in the mudflat. In contrast, A. columbi females entering a nonhost grass matrix had numbers that were high near the patch border and then declined exponentially with distance. These patterns of movement were likely responsible for the very different colonization rates for experimental patches embedded in different matrix types and located 3 m from a source patch of A. columbi. Patches embedded in brome were colonized at a rate that was 3.0 and 5.7 times higher than for patches in native grass or mudflat, respectively. Finally, based on a census of cordgrass patches spanning five generations, A. columbi densities and proportion of patches occupied generally increased with increasing host density, patch isolation, and the proportion of the surrounding matrix that was mudflat. Patch size had no effect on the distribution of A. columbi. Overall, these data suggest that cordgrass patches in a nonhost grass matrix, particularly smooth brome, have high connectivity relative to patches in a mudflat matrix.

Our work illustrates how spatiotemporal covariation in settlement density and site quality can obscure patterns of density dependence at larger scales, contributing to a phenomenon we call ""cryptic density dependence.""

Drawing on the historically documented mismatch in nitrogen stoichiometry between herbivores and their host plants (C:Nplants ≫ C:Nherbivores), and a recently documented, though smaller, difference in nitrogen content between predators and their herbivore prey (C:Nherbivores > C:N predators), we discuss the existence of a trade-off between nutrient quality and quantity that occurs across trophic levels. The existence of this trade-off suggests that arthropod predators, which we show to be frequently nitrogen-limited in nature, can enhance their nitrogen intake by broadening their diet to include nitrogen-rich predators.
