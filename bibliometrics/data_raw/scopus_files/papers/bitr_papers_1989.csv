Species of hawkmoth flowers also decreased through the dry season, but several species began flowering before onset of the wet season and before the sudden increase in hawkmoth numbers that followed shortly after the first rains. Tube lengths of hawkmoth flowers ranged from 0-19 cm (mean 5.1 cm), matched by the range in length of hawkmoth tongues (1-20 cm, mean 4.9 cm).

Some flowers were always heavily visited, other species were virtually ignored. In less attractive flowers, nectar accumulated during the night and attracted a variety of diurnal visitors the following morning.

Severe droughts have occurred previously but without causing such extensive fires. This extensive burning is a result of forests becoming more fire-prone after disturbance by logging. Rates of tree mortality after drought and fire ranged from 38-94% in logged forests and 19-71% in unlogged forests, while for saplings rates of mortality exceeded 80% in both forest types. Secondary succession after logging was truncated by fire with the result that the post-fire condition of a forest logged 6 yr before fire was similar to that of a forest logged 2 yr before fire. The impact of fire differs from other natural or man-made gap forming processes in that most pre-existing seedlings and saplings are killed by fire. This left the regrowth in burnt forest depauperate in species diversity and in regeneration of upper-canopy species. Logged and burnt forests suffered severe canopy loss and the ground cover was dominated by grasses (eg Imperata cylindrica) or woody creepers (eg Eupatorium odoratum). In burnt primary forest, however, canopy loss was less severe and there was a low density of grasses. The prospects for recovery of forest structure appear to be good in burnt primary forest although species composition may be permanently altered. In forests logged prior to the fire, however, prospects for recovery of forest structure are not good, especially if further burning occurs. Recovery of these forests depends heavily on the ability of the secondary tree species to shade out the vigorous grasses, the continued presence of which may herald the conversion of the forest to unproductive grassland as has occurred widely elsewhere in the tropics after over-intensive shifting cultivation. -Author",171,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,33

Experiments showed that the differences between means from such collectors as compared to those from collectors in clearings were <5%, <3%, and <17% for rainfall, sodium, and acidic deposition, respectively. The primary sources of sodium and acidity were from outside the basin. Deposition rates were positively skewed; a few events dominated mean annual deposition. Rainfall and acidic deposition were uniformly distributed in the basin, while sodium varied significantly. Thus, the distribution of collectors necessary to characterize atmospheric input to this type of forest depends both on the site and the component to be studied. -from Authors",4,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,48
