This is especially so for second-growth that develops on large areas of degraded land. We address this by investigating assemblages of large-bodied birds and mammals in extensive patches of secondary forest in the Jarí region of the north-eastern Brazilian Amazon, comparing species richness and abundance against that of adjacent undisturbed primary forests. We conducted 184 km of line-transect censuses over a period of 3 mo, and found that although primary and secondary forests held a similar abundance of large vertebrates, the species composition was very different. Secondary forests supported a high abundance of ungulate browsers (0.85 vs 0.44 indiv. per 10 km) and smaller-bodied primates (15.6 vs 4.6 indiv. per 10 km) compared with primary forests. However, large prehensile-tailed primates were absent (black spider monkey Ateles paniscus) or at very low abundance (Guyanan red howler monkey Alouatta macconelli) in secondary forest. The abundance of large frugivorous/granivorous birds was also low in secondary forests compared with primary forests (22.6 vs 37.1 individuals per 10 km, respectively). Faunal assemblages appear to reflect food resource availability. Concurrent vegetation surveys indicated that secondary forests had high levels of terrestrial and understorey browse. Fruit production was largely restricted to pioneer trees such as Bellucia and Inga spp. Although these regenerating forests were an important habitat for large mammals and birds, they were limited in terms of faunal richness, particularly dispersers of large-seeded plants.

Nevertheless, data are lacking that allow a better test of the relationships involved. Here we investigate the relationship between bromeliads and hummingbirds in an area of secondary Atlantic rain forest in southern Brazil. The study examined the interactions among 12 species of bromeliad and 10 of hummingbird at Reserva Natural Salto Morato, Paraná state. The number of flowering species of bromeliad and the species richness and abundance of hummingbirds were quantified monthly between November 2004 and October 2005. Focal observations on each bromeliad species were made to determine the hummingbird visitors. Neither species richness nor abundance of hummingbirds were related to bromeliad phenology. Together with the monthly variation in visit frequency by a given pollinator to a given plant, these factors indicate a generalization in the use of bromeliads by hummingbirds and argue against tight coevolution. Ramphodon naevius and Thalurania glaucopis were the main pollinators in the community. Aechmea nudicaulis was the most generalist bromeliad species. The generalist species interacted with other generalists or with asymmetric specialists and there was no specialist-specialist interaction. This produced a strongly organized and nested matrix of interactions. This nestedness is similar to other plant-pollinators networks, supporting the hypothesis that the evolutionary relationship between bromeliads and hummingbirds is no stronger than that of other pollination networks.

The altitude, climate and plant composition of these habitats differ. Our goal was to compare the diets of gorillas living in each of these habitats. The nutrients in staple foods and in the diets of individuals in a group of gorillas in Bwindi (N = 12 individuals) and a group in the Virungas (N = 7 individuals) were compared to determine if differences in dietary composition affected concentrations of nutrients in their diets. At both sites gorilla diets consisted primarily of herbaceous leaves, but the diet of Bwindi gorillas contained more tree leaves, fruit, pith and dry wood, and fewer stems. Despite differences in habitat and dietary composition, the nutrient concentrations in both gorilla diets were remarkably similar. On a dry matter basis, the diets and staple foods of Bwindi and Virunga gorillas contained similar concentrations of crude protein (CP), fibre (NDF) and non-structural carbohydrates (TNC). Bwindi gorillas ate diets containing 18% CP, 43% NDF and 19% TNC on a dry-matter basis, while the diets of the Virunga gorillas contained 17% CP, 41% NDF and 18% TNC. Our results demonstrate that gorillas consume diets that differ by plant species and part, but contain similar concentrations of nutrients. This suggests that classifying animals by broad dietary strategy (e.g. frugivory and folivory) does not provide a reliable indicator of the nutritional quality of their diet, and that our previous assumptions about these categories should be re-evaluated.

Distance matrices were calculated between adult trees (n = 283) and the locations of seeds (n = 3016) encountered along 100 x 4-m transects (n = 77). There was no significant difference in the density of seeds dispersed > 25 m from the nearest adult (n = 253) among sites.

Exact dispersal distances were determined for a subset of seeds (n = 14) from which maternal endocarp DNA could be extracted and matched to maternal trees using microsatellite analysis. Dispersal within fragments and from pasture trees into adjacent fragments was documented, at a maximum distance of 853 m.

To improve understanding of the implications of their loss we used stable isotope analysis to examine trophic relationships in an ecosystem in which amphibians are dominant in a second-order forest stream at 750 m asl in Parque Nacional Omar Torrijos Herrera, Panama. We analysed δ13C, δ15N and C:N ratios of major biotic components (basal resources, invertebrates, amphibians, fish and reptiles) in the stream and of the adjacent riparian food web. Tadpoles (mean δ15N = 4.49‰) and adult amphibians (mean δ15N = 5.45‰) were intermediate links in the aquatic and terrestrial food web respectively. High δ15N signatures identified fish as top predators in the aquatic food web and snakes and the toad Bufo as top predators in the terrestrial food web. Isotopic signatures clearly distinguished between trophic groups of tadpoles: microbial feeders (Centrolenidae, δ15N range = 0.91-3.05‰), herbivores (Rana and Hyla, δ15N range = 4.74-5.15‰) and neuston feeders (Colostethus, δ15N range = 5.31-6.40‰). Dependence on autotrophic production was indicated by enriched signatures of carbon isotopes in pool dwellers versus those that reside in faster-flowing sections of the stream.

We investigated impacts of forest fragmentation on genetic diversity in the butterfly Mycalesis orseis (Satyrinae) in Sabah (Malaysian Borneo). We investigated mtDNA diversity in 90 individuals from ten forest sites typical of the sizes of forest remnants that currently exist in the region. Nucleotide diversity declined with increasing isolation of remnants, but there was no effect of remnant size or population size, and haplotype diversity was similar among sites. Thus, approximately 50 y after forest fragmentation, few changes in genetic diversity were apparent and remnants apparently supported genetically viable populations of this butterfly. Many studies have shown that responses of species to habitat fragmentation usually follow a time delay, and so we developed a Monte Carlo simulation model to investigate changes in genetic diversity over time in small remnants. Model output indicated a substantial time delay (> 100 y) between fragmentation and genetic erosion, suggesting that, in the smallest study remnants, an increased risk of extinction from reduced genetic diversity is likely in the longer term.

The aims of the research were to study post-fire succession on savanna habitats in the Okavango Delta and to investigate the mechanisms behind vegetation changes with time-since-fire. We hypothesize that vegetation structure rather than species occurrence is affected by the fire event and that the driving forces of post-fire succession change from fire-driven to competition-driven with increasing time-since-fire. A total number of 153 study sites were investigated, representing areas of 2-12 y without a fire. Both woody and herbaceous plant species were recorded and cover/abundance values were measured. The vegetation changes with time-since-fire could be assigned to three different successional stages: (1) the post-fire conditions shortly after fire, supporting high species numbers due to open space and little competition; (2) the dominance of competitive perennial grass species (e.g. Urochloa mosambicensis) after 6-8 y; and (3) the enhanced establishment of woody species after about 10 y, creating new habitats in their vicinity. High species numbers were found after short and long fire-free periods, and different species occurred shortly after the fire event and at late stages of the post-fire succession. A variety of different inter-fire intervals is therefore expected to be responsible for sustaining plant species richness and habitat diversity in the study area. Post-fire succession could be described as not only being driven by the life history of the species, but also by seedbank dynamics and plant mobility in early successional stages and by competition and niche differentiation in late-successional stages.

We measured indicators of forest productivity and soil and leaf nutrients across independent gradients of precipitation and elevation/temperature in lower montane Hawaiian forests dominated by a single overstorey species, Acacia koa, situated on 1500-3000-y-old soils that were mixtures of volcanic ash and basalt. Stand basal area was highest at the wettest site, 2000 mm mean annual precipitation (MAP), and leaf N and P were lowest at the driest site, 1000 mm MAP. Soil N availability and leaf N concentration declined across an 850-m elevation gradient, but this was not correlated with stand basal area or soil organic matter content. Across all stands, basal area was negatively correlated with the exchangeable soil P fraction. As well, the soil C:N ratio was negatively correlated with both soil P availability and the size of the primary mineral P fraction. Soil P availability and weathering appear to be important determinants of soil organic matter quantity and quality. Overall, precipitation is the major driving force for forest productivity, but P weathering and availability play important roles in limiting productivity in wetter sites and in controlling soil organic matter dynamics in these N-fixing forests.

Generalized linear modelling and multi-model inference was used to analyse frequency and degree of piping relative to initial tree diameter at breast height (dbh), eco-taxonomic group or species of eucalypt. Growth (dbh increment) and survival (4 y) were analysed relative to initial tree size, pipe ratio (pipe diameter:dbh) and eco-taxonomic group. The frequency of piping was strongly dependent on dbh, increasing with size of tree, and was highest in eucalypts.

In many tropical and subtropical forests a large number of seeds are efficiently dispersed by 'non-restricted frugivores' (NRFs, animals for which fruits do not represent the main bulk of their diet), a group commonly underestimated as seed dispersers. Here, we synthesize data from three different neotropical forests (Argentina, Panama and Costa Rica), evaluating several aspects of seed dispersal by two species of Cebus monkeys. Capuchin monkeys are NRFs broadly distributed throughout Central and South America that are potentially long-distance seed dispersers. In this study we evaluated the influence of the foraging behaviour of Cebus apella and C. capucinus on the patterns of seed dispersal. Even though the distribution of fruit types significantly differed among forests, no evidence of diet selection was found, indicating that the fruits consumed by monkeys represent a random sample of the pool available at each site. Neither seed treatment, nor the evenness with which fruit species were consumed, differed among forests. In contrast, the feeding time per fruiting tree (10-45 min), the diversity of fruits consumed (H = 2-3.3), and seed dispersal distances (100-400 m), differed among the three forests. Thus, capuchin monkeys consume a high diversity of fruits in transit producing a scattered dissemination of seeds in all study forests. This study highlights the ecological and evolutionary significance of seed shadows generated by NRFs, without neglecting the possibility that differences in the distribution of fruit patches, species richness and a range of environmental attributes among the studied forests, exert a strong influence on the outcome of the interaction between NRFs and plants.

Army ant raids support a community of diverse organisms, including birds that attend the raids to collect prey. While elevation and forest fragmentation influence army ant and insectivorous bird communities, their effects on the interaction between army ants and bird species is unknown. We studied the size and species composition of bird flocks attending army ant swarms in forest fragments and continuous forest across an elevational gradient (1100-1680 m asl) in a neotropical montane region (Monteverde, Costa Rica). We observed a total of 41 bird species attending army ant swarms. Neither the number of birds, nor the total body mass of birds, nor the number of bird species in attending bird flocks was related to elevation. However, we found a higher bird species richness, larger flock size and greater total body mass of birds attending army ant swarms in continuous forest. Continuous and fragmented forest shared many attending bird species in common, but there was elevational segregation of attending bird species. Some montane endemic birds, and neotropical migrants, attend swarms regularly and use army ant raids as a food source.

Fourteen trapping sessions were conducted in six 0.5-ha grids at irregular intervals from July 2000 to March 2005. Responses by H. desmarestianus to four disturbance events depended on the type and magnitude of the events. Although fluctuations in density were strongly related to fruit availability, the disturbances tended to magnify direct and delayed density-dependent effects on reproduction and juvenile survival. A catastrophic flood in July 2000 eliminated the entire population, but by September 2001 population density had increased from 34.4 individuals ha-1 immediately pre-flood to 42.5 individuals ha-1. Indirect effects from a hurricane in October 2001 had greater and longer lasting influences on demographic rates than direct effects from less severe floods in August 2002 and September 2003. Fruiting ceased for almost 2.5 y after the hurricane, resulting in extremely low juvenile survival and a decline in density from 46.8 individuals ha-1 in January 2002 to 23.0 individuals ha-1 in January 2004. Fruiting began again in January 2004, and after several subsequent pulses of reproduction and generally higher rates of juvenile survival the population reached a maximum of 77.3 individuals ha-1 in March 2005. Inferences from the study, especially on the duration of delayed-density-dependent effects, must be made cautiously because of the irregular trapping intervals resulting from the unplanned disturbances. However, the results indicate that population dynamics of many tropical small-mammal populations will be driven by direct and indirect effects from density-independent events that amplify density-dependent influences on demographic rates.

We looked for evidence of light and soil moisture partitioning among seedlings of four native Malagasy tree species, the pioneer, gap-adapted species Harungana madagascariensis and the three shade-tolerant species Ocotea cymosa, Stephanostegia capuronii and Uapaca ferruginea. Four hundred and eighty seedlings were transplanted in experimental plots in the Tampolo coastal forest and grown for 2 y. Growth rates increased with increasing light availability for all species, and with increasing dry-season soil moisture for H. madagascariensis. With increasing light availability, survival increased for H. madagascariensis, S. capuronii and U. ferruginea but decreased for O. cymosa. While dry-season soil moisture did not influence the growth or survival of the shade-tolerant species, it interacted with understorey light in its effect on the performance of H. madagascariensis, which performed better in wet soils at high light than in dry soils in shade. Rank reversals in species performance suggested that three of the four tree species partition resource gradients as seedlings, mostly light and secondarily dry-season soil moisture. There was only partial agreement between the performance of transplanted seedlings and the distribution of natural seedlings of the same four species with respect to light and soil moisture, suggesting that the success of tropical tree regeneration can only be partly accounted for by seedling performance across resource gradients.

Rising sea level will cause changes in the hydro-period, surface water salinity and salt-water intrusion in coastal areas, which will reduce the distribution of forests in these areas. We studied the dynamics of a Pterocarpus officinalis stand in Puerto Rico over a 9-y period. We observed differences in plant growth, recruitment and mortality across a salinity gradient within a 1-ha plot. In areas of high salinity, recruitment, juvenile density and growth rates of juveniles and adults were lower. The detrimental effect of salinity was also observed in a growth experiment; seedlings in 5‰ and 10‰ salinity treatments had higher mortality, slower growth and less above- and below-ground biomass than control seedlings (0‰). In addition, an increase from 0 to 1‰ in salinity resulted in approximately 50% less nodulation in seedlings. Low recruitment in high salinity areas and lack of recruitment in adjacent grasslands will further reduce the distribution of this forest type. Although some ecosystems can respond to changing conditions by migration to more favourable areas, this is not the case with P. officinalis, and thus, restoration efforts are needed to re-establish this species where it occurred historically.

However, habitats of specialist species must be divergent, i.e. habitat divergence, to coexist in a local community. When a pair of species specialize in the same habitat, i.e. habitat convergence, they could not coexist by way of habitat specialization. Thus, analyses of habitat divergence, in addition to habitat specialization, are necessary to discuss coexistence mechanisms of sympatric species. In this study, the habitat specialization and habitat divergence along topographic gradients of eight sympatric tree species of the Fagaceae were studied in a 15-ha study plot in a tropical lower montane forest in northern Thailand. A statistical test with torus shift randomizations for 9673 trees of Fagaceae revealed significantly biased distributions for all of the species, for at least one of the four topographic variables used: elevation, slope inclination, aspect and convexity. Slope convexity was the most critical topographic variable, along which all but one species had significantly skewed distributions. Out of 112 possible combinations of species pairs and topographic variables, 18 (16%) and two pairs (1.8%) showed significant habitat divergence and habitat convergence, respectively. The observed habitat divergence alone could not completely explain the coexistence of the eight species. There was a gradation in the habitat position of each species, with relatively large overlaps between species distributed in similar habitats, and small overlaps between species associated with contrasting habitats, respectively. The gradual changes in the habitats of the species suggested that dividing the species into a small number of distinct habitat groups, such as ridge and valley specialists, would not be straightforward.

However, leaf-litter depth and soil characteristics are influenced by distance from streams, so the apparent relationship between edaphic characteristics and species distributions could be an artefact of the dependence of species on free water for reproduction. Therefore, we investigated the effect of edaphic variables on the mesoscale distribution of frog species not dependent on free water for reproduction. We evaluated the effects of soil texture, pH, slope, number of trees and leaf-litter volume on the distribution of nine terrestrially reproducing anuran species in the Reserva Ducke, a 100-km2 terra firme forest preserve in central Amazonia. Diurnal and nocturnal assemblages of anuran species were sampled in 72 plots systematically distributed across the reserve. We sampled the diurnal anuran assemblage by visual encounter in 250 x 1-m plots and the nocturnal assemblage in 250 x 20-m plots using both auditory and visual surveys. The majority of terrestrially breeding anuran species were influenced by topographic and/or edaphic variables, such as slope, soil clay content and pH. However, responses to environmental predictors differed among species. Most species occurred throughout all environmental gradients and relationships with soil characteristics were subtle, indicating that these species occur in the majority of habitats in Reserva Ducke. The results of this study indicate that terrestrially breeding frogs are habitat generalists that show little mesoscale beta diversity associated with habitat variation.

Three currently used extrapolation models were tested on our data. In a 2.5-mo trapping period we caught 75 individuals representing 18 small non-volant mammal species in three different habitats. We found that for comparable trapping efforts, village edges presented a higher abundance and species richness than primary and secondary forests.

We used a randomized complete block design with five blocks of 100 × 100 m, demarcated in a 10-ha pocket of Colophospermum mopane-dominated woodland protected from grazing and fire. In each block, we randomly selected three mopane trees with large canopies (8.3 m crown diameter) and another three with small canopies (2.7 m crown diameter). We determined soil organic carbon and nutrient concentrations, litterfall N and C inputs, microbial biomass and N transformations beneath large and small mopane trees as well as in the intercanopy areas. Soil organic carbon, microbial biomass, N, P and K were more than twice those beneath large trees than in the intercanopy areas. Rainy-season net mineral N accumulation rate in the surface soil (0-10 cm) ranged from 3.71 μg g-1 mo-1 in the intercanopy areas to 8.80 μg g-1 mo-1 beneath large trees; correspondingly, net nitrate accumulation rate ranged from 1.33 to 3.60 μg g-1 mo-1. Dry-season net mineral N and net nitrate accumulation rates were similar across sampling sites and did not exceed 2 and 0.4 μg g-1 mo-1, respectively. Litterfall N inputs were positively and significantly correlated with soil N availability, microbial biomass N and N transformations. At all sampling sites, microbial biomass and mineral N pools in the dry season were maximum when soil moisture (∼5%) and N transformations were minimum. In contrast, when soil moisture (9-13%) and N transformations were maximum in the rainy season, microbial biomass and mineral N pools were minimum.

This short-term study investigates how bird assemblages are affected by agricultural practices adopted by the residents of a national park in the Brazilian Amazon. Twelve sites in secondary forest (four sites in three age categories) and 12 sites in primary forest were selected for bird sampling. Audio-visual censuses of birds were conducted in small plots (1 ha) of young secondary growth (4-5 y), middle-aged (7-15 y), and old (20-35 y) secondary forests. Each site in secondary forest had a corresponding control site in adjacent primary forest. Young secondary growth had fewer species than old secondary and primary forests. Bird species richness was similar in middle-aged, old secondary and primary forests. Bird communities of young secondary habitat were dominated by species normally found in open habitats, such as agricultural fields and igapó flooded forests. The bird species composition of young secondary growth was more similar to that of middle-aged forest, which in turn was more similar to that of old secondary forests. Bird species composition differed between young secondary growth and old secondary forests and primary forests and between middle-aged secondary and primary forests. Nectarivore/insectivores and frugivore/insectivores of monospecific flocks are significantly associated with secondary forests, especially in initial stages of forest regeneration. In contrast, specialized insectivorous birds that join mixed-flocks show a significant association with primary forest.

This hypothesis was tested by altering the tip of one leaf in each of 50 pairs of opposite leaves on plants of each of two woody species in the understorey of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. After 11 mo in situ, there were no statistical differences between the mean epiphyll cover on leaves with and leaves without drip tips. Epiphyll cover was, however, strongly correlated between the opposite leaves at a node, even though one had a drip tip and the other had the tip removed. This correlation could be due to small-scale heterogeneity of insolation, temperature and humidity in the crowns of plants. A relationship between epiphyll cover and growth of the branch containing the leaves provides qualitative support for this interpretation. It seems clear that drip tips do not have a large, consistent, easily detectable effect on epiphyll cover. However, because of the tiny cost of drip tips, reductions in epiphyll growth that are small and transitory and occur in only a portion of a plant's leaves may provide sufficient advantage to explain the evolution of drip tips. No experiment to date has been capable of detecting such effects.

Melaleuca argentea was confined to streams and occurred on sandier substrates, whereas M. cajuputi mostly occurred in the near-coastal lowlands on clay soils. The greater basal area of M. cajuputi suggests an association with productive sites. Melaleuca dealbata, M. viridiflora and M. leucadendra occurred on a wide range of soils. More deeply floodprone sites were occupied by M. argentea and M. leucadendra along streams and by M. leucadendra and M. cajuputi on floodplains and in swamps.

Seedlings were more frequent in recently burnt areas and especially where fires had been severe. We propose that Melaleuca forests occur where disturbance by fire and/or floodwater is too great for rain forest to persist, rendering them the wetland analogue to the eucalypts that dominate well-drained portions of the north Australian environment.

Over 6 y, the bromeliads flowered mainly between October and December; with an individual inflorescence flowering for an average of 34 d (n = 233 inflorescences). The bromeliad showed a flexible breeding system with autogamy occurring in addition to cross-pollination. Exclusive pollinators were small nectar-feeding bats (Phyllostomidae: Glossophaginae). The average volume of nectar produced per flower was 1.1 ml (n = 25 flowers). The main visitor was the bat Glossophaga commissarisi, which approached the flowers exclusively using hovering flight. Visitation by bats, measured by infrared light sensors, occurred throughout the night with an activity peak after midnight. Median hovering duration of the bats at the flowers was 320 ms (n = 1246 visits). Hourly mean of hovering duration was negatively correlated with hourly nectar secretion rate. The flower visitation behaviour of a bat over the night seems to be shaped by a combination of intrinsic physiological factors and by nectar availability. Size of both flowers and visitors make Werauhia gladioliflora a very accessible system for quantification of factors affecting evolution of bat-plant interactions.

Two seed densities (1 m-2 and 6 m-2) were tested in two forest types (monodominant versus mixed) with 10 plots per treatment (40 plots total). Germination success, seed and seedling survival after 1 y were measured for the monodominant tree, and four non-dominant canopy tree species found in both forest types (Eschweilera sagotiana, Licania laxiflora, Chrysophyllum sanguinolentum and Carapa guianensis). A significant effect of forest type was detected for seed removal and seedling survival. In the mixed forest, seed removal was higher for all species, with 27% average removal compared with 7% average seed removal in the monodominant forest. Germination success was significantly lower for all but one species in the mixed forest, with average germination of 41% compared with 78% germination in the monodominant forest. Seed and seedling survival of the monodominant tree was greatest within the monodominant forest with 93% of seeds germinating and 85% of seedlings surviving after 1 y compared with 65% germination and 15% seedling survival in the mixed forest.

The area of shoreline swamps declined exponentially with increasing wave exposure.

Data from 19 tree species were collected from 20 transects in coastal dune forest. Resprouting was negatively correlated with turning up and species abundance, and positively correlated with leaning and a dead primary stem. In contrast, turning up was associated with low probabilities of leaning and higher species abundance but not with a dead primary stem. Slightly inclined trees turned upwards more than severely inclined ones, which mostly resprouted. Leaning trees without exposed roots turned upwards, while severe erosion caused leaning and resprouting. Consistent with the latter, leaning trees in stable dune slacks frequently turned upwards, whereas leaning trees on narrow dune crests and steep landward slopes seldom did so. Small trees were more likely to turn upwards than big trees. Because of potentially greater costs to the individual of sprouting, stem reorientation precedes the resprouting response across the disturbance gradient. Consequently, species prone to stem reorientation and less likely to resprout, are dominant during late-succession. This study emphasizes the advantage under low levels of disturbance of turning up as an alternative strategy to resprouting for leaning trees.

Our objective was to quantify the removal rate of these diaspores by ants and vertebrates in order to test the predator avoidance hypothesis, and to test how diaspore traits influence removal by ants and dispersal distance. We also investigated whether seed cleaning (removal of fruit matter simulating ant activity) can influence seed germination. We performed removal experiments with nine diaspore species in a reserve of cerrado savanna in south-east Brazil. Considerable differences in removal rates were found among the nine species. We found a positive linear relationship between lipid content and removal rates for five diaspore species. Vertebrate predation pressure was low for most species, limiting the benefits that ants can provide to plants to escape predators. Ants displace diaspores up to 25 m, which may increase the chance of a seed hitting a safe site. Smaller diaspores attain longer distances of dispersal than large ones. Seed cleaning increased the germination rate for five out of six species tested in greenhouse experiments.

However, demographic responses to spatio-temporal resource variation that could result in biased species distributions are still little studied. In this paper we investigate from two censuses, c. 15 y apart, of a 12-ha permanent forest sample in French Guiana, how tree recruitment and mortality rates vary among hydrological soil types known to affect species habitat preferences and among ecological guilds related to species light requirement. The results indicate that both recruitment and mortality vary significantly with respect to these factors. While the mean instantaneous mortality and recruitment rates are estimated to 0.98 and 0.81%, respectively, pioneer species, canopy trees and hydromorphic bottomland soils depart significantly from these values. In particular, the pioneers, regenerating either from the soil seed bank or from post-opening seed rain, show faster dynamics than other species. These two guilds harbour probabilities of mortality elevated by a factor of 1.9 and 3.2, respectively, and probabilities of recruitment elevated by a factor of 4.9 and 3.1, respectively. Conversely, canopy trees show slower dynamics, with probabilities of mortality and recruitment lowered by a mean factor of about 0.5 with respect to other species. We also observe that trees growing in hydromorphic bottomlands prove to have significantly higher mortality and recruitment probabilities, by a factor of about 2 with respect to those growing in terra firme.

There were four irrigated plots and four unirrigated, in each plot there were eight subplots (four trenched, four untrenched); 32 seedlings (two per subplot) of each of four tree species were equally allocated to the four treaments; the four species were: Aspidosperma cruenta; Gustavia superba; Simarouba amara and Tachigali versicolor. Over all species together, trenching increased seedling height by 41% and leaf area by 140% over 4 y. The cause was likely to be increased nutrient supply, because the amounts of N, K and Ca were higher in trenched plants, though concentrations were not higher. Irrigation had no significant effect on growth. Irrigation, but not trenching, reduced seedling mortality. We conclude that below-ground competition was a major limitation for seedling growth for at least some common species (Gustavia and Tachigali in this experiment).

Tropical forests are known to have much greater diversity of plant species than their temperate counterparts, but studies of litter processing in tropical streams have not explicitly addressed this issue. This paper documents the streambed leaf litter composition and diversity of an Australian tropical rain-forest stream and the leaf preferences of consumers in the stream. We hypothesized that there would be high diversity of litter in the stream and that the shredders would have broad preferences, given that litterfall of any one species would occur over a restricted period. Leaf litter was characterized by high species diversity (81 species from one stream reach sampled on two occasions). Leaf consumers ('shredders') were associated with a relatively broad suite of leaf species (38 species) and did not indicate clear leaf preferences. However, in a laboratory feeding experiment, using the three most common shredder species and some of the most abundant leaf species in the stream, all shredder species exhibited clear preference for a single leaf species (Endiandra bessaphila). Preference for this and other species was affected by the conditioning age of leaves (i.e. the length of time leaves were exposed to leaching and microbial colonization), with conditioned leaves usually being preferred, and previously non-selected leaves becoming more palatable with conditioning. Thus, different successional stages were more important than the identity of leaf species in determining the distribution of shredders among the leaves.

This exception coincided with the period of lowest abundance of M. huberti at the study site. Distribution of M. huberti prey into four age classes was assessed through analysis of tooth wear in remains from the seasonal pellet samples. Comparisons with age structure of the CMR population indicate that the barn owl tended to prey on smaller-than-average (thus younger) individuals, especially when these are rare in the population (non-reproductive period between June and October). The spectrum of prey consumed is compared with data previously reported in Sahelian Africa, showing for the first time in this region a major shift in prey choice by the barn owl when its preferred prey becomes rare.

Given the longevity of large trees and the scarcity of appropriately long-term demographic data, standing size distributions are a potential tool for predicting species' responses to disturbances and resultant changes in population structure. Here we test the utility of several different measures of size distribution for predicting subsequent population changes at the intraspecific level using demographic records from two subsampled 50-ha tree plots in Malaysia (Pasoh and Lambir). Most measures of size distribution failed to successfully predict population change better than random; however, the 'coefficient of skewness' (a measure of the relative proportion of small vs. large stems in a population) was able to correctly predict the direction of population change for approximately three-quarters of species at both sites. At Pasoh, the magnitude of this relationship decreased with adult stature and rate of turnover, but was unrelated to sapling growth rates at either site. Finally, using data for species common at both forests, we found that size distributions were generally uninformative of subsequent differences in population change between sites (only median dbh correctly predicted the direction of change for more species than random). Based on these results we conclude that some measures of intraspecific differences in size distribution are potentially informative of population trends within forests but have limited utility across broader spatial scales.

Roosts of bat species differ in durability and protection, and bat flies separate from the host to pupate in the roost. We predicted higher levels of parasitism and more parasitic associates for bats roosting in more permanent structures (e.g. caves, tunnels) that would facilitate their association with hosts. We also predicted wing development of flies should correlate inversely with roost duration, restricting flightless forms to bats in permanent roosts. Ranking roosting structures by durability and protection, we sought correlations among bat species in prevalence, mean intensity and number of associated fly species. All three measures of parasitism were positively and significantly related to roosting habits: bats roosting in more permanent, enclosed structures were more likely to be infested, to carry heavier parasite loads, and to harbour more species of ectoparasitic flies. However, roosting habits were not correlated with the average wing development of bat flies. Although other factors affect parasitism rates in bats, the study provides a compelling example of both ecological and evolutionary responses of parasites to features of the host's environment.

In contrast, predators of invertebrates, rodents and generalist herbivores (leaf-cutter ants, howler monkeys, common iguanas) are present at greatly elevated densities.

Two of these hypotheses are tested herein. The seed predation hypothesis predicts greater seed removal in the presence of hyperabundant rodents, and the seedling herbivory hypothesis predicts reduced seedling survival in the presence of hyperabundant herbivores. Seed removal trials were conducted with 18 species of forest trees, using both exposed and lightly buried seeds. Seed removal was not generally higher on islands supporting hyperabundant rodents, contrary to the seed predation hypothesis. Seedlings exposed to herbivores for 4 mo suffered the highest mortality on small islands supporting hyperabundant rodents and leaf-cutter ants. Saplings survived equally well in cages open to arthropods + rodents as in cages open only to arthropods, suggesting that there was no additive effect of rodents on seedling mortality. Current evidence points to excessive seedling herbivory by arthropods, especially by leaf-cutter ants, as the principal cause of recruitment failure on predator-free Lago Guri islets.

Anthropogenic disturbance, such as shifting cultivation, is an important factor causing demographic variation in many tropical non-timber forest products. The leaves of the palm Sabal yapa are an important non-timber forest product used for thatching by Mayan peoples. The demography of Sabal yapa was studied in three habitats (mature forest, successional forest and crop fields), representing successional phases along the slash-and-burn agricultural cycle in the Yucatan Peninsula. Matrix population models, along with elasticity analyses and life-table-response experiments were employed. Population growth rate differed between patches (MF: λ = 1.043; SF: λ = 1.027; CF: λ = 0.959). Only the λ value of the mature forest was significantly higher than unity. Fecundity and seedling survival were lowest in the crop fields and highest in the mature forest. The elasticity analyses and life-table-response experiments showed that entries with a high positive contribution to λ also showed high elasticity values, while those with a negative contribution to λ showed low elasticity. Thus, both analyses are crucial to understand the demography of a species and to aid in conservation and management practices.

Previous studies have shown that these gaps play an important role in plant and bird communities, however less is known about their role in arthropod communities. Using eight Malaise traps we investigated the difference in arthropod abundance of 19 taxonomic groups between gaps and understorey for 21 wk during the rainy season and 8 wk in the dry season on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. More (33.8%) arthropods were collected in gaps during the rainy season and 32.2% more in the understorey during the dry season. To assess the possible factors contributing to these differences we measured light, plant densities and young leaf densities, as indicators of abiotic factors and food resources for insect herbivores. Arthropod abundance was negatively correlated with light in the dry season. Thus, abiotic stress may explain the pattern of abundance in the dry season. While there was no correlation with light in the rainy season, predator abundance was positively correlated with herbivore abundance. The plant and young leaf density data suggest that there is significantly higher food availability for herbivores in gaps. Thus, less stressful abiotic conditions and more food resources may contribute to more herbivores followed by more predators in gaps during the rainy season.

In seasonally dry forests, to the degree that soil moisture limits plant productivity, community-wide peaks in reproduction are expected during the rainy season, with seedfall and germination timed to allow seedlings to become well established while soil moisture is available. Where soil moisture is never seasonally limiting, seasonal changes in light availability caused by periods of cloudiness or seasonally low zenithal sun angles should favour reproduction during seasons when irradiance levels are high. To evaluate these predictions, we documented the timing of flower and fruit fall for 10 and 15 y at El Verde, Puerto Rico, and Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama. At El Verde, rainfall is abundant year-round and solar declination largely determines seasonal variation in irradiance. At BCI, rainfall is abundant throughout the 8-mo wet season while drought develops and average solar irradiance increases by 40-50% over the 4-mo dry season. Seasonal variation in the number of species flowering and fruiting at both sites was generally consistent with the hypothesis that seasonal variation in irradiance limits the evolution of reproductive phenologies. Community-level metrics provided no evidence for a similar role for moisture availability at BCI. Seasonal variation in irradiance also strongly influenced seed development times at both sites. Thus, community-wide phenologies reveal a strong signature of seasonal changes in irradiance, even in those forests that exhibit some degree of seasonality in rainfall.

One circumstance under which sex-role reversal may occur is when males are a limiting resource, so that females have to compete for access to mates. Here we report on male rarity and male and female behaviour of species within the damselfly genus Nesobasis, endemic to Fiji. Earlier reports suggested that, in some members of this genus, males were seldom observed and that females of these species were consequentially territorial, a phenomenon described as 'sex-role reversal'. Quantitative estimation of the ratio of adult males to females at 15 localities in 13 Nesobasis species (1489 individuals) indicated that males were extremely rare in some species, yet common in others. This interspecific variability in male rarity cannot be explained by elevation or habitat. Formal observations of three species with abundant males revealed that males of these species were highly territorial: they physically challenged intruders while remaining within a confined area. By contrast, in three species where males were consistently rare or absent, females were not territorial: instead, they moved widely and were primarily engaged in oviposition. While we do not know the underlying reason for the unusual rarity of males at oviposition sites in some species, it is clear that this rarity has not provided sufficient selection pressure to generate genuine sex-role reversal.

There is, therefore, an urgent need to improve our understanding of nutrient cycling processes in this ecosystem, including the absorption of nutrients (mainly N and P) from senescing leaves, which may be a key component of adaptive mechanisms that conserve limiting nutrients (Killingbeck 1996). Nutrients which are not resorbed, however, will be circulated through litterfall in the longer term (Aerts 1996). The degree of nutrient resorption affects litter quality, which consequently affects decomposition rates and soil nutrient availability (Aerts & Chapin 2000). The importance of resorption in nutrient conservation has led to general hypotheses that species adapted to nutrient-poor environments have high resorption efficiencies (Richardson et al. 2005), and that low leaf nutrient concentrations are associated with high resorption efficiencies within species (Aerts 1996, Kobe et al. 2005). Nutrient resorption has also been shown not to differ greatly between growth forms (e.g. shrubs, grasses, forbs and trees) (Aerts 1996).

In response to the colonization by climbers, the supporting tree can suffer a reduction in growth and its allometric relationships may be modified. We evaluated the effects of three species of climber on the performance of the pioneer tree Ceiba pentandra in a moist semi-deciduous tropical forest in Ghana. In each of three gaps, four plots were set up, each with eight Ceiba seedlings paired with a single plant of one of three climber species, planted within 5-10 cm of the tree seedling, plus a control (no climber). The climber species were: Centrosema pubescens, a nitrogen-fixing woody climber; Combretum racemosum, a woody climber and Dioscorea praehensilis, an herbaceous climber. After 12 mo, Centrosema and Combretum had about four to five times more biomass than Ceiba seedlings. There was no effect of climber competition on Ceiba biomass growth, and no relationship between climber biomass and Ceiba growth rate. Individual climber species, however, had other effects: Combretum caused a significant reduction in the height and diameter growth of Ceiba, whilst competition with Centrosema was associated with significant reduction in the crown area and increase in internode length in Ceiba. The results indicate that even very different climber species appear to cause negative effects on trees during regeneration.

We investigated patterns of helminth species assemblages (Nematoda, Platyhelminthes) in two rat species (Leopoldamys sabanus, Niviventer cremoriventer) and two tree shrew species (Tupaia tana, T. longipes) in three logged and three unlogged rain forests in Borneo by examining 337 faecal samples with non-invasive faecal egg count (FEC). Nematode eggs prevailed in 95% of all samples with up to five (mean 1.9 ± 1.1) morphotypes. Whereas members of Strongylida were most prevalent in L. sabanus, T. tana and T. longipes, Spirurida dominated in N. cremoriventer that revealed at the same time the lowest average nematode prevalence and FEC. Cestode eggs were only found in L. sabanus and T. tana. Composition and abundance patterns of the parasitic helminth assemblages were influenced by logging. As hypothesized, species richness of nematode morphotypes and mean number of infections per host of T. longipes were larger in logged than in unlogged forest. In contrast, L. sabanus was more heavily infected with cestodes in unlogged than in logged forest and also revealed larger egg counts for strongylids and spirurids in unlogged forest. Our results suggest that forest degradation and altered environmental conditions influence helminth diversity and infection patterns of small mammals with contrasting trends among host species. The inconsistent logging-induced changes in helminth assemblages from different hosts indicate that specific sets of habitat-host-parasite interactions are uniquely influenced by the effects of logging. Consequently, predictions on changes of parasite diversity and prevalence with regard to habitat disturbance need to be based on the individual life histories of the hosts (and the parasites).

Our study included an area of early successional forest (10 y old), with phosphorus-poor soils and comparatively abundant nitrogen, an area of late-successional forest (∼60 y old), in which soil P and N were comparatively abundant, and an area of primary forest, in which soil P was comparatively abundant and N was less abundant than in the secondary counterparts. N and P concentrations in mature leaves varied across forests, reflecting soil nutrient availability. Nitrogen concentration in senescent leaves did not change among sites, which led to very different patterns of N resorption. In contrast, P concentration in senescent leaves was lower in the early than in late-successional and primary forests, which resulted in similar patterns of resorption. Leaf decomposition increased from 70% mass loss in the first year in the early successional to ∼80% in the same period in late-successional and primary forests. The element loss during decomposition change across forests in the following order: for N, early successional = late-successional > primary forest, and for P, primary forest > late-successional > early successional forest.

Food transit times in frugivorous bats are relatively rapid; generally less than 30 min (Laska 1990, Tedman & Hall 1985).

In this vegetation type, many pastures remain free of cattle grazing due to the occurrence of a native shrub poisonous to livestock. Vegetation (floristic data and 22 habitat variables) and vertebrate fauna (birds, mammals, reptiles) were sampled in 29 standardized 50 × 50-m quadrats in the 2001 wet season, representing four treatments: sites burnt recently (within 2 y) and grazed by cattle (4-8 ha per livestock unit); sites unburnt (last burnt >2 y ago) and grazed; sites burnt recently and ungrazed; and unburnt and ungrazed sites. Fire and grazing had a significant influence on vegetation: both grazing and fire reduced ground cover (fire in grazed sites 51-23%, fire in ungrazed sites 68-39%) and increased the cover of forbs (8% in burnt and grazed sites, 3% if ungrazed) and tussock grasses (20% in grazed and unburnt sites and 5% when ungrazed). Grazing caused a shift in floristic composition from the perennial hummock grass Trioda pungens to tussock grasses (e.g. Aristida spp., Enneapogon spp.), forbs (e.g. Phyllanthus spp.) and shrubs (e.g. Acacia spp.). Of the vertebrate groups, birds responded more to fire effects (9 species), reptiles to grazing effects (6 species) and mammals to the interaction (2 species). Species reacted to increases in bare ground (e.g. crested pigeon Ocyphaps lophotes, hooded robin Melanodryas cucullatus, Ctenophorus nuchalis) and to the dominant ground cover (e.g. Ctenotus pantherinus) or change in vegetation architecture (e.g. singing honeyeater Lichenostomus virescens, variegated fairy-wren Malurus lamberti). The clearest example of an interacting effect was the cycle of complementary dominance between the rodents Pseudomys delicatulus and P. desertor, the latter's post-fire recovery becoming more muted in sites where cattle grazed (modelled time for population recovery twice as long as in ungrazed sites).

Two contrasting periods in terms of elephant population densities were compared in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe: the early 1980s and the late 1990s. Elephant population density and other ungulate population densities were estimated for a c. 400-km2 area from road counts. Vegetation structure at the landscape scale was assessed using aerial photographs for the same area. All browsers and grazers declined between the early 1980s and the late 1990s, whereas elephants experienced a 16-fold increase. At the landscape scale, vegetation structure changed little with no evidence of an opening of the habitats. These results do not support any kind of medium-term facilitation between elephants and other herbivores. They rather suggest a negative effect of elephants on other herbivore species when elephants are present at high densities. This study rules out a scenario where the decrease of the different herbivore populations was caused by large changes in vegetation structure due to elephant activity.

Seedlings were grown in soils of low and high natural fertility, uninoculated or inoculated with AM fungi, under greenhouse conditions. The mycorrhizal root colonization and plant responsiveness were higher among early successional species than late successional ones. Among early successional species, in both soils, mycorrhizal colonization provided significant increase in total dry mass, growth rates of shoot and root, root length, density of root tissues, root surface area and P concentration and content in the shoot. Early successional species grown with AM fungi displayed significant decreases in carbon allocation to roots, specific root length and the length and incidence of root hairs. Mycorrhizal colonization did not affect the root morphology of the late successional species in either soil. The growth of these woody species was influenced by differences in soil fertility. There was positive correlation between the degree of plant responses to AM inoculation with the percentage of root colonized by AM fungi. In both soils, plant responsiveness and mycorrhizal root colonization correlated positively to root-hair incidence and root-hair length and correlated negatively to fine-root diameter. The results suggest that during the establishment of seedlings, the large responses to the inoculation and colonization of roots by AM fungi are related to both the successional status and root morphological plasticity of the host plant, regardless of soil fertility.

Comparison of aerial photographs for 50 rain-forest patches in Kakadu National Park had previously revealed a landscape-wide monotonic expansion of rain-forest boundaries between 1964 and 2004. Here floristic, structural, environmental and disturbance attributes of the changes were investigated by sampling 588 plots across 30 rain-forest patches. Areas that had changed from savanna to rain forest were associated with a significantly higher abundance of rain-forest trees and less grasses, relative to stable savanna areas. Ordination analyses showed that overall floristic composition was not significantly different between newly established rain forest and longer established rain forest. Generalized linear models also indicated that contemporary levels of disturbance (fire and feral animal impact) and environmental variables (slope and soil texture) were poor predictors of historical vegetation change. We concluded that (1) the rain-forest boundaries are highly dynamic at the decadal scale; (2) rain-forest expansion is consistent with having been driven by global environmental change phenomena such as increases in rainfall and atmospheric CO2; and (3) expansion will continue if current climatic trends and management conditions persist.
