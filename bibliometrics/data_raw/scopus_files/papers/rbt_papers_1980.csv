Comparison was on a basis of determination of the following effects: hemorrhage, myonecrosis, edema, proteolysis, hemolysis, and lethality, as well as neutralization of the lethal effect by polyvalent antivenom. Biochemical and immunochemical comparisons were done by means of electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, and immunodiffusion. There are marked differences between newborn and adult venoms from both regions in electrophoretic and immunoelectrophoretic patterns, although the immunodiffusion plates showed an almost identical pattern. Venoms from newborn specimens are more proteolytic, hemorrhagic, edema-forming and lethal, whereas those of adult specimens are more hemolytic and induce a stronger myonecrotic action, characterized by a myolitic type of necrosis. Antivenom neutralizes the lethality of all venoms with similar ED50. Venoms of adult specimens from both regions showed a slight variation in the immunoelectrophoretic pattern, but a complete identity in immunodiffusion plates. Adult venoms from San Carlos are more hemorrhagic, and myonecrotic, whereas those of Puriscal are more proteolytic, having similar lethality, edema-forming activity, and hemolytic effect. The same differences were observed when venoms from newborn specimens from both populations were compared.",74,7323342,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,1

Vegetable items (especially grass, grains and tubers) formed the bulk of the food of all the species. Oil-palm nuts and kernels were also common in the guts of C. gambianus and M. natalensis. Animal food components of all the rodent species comprised mainly insects (especially ants, crickets etc.). Vertebrate flesh and scales were also well represented in the guts of C. gambianus. Domestic and miscellaneous food items were recorded from R. rattus, most of which were trapped in human and animal shelters. Inorganic gut contents, primarily sand grains, were found in sizeable quantities in more than 70% of the rodents examined. Results of experimental feeding trials with caged rodents showed close correlation with those recorded from field samples, especially in terms of food choices and the relative quantities consumed. The ecological and practical implications of these observations are discussed in the light of the importance of the rodents as agricultural and domestic pests.",3,7323341,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,2

Experimental study,Chinchilla M.,Revista de biologia tropical,00347744,28,1,109-119,1980-07-01,July 1980,"Groups of ""immunized"" and ""non-immunized"" hamsters were inoculated weekly with 2, 10 or 20 mg of cortisone acetate per 100 gr of body weight and infected with Leishmania mexicana or L. braziliensis. Doses of 10 and 20 mg of cortisone were excessive, since the animals died with bacterial infections before they developed leishmaniasis. Inflammation and necrosis were more evident in animals inoculated with cortisone and L. mexicana. Furthermore, this strain caused lesions in lymphatic ganglia of immunosuppressed animals, but was not observed in those inoculated with L. braziliensis. There was no difference between the pathological findings in nonimmune and immune hamsters. These results could indicate that passive immunization with dead antigen is not effective.",0,7465874,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,3

In all the vasectomized animals there was marked degeneration of the semniiferous tubules as well as reduction of spermatogenesis. The thickening of the basal membrane was quite evident and showed extensive infolding. In the Sertoli cells, the presence of spherical or oval membrane-bound granules, vacuoles and degenerating cytoplasmic organelles were observed in the vasectomized group. Degenerative changes of sub-cellular organelles were quite evident in the process of spermatogenesis and spermiogenesis. The number of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids and mature sperms were considerably reduced; in some cases, almost completely degenerated. Only one type of spermatogonia (Type A) remained intact in the germinal epithelium. Large numbers of multi-nucleate spermatids were observed eight months after vasectomy. These cells were identifiable at all stages of spermatogenesis but were readily detected in cap phase spermatids. There was no evidence of any regeneration occurring in the seminferous tubules examined eight months after vasectomy.",4,7465875,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,4

Transplants showed a positive correlation between the percentage of dead cells in the thallus and the ketone soluble substances deposited on it. Those parts of the city where pollution is greatest (industrial areas and heavy traffic) were also the ones where lichens suffered the most, and in some extreme cases the thallus died after 8 months of exposure. Besides this transplant experiment, the coverage of Parmelia lichens on the bark of several tree species was determined in some areas of the city. The results of these observations suggest that the city of San José has three different kinds of air environment in relation to lichen survival: normal, transitional and desertic, as reported for other cities of the world. The most frequent air pollutants in San José are: CO, CO2, C2H5OH, Cl2, HCl, H2S, H3PO4, H2CrO4, NO, NH3, NH4 Cl, SO2 and Zn.",10,6162175,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,5

Tolerance to nitrites increased when the concentration of ascorbic acid was high. Flow-through bioassays in fingerlings showed that when the temperature increased the percent of methemoglobin in their blood also increased. The tolerance to nitrite toxicity was less in large fish than in those smaller fed the same concentration of ascorbic acid. Possibly ascorbic acid acts in the reduction of methemoglobin to hemoglobin, and also it has a protective effect against stress in the fish. A ""safe"" level of 200 mg/kg of ascorbic acid in practical diets was reached.",18,7193338,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,6
