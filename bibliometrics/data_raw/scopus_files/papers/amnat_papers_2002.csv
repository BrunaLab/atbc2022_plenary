It is also the primary and most important instance of indirect genetic effects, where genetic variation in one individual affects phenotypic variation among others. This relationship is so important in mammals that often the major factor determining the life or death of newborns is the environment provided by their mother. Variations in these environments can be due to variations in maternal genotypes. In our work with the intercross of two mouse inbred strains, LG/J and SM/J, we uncovered a very severe variation in maternal performance. These females failed to nurture their offspring and showed abnormal maternal behaviors leading to loss of their litter. Rather than this being due to a single gene variant as in knockout mice, we uncovered a complex genetic basis for this trait. The effects of genes on maternal performance are entirely context dependent in our cross. They depend on the alleles present at the same or other epistatically interacting loci. Genomic locations identified in this study include locations of candidate genes whose knockouts displayed similar aberrant maternal behavior. Behaviors significantly associated with maternal performance in this study include suckling, nest building, placentophagia, pup grooming, and retrieval of pups after disturbance.",29,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Epistasis | Genetic architecture | Mammals | Maternal care | QTL,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This European native was introduced to North America in the 1800s and subsequently spread to a large part of the continent. It is now considered a problematic weed of disturbed habitats and agricultural fields in the United States and Canada. Surveys of 86 populations in the United States and Europe revealed greater levels of attack by generalist enemies (aphids, snails, floral herbivores) in Europe compared with North America. Two specialists (seed predator, anther smut fungus) that had dramatic effects on plant fitness in Europe were either absent or in very low frequency in North America. Overall, plants were 17 times more likely to be damaged in Europe than in North America.

Here we adapt the interacting phenotype model to show how social dominance can evolve. Our model makes a number of predictions: rapid evolution of behavior, strong correlated responses in associated traits (such as a badge of status), and, because context is important for social dominance, integrated evolution of both dominant and subordinate behavior reflecting direct and indirect genetic effects and social selection. We also describe the results of empirical work, artificial selection based on social status within a hierarchy in the cockroach Nauphoeta cinerea, that we used to test the predictions of our model. There was little change within selection lines in the expression of agonistic behavior, but by just generation 7 of selection, in comparisons between lines, high-line males consistently dominated low and control males, while low-line males were consistently subordinate to high-line and control males. There was a strong correlated response to selection in the pheromonal badge of status. Some correlated responses to selection differed among replicate lines, with the compound that makes males subordinate changed in one replicate, while the compound that confers dominance was altered in the other. Overall, our results are consistent with predictions from models of interacting phenotypes: social dominance is influenced by additive genetic variation, can evolve as a result of social selection, and evolution of social interactions appears to be rapid. Finally, different responses in the replicates allowed us to test very specific predictions regarding the role of the social pheromone in N. cinerea, highlighting the value of artificial selection experiments as a tool in evolutionary behavioral genetic studies.",89,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Artificial selection | Interacting phenotypes | Pheromone | Sexual selection | Social dominance | Social selection,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Subsequent recombination of attractive male characters from the Y to the X would create physical linkage between attractive male trait and preference. A literature survey shows that Y linkage of potentially sexually antagonistic traits is common in poeciliid fishes and other species with sex chromosomes that are not well differentiated, but may also occur in taxa with degenerate Y chromosomes. In the guppy, attractive male traits are primarily Y and X linked; a literature review of the inheritance of sex-limited attractive male characters suggests that 16 are Y linked, 24 recombine between the X and Y, two are X linked, and two are autosomal.

Here we show that species richness on oceanic islands has remained relatively unchanged for land birds, with the number of naturalizations being roughly equal to the number of extinctions, and has increased dramatically for vascular plants, with the number of naturalizations greatly exceeding the number of extinctions. In fact, for plants, the net number of species on islands has approximately doubled. We show further that these patterns are robust to differences in the history of human occupation of these islands and to the possibility of undocumented species extinctions.

Apart from strong contributions of environmental variance in reducing heritabilities, the additive genetic components can be very low, especially when they are camouflaged by nonadditive genetic effects. We first report the heritabilities of courtship traits in founder-flush and control populations of the housefly (Musca domestica L.). We estimated the heritability of each male and female display through the regression of the courtships involving daughters and sons (with randomly selected mates) onto the ""midparental"" courtship values of their parents. Overall, the average heritability was significantly (P = .012) higher for the parent-daughter assays than for the parent-son assays. We attributed the low (even negative) heritabilities to genotype-by-environment interactions whereby the male's behavior is influenced by the ""environment"" of his mating partner's preferences for the display, generating epistasis through indirect genetic effects. Moreover, bottlenecked lines had up to 800% of the heritability of the controls, suggesting ""conversion"" of additive genetic variance from nonadditive components. Second, we used line-cross assays on separate populations that had been selected for divergence in mating behavior to identify dominance and epistasis through heterosis and outbreeding depression in courtship. Finally, our literature review confirms the prevalence of such low heritabilities (i.e., a conservative mean of 0.38) and nonadditive genetics in other behavioral repertoires (64% of the studies).

Using a recently compiled database on insect nutrient content, we found that predators exhibit on average 15% greater nitrogen content than herbivores. This difference persists after accounting for variation from phylogeny and allometry. Among herbivorous insects, we also found evidence that recently derived lineages (e.g., herbivorous Diptera and Lepidoptera) have, on a relative basis, 15%-25% less body nitrogen than more ancient herbivore lineages (e.g., herbivorous Orthoptera and Hemiptera). We elaborate several testable hypotheses for the origin of differences in nitrogen content between trophic levels and among phylogenetic lineages. For example, interspecific variation in insect nitrogen content may be directly traceable to differences in dietary nitrogen (including dilution by gut contents), selected for directly in response to the differential scarcity of dietary nitrogen, or an indirect consequence of adaptation to different feeding habits. From some functional perspectives, the magnitude rather than the source of the interspecific differences in nitrogen content may be most critical.

In this article, we review how genetic analyses of behavior are central to topics ranging from understanding past selection and predicting future evolution to explaining the neural and hormonal control of behavior. Furthermore, we review both new and old techniques for studying evolutionary behavior genetics and highlight how the choice of approach depends on both the question and the organism.

Two recent developments serve to expand the relevance of such studies to behavioral ecology.

To test this hypothesis, we examined the sizes of 14 introns in a nonflying relative of birds, the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), and in 19 flighted and flightless birds in 12 taxonomic orders. Our results indicate that a substantial fraction (66%) of the reduction in intron size as well as in genome size had already occurred in nonflying archosaurs. Using phylogenetically independent contrasts, we found that the proposed inverse correlation of genome size and basal metabolic rate (BMR) is significant among amniotes and archosaurs, whereas intron and genome size variation within birds showed no significant correlation with BMR. We show statistically that the distribution of genome sizes in birds and mammals is underdispersed compared with the Brownian motion model and consistent with strong stabilizing selection; that genome size differences between vertebrate clades are overdispersed and punctuational; and that evolution of BMR and avian intron size is consistent with Brownian motion. These results suggest that the contrast between genome size/BMR and intron size/BMR correlations may be a consequence of different intensities of selection for these traits and that we should not expect changes in intron size to be significantly associated with metabolically costly behaviors such as flight.",77,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Archosaurs | C-value | Comparative method | Genomics | Introns | Metabolic rate,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,20,539-552,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

Two opposing evolutionary forces are assumed to act: stabilizing selection on the trait, which favors genotypes with an intermediate phenotype, and intraspecific competition mediated by that trait, which favors genotypes whose effect on the trait deviates most from that of the prevailing genotypes. Accordingly, fitnesses of genotypes have a frequency-independent component describing stabilizing selection and a frequency- and density-dependent component modeling competition. We study how the underlying genetics, in particular recombination rate and relative magnitude of allelic effects, interact with the conflicting selective forces and derive the resulting, surprisingly complex equilibrium patterns. We also investigate the conditions under which disruptive selection on the phenotypes can be observed and examine how much genetic variation can be maintained in such a model. We discovered a number of unexpected phenomena. For instance, we found that with little recombination the degree of stably maintained polymorphism and the equilibrium genetic variance can decrease as the strength of competition increases relative to the strength of stabilizing selection. In addition, we found that mean fitness at the stable equilibria is usually much lower than the maximum possible mean fitness and often even lower than the fitness at other, unstable equilibria.

We construct and analyze a model of peatlands that sheds some light on this problem. The model is a set of six coupled differential equations that define the flow of nutrients from moss and vascular plants to their litters, then to peat, and finally to an inorganic nutrient resource pool. We first analyze a simple version of this model (model 1) in which all nutrient input is from precipitation and enters the moss compartment directly, mimicking the dynamics of ombrotrophic bogs. There is a transcritical bifurcation that results in a switch of stability between two equilibrium bog communities: a moss monoculture and a community where mosses and vascular plants coexist. The bifurcation depends on the magnitudes of the input/output budget of the peatland and the life-history traits of the plants. We generalize model 1 to model 2 by dividing nutrient inputs between precipitation and groundwater, thus also allowing the development of minerotrophic fens that receive nutrient subsidies from both groundwater and precipitation and adding intraspecific competition (self-limitation) terms for both moss and vascular plants. Partitioning precipitation inputs between moss and the nutrient pool resulted in the greatest changes in model behavior, including the appearance of a lake and a vascular plant monoculture as well as the moss monoculture and coexistence equilibrium. As with model 1, these solutions are separated by transcritical bifurcations depending on critical combinations of parameters determining the input-output budget of the peatland as well as the life-history characteristics of the plant species. Model 2 also allowed for an early transient spike in vascular plant dominance followed by approach to near moss monoculture and then eventual approach to coexistence equilibrium.

When low population density or low mobility of a species limits the number of potential mates, simultaneous hermaphrodites may have a selective advantage because, first, they are able to adjust the allocation of resources between male and female functions in order to maximize fitness; second, in a hermaphroditic population the likelihood of meeting a partner is higher because all individuals are potential mates; and, third, in the absence of mating partners, many simultaneously hermaphroditic animals have the option of reproducing through self-fertilization. Recognizing that mate availability is central to the existing theory of hermaphroditism in animals, it is important to examine the effects of mate search on predictions of the stability of hermaphroditism. Many hermaphroditic animals can increase the number of potential mates they contact by active searching. However, since mate search has costs in terms of time and energy, the increased number of potential mates will be traded off against the amount of resources that can be allocated to the production of gametes. We explore the consequences of this trade-off to the evolution of mating strategies and to the selective advantage of self-fertilization. We show that in low and moderate population densities, poor mate-search efficiency and high costs of searching stabilize hermaphroditism and bias sex allocation toward female function. In addition, in very low population densities, there is strong selective advantage for self-fertilization, but this advantage decreases considerably in species with high mate-search efficiency. Most important, however, we present a novel evolutionary prediction: when mate search is efficient, disruptive frequency-dependent selection on time allocation to mate search leads to the evolution of searching and nonsearching phenotypes and, ultimately, to the evolution of males and females.",45,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Functional gender | Hermaphroditism | Reproductive strategies | Self-fertilization | Separate sexes | Sex allocation,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,23,645-660,NA,NA,NA,NA

In Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis, the genital appendages are too wide to penetrate the spermathecae, but males use a different mechanism in which the aedeagus stimulates the vaginal sensilla that control spermathecal sperm release. Since these sensilla are used during egg fertilization and oviposition, it was hypothesized that this function evolved before the male stimulatory ability. I investigated this using Hetaerina cruentata, a species whose position in the Calopterygidae phylogeny is more basal than Calopteryx. Given this position and having determined that males of this species are not able to displace sperm of their conspecific females during copulation, it was expected that H. cruentata females would eject sperm when stimulated with the aedeagi of C. haemorrhoidalis but not when stimulated with the aedeagi of their conspecifics. This prediction was confirmed. In order to investigate the widespread nature of this result, some other Calopteryx species-Calopteryx xanthostoma and Calopteryx virgo-were investigated. The results were similar to those of H. cruentata: conspecific males were unable to stimulate their females, but females ejected sperm when stimulated with C. haemorrhoidalis aedeagi. Morphometric analysis suggests that the mechanistic explanation for the stimulatory ability of C. haemorrhoidalis genitalia is that the aedeagal region that makes contact with the vaginal sensilla is wider in C. haemorrhoidalis than in the other species. These results suggest that the sensory ""bias"" shown and shared by H. cruentata, Calopteryx splendens, C. virgo, and C. haemorrhoidalis females represents an ancestral condition and that the male stimulatory ability is absent in the evolutionary history of the clade. These pieces of evidence as well as another one presented elsewhere, which indicates that C. haemorrhoidalis males vary in their stimulatory ability, constitute the three criteria for a case of sexual selection via exploitation of a female sensory bias. These results also provide support to the sensory trap hypothesis that indicates that the female bias-in this case, egg fertilization and oviposition-evolved in a context different from sexual selection. Considering that the male genital appendages responsible for physically removing spermathecal sperm in other calopterygids are present in C. haemorrhoidalis, I suggest that males were once able to displace spermathecal sperm physically. Such ability may have been later impeded by a reduction in size of the spermathecal ducts. Possibly, one of the latest events in this sequence is the male's stimulatory ability.

I propose a computationally feasible approximation method, which approximates the behavior of a heterogeneous SPOM by an ""ideal"" metapopulation inhabiting a network of identical and equally connected habitat patches. The transformation to the ideal metapopulation is based on weighting the individual patch occupancies by the dynamic values of the habitat patches, which may be calculated from the deterministic mean-field approximation of the original SPOM. Conceptually, the method resembles the calculation of the effective size of a population in the context of population genetics. I demonstrate how the method may be applied to SPOMs with flexible structural assumptions and with spatially correlated and temporally varying parameter values.

Each prey species is characterized by a trait that determines both the rate of resource capture and vulnerability to a predator. In a simple model of a three-species food chain, such traits usually increase in response to an imposed reduction in resource density. When the per capita growth rates of each of two prey species depend linearly on resource density, such traits will change in opposite directions when the two prey come into sympatry. In addition, the ratio of the effect of the predator on prey fitness to the effect of the resource on prey fitness will diverge from the corresponding ratio in a second prey species when those species coexist in sympatry. These simple predictions need not hold under several alternative assumptions, which may be more common in biological systems. Parallel changes in sympatry may occur if the relationship between resource consumption and prey growth is non-linear, if the prey species have partial overlap in the set of resources used or in the set of predators that consume them, or if prey experience direct intraspecific competition. The responses to a second prey can also differ significantly from those predicted by the simplest model if separate traits affect vulnerability to predators and resource acquisition rate.

A particular problem is that previous models assume that skew in paternity is determined by interactions among males and males only. This conflicts with observations from many species that indicate that females exert control over the distribution of paternity. Here we address this shortfall in the current theory by developing two models to explore the expected patterns of skew in three member groups in which a female controls the allocation of paternity among two males. The first ""staying incentive"" model extends previous ""transactional"" (or ""concession"") models to examine the conditions where females will be willing to share reproduction among a dominant and a subordinate male to retain the subordinate in the group. The second ""work incentive"" model explores patterns of skew where females allocate paternity in order to maximize the amount of care their offspring receive. The models make contrasting predictions about the nature of male-female conflict over reproduction and also about the relationships between skew and relatedness, ecological constraints, the relative quality of the subordinate male, and the relative cost of care for the two males.

Viviparity has arisen in many oviparous reptile lineages that have invaded colder climates. Thermal advantages (eggs retained within the mother's body will be warmer than those laid in the nest) are almost certainly important, but the actual selective pressures remain controversial. For example, the benefit to retention might involve faster development, protection against freezing, predation, or desiccation, or modification of hatchling phenotypes. I experimentally manipulated incubation regimes of a montane scincid lizard (Bassiana duperreyi, Scincidae) to test these ideas. Eggs maintained in cooler ""nests"" in the laboratory developed more slowly, were more likely to die before hatching, and produced inferior (small, slow) hatchlings. A 2-wk initial period of higher-temperature incubation (simulating uterine retention, an intermediate step toward viviparity) ameliorated these effects. In the field, I placed eggs in artificial nests at the upper elevational limit of natural nests and also extending a further 100 m higher on the mountain. The results mirrored those in the laboratory: retention at maternal body temperatures accelerated hatching, enhanced hatching success, and increased locomotor speeds of hatchlings. This selective advantage of uterine retention was greater at higher elevations and increased with longer retention. The causal process responsible was prolonged low-temperature incubation rather than freezing, desiccation, or predation, and both hatching success and hatchling viability were affected.

This is the case only if the lower developmental threshold is the same for all developmental stages. In this study, the incidence of rate isomorphy in seven species of mites and 342 species from 11 insect orders (some represented by several populations) was determined. Whether a species shows rate isomorphy or not was determined over a range of temperatures where the relationship between the rate of development and temperature is linear. Proportion of total developmental time spent in a particular stage was plotted against temperature and the existence of rate isomorphy inferred from a zero change in proportion. Rate isomorphy was detected in 243 (57%) of 426 populations. In the rest of the cases, rate isomorphy was violated by deviations in the proportion of time spent in a stage by an average of 0.2% (range 4.5E-06% to 2.8%) at the mean of the range of temperatures of all the data sets (11Â°C). The violations occurred most frequently at the extremes of the linear phase, which is attributed to methodical biases, mortality at low temperatures, or too coarse an estimate of developmental time at high temperatures. Similarly, a meta-analysis also revealed an overall prevalence of rate isomorphy. Consequently, in insect and mite species, all the developmental stages appear to have the same population-specific lower developmental threshold. The existence of rate isomorphy could be of great practical importance, for example, in the timing of life-history events and in determining preadult thermal requirements.

The main findings are as follows: Wolbachia differences in the two populations are maintained up to a threshold migration rate, above which the system collapses to a single Wolbachia type; differential selection at a nuclear locus increases the threshold migration rate below which Wolbachia polymorphisms are maintained; Wolbachia differences between the populations enhance their genetic divergence at the selected locus by reducing the ""effective migration rate,"" and even moderate levels of CI can cause large population differences in allele frequencies; and asymmetric CI can induce strong asymmetries in effective migration rate and dramatically alter the pattern of genetic divergence compared with the No Wolbachia situation.

In a nonspatial model, empirically derived competition-colonization trade-offs related to seed mass were insufficient to generate coexistence. This was unchanged by spatial structure or interspecific variation in the fraction of seeds dispersing globally. These results differ from those of the more generalized competition-colonization models because the latter assume completely asymmetric competition, an assumption that appears unrealistic considering existing data for annual systems. When, for heuristic purposes, completely asymmetric competition was incorporated into our models, unlimited coexistence was possible. However, in the resulting abundance patterns, the best competitors/poorest colonizers were the most abundant, the opposite of that observed in natural systems. By contrast, these natural patterns were produced by competition-colonization models where environmental heterogeneity permitted species coexistence.

Immune defense has several characteristics that complicate this approach, however; for example, because of the risk of autoimmunity, optimal immune defense is not necessarily maximum immune defense. Two important types of cost associated with immunity in the context of life history are resource costs, those related to the allocation of essential but limited resources, such as energy or nutrients, and option costs, those paid not in the currency of resources but in functional or structural components of the organism. Resource and option costs are likely to apply to different aspects of resistance. Recent investigations into possible trade-offs between reproductive effort, particularly sexual displays, and immunity have suggested interesting functional links between the two. Although all organisms balance the costs of immune defense against the requirements of reproduction, this balance works out differently for males than it does for females, creating sex differences in immune response that in turn are related to ecological factors such as the mating system.

This system has little direct social impact, and it is readily amenable to experimental manipulation. Our microevolutionary studies have focused on the host shift of Microbotryum from Silene alba (=latifolia; white campion) onto Silene vulgaris (bladder campion) in a population in Virginia. Karyotypic variation shows that the host shift is recent and originates from the disease on sympatric S. alba. Analysis of the spatial pattern of disease shows that the host shift has been contingent on the co-occurrence of the two species at a local scale. Cross-inoculation studies show that families of the new host differ greatly in their susceptibility to the pathogen, indicating the potential for rapid evolution of resistance. Disease expression on the new host is frequently abnormal, suggesting that the pathogen is imperfectly adapted to its new host. In experimental populations, disease transmission within populations of the old host is greater than within populations of the new host. However, there is also a high transmission rate of the disease from the new host back to the old host, suggesting a feedback effect that increases disease prevalence in the community as a whole.

Utilizing estimates of breeding values instead of phenotypic data with these methods can eliminate environmentally induced bias, although this approach is more difficult to implement. Despite this potential limitation to phenotypic methods and the availability of a potential solution, little empirical evidence exists on the extent of environmentally induced bias in phenotypic estimates of selection. In this article, we present a method for detecting bias in phenotypic estimates of selection and demonstrate its use with three independent data sets. Nearly 25% of the phenotypic selection gradients estimated from our data are biased by environmental covariances. We find that bias caused by environmental covariances appears mainly to affect quantitative estimates of the strength of selection based on phenotypic data and that the magnitude of these biases is large.

We compare three routes to breeding: departing to search for territories as a floater, staying and queuing to inherit the natal territory, or queuing and eventually shifting to a neighboring vacancy. Our model assumed a dominance-structured population. It quantifies the benefits of philopatry for varying-rank subordinates and contrasts it against the benefit of dispersal. We apply the model to data on Siberian jay Perisoreus infaustus, a species in which retained offspring do not help at the nest. The results indicate that territorial inheritance plays a small role in this species (presumably due to inbreeding avoidance), and territory acquisition is less constrained for dispersing than philopatric offspring. Nevertheless, small family groups-one or, at the most, two same-sex queuers-are predicted to form because philopatric offspring gain nepotistic benefits that improve their survival. This fits with data on group sizes and supports the idea of the natal territory as a safe haven for waiting for breeding opportunities. We also discuss our predictions in the light of ecological constraints and clarify recent confusingly different predictions on the role of habitat saturation as an explanation for delayed dispersal and cooperative breeding.

The fungi (Clavicipitaceae, Ascomycota) grow intercellularly and systemically in aboveground plant parts. Vertically transmitted asexual endophytes forming asymptomatic infections of cool-season grasses have been repeatedly derived from sexual species that abort host inflorescences. The phylogenetic distribution of seed-transmitted endophytes is strongly suggestive of cocladogenesis with their hosts. Molecular evidence indicates that many seed-transmitted endophytes are interspecific hybrids. Superinfection may result in hyphal fusion and parasexual recombination. Most endophytes produce one or more alkaloid classes that likely play some role in defending the host plant against pests. Hybridization may have led to the proliferation of alkaloid-production genes among asexual endophytes, favoring hybrids. The ergot alkaloid ergovaline, lolitrems, and lolines are produced by only a single sexual species, EpichloÃ« festucae, but they are common in seed-transmitted endophytes, suggesting that E. festucae contributed genes for their synthesis. Asexual hybrids may also be favored by the counteracting of the accumulation of deleterious mutations (Muller's rachet).

Estimates of infection frequency have revealed variable levels of infection with especially high prevalence in the subfamily Pooideae.

This article takes a different perspective and explores first the evolutionary interests and leverages of the fungal cultivars, then dissects eight potential evolutionary conflicts between ants and cultivars. Three types of ant-cultivar conflict are examined in depth. First, ant-cultivar conflict over the ant sex ratio is predicted because the cultivars are dispersed by female foundresses but not by males; cultivars thus may be selected to bias the ant sex ratio toward females. Second, ant-cultivar conflict over fungal sexual reproduction exists if the fungi are able to escape from the symbiosis and live independently, as is implied by phylogenetic analyses of the fungi; this conflict is exacerbated in colonies that experience queen death or senescence. A literature review reveals that sexual fruiting of attine cultivars is more common than has been traditionally realized and often occurs in moribund colonies. Third, the routine transplanting of fungal mycelium by ants could generate, through sensory-biased symbiont choice, selection favoring fungal features that increase the likelihood of transplantation within nests (symbiont drive) but that are detrimental to the survival of the whole colony. A balanced perspective incorporating both ant and fungal interests emerges as a more appropriate framework than the traditional myrmicocentric perspective.

Consumer-resource models predict that equilibrium or average population size can increase with deteriorating environmental conditions over a large part of the range of the environmental parameter that allows persistence. The initial insensitivity or increase in the population of the focal species occurs because changes in the populations of other components of the food web compensate for the decline in one or more fitness components of the focal population. However, the compensatory processes are generally nonlinear and often approach their limits abruptly rather than gradually. When there is steady directional change in the environment, populations lag behind the equilibrium population size specified by current environmental conditions. The environmental variable can then decline below the level required for population persistence while the population size is still close to or greater than its original value.

This model allows for hosts with either a fixed (i.e., genetic) or conditional (i.e., a phenotypically plastic) response to parasitism. It also considers superinfections. We show that parasitism always favors increased allocation to host reproduction, but because of epidemiological feedbacks, the evolutionarily stable host reproductive effort does not always increase with parasite virulence. Superinfection drives the evolution of parasite virulence and acts on the evolution of the host through parasite evolution, generally leading to higher host reproductive effort.

In most sexual species, females produce few large ova, whereas males produce many tiny sperm. This difference in initial parental investment is presumed to exert a fundamental influence on sex differences in mating and parental behavior, resulting in a taxonomic bias toward parental care in females and away from parental care in males. In this article, we reexamine the logic of this argument as well as the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) theory often used to substantiate it. We show that the classic ESS model, which contrasts parental care with offspring desertion, violates the necessary relationship between mean male and female fitness. When the constraint of equal male and female mean fitness is correctly incorporated into the ESS model, its results are congruent with those of evolutionary genetic theory for the evolution of genes with direct and indirect effects. Male parental care evolves whenever half the magnitude of the indirect effect of paternal care on offspring viability exceeds the direct effect of additional mating success gained by desertion. When the converse is true, desertion invades and spreads. In the absence of a genetic correlation between the sexes, the evolution of paternal care is independent of maternal care. Theories based on sex differences in gametic investment make no such specific predictions.

Asymmetric dispersal rates can lead to over-crowding of the ""downstream"" habitat, resulting in a source-sink population structure in the absence of intrinsic quality differences between habitats or can even cause an intrinsically better habitat to function as a sink. Source-sink population structure due to asymmetric dispersal rates has similar consequences for adaptive evolution as a source-sink structure due to habitat quality differences: natural selection tends to be biased toward the source habitat. We demonstrate this for two models of adaptive evolution: invasion of a rare allele that improves fitness in one habitat but reduces it in the other and antagonistic selection on a quantitative trait determined by five additive loci. If a habitat can sustain a population without immigration, the conditions for adaptation to that habitat are most favorable if there is little or no immigration from the other habitat; the influence of emigration depends on the magnitude of the allelic effects involved and other parameters. If, however, the population is initially unable to persist in a given habitat without immigration, our model predicts that the population will be most likely to adapt to that habitat if the dispersal rates in both directions are high.

We present a reaction-diffusion model for the ecological dynamics governing the velocity of the current epidemic's spread. We find that the equilibrium density of infectious tick nymphs (hence the risk of human disease) can depend on density-independent survival interacting with biotic effects on the tick's stage structure. The local risk of infection reaches a maximum at an intermediate level of adult tick mortality and at an intermediate rate of juvenile tick attacks on mammalian hosts. If the juvenile tick attack rate is low, an increase generates both a greater density of infectious nymphs and an increased spatial velocity. However, if the juvenile attack rate is relatively high, nymph density may decline while the epidemic's velocity still increases.

We tested this prediction by maintaining 67 female garter snakes (Thamnophis elegans) at eight different constant temperatures (21Â°-33Â°C) during pregnancy and making a series of scale counts on their newborn offspring (n = 491). To insure that the experimental temperatures were ecologically relevant, we used automated radiotelemetry to record the body temperature of pregnant, free-ranging females. The resulting temperature data allowed us to test the prediction that the inflection points of reaction norms would correspond to the average temperature experienced by embryos in the field. In line with predictions of the Osgood model, reaction norms were flat or U-shaped. In the case of U-shaped reaction norms, the inflection point of the curves corresponded to the average temperature imposed on embryos by free-ranging females.

Our goals are to develop general principles and to relate these principles to salmon population dynamics. The analytical model describes the dynamics of two density-dependent subpopulations, connected by dispersal, whose growth rates fluctuate in response to environmental and demographic stochasticity.

We first study a simple model in which the host does not coevolve with the parasite (i.e., the frequency of resistant hosts is independent of the parasite). We show that a higher proportion of resistant host decreases the ES level of parasite virulence. Higher levels of the efficiency of host resistance, however, do not always decrease the ES parasite virulence.

In particular, we show that the effects of variable harvesting on the variance in population density and yield depend critically on the autocorrelation of environmental noise and on whether the endogenous dynamics of the population display over- or undercompensation to density. These factors interact in complicated ways; harvesting shifts the slope of the renewal function, and the net effect of this shift will depend on the sign and magnitude of the other influences. For example, when environmental noise exhibits a positive autocorrelation, the relative importance of a variable harvest to the variance in density increases with overcompensation but decreases with undercompensation. For a fixed harvesting level, an increasing level of autocorrelation in environmental noise will decrease the relative variation in population density when overcompensation would otherwise occur. These and other intricate interactions have important ramifications for the interpretation of time series data when no prior knowledge of demographic or environmental details exists.

Here, I consider a discrete model of the coevolution of parasites with host-acquired immunity. In this model, if the effective recombination rate is low, strain structure can be maintained for very high levels of cross-protection. However, if the effective recombination rate is higher, this strain structure can no longer be maintained. The effective recombination rate is affected by the actual recombination rate between immunologically selected loci, the proportion of individuals that reproduce sexually, whether recombination occurs inside or outside of the host or vector, and the level of cross-protection. The model predicts that for Plasmodium falciparum, where reproduction occurs inside of a vector, we expect to see strain structure in areas of low transmission but not in areas of high transmission.

This is largely because of the constraining effects of low rainfall on productivity in high-PET areas. The increase in the importance of vegetation heterogeneity as an explanatory variable is caused largely by an increase in the range of vegetation heterogeneity included at coarse resolutions and is probably also a result of the positive effects of environmental heterogeneity on species richness.

If turbulent diffusion is too high, phytoplankton are mixed to great depths, and the depth-averaged light conditions are too low to allow net positive population growth. Conversely, if turbulent diffusion is too low, sinking phytoplankton populations end up at the ocean floor and succumb in the dark. At intermediate levels of turbulent diffusion, however, phytoplankton populations can outgrow both mixing rates and sinking rates. In this way, the reproducing population as a whole can maintain a position in the well-lit zone near the top of the water column, even if all individuals within the population have a tendency to sink.

Little empirical evidence exists to show that increased plasticity leads to reduced growth and development, leads to increased developmental instability, or limits the ability of organisms to produce more extreme phenotypes. I used half-sib families of larval wood frogs (Rana sylvatica) reared in outdoor mesocosms to examine how tadpoles altered behavioral, morphological, and life-historical traits in response to larval dragonfly predators (Anax longipes). The predators induced lower activity and the development of relatively large tails and small bodies in wood frogs. As a result, wood frogs experienced reduced growth and development. I then examined whether tadpole sibships with higher plasticity experienced fitness costs (above and beyond the costs of expressing a particular phenotype) and whether they were limited in producing extreme phenotypes. Fitness effects of plasticity were widespread. Depending on the trait examined and the environment experienced, increased plasticity had either positive effects, negative effects, or no effects on tadpole mass, development, and survivorship. I found no relationship between increased plasticity and greater developmental instability.

Although the traffic is composed of eusocial organisms with a common interest in group success, the coarse-grained behavior of Atta traffic displays little more coordination than a moving fluid. The relationship between speed and concentration implies that maximum flow rates (which are likely to be closely tied to colony-level rates of resource acquisition) occur at a relatively high concentration that keeps individual speeds well below their ""free flow"" maximum.

Natural hybrid zones contain recombinant individuals resulting from many generations of hybridization and thus offer a potential solution to these problems. For studies of speciation, hybrid zones offer the possibility of mapping QTL simultaneously with assessments of their effects on assortative mating, hybrid fitness, and interspecific gene flow. Here, we explore the problems and prospects associated with genetic map building and QTL analyses in natural hybrid zones by analyzing correlations among markers of known genomic location in four hybrid zones between the wild sunflower species Helianthus annuus and Helianthus petiolaris. Results indicate that mapping in hybrid zones presents many challenges. These include overlap in the strength of marker correlations between linked and unlinked markers, unevenness in marker frequencies along linkages, and heterogeneity in the relationship between marker distances and correlations. All make it difficult to accurately group and order markers or to estimate the distances between them. These problems can be ameliorated by sampling strategies that maximize the difference in linkage disequilibria between linked and unlinked markers and that minimize differences in frequencies among markers or QTL.

For example, negative genetic correlations between fitness traits in different environments (i.e., genetic trade-offs) are thought to influence the evolution of specialization, while positive genetic correlations between performance and characters influencing assortative mating can accelerate the evolution of reproductive isolation between ecologically specialized populations. We first discuss how the genetic architecture of a suite of traits may affect the evolutionary role of genetic correlations among them and review how the mechanisms of correlations can be analyzed using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping.

The model results indicate that the dynamics of vegetation on coarse scales are determined by the interaction of two spatial feedback processes. Loss of plant cover in a certain area results in increased availability of water in remaining vegetated patches through run-on of surface water, promoting within-patch plant production. Hence, spatial redistribution of surface water creates negative feedback between reduced plant cover and increased plant growth in remaining vegetation. Reduced plant cover, however, results in focusing of herbivore grazing in the remaining vegetation.

This threshold effect should be generic to both natural blooms and most simulation models. Furthermore, predictions are given as to how the peak of the bloom Pmax is determined by initial conditions.

When spatial structure prevents the populations from being well mixed, such predators may have a selective disadvantage because they do not make full use of the prey's growth capacity and hence produce fewer propagules. The best strategy then depends on the degree to which predators can monopolize the exploitation of local prey populations, which in turn depends on the spatial structure, the number of migrants, and, in particular, the stochastic nature of the colonization process. To analyze the evolutionary dynamics of predators in a spatially structured predator-prey system, we performed simulations with a metapopulation model that has explicit local dynamics of nonpersistent populations, keeps track of the number of emigrants entering the migration pool, assumes individuals within local populations as well as within the migration pool to be well mixed, and takes stochastic colonization into account. We investigated which of the predator's exploitation strategies are evolutionarily stable and whether these strategies minimize the overall density of prey, as is the case in Lotka-Volterra-type models of competitive exclusion. This was analyzed by pairwise invasibility plots based on short-term simulations and tested by long-term simulation experiments of competition between resident and mutant predator-types that differed in one of the following parameters: the prey-to-predator conversion efficiency, the per capita prey consumption rate, or the per capita emigration rate from local populations. In addition, we asked which of these three strategies are most likely to evolve. Our simulations showed that under selection for conversion efficiency the predator-prey system always goes globally extinct yet persists under selection for consumption or emigration rates and that the evolutionarily stable (ES) exploitation strategies do not maximize local population growth rates. The most successful exploitation strategy minimizes the overall density of prey but does not make it settle exactly at the minimum. The system did not settle at the point where the mean time to co-invasion (i.e., immigration of a second predator in a local prey population) equals the mean local interaction time (an idea borne out from studies on host exploitation strategies in host-pathogen systems) but rather where the mean time to co-invasion was larger. The ES exploitation strategies represent more prudent strategies than the ones that minimize prey density. Finally, we show that - compared to consumption - emigration is a more likely target for selection to achieve prudent exploitation and that prudent exploitation strategies can evolve only provided the prey-to-predator conversion efficiency is subject to constraints.",23,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Evolutionarily stable strategy | Exploitation | Metapopulation model | Natural selection | Predator-prey interaction | Virulence,12604,undefined,0,FALSE,99,172-189,NA,NA,NA,NA

The two trade-offs interact in determining best life histories, but this effect is generally small, supporting the validity of studies addressing the trade-offs separately. The accumulation-export trade-off responds strongly to the three gradients, increasing export with productivity and with patch extinction rate when this rate is high but decreasing export with higher stress; the expansion-survival trade-off increases expansion with productivity but fails to respond to stress and patch extinction rate gradients, except when the other trade-off does not occur.

We used a spatially-explicit, individual-based model to assess the effects of each of these processes on species richness, relative abundance, and spatial patterns such as the species-area curve. Our model communities had an order-of-magnitude more individuals than any previous such study, and we also developed a finite-size scaling analysis to infer the large-scale properties of these systems in order to establish the generality of our conclusions across system sizes.

Three complementary models are presented: the generation of a grass height structure through selective grazing; investigating the conditions for consumer coexistence; and, using a simplified resource structure, the consequences for consumer abundance. The main finding is that coexistence between grazers differing in body size is possible if a single-resource type becomes differentiated in its height structure. Large grazers can facilitate food availability for smaller species but with the latter being competitively dominant. The relative preference given to different resource partitions is important in determining the nature of population interactions. Large-body and small-body grazer populations can interact through competitive, parasitic, commensalist, or amensalist relationships, depending on the way they partition the resource as well as their relative populations and the dynamics of resource renewal.

We show that this disincentive to help can potentially be offset by increased productivity, increased life span, and insurance-based benefits for helpers if they survive to inherit dominance in larger groups. We analyze a field experiment in which group size was manipulated in the hover wasp Liostenogaster flavolineata. Productivity increased linearly with group size, larger groups were less likely to fail, and dominants in larger groups may have lived longer. Combined with the probability of inheriting dominance, these effects led overall to a negative correlation between group size and expected direct fitness, mainly because group size decreased during our study period, so that helpers could not expect to inherit as large a group as they started queuing in.

Here, we use a relatively general optimization model for age and size at life-history transitions to argue that current life-history theory cannot adequately explain these results. Specifically, most such theory requires key assumptions that are unlikely to be generally met. This suggests that some important component of the biology of many organisms must be missing from many of the models in life-history theory. We suggest that this missing component might be the phenomenon of developmental thresholds. There are at least two different types of developmental thresholds possible, and we incorporate these into our general optimality model to demonstrate how they can cause a negative relationship between growth conditions and age at a transition. If developmental thresholds are common throughout taxa, then this might explain the empirical results. Our model formulation and analysis also formalizes the popular Wilbur-Collins hypothesis for age and size at metamorphosis in amphibians.

The immunocompetence handicap hypothesis was developed to provide a handicapping mechanism to stabilize the correlation between signals and health. In earlier articles, I showed that handicap signaling is a special case, not a general law that we can rely on to deduce relative costs across signalers of different quality at equilibrium. The essential requirement for reliable signaling is that higher-quality signalers are more efficient; they get greater marginal fitness returns from an incremental increase in the signal. This does not undermine the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis or the immunocompetence mechanism, but it does raise doubts about a widespread assumption that is commonly used to test these hypotheses: that sexual selection on signals of health implies the choice of mates with the fewest parasites. Immunity and parasites might play a fundamental role in many biological signaling systems, but viability-indicating traits are not necessarily parasite-load-indicating traits. Theory allows for the possibility that high-quality big signalers have greater health and more parasites than low-quality small signalers (and the data suggest that in many systems they do).

Such hierarchies have been proposed to form and to be maintained through an equitable skew in reproduction for both dominants and subordinates.

Neither, however, seems to be generally present in the colony initiation phase of temperate polistine wasps, although the behaviors of individuals within such groups are often consistent with skew model predictions. This apparent contradiction can be resolved in the context of a special case of the skew models that incorporate mother-offspring conflicts over sex ratios. Data suggest that all the needed preconditions are present for cooperating foundresses to gain an added benefit through producing male-biased investment ratios. Therefore, the special case model predicts that cooperation can evolve in Hymenoptera with both the observed high skews and reduced per capita group productivity. Further predictions of the special case model (e.g., mixed populations of single and multifoundresses) are also supported. Because the special case model is applicable only to haplodiploids, this may explain why cooperation in vertebrates rarely occurs without significant ecological or physiological constraints.

We parameterize a mechanistic resource-based model for mast seeding in Chionochloa pallens (Poaceae) using a long-term individually structured data set. Each plant's energy reserves were reconstructed using annual inputs (growing degree days), outputs (flowering), and a novel regression technique. This allowed the estimation of the parameters that control internal plant resource dynamics, and thereby allowed different models for masting to be tested against each other. Models based only on plant size, season degree days, and/or climatic dues (warm January temperatures) fail to reproduce the pattern of autocovariation in individual flowering and the high levels of flowering synchrony seen in the field. This shows that resource-matching or simple cue-based models cannot account for this example of mast seeding. In contrast, the resource-based model pulsed by a simple climate cue accurately describes both individual-level and population-level aspects of the data. The fitted resource-based model, in the absence of environmental forcing, has chaotic (but often statistically periodic) dynamics. Environmental forcing synchronizes individual reproduction, and the models predict highly variable seed production in close agreement with the data. An evolutionary model shows that the chaotic internal resource dynamics, as predicted by the fitted model, is selectively advantageous provided that adult mortality is low and seeds survive for more than 1 yr, both of which are true for C. pallens. Highly variable masting and chaotic dynamics appear to be advantageous in this case because they reduce seed losses to specialist seed predators, while balancing the costs of missed reproductive events.",131,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Predator satiation | Resource matching | Seed bank | Synchrony | Time-series analysis,12604,0072909,0,FALSE,127,44-59,all,All Open Access,BIO,Directorate for Biological Sciences

The large genetic difference between them contrasts with their similarity in plumage, size, shape, and courtship behavior. They differ in song, which is a key factor in premating isolation of other sympatric Darwin's finches. We conducted playback experiments to see whether members of the population of C. olivacea on Santa Cruz Island would respond to songs of C. fusca from two islands, Genovesa and Pinta, and songs of C. olivacea from another island (Isabela). Another set of experiments was performed, using the same playback tapes, with C. fusca on Genovesa. Some members of both populations responded to all playbacks; therefore, the hypothesis of complete premating isolation on the basis of song is rejected. Discrimination between songs of the two lineages was inconsistent. We conclude that premating barriers to interbreeding among the tested populations have not arisen in the 1.5-2.0 m.yr. of their geographical isolation on different islands. This contrasts with strong premating barriers between more recently derived sympatric species. Early learning of song associated with morphology is later used in mate recognition. This explains why sympatric species that are vocally and morphologically distinct yet genetically less differentiated than Certhidea do not interbreed, whereas the Certhidea lineages that are genetically well differentiated but vocally and morphologically similar have no apparent premating barrier. We discuss this unusual situation in terms of the forces that have produced similarities and differences in song, morphology, and ecology and their relevance to phylogenetic and biological species concepts.

Most clades, given enough time, will diversify adaptively to some extent; therefore, we argue that the term ""adaptive radiation"" should be reserved for those clades that are exceptionally diverse in terms of the range of habitats occupied and attendant morphological adaptations. Making such a definition operational, however, requires a comparative analysis of many clades. Only by comparing clades can one distinguish those that are exceptionally diverse (or nondiverse) from those exhibiting a normal degree of adaptive disparity. We propose such a test, focusing on disparity in the ecological morphology of monophyletic groups within the lizard family Iguanidae.

To this end, we develop an optimization fitness model that takes into account different physiological parameters such as energetic level, the physiological stress associated with each strategy, and climatic variables. The results show that the freeze-tolerance strategy is strongly dependent on a low sensitivity to the number of freezing days and on a capacity to reduce stress associated with freezing. This strategy is also favored when the initial energetic level is low compared to the freeze-avoidance strategy, which is favored by a high initial energetic level, a low stress associated with the supercooling, and a low sensitivity of this strategy to climatic conditions. From a theoretical point of view, the mixed strategy permits survival in harsher environments but requires the optimization of all parameters involved in both cold-hardiness strategies. However, the mixed strategy shows energetic advantages in variable environments allowing animals to resist the harshest periods.

The process of ""environmental feedback"" requires only that the cooperative trait affects the quality of the local environment and that individuals are more likely to leave low-quality than high-quality environments. We illustrate this dynamic using an agent-based spatial model of feeding restraint.

The plastic type may dominate or be fixed even in an environmentally uniform site, and even if the plasticity has imperfect accuracy or bears some cost such that a local specialist has higher fitness in that site, as long as there is some migration between sites with different distributions of environmental states. These results suggest that differences among taxa in dispersal and hence realized migration rates may play a heretofore unrecognized role in their patterns of adaptive population differentiation. Migration relaxes the thresholds for both environmental heterogeneity and accuracy of plastic response above which plasticity is favored.

We used these data to model the expected fitness payoffs of breeding and helping at different times during the season. The model shows that late in the breeding season, the fitness payoff from a kin-directed helping tactic becomes greater than that from independent breeding.

This result supports the general principle that lengthening the prereproductive period increases Ne. When adult numbers vary, Ne at any time depends on N and on the numbers contributing to the seed bank in previous seasons. Averaging these effects over time gives Ne â Nh + (T - 1)Na, where Nh and Na are the harmonic and arithmetic means of the adult population. Thus if T â« 1, Ne is determined primarily by Na.
