Species having potential deterrents to folivore attack (hairy leaves or secondary compounds) were attacked less frequently than species without apparent protection. Prolonged flushing activity brought about an added risk of insect attack in species lacking such protection.

The flowers are usually borne in fascicles of 2 or 3, and within each fascicle, 4-9 day separate the sequential opening of individual 1-day flowers. Phyllotaxy is distichous on more or less horizontal branches and the tree architecture conforms to Troll's model. The continuous and regular growth patterns, with frequent branching, facilitates continuous initiation of supra-axillary flowering fascicles, flowers are pollinated above the branches by bees, and fruit is dispersed from below the branches by bats. By elongation and erection of the pedicel, buds are raised into a flowering position, and following pollination, young fruit are lowered to a position for dispersal. As these movements of reproductive structures allow for pollination and dispersal simultaneously from different positions, it is suggested that for a continuously flowering species this may be a mechanism whereby pollinator-disperser interference is avoided.-Author",6,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,27

The large size and unique bipartite structure of C. cumulans mounds make them excellent nesting locations for ant and termite inquilines. At least 17 species of termites and 10 species of ants were found nesting in different Cornitermes mounds. Armadillos had attacked 36% of the mounds; there was a strong correlation between such attacks and the absence of a Cornitermes colony. -from Author",84,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,28

Relative numbers of individuals of smaller species varied dramatically from site to site while those of large species tended to be quite constant. The pattern of variation in numbers of individuals is mirrored by species richness differences between western Amazonia and the Guiana Shield region of Brazil. Soil fertility and undergrowth density are positively correlated with the density and species richness of mammals in a locality, but quantity or pattern of rainfall does not seem to account for any of the observed differences. Competition, home range size and diet are discussed as possible causes of the differential reduction in density and species richness of small, compared to large species in unfavorable habitats. Hunting has extirpated or severely reduced populations of large mammals, especially primates, at 5 of the 7 localities. -from Author",183,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,29

Ipomoea phillomega maintains extensive stolon systems, colonizing gaps from adjacent undisturbed forest and penetrating undisturbed forest from gaps. Marsdenia laxiflora is restricted to primary forest and its stolon systems generate new liana canopies from deep shade of the forest floor. Both species produce a variety of shoot types, each one with characteristic morphology, growth rate and survival rates of apex and leaves. Vegetative spread is by basal branching (production of epicormic shoots). Vegetative spread by stolons may be a consequence of hydraulic constraints on liana canopy growth; this pattern may result in long lives for established liana genetic individuals. -from Author",76,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,30
