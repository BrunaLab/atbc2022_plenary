During the 1st growing season increasing density resulted in reductions in leaf-population growth rates, ramet biomass, number of flower heads, and reproductive 'allocation', and a delay in flowering. In contrast, there was negligible mortality in response to high density during the first growing season. Clonal growth was also density-dependent; both the length of new rhizomes and the number produced per ramet were reduced with increasing density. As new rhizomes were produced in autumn some emerged to form leafy rosettes and others remained underground. Rosettes had higher survivorship and made a greater contribution to the next season's ramet population than did the mature underground rhizomes. Overall shoot densities were regulated by a combination of ramet and genet deaths and density-dependent ramet birth within clones. At high densities, genet motality and clonal expansion of the survivors resulted in a decreasing number but increasing size of genets over time. The relationship between ramet weight and density of interconnected ramets did not conform to the 'law of constant final yield' predicted for populations of individual plants. This also indicates that ecologically, Solidago ramets are not functionally independent 'individuals'. -from Authors",44,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,1

Regrowth seeds showed a slight, but statistically significant, reduction in germination rate (78.8%) compared with the primary seeds (86.4%). In cultivated soil, dug to a fine tilth, both kinds of seeds produced equal numbers of seedlings. In dense, unaltered vegetation, neither kind of seed produced many seedlings. In cut grass, where plant competition was reduced but still substantial, seeds from primary shoots produced just as many seedlings as they did in cultivated, competition-free soil; the smaller seeds from regrowth shoots produced virtually no seedlings. While the smaller regrowth seeds of ragwort are equally viable, they produce seedlings which are substantially less competitive than those from primary shoots.

A consequence of such a curvilinear relationship is that a slight increase in density-independent mortality or a slight reduction in density-independent fecundity can produce a relatively sharp distribution limit along an environmental gradient. The abundance of Cakile edentula was studied along a complex environmental gradient on the sand dunes at Martinique Beach, Nova Scotia. Its population density was greatest in the middle of the dunes and declined to both the landward and seaward ends. The abundance of plants on the dunes as a whole is regulated through the density-dependent control of fecundity on the seaward end of the gradient. The abundance of inidividuals along the gradient is dependent upon the interaction between various density-dependent and density-independent processes. Amongst the latter, the landward migration of seeds is of prime importance. Without migration, populations would not persist in those areas where the species is most abundant in the field. -from Author",47,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,24

Conversely, a lower proportion of plants at the dense site survived to maturity, reproduction was delayed, and there was reduced seed output by mature plants, possibly due to competition. Survival and reproduction was highest in the year with the most rainfall during the growing season.

Results suggest the presence of precisely-defined biotic specialization in several neighbouring genotype pairs, all belonging to the same 2 species in different localities of a single community.

This relationship may be based on the relatively high mobility of T. repens cones through stolon extension, and the opportunity for concomitant competition and beneficence (through N enrichment from symbiotic Rhizobium) between these species.

Aerial biomass was 3245 g m-2 at Naivasha, and 1384 g m-2 at Busoro while the culm densities were 12.7 m-2 and 17.9 m-2, respectively. Combined data from several sites give a linear relationship between aerial biomass and culm density but it does not follow the thinning rule (-3/2 power law). Papyrus umbels on mature culms were larger at Naivasha than at Busoro; their photosynthetic tissues (rays + bracteoles) had mean surface areas per culm of 6245 cm2 and 5242 cm2, respectively. The area of photosynthetic tissue per unit ground area (umbel area index) was 7.0 at Naivasha and 8.1 at Busoro. The chlorophyll content of the photosynthetic tissue was similar to that recorded for other emergent macrophytes. Light interception by the canopy was virtually complete. The Naivasha site experienced daily mean temperatures 3oC, and mean minimum temperatures 10oC, lower than at Busoro. This may account for the higher biomass at Naivasha, because lower night temperatures reduce respiratory losses. There were differences in the root environment at the 2 sites with lower conductivity, redox potential and N concentration at Busoro. This suggests that growing conditions at Busoro were 'poorer' than at Naivasha. -from Authors",35,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,44

Many characters, especially for L. perenne and T. repens, showed a decline in mean values and variance with increasing pasture age. The overall high diversity may have been maintained by a heterogeneous biotic environment and the general decline in diversity may be attributable to continuous elimination of the less-fit genotypes by competition and grazing. -from Authors",31,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,69

Rosette populations grow logistically, probably regulated by change in birth rate. Branches of Prunella vulgaris are only loosely aggregated within clones (guerrilla type). The frequency distribution of clone sizes in P. vulgaris is hierarchical. Branch populations grow exponentially and exceed the equilibrium density before regulation, through increased death rate, occurs. No differences in intensity of competition within and between clones were found in either species. P. vulgaris showed a more fugitive behaviour in mixed than in pure populations. Competition was density-dependent; in mixtures of B. perennis and P. vulgaris the phalanx species was aggressive at high but suppressed at low densities and the guerrilla species was aggressive at low but suppressed at high densities. This outcome is caused by the differences in growth form of the 2 species. -from Authors",129,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,70

In 1980, 93% of plants in the natural vegetation were defoliated. The frequecy of defoliation did not vary with plant size, distance from mature conspecifics, or with local vegetation composition. Annual mortality of 2nd year plants protected from grasshoppers was 89% and did not vary when either conspecifics or perennial grasses or both types of competitors were removed from within 0.5m of each plant. The death rate for plants exposed to grasshoppers was greatly affected by the presence of neighbouring plants; it ranged from 22% when all neighbouring plants were removed to 47% when the vegetation was left intact. Protection from herbivory significantly increased plant growth in the following year (plant height, number of stems). Growth was also significantly increased by removal of nearby perennial grasses. G. microcephala gradually becomes tolerant both to herbivore attack and between species competition during its ontogeny.-from Authors",54,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,71
