Seed production (inversely related to seed size) and recruitment success (positively related) affect colonization ability, suggesting that seed size can be used as a key trait. 2 Data on seed size, dispersal mode, life form, geographical range size and abundance were gathered for 81 grassland plant species in a field study area in Sweden. Seed production and plant size were estimated for 69 of these species. Analyses were performed both across species, with species treated as independent data points, and for 43 'phylogenetically independent contrasts'. 3 The cross-species analyses suggested that local abundance was related to life forms but not dispersal or plant size. Perennials were generally most abundant, as were clonal species. If abundance reflects colonization we predicted that species with intermediately sized seeds (or intermediate seed production) would be most abundant, and this was supported by the phylogenetic contrast but not by cross-species analyses. In the former analysis, a high abundance of species was significantly associated with a small seed size deviation (and seed number deviation) from the median values of these traits in the community. 4 Local abundance, seed production and seed size deviation from the community median value were positively related to geographical range size in the cross-species analysis, but no relationships were seen in the phylogenetic contrast analysis. 5 We conclude that colonization processes do have a significant influence on abundance patterns in grasslands. Seed size is a key trait for colonizing ability, and the effects of the trade-off of seed size vs. seed number must be considered. No single mechanism can be identified that influences both abundance and geographical distribution range.",135,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Colonization | Metapopulation dynamics | Phylogenetic comparative methods | Plant communities | Seed size,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,1,NA,NA

We assessed the effects of light, herbivory, water availability and the habitat an offspring came from on the survival and growth of sexual or clonal offspring (i.e. seedlings and cladodes), through 3-and 4-year common garden and short-term greenhouse experiments. 2 Shading by nurse plants increased seedling survival in the field by an order of magnitude, and a small additional advantage due to predator protection by grasses was observed. Strong herbivory transforms a facultative nurse-protege relationship for seedlings into an obligatory one. 3 In the greenhouse seedlings grew better under shade, but in the field the production of the first cladode was delayed in seedlings in the more shaded GH. Competition for soil resources may be more intense under a dense grass tussock than under a open shrub, thus affecting the nurse-protege relationship. Seedling survival under nurse plants was similar in GH and NH, but higher plant cover suggests that a larger number of seedlings will establish in GH in the long term. 4 Cladode survival was higher in NH. Cladodes were more successful than seedlings at establishing in intercanopy areas, possibly due to physiological differences as well as their ability to survive partial predation. Cladode survival in intercanopy areas may explain the enhanced clonal propagation in the more open NH scrubland, together with their susceptibility to the flooding which affects GH. 5 The high seedling and cladode survival in the greenhouse experiments contrasted with that observed in the field, indicating that survival is determined by the interaction between herbivores, plants and abiotic conditions rather than the physiological aptitude of the plants.",92,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Cactaceae | Clonal vs. sexual recruitment | Herbivory | Nurse plants | Opuntia rastrera,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,2,NA,NA

Above-ground biomass, litter production, changes in soil elevation, vertical soil accretion, shallow subsidence, below-ground production of roots and rhizomes, the thickness of the root zone, soil bulk density, and soil organic matter were measured. 3 Above-ground biomass, below-ground production, soil elevation and the expansion of the root zone decreased due to herbivore activity. Litter production, the rate of soil surface accretion and shallow soil subsidence were all higher in grazed compared to ungrazed plots, while soil organic matter and bulk density did not differ significantly between treatments. 4 The results indicate that herbivores can have a negative effect on soil building processes, primarily by reducing below-ground production and expansion of the root zone.

The species pool observed in the lowest density plots was used as the null community, which was repeatedly sampled to calculate the species richness (and other diversity indices) in higher density plots that would be expected from sampling considerations alone. The significance of deviations of observed diversity from this expected diversity was then evaluated. 3 Both observed and expected number of species increased substantially with the experimental increase in density. However, observed species richness, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Simpson's diversity index were often significantly lower than that expected based on sampling considerations. The magnitude of the deviation from expected increased significantly with increasing density for richness and the Shannon-Wiener index.

We conducted a large-scale geographical survey of populations four times over a 7-year period (1982-89) and measured population size, population persistence and patch occupancy. In total, 167 populations were censused. 2 To investigate the importance of local and regional influences on population size, we posed the following specific questions. Are fluctuations in population size independent of their initial size and independent among years? Is persistence uniform among populations of different size and age? Are the proportion of patches occupied related to the density of habitat patches in a region? What are the relations between the size, persistence and density of populations? 3 Population size averaged 86 over the 4-year period with 52% of populations containing less than 100 individuals. Sixty-four per cent of populations persisted from one year to the next, but the rate at which populations became absent from a patch was independent of initial population size and time since the last census. For populations that persisted, there was a significant positive correlation between the initial census number and their size in subsequent years. 4 In 29 transects through different regions of north-eastern Brazil, an average of 21.6% (range 3.8-47.2%) of suitable habitat patches were occupied by E. paniculata. The proportion of patches occupied was positively correlated with the density of patches in a region. No populations were found when the density of patches fell below 0.23 patches kin-1 or 0.18 patches km-1 in 1988 and 1989, respectively, indicating the probable existence of a habitat threshold for species persistence within a region. There was no correlation between patch occupancy and either the average number of individuals per population or the probability of persistence in a region. Hence, even when E. paniculata is regionally common, it is not necessarily locally abundant. 5 We conclude that the distribution of E. paniculata populations in north-eastern Brazil is governed, in part, by metapopulation dynamics.",47,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Aquatic | Environmental stochasticity | Metapopulation structure | Population size | Regional processes,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,7,NA,NA

We also examined the responses of plants to a 4-year experimental increase in temperature. 3 Significant differences in average plant performance were found between populations. Variance partitioning of the response data showed that environmental factors explained 45 % of the variation in plant performance and density between populations, whereas variation due to transect position was small (10.8%). Soil pH, altitude and season length were the most influential of the environmental variables, and explained 23%, 21% and 14%, respectively, of the variation. Plant performance was in general negatively correlated with these variables, whereas plant density increased along the pH and altitude gradients, suggesting that environmental factors associated with elevation (temperature and vegetation cover) and pH (soil fertility) had opposing effects on individual performance and density. Season length was highly important for average bulbil weight. 4 Plants growing in open top chambers had significantly enhanced growth and produced significantly heavier bulbils than those in control plots, whereas flower and bulbil number were unaffected by experimentally increased temperatures.

Dominants recur in particular vegetation types, are relatively large, exhibit coarse-grained foraging for resources and, as individual species, make a substantial contribution to the plant biomass. Subordinates also show high fidelity of association with particular vegetation types but they are smaller in stature, forage on a more restricted scale and tend to occupy microhabitats delimited by the architecture and phenology of their associated dominants. Transients comprise a heterogeneous assortment of species of low abundance and persistence; a high proportion are juveniles of species that occur as dominants or subordinates in neighbouring ecosystems. 3 A 'mass ratio' theory proposes that immediate controls are in proportion to inputs to primary production, are determined to an overwhelming extent by the traits and functional diversity of the dominant plants and are relatively insensitive to the richness of subordinates and transients. Recent experiments support the mass ratio hypothesis and the conclusion of Huston (1997) that claims of immediate benefits of high species richness to ecosystem functions arise from misinterpretation of data. 4 Attribution of immediate control to dominants does not exclude subordinates and transients from involvement in the determination of ecosystem function and sustainability. Both are suspected to play a crucial, if intermittent, role by influencing the recruitment of dominants. Some subordinates may act as a filter influencing regeneration by dominants following major perturbations. 5 Transients originate from the seed rain and seed banks and provide an index of the pool of potential dominants and subordinates at specific sites. Where the landscape carousel operates against a background of declining diversity in the reservoir of colonizing transients, we may predict that a progressive loss of ecosystem functions will arise from the decline in the precision with which dominants can engage in the re-assembly and relocation of ecosystems.",1709,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Biodiversity | Dominance | Ecosystem function | Landscape ecology | Regeneration,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,9,NA,NA

Changes in forest composition have occurred as a result of both autogenic and allogenic processes. High grazing intensities in recent centuries have been particularly significant, although the forest is often considered to be undisturbed. 4 The larger hollow (site I) initially sampled across Peucedano-Pinetum, Carici elongatae-Alnetum and Tilio-Carpinetum communities. Since 1750, the Peucedano-Pineturn community has dominated, but with an increased Picea component. This has recently been replaced by the Pino-Quercetum community following the reduction of grazing pressure. These recent changes are largely consistent with published successional models for Bialowieza Forest. 5 Site II recorded a relatively stable balance between the Tilio-Carpinetum and Pino-Quercetum communities until 750 years ago. The Tilio-Carpinetum community then expanded. The continued dominance of Quercus in this community is inconsistent with previous models. 6 The long time perspective available with pollen data permits the exploration of forest dynamics beyond the temporal range of existing models for Biatowieza Forest.

Deterministic and stochastic computer models were used to try to identify the circumstances under which serotiny is favoured, and what degree of serotiny maximizes the estimated finite rate of natural increase (λ) for species which, in addition to serotiny, have the capacity to resprout vegetatively. 2 The deterministic model indicated a maximum finite rate of natural increase (λ = 1.015) when the fire interval was 13 years and all seeds were retained on the plant until fire occurred (i.e. complete serotiny). Populations were predicted to decline if the fire interval exceeded about 40 years. 3 Changes to biological attributes associated with timing of reproduction shifted the optimum fire interval but did not change the overall pattern in relation to serotiny. Reduction in the probability of adults resprouting after fire also shifted the optimum, so that as probability of resprouting declined, optimum fire interval increased. 4 Increasing stochasticity around the mean fire interval (CV > 50%) under regimes of frequent fire (fire interval < 20 years) led to strong, but not complete, serotiny as the optimum strategy (2 = 1.009 ± 0.001). If fire was less frequent, and the probability of inter-fire recruitment was similar to that of post-fire recruitment, then the optimum strategy was zero serotiny. 5 The probability of seedling recruitment was low after most fires due to low seed availability and high seedling mortality over the first summer. Stochastic weather (variation in summer rainfall) resulted in a higher rate of population growth (λ = 1.019) than under constant average weather conditions, emphasizing the importance of rare recruitment events in the population behaviour of resprouting species. 6 Resprouters were able to cope with more frequent fire than non-sprouters, but there was no evidence to support the contention that they are also favoured under regimes of infrequent fire.",69,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Banksia | Computer models | Fire regime | Optimum life-history strategies | Resprouter | Serotiny,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,11,NA,NA

Parameter ranges encompassed life-history information for other nonsprouting Banksia species from the same region. 2 The relationship between fire interval and level of canopy seed storage (serotiny) was analysed to identify the circumstances under which serotiny is favoured, and what degree of serotiny maximizes potential population growth rate.

Although shorter seed longevity and increased rates of predation and/or decay reduced the value of serotiny, even very low levels of canopy seed storage increased species fitness under intermediate fire frequencies (10-20 years). 5 If the probability of inter-fire recruitment and survival was increased, optimum growth shifted from strong serotiny under a regime of frequent fire (< 20 year interval), to weak (or no) serotiny where the interval between successive fires was long (> 40 year interval). 6 Stochasticity around mean fire interval resulted in intermediate to strong (but not complete) serotiny being predicted as optimal once the CV for fire interval approached 100%.

Yearly growth increments (long-shoots) and emerging buds were individually marked, architectural parameters measured, the branch topology mapped, and the number of male and female cones counted. In 1993, the survival of growth increments and buds was recorded and the branches were harvested to determine dry mass of growth increments and needles. 3 The size of growth increments produced after 1989, i.e. their length, total dry mass and needle dry mass, decreased in the order sun branches of edge trees > branches of centre trees > shade branches of edge trees. Thus, the growth increments produced on the shade branches of trees that also had branches in the sun were consistently smaller than the growth increments on the branches of centre trees growing completely in the shade. 4 The number of new growth increments produced after 1989 was highest in sun branches and lowest in shade branches of edge trees. Survival of growth increments and buds was higher in edge than in centre trees; no difference was found between sun and shade branches of edge trees. 5 In shade branches of edge trees, branching angles between first- and second-order growth increments were highest and increased from older to younger growth increments. This was interpreted as 'bending' towards the edge of the patch. 6 Production of female cones was almost totally restricted to edge trees and higher in sun than in shade branches. 7 One prediction of an optimal foraging strategy, i.e. the production of more growth increments and buds in higher light, was supported by the data, whereas the other prediction, i.e. decreased length of growth increments, could only be supported when it was expressed per unit dry mass. Thus, the hypothesis of an adaptive foraging strategy in plants was rejected in favour of a 'passive' growth null hypothesis. 8 The results suggest that both growth increments within branches and branches within trees are physiologically integrated and their 'foraging behaviour' can only partly be understood in terms of their local environment.

Five treeline species had low seed germination rates and low survivorship and growth of seedlings when transplanted into Alaskan tundra. Seed germination of all species increased with experimental warming, suggesting that the present treeline may in part result from unsuccessful recruitment under cold conditions. 2. Growth, biomass and survivorship of seedlings of treeline species transplanted into tundra were largely unaffected by experimental warming. However, transplanted seedlings of three species (Betula papyrifera, Picea glauca and Populus tremuloides) grew more when below-ground competition with the extant community was reduced. All three measures of transplant performance were greater in shrub tundra than in the less productive tussock or heath tundra. Establishment of trees in tundra may thus be prevented by low resource availability and competition. 3. Two species (Alnus crispa and Populus balsamifera) had low seed germination and survivorship of germinated seeds; transplants of these species did not respond to the manipulations and lost biomass following transplanting into tundra. Isolated populations of these two species north of the present treeline in arctic Alaska probably became established during mid-Holocene warming rather than in recent times. 4. Of all the species studied here, Picea glauca was the most likely to invade intact upland tundra. Its seeds had the highest germination rates and it was the only species whose seedlings survived subsequently. Furthermore, transplanted seedlings of Picea glauca had relatively high survivorship and positive growth in tundra, especially in treatments that increased air temperature or nutrient availability, two factors likely to increase with climate warming.",111,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Alaskan treeline | Climate change | Picea glauca | Tree establishment | Tundra,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,15,NA,NA

A survey of plant and soil parameters was carried out in dry dune grasslands along the Dutch coast in the lime- and iron-poor Wadden district and initially lime- and iron-rich Renodunaal district, in order to detect differences in nutrient availability related to soil characteristics and potential sensitivity to atmospheric deposition of nitrogen. 2. Plant biomass and phosphorus pools in the shoot were higher in the Wadden district. The low foliar nitrogen concentrations and nitrogen/phosphorus ratios in the Wadden district suggested nitrogen-limitation, while in the Renodunaal district there appeared to be a balanced supply of both nitrogen and phosphorus. 3. Soil pH, soil organic matter, soil nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and total amounts were generally higher in the Renodunaal district. In both districts mineral phosphorus decreased with acidification and phosphorus oxalate (iron and aluminium bound) increased. 4. In the Wadden district iron is present primarily in iron-organic matter complexes, which leads to reversible binding of phosphorus. In the Renodunaal district large amounts of iron (hydr)oxides occur and at high pH may contribute to reversible phosphorus-sorption, but at low pH this probably leads to immobilization of phosphorus. 5. While pools of soil phosphorus are low in the Wadden district, the phosphorus availability may be relatively high due to the comparatively loose nature of phosphorus-sorption. As a result the area may be nitrogen-limited and grass-encroachment may thus have resulted from atmospheric deposition of nitrogen. 6. In the Renodunaal district, atmospheric deposition probably only accelerates grass-encroachment, because deposition of acid and nitrogen increases the availability of both nitrogen and phosphorus and maintains the 'Co-limitation'.",92,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Grass-encroachment | Nitrogen | Phosphorus | Soil organic matter | Soil pH | Vegetation biomass,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,16,NA,NA

Analogy with deposition of NMS suggests that this discrepancy is accounted for quantitatively by seeder-feeder enhancement, cloudwater deposition, and dry deposition of acidity. 7 Ombrotrophic bog surface waters are buffered by the cation-exchange properties of the peat.

We also investigated a possible correlation of population size effects with environmental variation in climate, topography, soil, vegetation, and management. To ascertain whether the differences between populations have a genetic basis, we grew 20 seed families from each of the populations in a common garden experiment. 2 In 1993, population sizes ranged from 40 to 5000 flowering plants in the field populations (geometric mean 386). Plants in small populations had fewer seeds per fruit and fewer seeds per plant than plants in larger populations, whereas seed mass was independent of population size. From 1993 to 1995 population size decreased in most populations (mean annual population growth rate 0.876), and this decrease was larger in small populations than in large populations. 3 In the common garden the positive correlation between the number of surviving plants per planted seed and original population size increased steadily over time. After 17 months there were significantly more flowering plants and more flowers per planted seed for seeds from large populations than for those from small populations. 4 Although environmental variables accounted for significant variation in population growth rate and plant performance both in the field and in the common garden, effects of population size detected in stepwise multiple regressions were not confounded with environmental effects. 5 We conclude that the reduced performance observed in plants from smaller populations was explained by genetic effects rather than by habitat quality, although pollinator limitation may have contributed to fitness reductions in the field. The observed patterns suggest further reductions of population sizes in Gentianella germanica in the future, especially in already small populations.

Matrix projection methods were used to summarize population performance with and without recruitment. Median finite rates of increase by population varied from 0.57 to 1.82 and from 0.44 to 0.99, respectively. 3. Populations with the highest rates of increase had been burned. Six of eight populations, for which stochastic modelling predicted persistence for 1000 years, included fire in their management. None of the five populations with predicted 100-year extinction probabilities of 100% was managed for conservation or burned. An intermediate group of three populations with at least 10% probability of extinction between 100 and 1000 years was not managed, but was none the less kept open by mowing and herbicide application. 4. Analysis of composite elasticities showed that growth and fecundity terms were higher for growing (vs. declining) populations and that growth elasticity was higher in burned than unburned populations. Lack of burning shifts the elasticity spectrum from that typical of open habitat herbs (higher growth and fecundity elasticities) to values usually found for closed habitat herbs (higher survival elasticities). 5. In multivariate analyses predicting finite rates of increase (with and without recruitment), fire management and region were the strongest predictors, followed by genetic variation, population size, isolation and interactions of population size and fire, and region and fire. Populations with the highest rates of increase were burned, eastern, more genetically diverse, larger and less isolated. Discrimination of populations with different extinction risks (three classes) was related mainly to fire, genetic variation and region. 6. Most of these conclusions support conservation biology predictions that population viability will be highest in larger, less-isolated, more genetically diverse populations.

Smoke-stimulated germination in the post-fire flora of California chaparral does not appear to be triggered by nitrate.

KNO3 buffered at acidic pH (or unbuffered solutions equilibrated with atmospheric CO2) did induce germination, but KNO3 solutions at pH 7 failed to induce germination. Induction of germination is therefore not due to the nitrate ion per se, but rather to high [H+], although buffered controls gave weak germination at low pH, suggesting a role for H+ plus nitrate. However, other anions such as sulphate were equally as effective as nitrate at breaking dormancy. 3. The germination response to KNO3 was affected by the type of filter paper used and this may be linked to differences in pH. 4. NO2, at concentrations present in biomass smoke, was highly effective at inducing germination, and other oxidizing agents also induced germination. 5. Several growth regulators, including nitrite and gibberellin, were stimulatory only at acidic pH, but KCN was stimulatory across a broad pH range. 6. Germination decreased at smoke exposures longer than a few minutes. Also, smoked water samples effective at breaking dormancy were acidic and were less effective when buffered to pH > 7.

Neighbourhood strength was positively correlated with the degree of patchiness. Very high neighbourhood strength is necessary to form mono-specific patches composed of hundreds of individual trees. Intermediate neighbourhood sizes (5-12 neighbours) led to the most distinct patches where individuals were arranged so that contact between species was minimized. 3.

This implies that neighbourhood effects may be responsible for some unexplained variability in studies that attempt to relate environmental parameters to forest composition. 5.

Herbaceous plant production on many Mediterranean soils is severely restricted by nutrient deficiency. On such a shallow, phosphorus-deficient soil in the western Galilee of Israel with an average annual rainfall > 800 mm, a single addition of phosphorus fertilizer consistently increased herbaceous plant production in a community dominated by the dwarf shrub Sarcopoterium spinosum by a factor of 2.8-3.8 over 7 years. Regardless of phosphorus addition, interannual variation of the herbaceous vegetation remained high (C.V. = 0.33). A simple model based on climate data was developed to explain the continuing interannual variation in biomass production. 2. This interannual variation is accounted for by an 'effective growing day' index, G, based on an estimate of the number of clays throughout the growing season during which the available water in the rooting zone can balance the current potential evaporation demand. The validity of this approach was tested on data from 7 consecutive years. 3. At given phosphate (P) availability levels, the index G was found to be highly correlated with both seasonal biomass production and P uptake of the herbaceous plant, but the regression lines intersected the G axis far to the right of the origin. 4. When the adverse effect of the winter climate on growing conditions was taken into account, the regression lines passed close to the origin. Annual biomass production and P uptake could then be well described as linear functions of G with the slope related to availability of P. 5. Average intraseasonal trends gave G-values which were better predictors of both biomass production and P-uptake than annual weather (temperature or potential evaporation) fluctuations. 6. Both shoot biomass and P uptake were strongly influenced by growing conditions in autumn (beginning of growing season) and in spring (main growing season), but plant production was more sensitive than P uptake to growing conditions in autumn and vice versa in spring. 7. The close relationship between G and P uptake at different P availability levels indicates that availability of P did not diminish for at least 7 years after a single application of 4.5-9.0 g m-2 P as superphosphate.

Seed mass was also unaffected by ovule position within follicles and follicle position within infructescences. 4 Seed mass variation among infructescences and plants was related to the limited availability of nutrient resources during seed provisioning. Mean seed mass was negatively related to seed number per infructescence and per plant. When resources decreased late in the flowering season and after defoliation, seed mass declined by 7-10% and seed number by 31-45%. When resources increased after inflorescence removal, seed mass increased by 8% but seed number was unaffected. Plants thus had only a limited capacity to maintain seed mass by adjusting seed number when resources varied 5 The N and P contents of seeds (mg seed-1) increased linearly with seed mass, indicating costs of producing larger seeds in terms of limited environmental nutrients. 6 Seedling size increased with seed mass, implying fitness benefits of larger seeds in terms of increased seedling establishment on nutrient-poor soils. Seed mass had little or no effect on seed germination, relative growth rates and root:shoot ratios. 7 Although stabilizing selection should eliminate seed mass variation occurring within plants, such variation persists because resource constraints limit the ability of plants to control individual seed size.",146,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Nutrient allocation patterns | Nutrient-poor soils | Seed nutrient content | Seed size and number | Seedlings,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,29,NA,NA

In the dioecious, perennial herb Silene dioica, the density of pollen donors in a population is determined by overall plant density, the sex ratio and the proportion of plants infected with the anther-smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum, which results in permanent sterility of both male and female plants. 2. Pollinators (Bombus spp.) were found to prefer male flowers and to avoid diseased flowers. This may result in an overall lower visitation frequency and increased risk for pollen limitation in populations with a low density of males or a high incidence of disease. 3. Compared with open-pollinated flowers, hand pollination resulted in a significant increase in the number of seeds produced per fruit in populations with an experimentally reduced proportion of males (25% and 50% male flowers) but not in a naturally male-dominated population (75% male flowers). Seed production per plant was increased by hand pollination only in the most female-dominated population. Because the floral sex ratio is often male-biased, resources rather than pollen availability are likely to set the upper limit for total seed production per individual in most healthy populations of S. dioica. 4. There was a negative relationship between seed set and incidence of disease across 22 populations in both years of a field study. However, there was no consistent difference between the responses of highly diseased populations (incidence 30-56%) and populations with a low disease incidence (incidence 0-8%) to hand pollination. 5. In a greenhouse experiment with cloned hand-pollinated females, the presence of spores on healthy flowers was found to reduce seed set significantly.

Do local edaphic factors over short environmental gradients affect the distribution and abundance of tree species in tropical rain forests? We addressed this question by examining the responses of tree species to soil type, topographic position and slope angle in an upland old-growth tropical rain forest landscape in Costa Rica, Central America. 2. The study area covered 216 ha of non-swamp old growth and included replicated landscape units such as ridgetop to swale catenas, small watersheds, and alluvial terraces. An existing soils map was refined using additional sampling along a regularly spaced grid. Three soil units were defined: residual soils derived from in-place weathering of basaltic parent material; old alluvial terrace soils formed by precontemporary flooding; and soils of stream valleys. A Geographic Information System was used to assign soil type to 2190 post-establishment individuals of nine tree species in a long-term demographic study. Topographic position and slope angle were measured in the field. 3. Data from 433 regularly spaced sample points were used to generate an expected distribution of edaphic variables, which was compared with the number of individuals of each species in each edaphic category. 4. Non-random distributions among soil types were found for seven of the nine species, with topographic positions for six species, and with slope angle classes for four species. 5. The issue of what constitutes an independent sample of independent sample of establishment was analyzed by considering the old-growth character of the landscape and evidence for frequent dispersal among edaphic units. A re-analysis of species' distributions using only individuals > 4 cm diameter showed that results from the original analyses were robust. 6. Soil type (residual vs. old alluvial) was not significantly related to diameter growth. Three species showed significant differences in size class distributions between soil types with increasing diameter. 7. Tree species in tropical rain forests are frequently non-randomly distributed along relatively short edaphic gradients on upland soils. Future studies should increase the number of species and spatial scale analyzed, incorporate better analyses of edaphic variables, and include experiments to identify the ecological processes that generate these non-random distributions.",279,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Costa Rica | Soil | Tropical rain forest | Tropical trees,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,31,NA,NA

A gap dynamic model (FORMAN) was developed as a first synthesis of available data for three Caribbean mangrove species into an individual-based model that simulates the long-term dynamics of mangrove forest development. 2. Field observations at three sites along the Shark River estuary were compared with simulation results, assuming development following Hurricane Donna in 1960. Total basal area simulated for each site was within ±10% of that observed, although species-specific basal area predictions were less accurate. 3. A decrease in nutrient availability from marine to mesohaline sites modelled the reduced basal area of Avicennia germinans and Laguncularia racemosa. However, at the lower nutrient site a 83% reduction in maximum sapling recruitment of both A. germinans and L. racemosa was required to fit field results. Increased basal area of A. germinans and L. racemosa limited the development of Rhizophora mangle at higher nutrient downstream sites, apparently due to competition for light resources. Both observed and simulated results indicated that R. mangle had higher frequencies in the smaller size classes at all three sites, compared to a bell-shaped size-class distribution of L. racemosa, particularly at the higher nutrient sites. 4. Succession was projected for the next 500 years at a site in the lower estuary. Long-term forest dynamics were sensitive to species-specific maximum sapling recruitment rates. In the absence of large-scale disturbance, initial dominance by L. racemosa was predicted to be replaced eventually by A. germinans, even when maximum sapling recruitment rate of A. germinans was set at half of L. racemosa and R. mangle. 5. Response curves for each species along gradients of soil nutrient resource and salinity illustrated their relative competitive balance over time (up to 300 years). Laguncularia racemosa dominated in fertile soils with low salinity at early stages of recovery, but its abundance decreased over time while A. germinans increased.

Data are presented from a 4-year study on the incidence of infection by the non-systemic smut fungus Anthracoidea heterospora of florets of the sedge Carex nigra. 2.

Path analysis clearly showed that the number of vectors on individual tussocks was an important factor explaining levels of infection of A. heterospora. 3. The year-to-year correlations in incidence of A. heterospora disease for individual C. nigra plants were high, indicating that the same plants consistently experience high levels of disease. There were also high year-to-year correlations in the abundance of P. substriatus beetles on individual plants. 4. A second natural enemy of the sedge, the gall mite Phytoptus caricis, also showed high between-year correlations in levels of infestation. Since P. caricis competes for the same resource as A. heterospora, we predicted that high levels of P. caricis infestation should have a negative effect on disease levels. However, there was in general a positive effect of P. caricis infestation on A. heterospora disease levels. 5. This study shows that for understanding levels of disease of A. heterospora, both within-year effects as well as transient effects must be included.

A Holocene sediment profile from a northern Swedish boreal forest lake was analysed for diatoms, pollen and charcoal. The diatom data were used for inferences of lake-water pH, alkalinity and colour, while the pollen and charcoal records enabled assessment of catchment vegetation changes and fire. This palaeoecological study demonstrated long-term changes in lake-water acidity as a result of catchment vegetation changes and fire. 2. The pollen record showed the transition from a deciduous-dominated forest (Betula and Alnus) 9000-8000 years BP (calibrated years) to the present coniferous-dominated forest (mainly Pinus) in the catchment of Makkassjon. Local peaks in the steadily decreasing Betula pollen curve corresponded with increases in the charcoal concentration. Picea pollen did not appear until the uppermost half of the sediment section (c. 2500 BP), and never exceeded 10% relative abundance. 3. The Holocene development in lake-water chemistry, inferred from diatom analysis, was divided into three periods: a natural acidification, a natural alkalization and a fertilization/liming period. During the long-term natural acidification period, the diatom-inferred pH and alkalinity decreased by c. 1.3 pH units and c. 80 μeq 1-1, respectively, while diatom-inferred colour increased from 10 to 40 mg Pt 1-1 in the same period. These changes occurred simultaneously with a change from deciduous to coniferous forest. Using redundancy analysis (RDA) with the tree pollen as predictor variables, the Alnus, Betula or Pinus pollen record captured 41-85% of the variance in lake-water pH and alkalinity. 4. During the period of natural alkalization fire became a dominant disturbance factor in the catchment. The charcoal record was a significant predictor of the variance in diatom-inferred pH and alkalinity during the period with frequent fires, as determined by RDA analysis with a time-restricted Monte Carlo permutation test.

Using the data in a recently published seed bank database for north-west Europe, we describe how a species' seed bank behaviour can be characterized by a single 'longevity index', and investigate how representative the information in the database is of the north-west European flora. We also test the hypotheses that seeds of short-lived species are more persistent than those of long-lived species, and long-lived seeds are characteristic of species living in disturbed habitats. 2. The data are not representative of the north-west European flora as a whole; they are a fair reflection of a research effort that has been largely directed towards grassland and arable weeds. Data for rare species, non-agricultural habitats in general and wetlands, rocky habitats and native woodland in particular, are scarce or absent. 3. Annuals and biennials almost always have more persistent seeds than related perennials, and this difference is most striking when, as in Anagallis arvensis and Aphanes arvensis, the short-lived species have moved well away from the 'core' habitat of the family. Confamilial monocarps and polycarps do not differ consistently in seed mass. 4. Gradients of habitat disturbance are accompanied by predictable changes in seed persistence, which are themselves often (but not always) accompanied by parallel shifts in seed size. These results suggest that increasing habitat disturbance (i.e. increasing density-independent mortality) always selects for increased seed persistence, confirming both theory and previous analyses. However, increased seed persistence is not always associated with reduced seed size. This is because persistence depends not only on seed size, but on other traits, many of them physiological.

In contrast, the abundance of pioneer seedlings > 10 cm height in natural gaps was strongly correlated with adult abundance, but was not correlated with seed size. 3 Seedlings were non-randomly distributed among gaps, but seedling abundance was not directly related to gap size, and there was no evidence of partitioning of the light environment of gaps by small seedlings. Large differences in growth and mortality rates among species were observed after 1 year, and this may result in the gap size partitioning previously found in saplings of the same species. 4 Seedlings of most species, particularly those with large seeds, were relatively more abundant than expected in gaps close to their conspecific adults. Proximity to reproductives, and by inference dispersal limitation, therefore exerts some effect on seedling distribution.

This was seen especially among the eucalypts, but the difference was eliminated at optimal soil nutrient levels. Hakea species with large seed mass, and all Banksia species, appeared unable to exploit additional soil nutrients for growth, whatever the level supplied. 3 Larger seeds tended to have proportionately higher contents of N, P and K and, under nutrient-poor conditions, supplied more of these to their seedlings, although at a diminishing rate. 4 We suggest that large-seededness could be an adaptation to the high-light, nutrient-impoverished habitats in which these species occur by providing the seedling with the mineral nutrients, rather than carbon-based metabolites, needed for maximizing initial root growth.

Both CH and CL flower numbers were positively correlated with ramet size expressed as leaf number, but the correlation was much stronger in the CL phase. CL flower production also varied significantly between years and sites. Thus, CL production in O. acetosella was not independent of resources and climatic variation. 3. When the effects of year and site were taken into account, the probability of an individual flower developing into a mature fruit was not higher in the CL phase than in the CH phase. 4.

To evaluate the advantage of early germination for the seedling establishment, differences in the temporal pattern of leaf development between the seedlings and overstorey trees were investigated, together with the timing of dry mass gain and allocation, survival and mortality agents of seedlings. These traits were contrasted at four sites with different types of foliage phenology in the overstorey trees (FU-1 and FU-2, forest understorey in which overstorey trees unfolded and shed the leaves as a flush and succeedingly, respectively; SG, small gaps; and FE, forest edge). 2 Seasonal growth patterns of the seedlings were greatly affected by the differences in the coupling of leaf development between the seedlings and the overstorey trees. For early germinating cohorts of Acer mono, 79, 61, 50 and 53% of annual dry mass gain occurred within 2 months of germination, in FU-1, FU-2, SG and FE, respectively. After this point (canopy closure) mass increment decreased abruptly in both FU sites, but continued to increase in both SG and FE. Seedling mass, however, increased after September again in FU-2 but not in FU-1, mainly due to earlier leaf shedding of the canopy trees in FU-2. 3 After canopy closure, leaf mass ratio was greatest in FU-1 where light was most limited, but lowest in FE. In contrast, root mass ratio was greatest in FE but lowest in FU-1 where soil moisture was most abundant. These traits might lead to the optimization of growth by making all resources equally limiting even after canopy closure in forest understorey. 4 Higher seedling survival resulting from early germination was observed in all four sites, since predators and pathogens selectively attacked late germinating individuals. The advantage of early germination was greater in both FU-1 and FU-2 than in FE, mainly due to large differences in available light for early vs. late germinating individuals in both FU sites compared with the FE site. 5 These observations suggest that phenological traits of A. mono such as rapid germination in early spring and earlier deployment of leaves compared with overstorey trees has been selected to maximize annual mass gain and survival in understorey habitats of deciduous broad-leaved forests.",114,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Biomass allocation | Causes of mortality | Light | RGR | Shade avoidance,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,45,NA,NA

Increasing the census interval, however, underestimates the rate because of unrecorded 'recruit and die' events. 2 We propose a new Gf procedure for estimation of recruitment rates. Recruitment rate per area is obtained by multiplication of the density in the smallest size class (f) and the average size growth rate in that class (G) divided by the width of the class. This procedure is valid when the size distribution of the population examined is continuous with size. 3 When tree size structure is negative-exponentially distributed, as is often the case in natural rain forest populations, the Gf estimate of the recruitment rate for a given size class was least biased close to the midpoint size of this class. 4 Gf estimates agreed well with census estimates of recruitment rate from permanent plots in rain forests. A tendency for Gf estimates to be larger than census estimates disappeared when census estimates were corrected for mortality after recruitment. 5 The effects of plot size, census interval and variation in growth rate on estimates of recruitment rate were simulated using model populations. Small plot size caused substantially more among-plot deviation for the census count of recruitment events than for the Gf estimate. The census recruitment rate also showed larger variation among plots for shorter intervals than the Gf estimate, which was independent of census interval. The Gf estimates were therefore more accurate than census counts in many situations. More than several tens of trees were needed in a size class to allow a reliable Gf estimates.",20,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Demography | Model population | Rain forests | Recruitment rate | Size structure | Transition rate | Tree population,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,46,NA,NA

The effect of supplementary feeding on growth and reproduction of three carnivorous plants species was investigated over a 6-year period.

Fed plants increased in size relative to control plants during the first years. Subsequently a stable size difference between feeding levels was established. The weight of the over-wintering part was higher in fed plants than in control plants. 3. The flowering frequency (i.e. proportion of plants in a population carrying flowers) was also higher in the fed plants. The proportion of flowering plants increased in the feeding treatment compared to control plants during more-or-less the whole experimental feeding period (5-6 years). Seed production also increased slowly in response to feeding. 4. No feeding effect on nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in seeds and overwintering parts was found. 5. In most characteristics the high-altitude populations were less responsive than populations growing at low altitude. In the high-altitude population reproduction failed repeatedly, suggesting that seed output may be more dependent on abiotic factors than on resource availability in cold environments. 6.

The reproductive output of Shorea siamensis, a widespread dipterocarp tree, was assessed in relation to disturbance and tree density at three sites in western Thailand during the 1996 and 1997 flowering seasons. The locations were similar except in disturbance history, which was reflected in decreasing tree density from undisturbed via moderately disturbed to disturbed sites. 2. Hand pollination experiments showed S. siamensis to be partially self-incompatible due to differential pollen tube growth and abortion of inbred fruit. Although more than 90% of flowers from trees at all sites were pollinated, pollen tubes developed in only a small proportion of these flowers. Both pollen tube development and initial fruit production were highest at the undisturbed site. Many fruit, presumably selfed, were aborted during development at all sites, but significantly more fruit were aborted at the disturbed site, resulting in lowered production of mature fruit. 3. Shorea siamensis was pollinated by small Trigona bees, which exhibited significant declines in intertree movements with increasing distance between flowering trees. As resource availability did not differ between sites, differences in mature fruit set were considered to be mediated by changes in pollinator foraging behaviour at differing tree densities. Variation in seed set was found to be negatively correlated with distance to nearest conspecific both within and between sites. 4. At the two least disturbed sites observed seed set values corresponded with those expected by calculation. However, seed set at the disturbed site was significantly lower than expected. 5. Our results suggest that high reproductive success of S. siamensis is dependent upon cross-pollination which, through pollinator behaviour, is a function of tree isolation.

Males and females of dioecious plant species often differ in a variety of secondary characteristics, such as size, flower number and flowering time, suggesting that dioecious species have sex-specific selection histories. However, a potential source of these dimorphic traits is age differences between males and females. By sowing 3000 seeds of the dioecious perennial, Silene latifolia (Caryophyllaceae), on a single day, we were able to assess the contribution of sex differences in emergence time to the development of sexually dimorphic adult traits. 2. Females emerged before males in our experimental field population, but on average males flowered first. Age differences between males and females did not therefore cause the earlier flowering of males. 3. The consequence of the detected differences in emergence and phenology between males and females was explored by path analysis. Emergence time had a strong direct effect on flower production as well as an indirect effect through flowering time. The regression coefficient of flowering time on emergence time was significantly larger for male plants. 4. A phenotypic selection analysis revealed that seedlings emerging early suffered greater mortality than those emerging later. Seedlings emerging early, however, developed into plants with more flowers, indicating that there was a trade-off between survivorship and reproductive performance. Seeds with intermediate emergence times had the highest total fitness, indicating the presence of stabilizing selection.

Rhizome systems of 120 clonal fragments were harvested in the spring of 1993, after 6 years of mowing (1987-92) and 2 years of fertilizer application (1991-92). The results were interpreted in the light of plant foraging theory. 2 The ages of the individual rhizomes comprising each rhizome system were determined and their length, number of offspring rhizomes, branching angles and the height of emerging shoots measured. Rhizomes were then washed, dried and weighed. 3 Persistent rhizomes, i.e. rhizomes that survived more than 1 year, were shorter and less numerous in mown plots and their dry mass was less than 50% of that in unmown plots. Thus, repeated mowing depleted the rhizomes of their stored resources and has been used as a measure to control the further spread of S. altissima. 4 In contrast, rhizomes established in 1992 produced 10% more daughter rhizomes, which were also 23% longer in mown than in unmown plots. 5 There was little evidence that the length, and no evidence that the number of rhizomes, was increased by fertilizer application. Nevertheless, fertilizer application increased the dry mass and decreased the specific length (length per unit dry mass) of rhizomes. 6 Rhizome branching angles were not consistently altered by the treatments. However, there was a significant interaction, i.e. angles increased in response to fertilizer in unmown but not in mown plots. 7 The observed rhizome growth patterns (3-5) could be explained by adaptive growth plasticity, i.e. foraging, in the first year followed by differential survival of long rhizomes in later years. However, the greater length of newly formed rhizomes in mown plots could also have been due to increased soil temperatures caused by the removal of standing biomass and litter, which increased irradiance at the soil surface.

Calamagrostis lapponica did not show any significant responses to temperature or water alone but there was a synergistic interaction between all three variables. 3 The abundance of the dominant dwarf shrubs (Empetrum hermaphroditum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, V. myrtillus and V. uliginosum) was unaffected by the perturbations but elevated temperature stimulated the biomass of V. uliginosum by 125% and total shrub biomass by 16%. The low ratio of current year's growth to standing biomass may have concealed other responses of the dwarf shrub group to the perturbations. 4 The response of the non-vascular flora to the perturbations was either neutral or negative, with lichens showing the most dramatic responses. Lichen biomass on temperature- and nutrient-amended plots was 56% and 18%, respectively, of that on unperturbed plots. Nutrients also exerted a negative effect on the biomass of bryophytes, and the combined biomass of lichens and bryophytes on nutrient-treated plots was almost a third of that on plots which did not receive additional nutrients. 5 Total above-ground biomass was not affected by the perturbations but the total number of interceptions determined by point quadrat analysis was greater on the elevated temperature and nutrient-treated plots. Point quadrat analysis also revealed an accumulation of litter and standing dead material in response to the nutrient and temperature perturbations, both singly and in combination, suggesting a faster turnover of plant material. 6 Both temperature and nutrients increased canopy height and also interacted synergistically such that together they resulted in a mean canopy height of 14.9cm compared with 8.0 cm in plots subjected to neither perturbation. 7 Nutrient addition lowered species richness by 17.7%, mainly through its impact on the mosses and lichens. 8 In general, nutrient addition elicited the greatest response, followed by temperature, with water exerting little measurable influence. There were a number of important interactions that were often synergistic, and some involved water. 9 Species' responses were highly individualistic and changes in the community were mediated through the response of a small number of key species already present in the community, with no invasion of new species.

The species scores along the first axis were highly correlated with the ammonium index. 5 FNIP was somewhat better correlated with the sample scores along axis 1 than mineralized ammonium, but only slightly better correlated than total-mineralized N relative to axis 2. Similar results were obtained for FNIS. 6 Ammonium index and FNIS explained more of the floristic variation along the ordination axes than Ellenberg's N indicator values. Weighted averages of these indices also showed higher correlations with the sample scores along the axes than corresponding averages of Ellenberg's N values. However, when ammonium index and FNIS for the most frequent species were transformed into classes, they were generally similar to the Ellenberg scale. 7 The ammonium indices differed considerably between regions, caused by differences in N deposition, total-N mineralization and nitrification rate. In one of the regions with comparatively low nitrification, the ammonium index was found to be uncorrelated with the species scores along the first DCA axis.

A few populations, however, had relatively high survival rates for 1-3 years after establishment, or brief periods (1-2 years) with much lower survival. Although the underlying survival function was best described by a negative power curve, a log-logistic model also fit the data and provided more versatility for fitting individual populations. 3 Significant differences in general survival pattern were found among species, sites (forests), years of establishment (cohorts), and all two-way interactions of species, site and cohort. Species differences were large. Spikes in mortality for individual species and cohorts were synchronized within sites and to a lesser degree among sites. In some sites, weak relationships were noted between mortality and peak river discharge during summer (negatively correlated) and winter (positively correlated). 4 Species differed strongly in their initial height, but effects of cohort and site on height were also significant as were all two-way interactions of species, site and cohort. During the 8 years of this study, very few seedlings grew taller than 30 cm. For most species, taller seedlings had greater per capita survival. Height growth, however, was not consistently related to survival.

Vertical distribution was assessed using an allometric approach to estimate maximum tree height (H(max)) and the slope of the sapling height-diameter relationship. 3 Average light levels intercepted and the proportion of individuals in each of five crown illumination classes varied significantly among the 11 species. Species ranged from extremely high-light demanding, to quite shade tolerant. Average light levels intercepted by trees generally increased through ontogeny, but the ranking of species did not change significantly. 4 Fewer individuals of the more shade-tolerant species established on disturbed microsites, irrespective of light levels. Among the more high-light demanding species, the proportion of trees on different types of disturbed sites varied. 5 Trees of seven species were significantly more common on clay-rich soils, two preferred sand-rich soils, and two were not strongly affected by soil texture. 6 H(max) ranged from 5.5 to 31.3 m and was negatively correlated with shade tolerance among species, although among the more high-light demanding species there was a wide range of tree sizes. Among species, H(max) was negatively correlated with both the slope and y-intercept of the sapling height-diameter relationship, indicating that small-statured species (also more shade tolerant) had more slender saplings than larger statured species. 7 Heterogeneity of resource availability leads to differences in horizontal and vertical tree distribution, which are important for the coexistence of 11 Macaranga species.",199,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Microenvironment | Rain forest | Shade tolerance | Species coexistence | Tree allometry | Tree spatial distribution,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,62,NA,NA

A demographic analysis of Primula vulgaris populations in forest patches with varying canopy openness was carried out to investigate the effect of forest canopy dynamics on the demography of this forest understorey herb. 2 Eight P. vulgaris populations across a range of light conditions were studied in three deciduous temperate forests in Britain. Demographic data were collected in each population during summer 1992, 1993 and 1994, and stage-based population projection matrices were built to describe their demography for two growth periods (1992-93 and 1993-94). 3 Population growth rate (λ) varied from 0.97 to 1.98 in 1992-93, and from 0.88 to 1.23 in 1993-94. There was a significant positive correlation between λ and diffuse light for the two periods studied: generally, population growth rate was lower in darker patches, implying that populations decline as the canopy closes. Lower λ-values in 1993-94 were the result of increased mortality and decreased fecundity compared to 1992-93. In most cases the observed population structures were significantly different from the calculated stable-stage distributions. 4 Sensitivity analysis showed that λ was most sensitive to changes in matrix transitions that corresponded to growth from small to adult stages, especially those that implied fast growth. Elasticity analysis revealed that the contribution of fecundity elements to λ was small, but populations in brighter patches showed comparatively higher fecundity elasticities than populations under the closed canopy. High elasticities corresponded to the entries that implied growth (especially in brighter patches) or persistence in adult categories (predominantly in darker patches). 5 The observed variation in the demography of P. vulgaris in different patches along the forest regeneration cycle stresses the importance of studying the variation in plant population dynamics across the range of habitat patches in which the plant naturally occurs.",140,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Canopy gaps | Demographic change | Gap-dependent species | Population dynamics | Sensitivity and elasticity analysis,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,63,NA,NA

Significant early and late-season differences among the species were found for available light (photosynthetically active radiation) at canopy and mid-canopy levels, and for soil temperature, moisture availability, macronutrient content, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and structure, at two depths. Field sites within each species also differed significantly for these variables. 3.

The development of general principles regarding biotic interactions involving plants, or plant species effects in ecosystems, is best achieved through simultaneous evaluation of several species. We utilized a comparative approach involving 20 dicotyledonous herbaceous species, to explore possible relationships between several plant ecophysiological traits and plant litter decomposition, interactions involving competition and herbivory, and plant species effects on soil properties. 2. Decomposition rates of plant stem and leaf litter were negatively related to plant mass, time until flowering and vegetative growth rate, and positively related to stem nitrogen content. Root decomposition was also related to several traits. Multiple regression relationships showed that 74% and 84% of the variation across species for stem and root litter decomposition, respectively, could be predicted by plant traits; this suggests that plant traits may be powerful predictors of decomposition and have potential as alternative predictors to the litter quality characteristics that previous studies have concentrated on. 3. Palatability of both seedlings and leaf discs by the invertebrate herbivores Deroceras reticulatum and Listronotus bonariensis were frequently related to plant traits. Those traits that showed the strongest relationships with the palatability data included various vegetative growth characteristics and (for the leaf disc data) nitrogen concentrations of flowering plant stems. 4. Competitive effects of the dicotyledonous species against a phytometer species, the grass Lolium perenne, were negatively related to leaf nitrogen concentration, and multiple regression relationships involving this trait in combination with others explained over 50% of the variation across species. The competitive response of both plant mass and total seed production to L. perenne was poorly related to plant traits. 5. The effects of plant species on soil properties including microbial biomass and activity, pH, nitrate concentration and total nitrogen were often closely related to various plant traits. Multiple regression relationships revealed that combinations of several traits were often important in determining these effects; the strongest relationships found were for effects of senescent plants on soil respiration and for the effects of flowering plants on soil nitrate. Plant traits were therefore clearly important in determining plant species effects on soils. 6. Our study emphasizes the importance of plant traits in understanding (and predicting) species interactions and effects in communities and ecosystems, and shows that properties considered at the whole plant level have the potential to manifest themselves over much larger scales.

The release of CH4 from Sedge cores increased with increasing temperature of the peat and decreased with decreasing temperature. Methane efflux from Sphagnum cores was quite stable independent of the peat temperatures. 3 In both Sedge and Sphagnum samples, CO2 treatment doubled the potential CH4 production but had no effect on the potential CH4 oxidation. A raised concentration of CO2 increased CH4 efflux weakly and only at the highest peat temperatures (17-20 °C). 4 The results suggest that in cool regions, such as boreal wetlands, temperature would restrict decomposition of the extra substrates probably derived from enhanced primary production of mire vegetation under raised CO2 concentrations, and would thus retard any consequent increase in CH4 emission.",57,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,CO  enrichment 2 | Glasshouse experiment | Methane efflux | Production and oxidation potentials,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,70,NA,NA

The empirical measurements were used to calibrate a model of canopy photosynthesis and soil respiration that was subsequently integrated to provide estimates of annual net ecosystem production (NEP). 2 Standing total and green biomass on the non-grazed site reached maxima during September of 1.9 ± 0.2 and 1.1 ± 0.2 kg m2 (± 1 SD, n = 3), respectively. Corresponding maxima (0.8 ± 0.1 and 0.5 ± 0.05 kg m2), were achieved during July at the grazed site. 3 Sediment organic matter as a percentage of dry weight was 31.6% and 5% at the non-grazed and grazed sites, respectively. Accounting for the higher sediment bulk density at the grazed site meant that concentrations of organic carbon were 0.027 and 0.021 g cm-3 at non-grazed and grazed sites, respectively. Thus, the fraction of NEP removed by grazing animals significantly reduced the accumulation of sediment organic matter. 4 Estimate of NEP varied between 17 and 38 mol m-2 year1 of carbon at the grazed site and between 5 and 38 mol m-2 year-1 at the non-grazed site, depending on assumptions about canopy geometry. Soil respiration, 36 mol m-2 year-1, did not differ between sites. Canopy respiration was less (21 mol m-2 year-1) at the grazed site than at the non-grazed site (28 tool m-2 year-1), and accounted for 22-29% and 28-41% of gross photosynthesis at grazed and non-grazed sites, respectively. The decrease in canopy respiration compensated the grazed canopy for losses to herbivores. 5 A canopy photosynthesis model was used to calculate a theoretical envelope of canopy biomass, termed the production window, inside of which NEP is positive and outside of which NEP is negative. The production window is bisected by the optimum canopy biomass, which is the theoretical biomass at which NEP is maximized. The seasonality of NEP is determined by the trajectory of actual canopy biomass through the production window.

Specific hypotheses tested were: (i) all ramets within individual clones are physiologically integrated; (ii) ramet hierarchies (several connected generations) within individual clones are capable of acquiring soil nitrogen equally from localized nutrient-rich pulses; and (iii) nitrogen is retained within individual hierarchies through allocation to sequentially developed ramet generations. 2 Mean 15N atom percent excess values within labelled ramet hierarchies were 10-21-fold greater than in immediately adjacent ramet hierarchies, and 105-137-fold greater than in the remaining ramet hierarchies within clones for all three species. This pattern of 15N distribution demonstrates that physiological integration does not occur among all ramets within individual clones and that ramet hierarchies function as integrated physiological individuals. 3 Ramets in closer proximity to a 15N pulse in soils acquired disproportionately greater amounts of the isotope compared to more distant ramets within clones for all three species. Inequitable resource acquisition among ramet hierarchies establishes the potential for asymmetric intraclonal competition below-ground and the development of size inequalities among hierarchies. 4 Approximately 21.7%, 3.5%, 1.7% and 2.3% of the initial 15N pool was allocated from the first ramet generation to the second and third (spring cohort), third (autumn cohort) and fourth generations, respectively. However, the magnitude of nitrogen allocation from parent to juvenile ramet generations was relatively consistent, with 17-32% of the 15N pool within parental ramets allocated to juvenile ramets. Intergenerational 15N allocation in S. scoparium clones therefore demonstrates a high degree of interdependence within individual ramet hierarchies. 5 Clones of the rhizomatous and two caespitose grasses investigated functioned as assemblages of autonomous ramet hierarchies, but ramet generations within individual hierarchies were effectively integrated. Consequently, intraclonal regulation in these temperate, perennial grasses is characterized by both ramet interdependence and independence. The occurrence of ramet independence throughout much of the life history of perennial grasses demonstrates the ecological importance of clonal fragments to genet and population maintenance and emphasizes that this may be the most relevant scale to investigate further the ecology of this important and widely distributed group of clonal plants.",31,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Clonal biology | Intraclonal competition | Nitrogen allocation | Physiological integration | Sectoriality,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,73,NA,NA

Plant productivity is thus increased, and achievement of maximum microbial biomass is facilitated through increased microbial access to plant-derived carbon. 2 Simulations show that micro-organisms exhibiting such a 'strategic' nitrogen uptake will be competitively excluded by more voracious micro-organisms in a homogeneous system, but can persist in a spatially explicit system. This persistence of less voracious micro-organisms contrasts with the frequently held view that micro-organisms in soil systems take up nitrogen at the maximum possible rate. 3 The selection of strategic or voracious microbial types in a spatially explicit environment is sensitive to the frequency of plant and microbial disturbance, and to the rate of diffusion of inorganic nitrogen in the soil system. In particular, the strategic (less voracious) microbial types are favoured under conditions of low plant disturbance, low to moderate diffusion of inorganic nitrogen, and moderate microbial disturbance. 4 When selection favours strategic microbial types, plant access to nitrogen is increased.

Using soil from the field plot location, we isolated fungi pathogenic to K. stipulacea seeds and seedlings. 3 Two pathogenic fungi (Rhizoctonia solani and Pythium irregulare) were used in a glasshouse study of the effects of pathogens and intraspecific competition on plant mortality and growth. Our null hypothesis was that death of individual plants due to disease would be balanced by increased growth of survivors. A factorial experiment was established with five soil treatments (three controls, P. irregulare and R. solani) and seven seed densities. 4 Inoculation by both R. solani and P. irregulare led to a reduction in final numbers of plants, with the reduction greatest for populations inoculated with R. solani. Average biomass per plant was reduced with increased sowing density in all treatments except the R. solani inoculation, where surviving plants in high-density pots may be larger because of the reduced density resulting from pathogen-induced death. No treatment differences in size hierarchies were evident 5 Surviving plants in both inoculation treatments could not take full advantage of the reduced density, and thus total biomass and number of trifoliate leaves per population (a surrogate for seed production) were reduced compared to controls, leading us to reject the null hypothesis. The reduction was more severe at high sowing densities. These results suggest that disease has the potential to reduce seed production and thus plant population numbers, if populations are seed limited.

The effects of species' dispersal mode and propagule size were examined. 3 In the first growing season, pits and mounds were colonized by large numbers of species. The total number of colonizing species was similar for the two patch types, but incidence was higher in pits than in mounds. 4 The early colonizers were mainly wind-dispersed and showed both high abundance and incidence. Dispersal mode did not affect colonization in the second year and later, nor did propagule size throughout the experiment. 5 Most early colonizers became resident in the patches, but pits and mounds showed some further colonization during the second year. In the third and fourth year both the numbers of colonizing species and their incidence decreased. 6 Pits were mainly colonized from outside the experimental units to which they belonged, whereas mounds received species mostly from the adjacent pits within the same units. 7 From the second year on, patches of undisturbed crusted soil were also colonized, mainly from the adjacent pits and mounds. The number of colonizing species in undisturbed patches increased during the last, high-rainfall, year both per patch and for the whole set of patches. 8 We conclude that the sink function of patches for colonization increases with removal of vegetation, soil crust and seed bank, with patch capacity to capture resource and plant propagules, and with amount of rainfall. Sink function decreased with time due to decreasing availability of new species, but increased with the presence of stronger sink patches in the vicinity. 9 We suggest that the concept of sink function, in terms of the numbers, incidence and abundance of species colonizing sets of patches, can be a powerful tool for linking community and landscape processes.",29,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Assemblage dynamics | Desert shrubland | Landscape mosaic | Negev | Sink function,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,77,NA,NA

As a consequence, the original model was reparameterized to provide a better fit to the observed yields for the 1989-90 experiment. 3 Analyses were conducted to determine the importance of potential sources of bias in the original model, including (i) mis-specification of density effects at low densities due to the parameterization protocol; (ii) interaction effects among competing species; and (iii) year-to-year variability in competitive interactions. All three sources had a significant effect on at least one of the species in the experiment, although significant sources differed between species. 4 Using two forms of sensitivity analysis, a comparison was made between the original and modified versions of the yield-density model to determine how they differed in predictions of long-term plant community dynamics. Rank order of average densities among species did not differ between models; however, there were several important differences in their predictions with respect to overall community structure. Implications of these results with respect to the use of yield-density models in studying plant community dynamics are discussed. 5 The present study indicates that the effectiveness of the generally employed yield-density model at characterizing competitive interactions under different environmental conditions depends upon the criteria employed in making an assessment.

The severity of these impacts depends on abiotic conditions (e.g. buffering capacity, soil nutrient status and soil factors that influence the nitrification potential and nitrogen immobilization rate) in the particular system. The sensitivity of fresh water ecosystems, wetlands and bogs, species-rich grasslands, heathlands and field layer of forests, all of which have conservational value, are discussed in detail. 2 The most important effects of nitrogen deposition are: (i) accumulation of nitrogenous compounds resulting in enhanced availability of nitrate or ammonium; (ii) soil-mediated effects of acidification; and (iii) increased susceptibility to secondary stress factors. 3 Long-term nitrogen enrichment has gradually increased the availability of nitrogen in several vegetation types, leading to competitive exclusion of characteristic species by more nitrophilic plants, especially under oligo- to mesotrophic soil conditions. 4 Soil acidification (with losses of buffering capacity and increased concentrations of toxic metals) is especially important after nitrification of ammonium in weakly buffered environments: acid-resistant plant species then become dominant at the expense of the often rare plants typical of intermediate pH. The related change in the balance between ammonium and nitrate may also affect the performance of several species. 5 The susceptibility of plant species to secondary stress factors (pathogens; frost and drought) may be affected by air-borne nitrogen but data are only available for a few communities (e.g. dry heathlands). 6 Most global biodiversity is contained within natural and semi-natural vegetation. It is thus crucial to control emissions of nitrogenous compounds to the atmosphere, in order to reduce or prevent effects on diversity in these systems.

Fire and vegetation dynamics in a boreal Pinus banksiana and Picea mariana forest are reconstructed using a 580 year fossil pollen and charcoal record obtained from 128 contiguous samples, each representing c. 4.55 years of sediment. 2. The general post-fire vegetation changes, as indicated by cross-correlation analyses, are an increase in ground layer taxa and shrubs, followed by an increase in coniferous trees and Betula papyrifera. The size and exact timing of the peak abundance in each taxon differs after individual fires. 3. Sixteen fires are identified using pollen and charcoal records. The mean fire interval is 34 years, similar to fire cycle estimates of 38 and 39 years from dendrochronological studies. 4. On two occasions, Picea mariana appears to replace Pinus banksiana as the local dominant, each time taking less than 70 years. 5. An unusual decline in Pinus pollen between c. AD 1816 and 1861 corresponds with a similar decline in a pollen record from 50 km WSW of this site.

We investigated the possible influence of small-scale heterogeneities and disturbances in determining tree spacing and tree-grass coexistence in semi-arid savannas, using a spatially explicit, grid-based simulation model. 2 We added factors such as seed clumping, locally improved moisture conditions, vegetation clearing and combinations of all three of these variables to a previously published model. We also examined the influence of changing the size and spariotemporal correlation among individual heterogeneities. 3 Increased seed availability in localized clumps, especially in combination with the other heterogeneity types, had the strongest impact on the long-term tree-grass coexistence in the model. Localized deposition of tree seeds in herbivore dung and underground seed caches built by seed-collecting rodents may act as a determinant of the distribution of trees in savannas. 4 Spatially autocorrelated small-scale heterogeneities led to a more stable coexistence of trees and grasses than uncorrelated heterogeneities did, and at high levels of autocorrelation runs with all three variables led to long-term coexistence in up to 60% of the rainfall scenarios tested. 5 The size of individual heterogeneities also played a significant role in determining whether trees would establish as lone individuals or in clumps. In simulations that included small-scale heterogeneities, the number of isolated trees scattered throughout the landscape increased, whereas large heterogeneity patches and high spatio-temporal autocorrelation tended to promote tree clustering. 6 Simulations based on rainfall data from the southern Kalahari produced a realistic density and spatial distribution for trees in this semi-arid savanna for a realistic range of small-scale heterogeneities. 7 Small-scale disturbances and heterogeneities, at least those that furnish better establishment conditions for tree seedlings, therefore act to increase the range of environmental conditions under which trees and grasses can coexist as savanna.",143,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Coexistence | Grid-based simulation model | Kalahari | Savanna | Seed clumping | Spatial vegetation dynamics | Stability | Tree spacing,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,85,NA,NA

Our objectives were to identify leaf- and whole plant-level traits that are key to its success and to determine its community- and ecosystem-level consequences in primary successional sites. 2 Along an elevational gradient from 90 to 1660 m, mean maximum net assimilation rates of Dicranopteris ranged from 2.9 to 5.0 μmolm-2S-1, compared with 3.6-9.5 μmol m-2 S-1 in the codominant tree Metrosideros polymorpha. Gas-exchange characteristics did not explain Dicranopteris' success, nor its trends in production. 3 However, indeterminate, clonal growth form, shallow rhizomes, marcescent leaves with low decomposability, and a mat-forming capacity enabled Dicranopteris to colonize sites and to maintain dominance via high effective leaf area, despite its low biomass. Phosphorus use efficiency, which reached 24 kg g-1, was exceptionally high, allowing colonization of phosphorus-poor sites. 4 Dicranopteris contributed up to 74% of above-ground net primary productivity in a site where it contained only 14% of live biomass. It accounted for up to 57% and 47% of total nitrogen and phosphorus uptake by plants, respectively, where it contained only 24% and 30% of plant nitrogen and phosphorus. Dicranopteris leaves are short-lived and slow to decompose; thus, fixed carbon is transferred quickly to soil detrital pools where it contributes to aggrading soil organic matter pools and may exacerbate oligotrophic conditions, thereby strongly influencing soil genesis and ecosystem development. 5 The fern therefore influences forest-floor light regimes and directs later community development. An exclusion experiment demonstrated that Dicranopteris competed with Metrosideros, but lack of revegetation in 40% of the exclusion area after 39 months showed that Dicranopteris also colonized microenvironments unavailable to its endemic codominants. Dicranopteris may play an important role in resisting invasions of exotic species into Hawaiian rainforests.",86,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Clonal plant | Dicranopteris linearis | Ecosystem development | Fern ecology | Growth form | Hawaii | Hawaiian rainforests | Mauna Loa | Nutrient use | Primary succession,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,86,NA,NA
