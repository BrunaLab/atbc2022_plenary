Digestibility of dry matter of winter food plants was 40% in the more preferred species and 20% in less preferred species. Faecal protein from wild hares was used as an index of mean food quality consumed by hares. Faecal protein was lower in winter than summer. In the winters of peak numbers (1978-82), some animals obtained food of a quality lower than necessary to maintain body weight, indicating food limitation. On food-supplemented areas, protein indicated there was adequate food in all years except 1980. Since the hare population declined in these areas in 1982 in the presence of adequate food, food limitation was not a necessary cause of the decline on the scale of these experiments. Plant secondary compounds declined through the increase, peak and decline phases of the hare cycle. Phenols increased 2 yr after hare numbers dropped due to new growth of juvenile shoots. Results are contrary to the hypothesis that fluctuations in secondary compounds cause the hare cycle. The proportion of juvenile twigs in the available food, containing high amounts of secondary compounds, remained low during the decline and first year of low hare density, contrary to the plant structure hypothesis which predicts that juvenile twigs should be predominant in the decline and first 2-3 yr of the low phase. Predation is a necessary cause of the hare cycle and in some circumstances, it may be the only cause. The hare cycle is constant in period but variable in amplitude. Food limitation may occur as a consequence of high amplitude rather than a cause of it. -from Authors",86,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA

When foxes and martens were killed, neither brood size nor subsequent adult numbers were significantly correlated with vole abundance in summer, although losses of whole broods increased slightly when vole numbers grew most rapidly from summer to autumn. Large vole populations thus resulted in large autumn grouse populations mainly because they reduced predation on breeding grouse. Vole numbers and increase rates associated with high grouse breeding success in one summer were also associated with low counts of adult grouse the next year, and thus with an increase in grouse losses from one summer to the next. -from Authors",189,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA,NA

Durations of dive were proportional to water depth in all species, but time spent searching for prey on the sea bed increased with water depth (transit time) in crowned and cape cormorants, and was apparently independent of water depth in bank and white-breasted cormorants. Theoretically, time spent at the water's surface recovering from dives is critical in determining the relationship between bottom time and depth. At given depths, distribution of bottom times was normal for white-breasted, bank and crowned cormorants but positively skewed for cape cormorants.

Key factors in mortality during development were desiccation of shallow, natural dune slacks and saltmarsh pools and predation of tadpoles by invertebrates in all pool types. Developmental failure of spawn was caused primarily by Saprolegnia infestation at low temperatures or by pH <6. Metamorphic success was correlated with high tadpole growth rates. These rates were determined primarily by temperature and food supply, and the latter was a function of water chemistry. Tadpoles grew faster in the more eutrophic pools, though low pH reduced growth rates irrespective of food supply. Major predators of natterjack larvae were dytiscid water beetles; others of significance included Notonecta species, Odonata larvae and newt Triturus cristatus.

Predators are assumed to follow the rule of abandoning their current patch when local capture rate is lower than estimated capture rate in the environment as a whole. This rule maximizes long-term capture rate in many foraging situations. After abandoning a patch, predators arrive at random at any patch in the environment. Predators detect precisely the capture rate in their current patch but ""learn' about the environmental average. The relative weight of past and present capture rate is controlled by a parameter denominated the ""memory factor'. In the absence of depletion, the predators distribute themselves close to the predictions of the Ideal Free Distribution model. This result indicates that the IFD prediction is not dependent on assuming omniscient predation, but can be jointly derived from reasonable assumptions about learning and optimal foraging at individual level. When the environment depletes as a consequence of predation, cumulative prey mortality can be positively or negatively density-dependent, depending on the interaction between predator efficiency and the velocity of the learning process as determined by the memory factor. The learning model converges towards the IFD faster than ""omniscient' variants in which the predators, instead of using a learned estimate and migrating ""blindly' to any patch, use the true environmental average for the migration decision and migrate only to patches with capture rate higher than their current capture rate. Both spatial and temporal between-patch variance in prey density affect the behaviour of the model. from Authors",207,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,21,NA,NA

In about half of the studies, there were no obvious density-dependent factors operating; many population densities may commonly fluctuate between an upper ceiling and a lower floor rather than be maintained around a more fixed equilibrium.

The mean size of emerging adults was strongly density-dependent, and ""carrying capacity' was linearly related to host mass, both within and across host species. Survival also was density-dependent on the smaller host species, and on the larger species when very high densities were used. Competition among these parasitoids thus appears to be largely determined by the amount of food which the host constitutes. Survival was lower on small hosts of both species, independent of density. Also, Plodia hosts from some cultures were unsuitable (produced no parasitoids), independent of size and density. Development time was unaffected by egg density or host size, and only very slightly by host species. -from Author",52,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,62,NA,NA

Densities of small mammal prey are lower in pine forest than in spruce forest, where small mammal populations are also rather stable. Microtus voles occupy agricultural land and show predictable population cycles. Thus, owls on good territories benefit from vole peaks by foraging over farmland and shift to alternative prey in woodland during the low phase of the vole cycle. Poor territories supported a breeding pair only in peak vole years, but good ones also in low vole years. Independently of their age both females and males performed better on grades 4-5 than on grades 2-3. Nearly all females shifted territories between successive breeding attempts, but males stayed on the same territory after their 1st breeding attempt. Females seemed to move to get more experienced mates rather than better territories. The longevity of males was greater on grades 4-5 than on grades 2-3. Mean longevity of males on their tertitories was 1.6 yr. Some good territories became vacant every year, but males did not change territories.

Migratory behaviour ensured that larger trout did not remain to use resources such as food and space in Black Brows Beck, whereas these older trout remained in Wilfin Beck, forming a major part of the biomass whilst contributing little to annual production. Smaller fry size at the start of the growth period, not lack of food, was chiefly responsible for the smaller trout in Wilfin Beck. The larger fry size in Black Brows Beck was related directly to egg weight which, in turn, was related to the larger spawning females and to a higher proportion of the female's resources being invested in egg production (30-37% of female's total energy content in Black Brows Beck, 16-17% in Wilfin Beck). -from Author",32,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,64,NA,NA

Also, males grew more slowly than females, which yields a cost to future reproduction, as larger males could brood more offspring. No sexual difference in predation risk was found. Over-winter survival of males was probably lowered because intestinal fat deposition was delayed as a result of their reproductive efforts. In Nerophis ophidion, males brood their offspring attached to their ventral body side, and provide them with nutrients and oxygen. Sexes are dimorphic, females being larger and bright in colour. Males suffered an increased predation risk when brooding. No indications of energetic costs were found, eg through lowered food intake or slower growth rate.

This may be related to the cost of defending a territory. Female survival rate is negatively related to the beech crop production of the previous year, which is probably an indirect measure of the number of resident males, so that the relationship reflects competition between males and females. Survival rates of immigrant males and resident females are affected by different variables from those affecting resident males and immigrant females. These differences may be related to sex differences in dispersal behaviour. In any year, females may survive better or worse than males and independently immigrants may survive better or worse than residents. These differences in survival between groups are not consistent in direction, although sometimes strongly significant. -from Authors",107,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,67,NA,NA

Data up to 1986 were used in a key factor analysis. Individual mortalities used were the inability to realize maximum egg production (k1), egg loss (k2), chick loss (k3), and overwinter loss (k4). At both sites number of pairs increased and young fledged per pair decreased following recolonization. Chick loss explained 86% and 83% of the variation in total loss at Havergate and Minsmere, respectively. Egg loss at both sites and chick loss at Havergate increased over the study period. Egg loss was positively correlated with number of eggs laid at both sites. Chick loss at both sites was unrelated to number of chicks hatched. The main density-dependent loss was the loss occurring from the autumn population in year t and the breeding population in year t+2 since most avocets return to their natal site in their 2nd year. During 2 phases, ""increase' and ""plateau' the strength of density dependence was determined. During the plateau phase density dependence was almost perfectly compensatory. At both sites numbers of black-headed gull Larus ridibundus, which predate avocet egg and chicks and appropriate avocet nests, have increased during the study periods. At Havergate, chick loss was correlated with number of breeding gulls up to and including 1971, beyond which kestrel Falco tinnunculus predation also occurred. At Minsmere, neither egg nor chick losses were related to the number of breeding gulls. Egg losses were higher at Minsmere than Havergate. Chick losses were higher at Havergate than Minsmere.

Survivorship and developmental rates, and ultimate size and weight vary with rearing temperature. By behaviourally thermoregulating, T. eques maintain their temperature between 30-40oC for much of the day, and thus optimize its effects. T. eques survives in a desert environment with a short and unpredictable favourable season that averages 692 degree-days (DD), but it requires 850 DD to develop. By thermoregulating, T. eques increases its developmental rate, enabling it to complete its life cycle before the habitat fails. In this sense T. eques is a ""maxitherm'. Enzymes function best within certain narrow temperature ranges. For ectotherms, this range must reflect the highest environmental temperature that the population normally encounters. The ability and need to thermoregulate are influenced by non-thermal features such as defensive strategy, body size and feeding strategy. For this grasshopper, the antipredation features of black aposematic coloration and unpalatability allow rapid radiative heating, and extended conspicuous exposure. Release from vertebrate, but not invertebrate, predation favours large size, a feature beneficial for water retention and deep oviposition. Size also influences thermal inertia, and ultimate temperature excess during solar heating. A high thermal inertia is detrimental for T. eques, considering the short period available for morning foraging. The need to ground forage thus makes thermoregulation essential. -from Author",40,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,29544,undefined,0,FALSE,69,NA,NA
