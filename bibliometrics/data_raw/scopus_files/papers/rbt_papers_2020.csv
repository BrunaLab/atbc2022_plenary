In Cuba, benthic mollusks have been reported as the main food for the lobster Panulirus argus. Objectives: To estimate spatiotemporal variations in the soft-bottom benthic community of the Gulf of Batabanó, and to infer, with emphasis on mollusks, the effect of such variations on the availability of food for spiny lobsters. Methods: A historical analysis of the variations in the density and biomass of megazoobenthos (organisms ≥ 4 mm) and particularly of megazoobenthic mollusks was carried out, taking as a reference the studies published in 1990 (with samples from 1983) and recent data (2007-2018) recorded on site using comparable methodologies based on sediment drags. Abundance was given as density (ind/m2) and biomass in g/m2. Results: It was found that both the density and the biomass were significantly higher at the end of the last century and show a tendency to gradually decrease towards recent times. Regarding the values reported in 1983, the density of organisms showed a decrease of 73 %, however, the biomass experienced an even greater decrease (86 %). The areas with the highest density and biomass, both benthos and mollusks, have varied from 1983 and are currently located towards the center of the gulf. Despite this, bivalves continue to be better represented than gastropods. In general, mollusks showed a significant decrease (55 % and 88 % respectively). Conclusions: The deterioration of the benthic community in the fishing areas of the Gulf of Batabanó was corroborated and it was demonstrated, based on megazoobenthos, that malacofauna can be used as a reliable indicator of the general parameters of the softbottom benthic community. The availability of food for lobsters have decreased 55.6 % compared to 1983. This could help to explain the current changes in the abundance, distribution and nutritional condition of lobsters, which could also be related to the recent megazoobenthos variations.",4,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Benthos | Food availability | Mollusks | Soft bottoms | Spiny lobster,13567,CONACYT,undefined,Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,1

Therefore, the development of new treatment alternatives is necessary. Natural products have various qualities as pos-sible adjuvants in therapies against different etiological agents, among which its antiparasitic effects stand out. Objective: To evaluate the antiparasitic, antioxidant, cytotoxic, and cytoprotective activity of Berberine (Ber), Curcumin (Cur), and Quercetin (Qr). Methods: Analytical grade Ber, Cur, and Qr solutions were prepared, and aliquots were made at different concentrations for their evaluation against Entamoeba histolytica, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Strongyloides venezuelensis. To do this, the mean inhibitory concentration (IC50) was determined, and the antioxidant capacity (EC50) was also determined by the DPPH assay, both using the Probit statistical test. The cytotoxic and cytoprotective activity was determined by the hemolysis technique, Anova and Tukey’s test were applied to determine the difference in the means in the treatments evaluated. Results: Ber, Cur, and Qr, showed activity against E. histolytica, T. vaginalis, and S. venezuelensis in-vitro. Ber presented IC50 of 1.7, 1.2, and 1.9 μM respectively, being more effective compared to Cur with IC50 of 55.3, 40.6, and 13.7 μM, or Qr with IC50 of 147.2, 93.2, and 110.9 μM, however, the best antioxidant activity (EC50 = 1.1 μg/ml), cytoprotec-tive and less hemolytic, was presented by Qr (P < 0.001) compared to the evaluated control. Conclusions: The metabolites of natural origin berberine, curcumin, and quercetin, have activity against trophozoites of E. histo-lytica, T. vaginalis and larvae of S. venezuelensis in low doses comparable to the reference drugs in the case of Ber.

Results: there were no significant differences in lignin and phosphorous percentages between the leaves of the three species, but nitrogen content and leaf toughness differed among them.

Although lignin and phosphorous differences were not significant, the leaves of C. multiflora had lower toughness, which could make them more palatable for Phylloicus sp. On the other hand, the daily specific growth of the larvae was higher when they used leaves of F. tonduzii.

The macro-invertebrate assemblages have been poorly studied compared to streams located at lower altitudes. On a global and regional scale, the characteristics of macroinvertebrates change with the increase in latitude and altitude (decreasing in richness and variation in composition). At the local level, the effect of acidic waters with high conductivity from springs that join streams generate heterogeneity in water quality and consequently in the characteristics of macroinvertebrate structure. Objective: To compare the diversity, composition and abundance of macroinvertebrates and the physicochemical characteristics of stream water in two high Andean wetlands in Peru. Methodology: Eleven stations located in streams of two high Andean wetlands were studied: 7 in Guitarrachayocc (G) of 43 ha (n = 28) and 4 in Pichccahuasi (P) of 28 ha (n = 8). A Surber sampler (0.3 mm mesh, sampling area of 1 200 cm2) was used to carry out monthly samplings from October 2016 to April 2017. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Non-Parametric-Multivariate-Analysis-Of-Variance (NP-MANOVA) were applied to compare water characteristics. The macroinvertebrate assemblages from the two streams were compared by using a Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA), NP-MANOVA, and a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test (α = 0.05). Results: The characteristics of the water were heterogeneous, with significant differences in pH which ranged from 3.2 (± 0.4) to 7.6 (± 0.1) and conductivity ranging from 168.9 (± 91.0) µS / cm to 1 117.0 (± 159.3) µS / cm. In particular, G6 presented the lowest pH values and the highest electrical conductivity, as well as chlorides. A total of 8 126 individuals were collected, distributed in 26 taxa from 20 families, 11 orders and five classes. Insects were the most diverse and abundant group. Differences were found between the streams of the highland wetlands, despite their proximity: in G, 25 taxa were registered, with a dominance of Macrelmis sp., Dicrotendipes sp., Claudioperla sp. and Meridialaris sp. and in P, 9, with a dominance of Pedrowygomya sp., Hyalella sp. and Dicrotendipes sp. The density was 475 ind./m2 and 31 ind./m2 for G and P respectively, these values were statistically different (p < 0.05).

Objective: We assessed the distribution and habitat use frequency of L. longicaudis in La Miel I hydroelectric power dam and its influence area in the Department of Caldas, Colombia. Methods: We carried out diurnal surveys across standardized transects between 2014 and 2018 looking for records (sightings, faeces, tracks, and dens) that indicate the presence of the species. Each yearly survey was done during 12 consecutive days over three seasonal sampling periods assessing the upstream, reservoir, and downstream waterscape areas. Results: We sampled a total of 875 km in a five-year period across the three main waterscape areas (upstream-103 km, reservoir-582 km, and downstream-190 km) registering a total of 1 496 records. Faeces were the most common record (~ 95 %) across the whole study area followed by sightings, dens (1.7 % each), and tracks (1.3 %). Spatial distribution analyses suggest that L. longicaudis prefers dwelling upstream watercourses (hot spots areas; Gi Z-score = 4.46, p < 0.001) and in a lesser extent, areas around the water reservoir (cold spot areas; Gi Z-score =-2.69, p = 0.007). Signs of otters were also recorded at downstream area, but these records were non-significant within the analysis (Gi Z-score =-0.11, p = 0.48), suggesting L. longicaudis uses this area opportunistically. Cluster and outlier analysis showed that even though L. longicaudis was commonly found upstream and in the reservoir area, only some specific sectors (Moro, La Miel and Tasajos rivers) had high (LMI Z-score = 5.63, p = 0.001) and low (LMI Z-score = 2.12, p = 0.001) clusters. Conclusions: The upstream waterscape area is key for the survival of L. longicaudis in this regulated system, likely providing enough shelter and food for the species to carry out living activities and have resident populations. In contrast, downstream areas require specific attention to understand in a better way the effects of caused by the dam on the species dynamics, also defining management strategies that avoid population fragmentation and movement reduction.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Conservation | Distribution | Hot spots | Mustelids | Tropical reservoirs,13567,NA,33/45,Universidad de Caldas,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,16

One alternative is to use artificial substrates. The use of artificial substrates to evaluate the aquatic macroinvertebrate biodiversity in wetlands has been studied previously in Costa Rica, but no research has been conducted to determine which types of substrates are most effective. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of three artificial substrates (i.e., stones, leaves and wood). Methods: Samples of the three substrates were taken bi-monthly between 2013 and 2017 in four sites of the Parismina River. A Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to determine differences between the macroin-vertebrate abundance among substrate type. Beside to determine if there is a difference between substrates per site, a two-way PERMANOVA test was applied and a multiple correspondence analysis was used to correlate the substrate type with the macroinvertebrate community. Results: A total of 1 159 organisms were collected, with Diptera and Ephemeroptera being the most abundant. Wood and leaves were the substrates with greatest biodiversity and abundance of organisms; in addition the two sites with greatest vegetation were the most diverse.

Plants provide food and habitat for fish, especially Prochilodus lineatus and Gymnotus omarorum, which are relevant to subsistence fishing by local indigenous communities. Objective: In this study we describe the main traits of E. crassipes floating meadows, and analyze the abundance and composition of macroinvertebrate assemblages associated with their roots in two floodplain wetlands of the Paraná River (within the Ramsar site Wetlands Chaco) and of the Pilcomayo River (within the Pilcomayo River National Park). Methods: During spring and summer, the macroinvertebrates were collected in monospecific stands of E. crassipes with a net of 962 cm2 area and 500 µm mesh size. Leaf density, the biomass of leaves and roots, the length of leaves and roots, and the water quality were measured simultaneously. Results: Temperature, oxygen concentration, and nutrient content were significantly higher and electrical conductivity was lower in the Pilcomayo than in the Paraná floodplain. E. crassipes growing in the Pilcomayo floodplain had longer leaves and less root biomass than those found in the Paraná floodplain. The number of macroinvertebrates per 1 000 g root dry weight and per m2 was significantly different between both floodplains, but the taxon richness was similar. Non Metric Multidimensional Scaling analysis differentiated the abundance of 14 selected taxa between both floodplains, and showed a high correlation between the environmental variables and macroinvertebrate abundance. The most abundant taxonomic groups in the Paraná River floodplain were oligochaetes (Naididae), ostracods mainly Cytheridella ilosvayi and larvae of non-biting midges (Chironomidae). Two families, Hydrobiidae (Heleobia parchappii) and Chironomidae accounted for 49.3 % of the total abundance in the Pilcomayo floodplain. The prawns Macrobrachium jelskii and M. amazonicum, frequent in the Pilcomayo floodplain, were not found in the Paraná floodplain. Conclusions: The different environmental conditions in both floodplains affect the abundance, composition, and the dominance of macroinvertebrate assemblages; however, the total taxa richness was similar.

However, researchers in the region are facing diverse challenges, and we lack a regional overview of the status of freshwater research. Objective: To address this, we surveyed researchers in the region to assess the current activity and challenges faced by the scientific community. We were interested in understanding (1) the type of research currently taking place in the region, (2) the major research gaps, as viewed by local researchers, and (3) the main limitations or obstacles slowing the development of freshwater science in the region. Methods: We prepared a questionnaire with 26 questions regarding the background of participants, their ongoing research priorities, the products generated from their research, and the major limitations they are facing as researchers. Results: We obtained 105 answers from researchers in 19 Latin American countries. Some of the important trends identified included: (1) a focus on stream ecosystems under agricultural and natural forest; (2) emphasis on biodiversity assessment and species inventories; (3) limited ecological research, mostly centered on litter decomposition and food web studies; and (4) communicating research in the form of peer-reviewed papers and reports in gray literature. Major limitations to the scientific activity included: (1) language, with a majority of respondents considering their handling of English a handicap; (2) limited access to research equipment; (3) lack of tools, such as taxonomic keys; and (4) limited research funding. Research needs and priorities resulted in three major areas in need of attention: (1) developing taxonomy and systematics; (2) improving our current understanding of ecology and natural history; and (3) understanding species distributions and biodiversity patterns. Conclusions: Latin America has an active community of scientists. There is a need to diversify research topics, without abandoning traditional research areas (e.g., taxonomy, species distribution). We advocate for more collaboration among scientists with similar research goals, regardless of their affiliation.

The analysis of gut contents distinguished seven food items, microphytes and MOPF were the most frequent, and through the stable isotopes analysis (δ15N) we identified four trophic levels, among resources (macrophytes and POM), and consumers (detritivores, herbivores, and predators). The two upper trophic levels concentrated greater diversity and biomass. Conclusion: Most of the organisms studied were linked to omnivo-rous habits, evidenced in a wide spectrum of food items in their diet.

This environmental heterogeneity, in turn, influences the assemblage and composition of aquatic communities and produces complex patterns of species diversity at the catchment scale. Objectives: In this contribution, we assessed biodiversity and community composition of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities from 51 stream site types in a glacierised catchment in the tropical Andes. The aim of our study was to: (1) determine diversity, rarity, commonness and spatial distribution patterns of aquatic macroinvertebrate communities from sites with different water sources, and (2) identify which environmental variables influence the density and presence of macroinvertebrate taxa and, in particular, of the subfamilies of the ubiquitous chironomids. Methods: Our study sites were grouped according to their water source and to their percentage of glacier coverage in the catchment (GCC). At each site we sampled aquatic macroinvertebrates, measured environmental variables and assessed community differences and environmental influence with ordination analyses and generalized linear models. Results: Kryal and mixed sites had an important proportion of rare taxa. Mean richness was highest in the mixed sites and lowest in the sites with the highest glacier cover; while sites with an intermediate percentage of glacier cover, had the highest values of α and β diversity. We found that 13 taxa (15.9%) were common to all stream site types. SIMPER analysis showed that Orthocladiinae, Hyalella sp. and Andesiops sp. contributed the most to the dissimilarity between site types (˃ 45% of cumulative contribution). RDA showed that kryal sites were associated with high turbidity and density of Podonomids, and with low temperature, amount of CPOM and densities of both Anomalocosmoecus sp. and Andesiops sp. Orthocladinae was associated with high current velocity and chlorophyll a concentration, whereas Hyalella sp. had a positive relationship with higher pH and streambed stability. Generalized linear models showed that GCC was the main variable explaining all faunal metrics. Current velocity explained macroinvertebrate abundance, water temperature was related to chironomid density and chlorophyll a influenced Orthocladiinae presence-absence. Conclusions: Our results suggest that by favoring the presence of rare taxa and taxa turnover, glacier influence may increase biodiversity in glacierised catchments. In terms of biodiversity conservation, this study confirms an urgent need to increase knowledge of high-Andean stream biodiversity, especially in highly heterogenous glacierised catchments, to better describe regional biodiversity patterns and community composition of these highly vulnerable freshwater ecosystems. Detailed analyses of benthic communities and development of databases are key for conservation strategies.

The physical environment is a key factor, where the substrate and hydraulic dynamics modify the availability of resources, the structuring, the functioning of the community and the ecosystem. Objective: Determine the structure, taxonomic diversity and functional diversity of the macroinvertebrate assemblages under different abiotic conditions in the Hato Laguna river, a tributary of Lake Tota. Methods: 120 biological samples were collected in four sampling events in two reaches in the river. Depth, flow velocity, channel width and roughness of the substrate were measured in situ. The functional traits evaluated were: body length, body shape, type of breathing, type of locomotion, trophic guild and functional feeding groups. Results: A total of 38 taxa were identified; Diptera, Coleoptera and Trichoptera orders presented the highest abundance of families and genera. Orthocladiinae, Andesiops sp. and Simulium sp. were more abundant groups under high-velocity conditions in the upper reaches. Nectopsyche sp. was abundant in the lower sections related to lower velocity and greater channel width. According to the taxonomic diversity indices, variation by reaches and samplings was presented without observing trends. In the upper reaches, the MOPF trophic guild (collectors), in tegument respiration, and small body size were characteristic. In the lower reaches, the assembly was of the scraper type with gill breathing and flattened body shape. The richness, divergence and functional evenness were higher in the upper reaches. In the Canonical Correspondence Analysis, the highest values ​of width and speed were related to categories attached to the substrate and endobenthic, while low width and roughness were related to the categories of flattened body shape, microphytes food resource, and maximum body size. Conclusions: The system presented a variation in the abiotic conditions, in the structure, taxonomic and functional diversity of the macroinvertebrates. The role of the flow velocity as a determining variable of the structure and function of the community is highlighted.

However, the exposure to pollutants could reduce their health and physiological performance, mainly because of low access to light and clogging of stomata by particulate matter. Objective: The accumulation of particulate matter on leaves (PMAL) and physiological traits of five urban tree species (Croton bogotanus Cuatrec., Eugenia myrtifolia Sims., Ficus soatensis Dugand, Schinus mole L., and Sambucus nigra L.) were quantified in sixty points in Bogotá, with the aims to (1) build a model explaining the PMAL based on traffic variables, (2) establishing the effect of vehicle pollution on physiological and phytosanitary variables, and (3) to evaluate the susceptibility of seedlings and trees to vehicle pollution. Methods: The physiological parameters: photochemical efficiency, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content, leaf area, and specific leaf mass were measured and correlated with phytosanitary condition, PMAL and traffic variables: number of lanes, vehicular flow and tree-to-avenue distance. Additionally, tree physiological responses were measured in control, residential streets (RS), low traffic avenues (LTA), and high traffic avenues (HTA), and these last were compared with physiology of seedlings planted by three months in HTA. Results: PMAL was strongly associated with physiological responses. Ficus soatensis and C. bogotanus were the species with the maximum and the minimum PMAL. The exposure to traffic increased the photochemical efficiency and specific leaf mass, which could be related to the enrichment of nitrogen and atmospheric CO2. The stomatal conductance followed a bell pattern of low gas exchange in control sites, high values in RS and LTA, and decreasing again in HTA, which suggests an optimization in CO2 fixation at intermediate levels of pollution and susceptibility to stomatal clogging by extreme vehicle emissions. The chlorophyll a/b ratio, leaf area, and specific leaf mass were significantly related to the severity of leaf symptoms, and S. molle was the species with the healthiest leaves in HTA. Seedlings were more susceptible to pollution than trees, and fruits size and seedlings growth were affected by vehicular pollution. Conclusions: Ficus soatensis optimizes particle filtration and C. bogotanus is ideal for planting in HTA, although only as saplings. By contrast, the fast-growing E. myrtifolia and S. nigra seedlings should not be planted in HTA because of susceptibility of pigment contents, leaf area, and stomatal conductance to pollutants.

Group I present some micro-perforations in the tectum, high density of micro-echinates and high convexity of the proximal face. In contrast to Group I, Group II has their distal face convex with half density of micro-echinates and a plane-subconvex proximal face. Group III is represented by H. latispatha and group IV is represented by H. librata, both groups have small pollen (for the present study). Although, H. latispatha has a verrucae distal face and a plane proximal face, germinating pore that is distinctively protruding, and H. librata has verrucae in both faces. In group V, H. collinsiana has a distinctively protruding germinating pore and a “corrugated circle-shaped” in the proximal face. Among varieties, H. collinsiana is 10 µm higher than H. collinsiana var. velutina in its equatorial plane. Conclusions: Heterogeneity of characteristics allowed pollen groups to be generated; whilst relatively homogeneous characteristics allowed for recognition of species and varieties within the groups. The morphology of the Heliconia species in Mexico confirms the previously described characteristics; however, additional features such as the presence of micropores and the corrugated circle-shaped in the proximal face stand out.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Diversity | Endemic | Heliconia | Neotropical | Palynology,13567,INIFAP,1711533202,"Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales, Agrícolas y Pecuarias",1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,25

Introduction: Historical knowledge of climate is essential to analyze its variability over time, as well as its impact on natural ecosystems and human popula-tions. Objective: To analyze the annual growth of the sabino trees, also known as ahuehuete trees (Taxodium mucronatum) from the Sabinas River to reconstruct the historical variability of precipitation in El Cielo Biosphere Reserve, Tamaulipas, Mexico. Methods: The annual growth of 116 sabino samples was dated to develop a chronology of 544 years (1474-2017). The period that admitted a series of samples suitable for climate analysis extends from 1550 to 2017 (468 years). Results: Based on the analysis of the response function, it was determined that the winter-spring precipitation (November-May) significantly influenced the radial growth of sabinos in the study area (R= 0.77, P < 0.001). The reconstruction recorded high climatic variability at interan-nual and interdecadal levels, in which the presence of droughts was identified at the beginning and end of each century, as well as the presence of extreme cyclical droughts every 50 years.

Objective: To describe the reproductive patterns and population dynamics of seven bat species (Artibeus toltecus, Carollia perspicillata, Glossophaga soricina, Mormoops megalophylla, Pteronotus fulvus, Pteronotus mesoamericanus and Natalus mexicanus) that roost in one mine (La Mina) and two caves (El Apanguito and Cerro Huatulco) in the State of Oaxaca, in Southeastern México. Methods: Sampling was conducted monthly from July 2016 to June 2017. Bats were captured using a harp trap, which was placed at the entrance of the roosts. The captured bats were identified using taxonomic keys, marked with an aluminum ring, sex and age class were also determined. Reproductive activity was modeled through 63 GLMs for each species (504 in total). The best model was selected according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Results: A total of 5 836 bats were captured and marked, classified into 14 species, 10 genera, and five families. The most abundant species were: P. fulvus and P. mesoamericanus, representing 41 % and 32.3 % of the captures, respectively. The mormopids M. megalophylla, P. fulvus, P. mesoamericanus, together with N. mexicanus showed a restricted seasonal monoestrous pattern, while the phyllostomids A. toltecus, C. perspicillata, and G. soricina showed a seasonal bimodal polyoestry pattern. The monthly abundance of species fluctuated significantly (H= 13, df= 11, P= 0.044) in the three roosts throughout the entire study period and the best supported GLM that included the seven species showed that the six chosen variables (season, sex, roost, temperature, precipitation and humidity) were positively associated with reproductive activity.

We applied circular statistics to detect seasonal trends, calculate intraspecific synchrony and identify correlations between phenophases and climatic variables. Results: Flowering and fruiting were significantly seasonal in most species. The flowering and fruiting patterns were annual (e.g. Henriettea seemannii, Ocotea aurantiodora, Schefflera morototoni, Lacistema aggregatum) or sub-annual (e.g. Eugenia cf. egensis, Erythroxylum citrifolium, Miconia minutiflora, M. rubiginosa). The open flower and mature fruit phenophases at the community level were continual and bimodal. Each species had high intraspecific population synchrony of open flowers and ripe fruits. Precipitation, relative humidity, temperature and solar irradiance were correlated to flowering and fruiting peaks, except in E. cf. egensis. Conclusions: The annual species showed high phenological synchrony, although the rainfall regime showed variations between years; thus, they seem to be less sensitive to climatic variation than the sub-annual species.

Objective: To describe and analyze the histopathological and histochemical aspects of Cymbopogon citratus and its relation with the different stages of the spores from the rust fungi Puccinia nakanishikii. Methods: During the months April and August 2013, leaves healthy and infected by Puccinia nakanishikii were collected in the Northwestern scarp of the Bucaramanga-Colombia plateau. The samples with injuries on diverse developmental stages were fixated and processed according to the standard protocols for embedding and sectioning in paraffin and resin. Sections obtained from paraffin (5-7 µm) were stained with Safranin-Alcian blue and Alcian blue-Hematoxylin. On the other hand, sections obtained from resin (0.5 µm) were stained with Toluidine blue. Further, freehand sections were obtained for an autofluorescence analysis. The observations and photographic record were done via photonic microscope and epifluorescence microscope. For the observations via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the samples were fixated in Glutaraldehyde, dehydrated with 2,2 dimethoxypropane, then desiccated to critical point and finally coated with gold. Results: The leaves are generally hypostomatic, with long and short epidermic cell forming parallel rows and showing unicellular prickle trichomes and micro-trichomes. The abaxial surface is covered by epicuticular wax forming a dense layer. The adaxial epidermis is formed by groupings of bulliform cells and epidermal cells with rectangular or squared contour. In the mesophyll, there is no differentiation between palisade and spongy parenchyma, its anatomy reflects the C4 metabolism. The formation of uredosori and teliosori both hypophyllous was observed. Urediniospores are the reinfecting agents phase, they have 4-5 equatorial germ pores and echinulate wall. Teliospores have smooth wall and a persistent pedicel. The urediniospores form a germ tube, generally on the abaxial leaf surface, these tubes develop towards the stomata reaching the mesophyll interior. No appressorium were observed. The epidermis limiting the uredosorus detaches due the development and pressure that exert both the urediniospores and capitate paraphyses. As the infection progresses, autofluorescense of the chlorophyll is lost and the cells undergo necrotic processes. Afterwards, the phloem collapses and the xylem becomes slightly disorganized. At this moment, the infection is extended along the whole leaf blade, resulting in the leaf death and the plant defoliation. On advanced stages of the infection, the uredosori showed pycnidia, probably belonging to the hyperparasite Sphaerellopsis, these structures were closely associated to the rust infected tissues. Conclusions: Puccinia nakanishikii develops on the leaves of Cymbopogon citratus producing uredosori and teliosori. Urediniospores are the reinfective stage, teliospores were only observed at late stages of the infection. The epidermis and photosynthetic tissue are severely affected by cell necrosis.

This is particularly relevant in scarcely studied regions, such as in the Colombian Guiana shield. Objective: To describe the taxonomic and functional structure of macroinvertebrate communities and assess their variability across spatial and temporal scales. Methods: We sampled the invertebrate communities in four streams during the dry seasons of 2017 and 2018. Additionally, we assessed diversity patterns within and among streams and between different sampling months in one stream. To assess diversity patterns, we compared alpha (differences in taxon richness and abundance within communities) and beta (differences in taxon composition among communities) diversity patterns among and within rivers. Alpha diversity was estimated using the numbers of Hill, while beta diversity was estimated using the Sørensen and Morisita-Horn indices and compared using a similarities analysis (ANOSIM). Results: The taxon composition of the communities was different within (mesohabitat scale) and among streams (regional scale). However, the composition of FFGs changed among but not within streams. The comparison of the numbers of Hill and the taxon composition suggested that the mesohabitat type is a determining factor of the taxonomic but not FFG diversity across scales. At the temporal scale, alpha diversity was low for months with high precipitation (February-April) and high for the dry season (January). The temporal beta diversity was high among sampling periods, being nestedness processes driving beta diversity among years and turnover processes driving beta diversity within years. Conclusion: Streams from Serranía de la Lindosa host a high diversity of freshwater macroinvertebrates.

Introduction: Due to its current coverage, the root biomass of tropical pastures is of vital importance for the terrestrial carbon storage, but its estimation has been mainly indirect and with a very wide range of values. Objective: To document at national and global level as well as compare, the root carbon stocks extracted directly from two grasslands of different growth type and origin. Methods: The biomass and root carbon stocks were directly extracted from two tropical pastures with more than 40 yr of age. The biomass and total carbon, one native with stoloniferous growth (Paspalum nota-tum) and one introduced with growth in tillers (Urochloa decumbens) were measured. The study was conducted between August and October 2016. Three plots of 1 600 m2 each were selected per pasture, with 10 sub-squares (4 m2 each) in each plot to determine the floristic composition, aboveground biomass and C. The biomass and root C were estimated by hand in three trenches (1.50 m x 0.50 m x 1.0 m) per plot. The organic carbon content was determined with the ignition method at an average temperature of 550 °C for 3 hours. For the statistical analysis, a two-factor ANOVA was used, where one factor was the treatments that were the type of pasture (2) and the other factor was the section of the grass (above and belowground). Results: The floristic composition of the two types of pasture was different due to its management history. On average, 28.25 Mg ha-1 of total C was estimated for the locality. The native pasture of stoloniferous growth P. notatum yields almost three-fold more biomass (42.5 MgC ha-1) than the introduced with growth in tillers U. decumbens (14 MgC ha-1) due to the radicular storage (38.5 vs. 11.46 MgC ha-1). Seventy-four point five percent of the carbon in P. notatum was located in the radicular part and 25.5 % above-ground, while in U. decumbens 56.5 and 43.5 %, respectively. Conclusions: P. notatum accumulated more total and radicular biomass and carbon than U. decumbens. The best adaptation of the native grass as well as the morphology of its root system may explain this difference. Ninety six percent of the biomass and root C is found in the first 0.50 m depth.

When the plant can associate with more than one ant species, the herbivore evasion strategies may either be species-specific, or flexible enough to successfully deter workers of different ant-plant species. Objectives: We studied the behavior of an herbivore bug (Piezogaster reclusus) on ant-defended acacia trees (Vachellia collinsii), which associates with one of three mutualistic Pseudomyrmex ant species, and report the geographical distribution of the acacia bug species of Costa Rica and Panama. Methods: We tested whether herbivore bugs (1) associate with a particular ant species; (2) use chemical or behavioral strategies to evade the ant workers; (3) adjust the evasion strategy to the ant species living on the acacia tree. We also compared collected acacia bugs with Museum specimens to clarify the identification from Costa Rica and Panama. Results: We found bugs more often on trees with ants, particularly Ps. spinicola, and never on trees with Ps. nigrocinctus. To avoid ant attacks, bugs use evasive behaviors to prevent encounters with the ant workers, that depended on the ant species. Also, indirect evidence of intra and interspecific transfer experiments suggest species-specific chemical camouflage or repellence. We also report an expansion of the Southern limit of Pi. reclusus distribution in Central Panama, and reduced the distribution of Pi. chontalesis to the Chiriquí region. Conclusions: Similar to herbivores specialized on chemically defended plants, herbivores on ant-defended trees could evolve specific mechanisms to deal with the plant defenses.

However, genetic material obtained from specimens deposited in biological collections is not used frequently due to the natural deterioration of the DNA preserved in these specimens. Getting quality genetic material is demanding in terms of time and money. Objective: By using museum material, to identify a mini-barcode sequence that can be used in the taxonomic determination and provides information that allows the estimation of phylogenetic relationships of species of the genus Bombus. Methods: the DNA extraction protocol for museum samples was standardized using the mesothoracic right leg and / or a sample of thoracic muscle of 96 specimens deposited in the LABUN collection between 7 and 38 years ago. Different combinations of oligonucleotides allowed to amplify fragments from 152 to 407 base pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI). Using as a template a group of 31 sequences amplified from recently collected specimens, the fragments obtained from the museum specimens were assembled and analyzed in a phylogenetic framework. Additionally, a haplotype network analysis was performed in order to evaluate in detail the relationships between the resulting mitochondrial haplotypes. Results: The greatest success of DNA extraction was achieved from limb samples deposited since the year 1982 on. Meanwhile, successful amplification of fragments longer than 300 base pairs (bp) was achieved mostly in samples deposited on dates after 1999, which indicates greater integrity of the genetic material recovered from individuals of 19 years of collection and onwards. Although all the fragments evaluated can be used as mini-barcode, only with one primer pair, it was possible to obtain a topology similar to that observed with the complete fragment. A large genetic variation was detected, particularly within the Bombus atratus and B. funebris species, in which a clear phylogeographic structure was revealed. Conclusions: New barcode sequences were obtained through DNA extraction and amplification protocol from museum samples. Furthermore, new information on intraspecific genetic variability was generated, detecting the presence of unique mitochondrial haplotypes that could constitute management units subject of conservation.

Siphonophores are predatory organisms that constitute one of the most abundant groups of the zooplankton biomass. Objective: To analyze the specific composition, abundance and distribution of siphonophores from the upwelling region of the central America. Methods: Samples were obtained during the oceanographic campaign DOMO I, which was carried out during February and March of 1979 by the ‘Laboratorio de Oceanografía Física del Instituto de Ciencias del Mar y Limnología de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)’. The zooplankton samples were collected with a standard CalCoFI net with 0.3 mm mesh, and then analyzed in the laboratory. Results: A total of 30 species were identified, of which 27 belong to the suborder Calycophorae and three to the suborder Physonectae. Eudoxoides mitra, Muggiaea atlantica, Chelophyes contorta and Lensia hotspur were dominant species. C. contorta was observed with a wide distribution in the study area occupying 85% of the stations.

Historical data is important to evaluate changes in ecosystems due to local, regional and global stressors. Objective: To provide information on the presence, depth distributions and lengths of flatfish species collected by trawl nets. Methods: Fish studies were conducted by trawling at four sites along the Pacific coast of Costa Rica by the survey vessels Skimmer (1979-1980), Nishin Maru (1987-1988) and Victor Hensen (1993-1994). The published lists of species were consulted, museum specimens were accessed, and an updated list of flatfish species assembled. Results: A total of 36 species were found over a depth range of 8-359 m. The family Paralichthyidae included 13 species followed by the Cynoglossidae with 12 species, Achiridae with six and Bothidae with five. Thirty-five species were collected at depths from 10-235 m in the Gulf of Nicoya and Golfo Dulce. Monolene asadeae was collected offshore at a depth range of 254-359 m. The Gulf of Nicoya estuary yielded 27 species during the Skimmer expedition over a depth range of 8-60 m, while 31 species were found during the V. Hensen survey at depths from 10-228 m. The V. Hensen survey in Golfo Dulce (20-235 m) collected 19 species, and 17 species in Coronado Bay (21-187 m). Off the Nicoya Peninsula (56-359 m) 13 species were collected by the Nishin Maru shrimp trawler. A total of 21 species (58 %) were found at depths greater than 100 m which were probably exposed to low oxygen concentrations. During the V. Hensen survey Symphurus chabanaudi and S. elongatus were collected more frequently in the Gulf of Nicoya, while S. leei was collected more frequently in Golfo Dulce. Cluster analyses based on presence-absence data for the Gulf of Nicoya and Golfo Dulce revealed low station similarity indicating possible habitat partitioning among spe-cies. The size (Total length) of 33 species measured from both the Gulf of Nicoya and Golfo Dulce ranged from 8 cm (Syacium cf longidorsale, Trinectes xanthurus) to 50 cm (S. ovale). Only 12 species were found with lengths over 20 cm. Data on flatfish landings by the semi-industrial fishing fleet for the period 2000-2016 indicates that this group represents less than 1 % of the total landings (shrimp and bycatch), with a minimum of 365 kg in 2001 and a maximum of 13 414 kg in 2013. Conclusions: The number of flatfish species of the Pacific coast of Costa Rica appears relatively high but comparable to the numbers found in other tropical regions.

Variations in the distribution of aquatic macroinvertebrates due to transitions and variations in physicochemical and hydrological characteristics are unknown in most rivers. Objectives: 1) to study the change in the aquatic macroinvertebrates assemblages in two sites in Naranjo River, during the four hydrological seasons; 2) to determine the relationship between the physicochemical variables, substrate and flow with the assemblages. Methodology: The study was conducted in the Naranjo River, Costa Rica, at two sampling sites during one year, evaluating the four seasons of the year. In each station we measure, values of water velocity and depth, flow rate, dissolved oxygen, pH, conductivity, sulfates, ammonium, nitrate, silicates, phosphates, and substrate were obtained, and a sample of aquatic macroinvertebrates was obtained for each type of microhabitat determined by water velocity. Two-way PERMANOVA was made to determine if there is a difference among aquatic macroinvertebrate abundance, per period and between sites. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to observe the relationship between aquatic macroinvertebrates and environmental factors. Finally, a Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was performed to determine the positive or negative relationship of variables with macroinvertebrates. Results: There was a greater abundance during the dry season, while during the transition from dry to the rainy season, the lowest abundance of organisms was recorded. The CCA indicates that the first axis presented a positive relationship with the silt and sand substrate and a negative relationship for the current velocity and rock substrate variables. The second axis showed a positive relationship with flow and nitrates and negative for the pebble substrate. Most organisms showed a negative response to increased flow and nitrates. Discussion: As flow increases, current velocity increases, and not all organisms recorded in the Naranjo River have the characteristics to survive these conditions. In addition, the depth also increases along with the drag force, causing movement of smaller substrates and removal of organisms. Increased nitrates can lead to a decrease in more sensitive organisms, such as Plecoptera and Ephemeroptera. In spite of the physicochemical and flow variations registered in the Naranjo River, these were not strong enough to vary the assemblages of aquatic macroinvertebrates, so the basin does not have stressful factors that eliminate organisms during one or several months of the year.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Aquatic insects | Aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages | Current velocity | Flow | Substrate,13567,NA,undefined,NA,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,40

While information about urban streams in Latin America is rather limited, streams are expected to experience similar environmental impacts and conservation issues as urban streams in parts of the globe, including habitat loss, channelization, sewage discharge, trash, and loss of riparian habitats. Objective: We surveyed a network of researchers from approximately 80% of the countries in Latin America to obtain information on the condition, state of knowledge, and threats to urban streams in the region. Methods: Most participants were reached via the Macrolatinos@ network (www.macrolatinos.net). Results: We obtained 104 responses from researchers in 18 of the 23 Latin American countries. Most urban streams are impacted or degraded, and inputs of contaminants and wastewater discharges were considered major drivers of stream degradation. Most respondents indicated that stream channelization is common, with some streams completely channelized or buried. Sewage and rainfall runoff management were identified as a major factor degrading streams, with most respondents suggesting that streams are a primary destination for wastewater discharge, much of which is untreated. Major limitations to urban stream conservation in Latin America are the result of limited ecological knowledge, lack of citizen interest or political will to protect them. There are isolated efforts to restore urban streams and riparian zones, but these are initial steps that need further development. Conclusions: Our research network of Latin American scientists proved to be a valuable tool to assess a large number of urban rivers in a relatively understudied region. Urban streams in Latin America face a diversity of stressors and management challenges, and we propose three areas that would benefit from further research to improve our understanding and management of these systems: (1) Studies should focus on the watershed, rather than isolated reaches, (2) researchers should strive to attain a better understanding of ecosystem function and the services provided by urban streams to justify management and restoration efforts, and (3) studies that integrate economic models where downstream users pay for upstream protection and restoration could prove beneficial for many Latin American cities in attempting to address water conservation issues.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Management strategies | Quality conditions | Scientific knowledge | Urban ecosystems | Water manage-ment | Water supply,13567,NSF,1938843,National Science Foundation,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,41

However, they are still poorly understood, especially for tropical montane wet forest species. Objetive: To analyze activity patterns and microhabitat selection on shrubs of the land snail Tikoconus costarricanus, according to season, daytime and weather. Methods: I conducted the study near “El llano” water dam in a tropical montane wet forest in Costa Rica. I observed daily activity of T. costarricanus, during the rainy and the dry season on a 2 km long trail. I observed 167 specimens and made 781 observations in total. I took note of: season, time, activity, weather, temperature and relative humidity inside the forest, and part of the leaf and height where snails were. Active snails had optical tentacles extended. I analysed daily rainfall data from a nearby meteorological station. Results: This species can be found mainly on understory leaves between 1.1 and 2 m above the floor. They are active the day around during the whole year. Only 24 % of the snails were on the upper side of leaves, but 92 % of them were active. The following behaviors were season dependent: activity peaks, leaf side selection according to daytime and weather, quantity of snails aestivating and vertical distribution. During the dry season, I found more active snails in rainy and cloudy days. During the rainy season I found more active snails in sunny days. During rainy season light hours, active snail percentage on the upper side of leaves decreased with rainfall increase, while in the dry season decreased with temperature increase and relative humidity decrease. During night hours of both seasons, the number of snails on the upper side of leaves decreased considerably in relation to active snails, especially in the rainy season. This snail aestivated on the underside of leaves during periods shorter than 21 h, mainly around noon and afternoons during the dry season. High humidity in this forest allowed snail activity around the day at any season. However, this species aestivated when moisture reached the lowest values, mainly, around noon and in the afternoons in the dry season. The rainfall pattern during the rainy season light hours explains the specimen decrease on the upper side of leaves, but in the dry season it is better explained by the temperature increase and the decrease in relative humidity. During dark hours, the almost complete snail absence on the upper side of leaves during the rainy season is explained if the effect of canopy drip produced by rain and dew condensed on leaves is added to the rain pattern. The situation is slightly different in dark hours of the dry season, in this case, snail decrease on the upper side of leaves is explained by canopy drip from dew and fog precipitation. Seasonal difference in vertical distribution may be a way to avoid rain and rain splash out on the soil.

Methods: Gamete bundles from the coral species O. faveolata were collected over two years (2018 and 2019) from Los Corales del Rosario y de San Bernardo Natural National Park, Cartagena, Colombia. Assisted fertilization, larval rearing, settlement (onto crustose coralline algae, CCA) and post settlement survival in laboratory conditions were monitored. Results: Embryonic and larval development were documented over 55 hours after the first cleavage, when larvae were fully developed and started pre-settlement behavior. Settlement began 7 days after first cleavage and after 37 days polyps had acquired zooxanthellae. Larval settlement was higher on Lythophyllum congestum and Titanoderma prototypum than in response to Porolithon pachydermum, Neogoniolithon sp., Hydrolithon sp., and Lythophyllum sp. Larvae did not settle on dead coral or on the negative control (sterilized seawater). After the first week post settlement survival was 59 % amongst O. faveolata recruits. During the second week, survival dropped to 42 %, and was further reduced to 0 % at the end of the third week. Conclusions: O. faveolata larvae require cues from certain CCA species to settle, they do not settle in absence of CCA.

Methods: From April to November 2015, 24 sampling units were established, each of which were 500 m2 in area and had a presence of A. purpurea. At each site, all woody species with a diameter at breast height (dap) ≥ 2.5 cm were measured and identified, and environmental, geographic and climatic information recorded. Information regarding the regeneration of the species was obtained. The structure of A. purpurea was estimated and its relationships with environmental variables examined.

In these watersheds, natural populations are threatened by multiple anthropic interventions such as mining activities and fishing pressure, but also, by increasing impacts of invasive exotic predators. Information related with predation on C. caementarius is scarce representing a major knowledge gap to ensure suitable management and conservation practices. Accordingly, the further deepening in relevant aspects such as the estimation of populations losses due to predators has been indicated as critical by relevant agencies as FAO. Objective: To conduct a complete registry and classification of C. caementarius predators, updating the knowledge for the Andean region. Methods: A thorough bibliographic review on existing information on C. caementarius’ predators from Perú and Chile was carried out calculating percentage of occurrence, relative frequency of species, zoogeographic origin, trophic structure, phenotypic attributes, river zone that inhabits and life stage of incidence. The registry was complemented using semi-structured interviews from prawn´s fishers in central-Northern Chile. Results: C. caementarius is predated along the entire fluvial network (estuary, potamon and rhithron) by 21 species of opportunists, carnivores, omnivores and herbivores, mostly aquatic vertebrates. In turn, these belong to 15 families and six guilds of native, exotic and cosmopolitan species. Approximately 86 % predate on adult prawns, whilst, 71 % on juveniles and 24 % on larvae. More than 40 % of the predation pressure seems to be exerted by native waterfowls and 24 % by exotic fish. Conclusions: The results emphasize the relevance for conservation of native species of predators in the Andean region and the need of control measures on exotic species in a latitudinal basis.

Objective: To report the potential geographic distribution and the environmental variables associated to ecological niches of two subspecies of M. tomentosa (M. tomentosa subsp. tomentosa and M. tomentosa subsp. xanthiifolia) in the Mexican territory. Methods: A database of herbarium records was created, an in situ systematic search of both subspecies was carried out from October 2015 to March 2016, during the flowering-fruiting season. After that, exploratory tours (Guanajuato, Querétaro, Hidalgo, Mexico City, State of Mexico, Puebla, Oaxaca and Chiapas) were realized. A total of 181 individuals were sampled and georeferenced, generating new records for the database upgrading. Three habitat suitability models (M. tomentosa complex, M. tomentosa subsp. tomentosa and M. tomentosa subsp. xanthiifolia) were generated using the MaxEnt software. These software estimates the probability of species distribution using geo-referenced data and environmental characteristics as predictors, through the maximum entropy logarithm and the Bayesian method. Results: From 22 environmental variables used as predictors, five (seasonality of temperature, isothermality, maximum temperature of the warmest month, precipitation of the warmest trimester and precipitation of the wettest trimester) contributed 70.2 % of the total percentage contribution. The model showed a potential distribution of 77 688 km2, approximately 4 % of the Mexican Republic territory. Both subspecies grew between 500 and 2 500 m. They were associated to xerophilous and heliophiles vegetation, sometimes they were located in the periphery or embed in openings of temperate and sub-humid forests too. They were not present dry regions from the North of the country. Conclusions: Temperature seasonality, isothermality and maximum temperature of the warmest month determine the distribution of the species. Precipitation of the warmest quarter and precipitation of wettest quarter defines the habitat between M. tomentosa subsp. tomentosa and M. tomentosa subsp. xanthiifolia. These findings clarify the ecological preferences and delimitation the infraspecific taxa of M. tomentosa.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Ecological niche | Habitat suitability | Heliophile | Infraspecific taxa | MaxEnt | Zoapatle,13567,IPN,undefined,Instituto Politécnico Nacional,0,FALSE,NA,NA,49

Being a hemiepiphyte which initially grows in the shady understory and later climbs to the canopy, it acclimates to different conditions of radiation and humidity. The possibility of extending this crop to dry areas where the incidence of diseases is lower will depend on the response to prolonged periods of drought. Objective: To evaluate the effects of the interaction of radiation and humidity on the parameters of photosynthesis and operation of CAM of vanilla plants, and to determine if the radiation environment could help to moderate the negative effects of drought. Methods: We evaluated well-watered vanilla plants grown for 18 months in relative illumination (RI) of 8, 17, 31 and 67 %, which underwent dehydration for 94 days until reaching critical water content (relative water content, RWC < 50 %) and then rehydration for 22 days; variables evaluated were: CO2 assimilation, titratable acidity, and quantum efficiency of Photosystem II (Fv / Fm). Results: Under intermediate conditions of radiation (17 % and 31 % RI), CO2 assimilation and nocturnal accumulation of organic acids were less affected by water deficit and also showed the best recovery after rehydration. The RWC was most affected by the water available in plant tissue, while Fv / Fm was affected by radiation. The combined effects of water stress and high radiation caused irreversible damage to photosynthesis for the 67 % RI treatment. Conclusions: In vanilla plants, the negative impact of drought on photosynthetic parameters was greater in high radiation; however, in low radiation conditions the susceptibility of plants to drought also increased, as compared to intermediate radiation environments, which were under a mean photon flux density of 340 µmol m-2 s-1 (17 % IR) and 620 µmol m-2 s-1 (31 % IR). These results suggest the potential for growing vanilla in areas with seasonal drought under low-tech production systems, maintaining these radiation conditions.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,CAM | Chlorophyll fluorescence | Orchidaceae | Photosyn-thesis | Relative water content | Titratable acidity | Water deficit,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,50

However, the validity of this ecomorphological rule to small-bodied endotherms across altitudinal gradients is poorly known. Objective: To understand the effects of environmental variation on body size, we assessed whether interspecific variation in body size of small tropical endotherms follows Bergmann’s rule along tropical altitudinal gradients. Methods: We compiled data on elevational ranges and body masses for 133 species of hummingbirds of Colombia. We then assessed the association between body mass and mid-point of the altitudi-nal distribution using phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) analyses under different evolutionary mod-els. Results: We found a decelerating rate of evolution for body size since the Early Burst model of evolution provided a better fit to body mass data. For elevational range, we found a slow and constant rate since Pagel’s lambda model provided a better fit to the mid-point of the altitudinal distribution data. Besides, phylogenetic regression analysis indicated that body mass and the altitudinal range of hummingbirds are associated through the phylogeny, with a positive but slight association (R2= 0.036). Conclusions: We found that body mass and altitude of hummingbirds are positively related, which is in agreement with expectations under Bergmann’s rule. However, this association was weaker than expected for small and non-passerine birds like hummingbirds. Thus, our results suggest that environmental changes across altitudinal gradients do not strongly influence body mass in small tropical endotherms as hummingbirds.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Bergmann’s rule | Body mass | Elevational ranges | Evolutionary models | Hummingbirds | Non-passerine birds | Phylogenetic signal,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,51

While the effects of salinity and temperature on fish abundance spatial and temporal variation have been well documented, research on the influence of substrate characteristics is scarce. Objective: To investigate the correlation of salinity, temperature and sediment characteristics with spatial and temporal variations of the ichthyofauna composition in Barra de Navidad coastal lagoon´s shallow zones. Methods: Samples of ichthyofauna were taken with a beach purse seine along a period of two years in four sites. Water salinity and temperature were measured simultaneously with fish sampling operations. Sediment particle size and organic matter content were determined four times at each site during the sampling period. Multivariate methods were used for data analyses. Results: A total of 13 487 fish pertaining to 69 species were collected, but only five taxa (Eucinostomus currani, Mugil setosus, Anchoa sp., Diapterus brevirostris, Centropomus robalito) made up more than 80 % of the individuals. Significant differences among all sampling sites and between seasons were found for the ichthyofauna composition. Redundancy analysis showed that changes in ichthyofaunal composition were mainly related to the percentage of mud and organic matter in sediments expressing a spatial gradient. The influence of salinity and temperature was also significant, but these variables explained a smaller proportion of the observed variability and were related mainly to seasonal changes. Conclusions: Sediment particle size and organic matter content are the most important abiotic factors influencing spatial changes in shallow water ichthyofaunal composition.

Objectives: To identify taxonomically two luminescent bacteria from Cuban shelf waters, as well as select the culture media that favor their growth and luminescence. Methods: The taxonomic location of the luminescent bacteria was carried out using traditional and molecular methods. Four culture media (LM, Boss, Chalk, ZoBell) were evaluated as a function of specific growth rate (μ) and lumines-cence, using a Genesys 10UV spectrophotometer and a Shimadzu RF-5301pc spectrofluorometer, respectively.

Also to assess the effect of B. bassiana on the aphid Myzus persicae pepper leaf feeding preference and growth. Methods: Three inoculation techniques were evaluated: leaf spraying, seed immersion and root dipping. The pepper plants were inoculated with a conidia suspension adjusted to 1×108 conidia/ml. The presence of B. bassiana in the seedlings was evaluated at 7, 15 and 28 days after inoculation. Results: We found significant statistical differences between inoculation techniques. Foliar spraying showed the highest B. bassiana colonization frequency. The natural endophytes presented higher presence in the treatments in which B. bassiana had a low presence. This might indicate the occurrence of antifungal activity that interferes with the establishment of the entomopathogen in pepper tissues.

Objective: We propose a new approach that uses dead fallen trees (DFTs) to improve AGB estimation. We aim to analyse if the adjustment of allometric models based on DFTs provides a suitable local equation for AGB estimation or helps to validate existing pantropical or regional allometric equations. Methods: The study was carried out at the Dois Irmãos State Park (PEDI), Pernambuco, Northeast Brazil. Along 4 000 m, using the line intersect technique, we sampled 37 recent dead fallen trees ranging from 7.6 to 92.3 cm in diameter and from 8.6 to 29.4 m in height. Nine models were adjusted, and the best equation (local) was compared to regional and pantropical equations. Results: One equation (AGBkg = 1.5292* DBH2.0601*TH-0.2187) produced biomass estimates which did not differ from the observed values (P > 0.05). Differently from the others, this equation overestimated AGB in only 2.8 % and, along with other parameters of analysis (R2adj and Syx %) had the best overall performance. Analysing the performance of the local equation versus available equations for estimating AGB, we found that only the local and the pantropical equations by Pearson et al. (2005) estimated values that were not significantly different from observed values. However, the local equation is more appropri-ate for local estimation of AGB, since it has the lowest RSME and CV. Conclusions: Based on the proposed approach, we were able to offer a local equation for tree AGB estimation based on fallen trees. The DFT method is efficient regarding time and costs, avoiding tree logging in protected forests and helps to guide the choice of a proper equation for forest AGB demands.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Allometric equations | Bole volume | Dead fallen trees | Diameter | Height | Rainforest | Wood density,13567,CAPES,457483/2012-1,Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,56

However, some areas are subject to fishing pressures that could degrade ecosystems. The Gulf of Papagayo comprises protected and unprotected areas with various degrees of impact. Objectives: Our aim was to evaluate the conservation status of fish and invertebrate communities in rocky reefs and sandy areas in two unprotected bays of the Gulf of Papagayo. Methods: The study was conducted at Cabuyal and Zapotillal Bays, south of Santa Rosa National Park. From December 2017 to April 2018, a total of thirty-five transects were done parallel to the coast at 3-10 m depth. We identified fish and invertebrate species and estimated biomass by trophic group in fish, and density in invertebrates. Results: We found a high number of species of fish (81) and invertebrates (70) in rocky reefs, which indicates a biodiverse ecosystem, but few species of fish in sandy areas. Species composition differed between the two bays. Density of juvenile fishes was high in Zapotillal Bay, suggesting that the area could be important for recruitment and breeding. Fish biomass was higher in sandy areas than in rocky reefs and all trophic groups had lower biomass than in other unprotected areas of the region. On average, reef fish biomass was 1.57 ± 0.67 (s.e.) t ha-1, similar to previous reports for Costa Rican North Pacific. By trophic group, piscivorous and planktivorous had the highest biomass in sandy areas and piscivorous and carnivorous in rocky reefs.

Transverse fragments 1 cm thick were fixed in a mixture of formalin, alcohol, and acetic acid. These were subsequently dehydrated using an ethanol series, clarified in Xylene, and finally embedded in Paraplast plus® to obtain 5 µm sections. Schiff’s periodic acid reaction (PAS) was used to detect structural and reserve polysaccharides, Ruthenium Red for pectins, Ponseau S and Lacmoid for callose, ferric chloride for polyphenols, Sudan Black for lipids and Uvitex 2B-Hematoxylin for chitin. The sections were observed using a Nikon 80i eclipse® pho-ton microscope, with Uvitex 2B-Hematoxylin-stained sections examined by epifluorescence using a UV-2A filter. For the observation and description of the samples by scanning electron microscopy, healthy and infected leaves were fixed and dehydrated in 100 % methanol, critical point dried, and coated with gold. Results: H. macrophylla leaves are isobilateral and homobaric, with adaxial and abaxial epidermis of a single cellular layer. The palisade parenchyma consists of a layer of short cells, while the spongy parenchyma forms 6 to 7 cellular layers. All vascular bundles in the leaf blade are closed collaterals. Abundant idioblasts with raphides may be observed in the mesophyll, and starch is the main reserve carbohydrate present in the tissues. The leaves are hypostomatic and exhibit a paracytic pattern of superficial stomata which possess large substomatal cavities. The morphological data observed indicate that the mycopathogen is related to the genus Erysiphe. The epidermal cells affected by the pathogen exhibit thickened walls, granular cytoplasm, and papillae or cell wall appositions in the outer periclinal walls. With the deterioration of the epidermis, the underlying tissues are affected and become necrotic. Histochemical test indicate that infected plants thicken and reinforce their epidermal cell walls with primary wall materials; primarily cutin, pectins, and callose. When stained with Sudan Black, the presence of dark-colored agglomerates in the cytoplasm of epidermal cells may be related to plant defense mechanisms; and those observed in mesophilic cells to the disorganization of membrane systems. Polyphenols accumulate in the cytoplasm of infected epidermal cells. The fungal material present in epidermal tissues was clearly differenti-ated when stained with fluorochrome to detect chitin. Conclusions: Species of the genus Erysiphe are causative agents of powdery mildew in H. macrophylla.

Introduction: Ants are one of the most abundant and diverse taxonomic groups. Their ecological fidelity allows them to carry out indispensable roles for the adequate functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Objective: Evaluate seasonal biodiversity dynamics (richness and abundance) of ant species associated with fragments of forest and the surrounding floodplain savanna at the municipality of Arauca, Colombia. Methods: Ants were collected using three complementary techniques (pitfall, Winkler sac and direct collect), in eight forest fragments where linear transects with seven sampling points were installed. Non-parametric estimators and the complementarity index were used to describe the ant community structure. The climatic seasons (dry and rainy) and environments (floodplain, edge, and forest) were compared using species richness and abundance. The relationship of ant species by each sampling points was evaluated with a non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) and the forest fragment attributes were related to species richness through a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Results: We found 30 496 specimens corresponding to 104 species, 37 genera, and eight subfamilies. The best-represented genera were: Pheidole, Camponotus, Solenopsis, and Dolichoderus. The richness nonparametric estimators showed that the ant community oscillates between 107 and 119 species, no differences were detected in species richness and abundance in terms of the climatic seasons (dry and rainy). There were differences in species richness between floodplain with both edge and forest environments. Ant richness fragments of the forest was related by fragment variables such as area, perimeter, fractal dimension, and compactness index. Conclusions: No differences in species richness and abundance were detected between the dry and rainy seasons, which suggests that the species are permanent residents of the study area. There must be mechanisms that allow these ant species to cope with the rainy season. There was a direct relationship between different forest fragment characteristics and ant species richness.

Objective: To describe the psocid diversity in two Colombian Amazonian localities and provide the first data on their vertical distribution in tropical forests. Methods: Monthly samplings of Psocoptera were conducted during new moon periods, from July 2014 to May 2015. Surveys were carried out in two localities of the Putumayo department, Colombia (Puerto Asís and Mocoa), using LED light traps. Results: During the sampling period, 152 species, in 23 genera and nine families were collected. The richest family was Psocidae, followed by Epipsocidae and Lachesillidae. More than 80 % of the species found are still undescribed, and among the described ones, nine represent new records for Colombia, and are shared with neighboring countries in the Amazon basin. Fourteen (9.2 %) species are shared by the two localities surveyed. Puerto Asís is considerably richer than Mocoa. Vertical stratification of Psocoptera was found in both localities, with the canopy being the most species rich stratum. Conclusion: The relatively high diversity of psocidos found, as well as the high number of new species, is an indicator of the need to continue the exploration of these organisms in the rest of the Colombian territory and Andean countries, especially in the Amazon foothills.

This article was one product of a malacological research carried out during a scientific expedition organized by the ‘Instituto Físico-Geográfico Nacional de Costa Rica’ (IFGN) in 1902 to Cocos Island, at a time when the country claimed its sovereignty both in this territory. Objective: To analyze the contributions of the article “Moluscos de la Isla del Coco” from the Social History of Science approach. Methods: Most of the researches that have applied this approach in Costa Rica analyze processes of institutionalization of scientific disciplines. The methodology used in these works was very useful for the analysis of the Biolley article, together with the information of historical data provided by other texts about Cocos Island and the development of scientific research in Costa Rica from a temporal perspective. In addition, tables were made to synthesize the classification of the species and genera studied by Biolley in Cocos Island to identify their provenance and the habitat in which they lived. Results: This study of Biolley constitutes a text of interest from the point of view of the Social History of Science, due to the descriptions it offers of the physical conditions of the territory of Cocos Island, of the different species of mollusks located in them and to the exchange of information with national and foreign scientists that show the participation of Biolley in scientific networks. Conclusions: The analysis of the information with the Social History of Science approach, concludes that the compilation of the flora and fauna permits a greater knowledge of the natural resources of the explored territories, in order to colonize them and integrate them into the economic dynamics of the Central Valley of Costa Rica.

Methods: Specimens were collected using entomological nets on 2 roundtrip voyages during the months of July and August of 2017 and 2018, respectively. Results: A total of 10 morpho-species were collected corresponding to the orders: Diptera (Ceratopogonidae, Milichiidae, and Nematocera of a non-identified family), Hymenoptera (Chalcidoidea: Agaonidae), Hemiptera (Scutelleridae and Coreidae) and Lepidoptera (Sphingidae).

Although marine protected areas have been established in the Eastern Tropical Pacific with a goal to protect and manage region’s marine biodiversity, not all utilize or enforce a no-take policy, and none are capable of protecting highly mobile species once they move outside of the limit of these areas. Objective: We present the first evidence of shark connectivity between Cocos Island National Park (CINP) and Las Gemelas seamount located in the Seamounts Marine Management Area (SMMA), by a female scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini). Methods: Between May 2015 and May 2016 a scalloped hammerhead shark and a pelagic thresher shark (Alopias pelagicus) were tagged (V16, Vemco Ltd.) and monitored by an array of acoustic receivers installed at CINP and Las Gemelas. We analyzed the acoustic data descriptively and we calculated the residency index (IR). Results: S. lewini performed persistent movements between these two marine protected areas. All detections in Cocos Island occurred during the morning (7:00–12:00 h) and Roca Sucia was the most visited site. The shark shows a low residency (IR=0.02) and intermittent presence in the study area. We recorded the presence of A. pelagicus at Las Gemelas almost one year after it was tagged at the site. Conclusions: The persistent movements of S. lewini between these two pelagic marine protected areas, and the presence of a tagged A. pelagicus at Las Gemelas seamount, suggests that movements between oceanic islands in the region may be more complex than simple “back and forth” movements, with seamounts in between them acting as stepping stones, where they may also stay for periods of time. Our results emphasize the importance of granting greater protection to seamounts and creating connecting swimways to oceanic island hotspots for the conservation of pelagic and highly migratory species. Although the establishment of marine reserves around oceanic islands and seamounts have been proposed as an effective way to conserve and protect marine biodiversity in the high seas, their effectiveness is only partial. This study highlights the importance of studying the spatial dynamics of highly migratory species to help improve the design and efficiency of marine protected areas located in the high seas such as CINP and SMMA.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Alopias pelagicus | Eastern Tropical Pacific | Highly migratory species | Marine Protected Areas | Sphyrna lewini,13567,NA,undefined,Sandler Foundation,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,67

Further, these protected areas face the challenge of protecting highly-mobile pelagic species that move between protected areas in different countries and across fishing zones. In general, the dissociation that commonly exists between academic and conservation groups, which work under different objectives and reward systems, serves as an obstacle for producing the information that is needed by wildlife managers. This limitation is further enhanced in oceanic islands, such as Isla del Coco because of their mere remoteness, a condition that dramatically increases the economic and operational costs for doing research. Objective: To illustrate the challenge of generating useful scientific information for conservation decision making in protected areas, using Isla del Coco National Park in Costa Rica as a case study, and to propose pos-sible solutions. Results: In order to produce the scientific information that these areas require, it is necessary to: i) distinguish between biologically relevant information, and information required for decision-making, ii) generate information about the threats to biodiversity, even in the absence of information about the species themselves, iii) establish clear goals and objectives for monitoring plans, and iv) build strong links between two types of groups: those that work from mainland and those that operate offshore; this includes working alongside fishing vessels. Conclusions: It will be a great challenge to articulate such relationships between groups, but this option seems more viable (in terms of associated logistic and economical costs) than attempting to collect the required data from an isolated academic platform. Also, this articulation appears to be the only way of generating information that is crucial for stock management, such as the accurate characterization of the fishing activity.",1,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Biodiversity threats | Biological monitoring | Conservation politics | Conservation research | Fishing overexploitation | Pelagic species,13567,UCR,undefined,Universidad de Costa Rica,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,69

The first record of fungi was published by Cooke & Bonar (1961), followed by the listings of Fosberg & Klawe (1966), Gómez (1983), and the contributions of Mata (2003) and Mata, Halling, & Mueller (2003). Subsequent to these studies on fungi, Rojas & Stevenson (2008) carried out research on the diversity, ecology and distribution of myxomycetes. Objective: To present a compilation and taxonomic update of the inventory of fungi and myxomycetes that were registered on Cocos Island and to facilitate the knowledge about their diversity on the island. Methods: The list provided here is based on the review of avail-able literature, databases of herbaria and on the determination of the specimens collected recently by several researchers of the Department of Natural History of the National Museum of Costa Rica. Three field trips were made to the island to collect and photograph specimens. These field trips took place between 2016 and 2017, in the months of June, November and December. The names of the species included were adjusted according to the online database Index Fungorum. Results: A total of 648 records distributed in 401 fungi (mainly macrofungi) and 247 myxomycetes were analyzed for Cocos Island. This number of records represent 185 species, of which 139 correspond to fungi and 46 to myxomycetes. The fungi registered were distributed in 85 genera, 46 families (four of them under the term “Incertae sedis”), 21 orders (two of them as “Incertae sedis”) and two divisions (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota); meanwhile, the myxomycetes were classified in 21 genera, 10 families, 5 orders and one division (Myxomycota). The family represented most in Ascomycota was Xylariaceae (8 spp.), followed by Pyronemataceae (3 spp.) and Sarcoscyphaceae (2 spp.). In Basidiomycota, the most diverse families were Omphalotaceae and Polyporaceae (both had 11 spp.), followed by Marasmiaceae (10 spp.), Agaricaceae (8 spp.), Hymenochaetaceae (8 spp.), Mycenaceae (8 spp.), Ganodermataceae (6 spp.) and Meripilaceae (6 spp.). The families with the highest number of species recorded in Myxomycota were Stemonitidaceae (14 spp.), Physaraceae (8 spp.), Trichiaceae (6 spp.), Didymiaceae (5 spp.) and Arcyriaceae (4 spp.). Thirty-four species were recorded for the first time for Cocos Island, the majority of them belonging to fungi (Ascomycota, 8 spp. and Basidiomycota, 21 spp.) and the remaining species (5) to myxomycetes. On the island, some of the species registered are relevant because of their edible or medicinal properties. Photographs of some of the fungi collected on the island are included. Conclusions: The list generated in this study is still preliminary for the fungi and myxomycetes that were registered on Cocos Island due to certain groups such as microfungi being scarcely collected.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Ascomycota | Basidiomycota | Cocos Island | Inventory | Myxomycota | Neotropics,13567,UCR,18-2017-I-ACMC-018,Universidad de Costa Rica,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,74

The present study describes the physical parameters of sea temperature and salinity around Cocos Island and its environment, the ETP, using CTD profiles. Methods: Data were obtained in April 2008, March 2009, April 2010, July 2011 and March 2012 near this island. Latitudinal and longitudinal transects were also done during October 2010 and March 2011 in a broader Costa Rican ETP region. In July 2012, three latitudinal transects were done around Cocos Island. Records were obtained using a CTD, measuring conductivity, temperature and pressure, among other variables. Results: Tropical Surface Water was observed in the upper 50m, showing temperatures above 25°C and salinities below 33psu. Below the surface waters, Subsurface Subtropical Water was detected below a 60m depth, showing temperatures colder than 25°C and salinities around 35psu. The transition between these waters was around 50-60m in depth. Temperature and salinity results were related with the atmosphere conditions observed, in which ETP variability was strongly influenced by the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone migration. Conclusions: This study also showed that reanalysis data from the HYCOM-NCODA general circulation model are comparable and in a good agreement with the CTD profiles. Temperature and salinity HYCOM data also reproduced, in general terms, the main characteristics of CTD data, having some small differences in the deeper levels.

However, in recent decades they have been under siege by degradation processes reducing their coral cover and topographic complexity. The coral-algae competition is an important ecological process in the dynamics of coral reefs thus studying is pivotal for understanding the resilience in these systems. Objective: To determine the effect of herbivory on coral-algae competition under different scenarios (using a combination of descriptive and experimental approaches) and two climatic seasons in Capurganá Bay, Colombian Caribbean, in a marine conservation area (Hope Spot). Methods: Between July 2018 and April 2019, the role of herbivory was evalu-ated, performing an exclusion-no exclusion experiment in 48 coral individuals under different scenarios of interaction between Siderastrea siderea and its surrounding algae (treatments), half of the juvenile corals were covered with 2 400 cm2 metal boxes fixed to the benthos. The treatments consisted of: T1= No manipulation (control), T2= Algae removal, T3= Coral damage, T4= Juveniles in contact with artificial algae, T5= T2 + T3, T6= T2 + T4, T7= T3 + T4 and T8= T2 + T3 + T4. Results: After nine months was found differences between scenarios with and without exclusion (P= 0.006) and the climatic season (P= 0.032), it was found that coral growth was higher when algae were removed in the presence of herbivores (Fisher’s LSD, mean ± SE 9.871 ± 8.298) and the appearance of algae was greater inside the cages than outside them, while the competitive treat-ment did not show growth interference (P= 0.155). Algae colonized juveniles when their tissue was damaged and herbivory was excluded (mean ± SE 9.359 ± 3.901). There were differences in coral growth between seasons, being higher in the dry season (Average 0.0029 ± SD 0.0243 cm2/day) than in the wet season (Average 0.0022 ± SD 0.0161 cm2 /day). Conclusions: The coral growth depended on the presence of herbivores that regulate the growth, reproduction, and survival of algae; currently, this process is being interrupted as a result of overfish-ing in the reef ecosystems. However, some algae could be beneficial for juvenile corals when their abundance is large enough to protect them from fish predation and small enough not to significantly reduce their growth.

The species Atya scabra is occasionally associated with fisheries, especially in Northeast and Northern Brazil. Objective: To determine the population structure, reproductive period, patterns of growth and distribution of size classes among sexes in a population of the prawn A. scabra in the De Contas River, Bahia, Brazil. Methods: Individuals were sampled in a period of one year by passing sieves through marginal vegetation and using dragnets. In the laboratory, we recorded the sex of the individuals and measured them using a pachymeter with 0.001 mm precision. The dimensions measured were CL (carapace length), TL (total length) and CW (carapace width). In order to analyze data, linear models for the relationships CL × CW were constructed and the type of allometry for each sex was determined. Individuals were grouped into size classes of 5 mm intervals. A chi-square test (χ2) was used to test deviation from the 1:1 sex ratio. The proportion of ovigerous females was registered for each month to determine the breeding period. Results: A total of 517 individuals were collected, 328 were males and 186 females of which 169 were ovigerous. Males showed a polymodal distribution in size classes and were significantly larger than females, which presented a unimodal distribution in size classes. The observed growth patterns demonstrated that both sexes present negative allometry. However, sexual dimorphism was detected when comparing the growth parameters. Ovigerous females were sampled the entire year and size-frequency data demonstrated that recruitment also occurs throughout the year, which allowed us to classify their reproduction as continuous. Conclusions: Our data is essential to draw sustainable fishery management strategies.

Objective: We aimed to evaluate the sex ratio, reproductive period and lengths at first maturity for 30 fish species caught in the Verde River, upper Paraná River Basin, Brazil. Methods: Fish were sampled monthly from November 2010 to March 2011 and from October 2011 to February 2012, and sampled quarterly from May to August in 2011 and 2012; totaling 14 samples. Fish were measured and weighed in the laboratory. In addition, gender and gonadal developmental stage were identified macroscopically. Subsequently, the sex ratio was determined and significant differences were tested using the chi-square (χ²) method. The reproductive period was determined with the use of gonadal developmental stages and the gonadosomatic index. Lastly, length at first maturity was estimated only for the species that presented individuals with sufficient immature and mature gonads to adjust the model. Results: Of the captured individuals, 51.5 % were male, and 48.5 % were female. Fifteen species showed significant differences in their sex ratios. The reproductive period for most species occurred from October to February, with reproductive peaks in November, December and January. The length at first maturity was estimated for only five species, including Salminus brasiliensis, a keystone species. Conclusions: The sex ratios revealed that for many species, there is a predominance of males over females, which was not expected for this parameter. The reproductive period follows the same pattern observed in Neotropical fish. However, it is noteworthy that some species are starting their reproduction in August.

Because indices of functional diversity may be directly related with ecosystem services, an assessment of functional diversity can be useful for evaluating ecosystem services provided under agroecological management. Objective: We compared functional diversity of birds found in rice fields under conventional and agroecological management in the rice zone of Santa Fe Province, Argentina. Our objective was to determine whether agroecological management of rice is associated with a higher functional diversity and a different functional composition of birds than conventional management. Methods: We surveyed birds eight times, roughly every 15 days between November 2017 and March 2018, from beginning of sowing to before harvest, in both types of rice fields. Birds were sampled by a combined technique of line transects and point counts at four sites in each type of management. We calculated indices of functional diversity and composition based on morphologic and trophic attributes of birds detected in each type of field. Results: Functional richness, divergence and dispersion were higher under agroecological management. Only differences in functional richness between managements reflected differences in species richness. Community-level weighted means of trait values by sample varied between management types. An insectivorous diet, pursuit as a foraging method, and air and shrubs as foraging substrates were traits best represented under agroecological management.

Demersal zooplankton in coral reefs makes diel migrations at night to avoid predation by fish and corals, increasing abundance and biomass at night. Objectives: To study the composition and variation of the demersal and pelagic zooplankton community at night and to increase the taxonomic knowledge of the benthic copepod fauna over different substrates of a coral reef. Methods: Traps made of plastic, with a 100 μm mesh size collector cup attached, were placed for 12 hours between 5-10 m depth over four substrates: (1) sand, (2) small and (3) big colonies of Porites lobata, and (4) dead and alive corals. Sampling started at dusk (1800 h), and the collector cups were collected and replaced at 2100 and 0000, and the last samples removed at down (0600 h). Results: The highest abundance of zooplankton was capture over P. lobata colonies between 0000 to 0600 h. Copepods (adults, copepodites, and nauplii) dominated the community structure and were more abundant during all the time intervals and substrates. Pelagic copepods were more abundant than the benthic, however, not more diverse.

Isla del Coco National Park is an oceanic island in which a tropical rain forest grows; however, its ecology and the effect of introduced species are poorly understood. Objective: To evaluate the mortality, recruitment, regeneration, and growth of forest canopy species. Methods: We measured 15 permanent sampling plots (PSP), nine in the Premontane Pluvial Rainforest (PPR), and six in the Cloud Forest (CF); trees with DBH > 5 cm (diameter at breast height) were measured. The sampling regeneration was done within every PSP, along two transects of 1 X 50 m. Data analyses were performed using data obtained in 2006 and 2012 as baseline. Results: In the period 2012-2017, the annual mortality rate in the PPR was 5.75 % and for CF 6.31 %. The yearly recruitment rate in the PPR was 5.38 %, and 5.90 % for CF. For the PPR the total registered regeneration was 5 656 individuals and 8 700 for the CF. Sacoglottis hold-ridgei reported the highest mortality and the lowest values of recruitment and regeneration. Forest structure fits the inverted J model for most of the tropical forests. Sacoglottis holdridgei define the forest population structure above DBH > 20 cm. But, diameters under 20 cm are strongly influenced by H. succosa, because it reported the highest abundance of regeneration and recruitment. The annual average increase in diameter between forest was statically different (p = 0.0414; N = 15), 0.36 cm/year in the PPR, and 0.33 cm/year the in CF. Conclusions: The PPR and CF differ in the patterns of mortality, recruitment, and regeneration, confirming the uniqueness of these ecosystems. More successful regeneration of H. succosa will lead to changes in structure and composition of forests, mainly PPR. The changes in forest structure will have a strong impact on epiphytic flora, microclimate conditions, and bird nesting such as Gygis alba (White Tern) due to the loss of mature trees of Sacoglottis.

Introduction: The flora of Isla del Coco has been the subject of various collection studies and publications efforts for more than 300 years. During these years 263 species were registered; however, there have been nomenclature and classification changes, and an increase of known species since the last publication. Objective: To prepare an updated catalog of the vascular plants of Isla del Coco. Methods: The catalog present here is based on the review of herbarium specimens, publications, and plants collected between 2016 and 2017 by the authors. An updated list of plants on the island was prepared. In addition, the estimated richness and the quality of the inventory were determined through biodiversity estimators and the proportion of species according to their form, epiphytic habitat, and origin. Results: 296 species of vascular plants were registered, corresponding to 199 genera and 82 families, which represents about 80% of the expected diversity according to the estimators used (Chao-1 and Clench equation). Of the total, 219 (74%) species are native and 77 (26%) are introduced. Native species include angiosperms (53%), ferns (44%) and lycophytes (3%), and those introduced are represented only by angiosperms. The most diverse families and genera and the most common or abundant species are indicated. From the native flora, 48 spp. (22%) are endemic, and is mainly composed of ferns (58%). The flora has a high proportion of herbaceous species (63%) and a low representation of arborescent species (12%) and vines (8%). There is also a high proportion of epiphytes (20% of the total flora), mostly composed of ferns (69%).

Two or three samples were taken by surface horizontal trawls in each coral reef from 2009 to 2012, using conical zooplankton nets of 200 and 500 µm mesh sizes at different times of the day. Physical and chemical variables were measured before zooplankton sampling. Results: We identified 24 taxonomic groups of macrozooplankton and 22 of mesozooplankton. Copepods were the most abundant taxa (87.1%) of the total abundance of mesozooplankton and macrozooplakton (58.9%); however, chaetognaths (35.6%) exceeded copepods (35.4%) in abundance in macrozooplankton samples during 2011. Mesozooplankton samples showed higher abundance (68753.2±9123.2 ind m-3) and biomass (85.14±11.3 mg DW m-3) than macrozooplankton samples (4454.9±751.0 ind m-3, 22.8±3.8 mg DW m-3). The interannual macrozooplankton community structure did not change significantly (ANOVA, p=0.368), but did change for mesozooplankton (ANOVA, p=0.001). Variations in physical and chemical variables influenced the community structure for both meso and macrozooplankton, increasing or decreasing organism abundance.

Due to its structural characteristics and the conditions of the areas where it develops, it could work as a critical habitat for many animal species. Objective: This work aimed at describing the regional and local diversity of the chiropterofauna inhabiting tintal along different areas in the Southeastern Mexico. Methods: The research was carried out in eight localities with presence of tintal in the states of Campeche and Tabasco, Mexico. In each site, six mist nets were placed during three nights. The observed and expected richness were calculated for each site, as well as the total abundance. Rank-abundance and species accumulation curves were generated. Similarity analyses between localities were performed and correlated with the geographical distance between them. Results: We recorded 25 bat species belonging to five families, where Phyllostomidae was the most represented. Most registered species were insectivorous (44 % of the total), while frugivorous were the most abundant. Frugivorous Artibeus lituratus and A. jamaicensis were the species recorded in a greater number of localities, and Glossophaga soricina was the most abundant. The highest richness of species was registered in Oxpemul (N= 12), while in Las Bodegas we found the lowest (N= 4), although the latter was the third locality with the highest number of individuals. The estimated richness of species for the whole area varied between 29 and 34. The least even assemblages were Las Bodegas and Tres Brazos. The most similar localities in terms of the structure of the assemblages were La Toza and Las Bodegas and, in terms of the species composition, Oxpemul and Atasta. The similarities between the localities were not correlated with geographical proximity. Conclusions: Most of the researched localities were highly anthropized, but the tolerance of several bat species to these landscape modifications has allowed them to make use of such areas. The high abundance of the frugivorous species registered supports that bats may play a key role in the recovery of tree vegetation in altered areas in Southeastern Mexico, and emphasizes the value of the tintal along this area for the conservation of biodiversity.",2,Journal,ar,Article,100,7,7,Chiroptera | Critical habitat | Haematoxylum campechianum | Key species | Logwood | Tintal,13567,NA,undefined,NA,0,FALSE,NA,NA,99

Objective: This study evaluates the toxicity of a chronically-contaminated Gleysol with several concentrations of weathered petroleum hydrocarbons (WPH), collected from La Venta, Tabasco (Mexico), on the growth of Clitoria ternatea and the phytoxicity attenuation due to inoculation of emulsifying bacteria. Methods: Soils with 50 and 150 g WPH kg-1, and control soil with 0.15 g WPH kg-1 (biogenic origin) were utilized, as well as the inoculation of six emulsifying bacteria and their combination (consortium). The WPH-phytotoxicity was evaluated by considering plant height, dry biomass production (root, shoot, and total), leaf area, specific leaf area, and the efficiency of photosystem II (EPSII), after 30 days. Results: WPH did not affect plant height, but soil with 50 g WPH kg-1 diminished root and total dry weight, and leaf area, when compared to both control soil and soil with 150 g WPH kg-1. The strain Sml (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia C10S1) significantly increased shoot and total dry weight, while the strain Ro (Raoultella ornithinolytica C5S3) produced higher specific leaf area relative to uninoculated plants. In control soil, the bacterial consortium stimulated plant height. The strains Sm (Serratia marcescens C11S1) and Sm2 (S. marcescens C7S3) improved plant height and specific leaf area when compared to uninoculated plants in soil with 50 g WPH kg-1. In soil with 150 g WPH kg-1, strains Spa (Stenotrophomonas pavanii C5S3F) and Cfr (Citrobacter freundii C4S3) enhanced root and shoot dry weight, respectively.

Objectives: To describe and ana-lyze the ontogeny of sori, sporangia, receptacular paraphyses and sporogenesis of Phymatosorus scolopendria. Methods: Fertile fronds of P. scolopendria were collected in the campus of the Universidad de Antioquia, Medellín, Colombia, during the months March and May (annual rain season) of 2017. The fertile fronds of the samples at different developmental stages were fixed and processed according to the standard protocols for embedding and sectioning in paraffin and resin. Sections of 0.5 µm obtained in resin were stained with Toluidine blue, which differentially stains primary and secondary walls, highlights the cell nucleus and spo-ropolenin and secondarily stains polyphenols. For detailed descriptions, additional sections were processed with Safranin-Alcian blue, allowing the distinction of components of primary and secondary walls, nuclei, cuticle and polyphenols; Hematoxylin-Alcian blue to enhance nuclei and primary walls and Phloroglucinol-HCl for lignin. Observations and photographic records were done with a photonic microscope. For the observations and descriptions with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the sori were dehydrated with 2,2-dimethoxypropane, critical point dried and coated with gold. Results: The sori are exindusiate, superficial, vascularized and have mixed development; they are associated with uniseriate and multicellular receptacle paraphyses. During the development of the sori, the epidermal cells of the receptacle that will form the sporangia are the first differenti-ated followed by those forming the receptacle paraphyses. The sporangium is leptosporangiate, with long stalks formed by one or two cell rows. The annulus of the sporangia displays secondary walls with U-shaped thicken-ings rich in lignin. The meiosis is simultaneous and the spore tetrads are arranged in a decussate or tetragonal shape. The cellular tapetum is initially unistratified but becomes bistratified after a periclinal division. The cells of the internal strata of the cellular tapetum loose structural integrity giving rise to a plasmodial tapetum that invades the meiotic sporocytes. During the sporoderm development, the sporopollenin-composed exospore is the first formed followed by the endospore, composed by cellulose, pectin and carboxylated polysaccharides; the process ends with the perispore. Polyphenols were mainly detected on vacuoles in cells of the sporangium, paraphysis and receptacle. When the time comes for the spore maturation, the remnants of cellular and the plasmodial tapeta have fully degenerated. Abundant orbicles are seen near the spores in the sporangial cavity. Conclusions: The ontogeny of the sporangia and sporogenesis of P. scolopendria are similar to the previously described for leptosporangiate ferns. Furthermore, in P. scolopendria, the receptacle paraphyses of the sori have a role protecting the sporangium during the early development stages.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Epiphytic fern | Microsoroideae | Sorus | Sporangia development | Ultrastructure,13567,UDES,undefined,Universidad de Santander,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,101

Caper is a plant with medicinal and aromatic properties. Flower buds, root bark, and fruits of the plant are used in folk medicine due to their analgesic, wound healing, cell regeneration, tonic, and diuretic effects. Objective: The aim of this research was to evaluate in vitro (anti-urease, antioxidant, anticholinesterase) and in vivo (anti-inflammatory) biological activities of caper (C. ovata var. canescens). In addition, we aimed to identify its major phenolic compounds using high performance liquid chromatography with a photodiode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and confirmate them using quadrupole time-of-flight liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (Q-TOF-LC/MS). Also, we quantified the concentrations of several trace and major elements in plant samples using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Methods: The antioxidant, anti-urease and anticholinesterase activities of different plant extracts were evaluated using DPPH, FRAP, ABTS/TEAC, Indophenol and Ellman tests. The identification of phenolic compounds and trace element contents was performed using HPLC and Q-TOF-LC/MS and ICP-MS. Results: Soxhlet methanol extract exhibited the strongest anti-urease, antioxidant (ABTS/TEAC) and anticholinesterase activity. Soxhlet and maceration methanol extracts demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory effect in the altered edema size after the second hour of carrageenan injection. The active phenolic compounds in Soxhlet methanol extract were identified as rutin, quercetin-hexoside-hexoside, quercetin-3-O-hexoside and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside. In addition, the average concentrations of vanadium, chromium, manganese, cobalt, copper, nickel, arsenic, selenium, zinc and lead were within the permissible limits defined by WHO for medicinal plants.

Objective: To determine the pollution sensitivity and tolerance of each genus of Elmidae in Colombian streams, and the main factors that influence its presence and taxonomic composition. Methods: Sixty locations between 450 and 4 000 m.a.s.l. were sampled, mainly in the Andean Region of Colombia. Collection was carried out between 2002 and 2013 with 70 non-simultaneous events in five zones. In a 100 m transect, physicochemical, bacteriological and environmental quality information was recorded. Samples of Elmidae were collected with D and Surber nets and determined taxonomically. A Canonical Correspondence Analysis of the Elmidae assembly and environmental data was carried out, significant relationships were confirmed with a Mantel test and a partial Mantel test was carried out including the geographic location as the third matrix. The Pollution (ICO) and Water Quality (ICA-NSF) Indices were calculated, and the occurrence intervals by genus were plotted for environmental variables and indices. Analysis of Variance ANOVA, Student’s t-test and Generalized Linear Models GLM with Poisson distribution, were calculated in order to establish the significance of the results. Results: Twenty-two genera and 15 species were found in the evaluated streams; which represent 78.5 % of known national generic richness.

Previous high-intensity El Niño events (1982-83 and 1997-98) caused high coral mortalities and deterioration of coral reef structures along the Eastern Tropical Pacific, affecting both ecosystem and associated economical activities. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the impact of the most recent El Niño event on coral reefs from Cocos Island and the Pacific coast of southern Costa Rica. Methods: Coral reefs were surveyed before (2013-2014) and after (2016) the disturbance, using underwater visual censuses within belt transects, to quantify the bottom coverage at different depths. Results: In general, average live coral cover decreased 50% after the 2015-2016 El Niño event, with Golfo Dulce being the most affected area with 75% of live coral cover decline. However, in certain localities such as Isla del Coco and Isla del Caño, the effects of El Niño were apparently minimal, since no substantial loss of live coral cover was detected. Differences in the level of deterioration found between coral reefs could be related to several factors, including the age of the protected area, the distance to centers of human population, and the effectiveness in the application of management strategies. Conclusions: The synergistic impact of the 2015-16 El Niño event and other stressors (e.g. illegal fishing and unregulated coastal human development) increased the levels of disturbance on coral reefs, threatening their structure and functioning. It is necessary to strengthen conservation strategies in order to improve the resilience of coral reefs to the impact of natural and anthropogenic disturbances.

Recent genetic analysis of these morphotypes has revealed the monophyly of the I. pricei complex, which indicates Ictalurus sp. from the Culiacán River and San Lorenzo River basins as its nearest genetic relative and recognizes as an evolutionarily significant unit the Culiacán River and San Lorenzo River morphotypes. Objective: To compare the meristic and morphometric characteristics of the catfish of the Culiacán River basin with its nearest genetic relative, the Yaqui catfish, in order to determine the presence of distinctive morphological characters that support genetic evidence previously reported for these morphotypes. Methods: Catfish specimens were collected during various field expeditions (1990-2012) to remote sites of the Sierra Madre Occidental and conducted in the Yaqui River and Culiacán River basins with the purpose of morphological comparison. Forty-five morphological characters (40 morphometric and five meristic) were examined in 76 adult specimens – 52 Ictalurus sp. and 24 Ictalurus pricei. Three groups were subject to a discriminant function analysis (DFA), including two Ictalurus sp. groups from the Humaya River and Tamazula River sub-basins, representing the Culiacán River basin, and one I. pricei group representing the Yaqui River basin. The standardized measurements and meristic data of the catfish morphotypes were compared by means of DFA. Results: The DFA revealed 12 characters to be significantly different (P < 0.01) among the groups compared. The morphological characters separating the Ictalurus sp. (Culiacán River basin) from the Yaqui catfish were associated with lower anal, pelvic and pectoral fin ray numbers, shorter head and predorsal lengths, shorter longest lateral barbel and longest dorsal ray lengths and a narrower premaxilar dentary plate; and finally longer distances in Ictalurus sp. for dorsal-fin origin to last anal-fin ray base and dorsal-fin origin to posterior end of the adipose fin base. The standardized coefficients for canonical variables 1 and 2 accounted for 85.6 % and 14.4 % of the total variation, respectively.

Objectives: To determine fuel load, fire behavior, CO2 emissions, and to get firefighting security issues for jaragua (Hyparrhenia rufa Nees.) grasslands and savannas. Methods: An artificial jaragua grassland and an artificial jaragua savanna were studied at the California and Flores Magón communi-ties, respectively, in La Sepultura Biosphere Reserve. Were measured pre and post-fire fuel loads. Six prescribed burns (three heading and three backing fires) were conducted in each, grassland and savanna, and were measured meteorological as well as fire behavior variables. Emissions were estimated multiplying the consumed fuel load by an emission constant. Results: In the grassland, were obtained the following averages: fuel load, 6.214 t/ ha; residual load, 0.107 t/ha, and CO2 emission, 10.449 t CO2/ha. For the savanna, were recorded 14.119, 2.161 and 20.460 t CO2/ha, respectively, without differences for the pre and post-fire fuel loads between heading and backing fires. For the grassland, the heading fires reached 3.92 m, 1.83 m and 22.3 m/min for flame length, flame depth and fire propagation rate, while for backing fires such values were, respectively: 1.07, 0.23 and 0.67 m/min, with significant differences.

Conclusions: Under the studied environmental conditions, particularly in the savanna, fire behavior is dangerous so a good prescription and more care must be taken for conducting controlled or prescribed burns. For forest fires, direct firefighting by the head of the fire must be avoided, for is too dangerous; instead it is recommended a firefighting by the back of the fire as well as waiting for a backing fire-advance of it after the fire reaches a ridge.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Chiapas | CO 2 | Fire behavior | Fuel consumption | Fuel load | Hyparrhenia rufa | Jaragua grass,13567,NA,undefined,NA,0,FALSE,NA,NA,108

The analysis of endemicity, despite its importance and wide recognition, has not been used as a tool to evaluate Páramo. Objective: Determine whether the neotropical Páramo is one or several biogeographic units. Methods: We included distributional records from Aves, Amphibia, Mammalia, Reptilia, Marchantiophyta, and Spermatophyta. We found 7 025 species with 193 250 suitable occurrences obtained from the GBIF. We used each taxonomic group as an independent partition or as a component of a larger partition, such as total plants (Plants-T: Marchantiophyta + Spermatophyta), or total animals (Animals-T: Aves + Amphibia + Mammalia + Reptilia), or total evidence (Plants-T + Animals-T). In order to identify areas of endemism, we used the opti-mality criterion (NDM/VNDM) with grids of 0.5° or 0.25°. We calculated the intersection among polygons of previous definitions and the areas recovered in our analyses. Results: Both grid sizes, 0.25° and 0.5°, identified areas of endemism in different sectors along the Andean and Central American cordilleras, but only the 0.25° size allowed us to recognize areas/sectors with a higher resolution. We recovered eight areas, which were considered as subprovinces (Santa Marta-Perijá, Mérida, Santanderes-Boyacá, Cundinamarca, Central-Western Cordillera, Northern Ecuador, Central-South Ecuador, and Talamanca). These areas were between 4 and 66 % consistent with previous definitions. Conclusions: Páramo has been considered a single biogeographic unit, however, given our analyses we identified it as a unit composed of eight biogeographic subprovinces, which is consistent with some published studies.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Area of endemism | Biogeographic subprovince | Endemicity analysis | NDM/VNDM | Páramo,13567,UIS,8864,Universidad Industrial de Santander,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,109

They harbor high biodiversity and provide a wide range of ecosystem services; therefore, their conservation is a priority worldwide. Climate warming, as well as land use patterns, are leading to species distribution range shifts. Objective: The objective of this work was to study the current and future potential distribution of a SDTF representative tree species (Anadenanthera colub-rina) in the Argentinian Sub Andean Piedmont nucleus and to assess the effects of land use and climate changes. Methods: Current and future potential distribution was modeled with Maxent, using 49 presence points and 20 variables. Climate change effects were estimated in four different temperature and carbon dioxide concentration scenarios. Land use changes were determined subtracting the deforested area until 2017 to the current and future potential distribution of the species. Results: A. colubrina current distribution represents 18 % of Northwestern Argentina. Land use changes decreased almost 25 % of it and climate change will probably cause a retraction in the East and a slight expansion towards the West and South of the current distribution. The synergistic effect of land use and climate change projected to the worst scenario would reduce 63 % of its current distribution. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate the central role of distribution range studies to assess the effects of anthropic activities. Climate change and land use change would have a negative and synergistic effect on the distribution of A. colubrina. Although a possible expansion of the Sub Andean Piedmont nucleus of SDTF would occur, this expansion may be limited by the Sub Andean mountain range that could act as an orographic barrier.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Climate change | Conservation | Geographic range | Land use change | Species distribution models,13567,UNSa,376/2018,Universidad Nacional de Salta,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,110

The restinga vegetation is associated with the Atlantic rainforest biome and comprises four distinct main formation zones: coastal grasslands, shrublands, open-forests and marsh zones. Especially due to coastal urbanization, this is a threatened ecosystem that, through its different shrub formations, exhibits a unique mosaic as a result of the vegetation distribution in nuclei of different covering, physiognomy and floristic composition. Objective: We aimed to characterize the above and belowground composition of a conserved, non-flooded, open-scrub, nuclei (patches of bushes) formation of restinga in Linhares, ES, southeastern Brazil. Methods: The vegetation survey was conducted using the line intercept method. Diameter and height of the first six nuclei were measured in five transects separated by 50 m, totaling 30 nuclei up to 350 m away from the shore line. The phytosociology and Shannon Index of the aboveground vegetation community were calculated. In the same 30 nuclei, leaf litter and topsoil layer (15 x 15 x 10 cm) samples were collected to survey the viable seed bank, which was later placed in a greenhouse for germination and seedling identification. The Sørensen Similarity index (SSi) was used to compare the floristic composition between the leaf litter and topsoil layer seed banks. Nuclei volume and number of species were calculated as well. Results: In the aboveground vegeta-tion, 54 plant species belonging to 32 families were identified, totaling 1 098 individuals. The nuclei showed a diversity (H’) of 3.08 nats, and an average diameter of 11.5 m (s = 9.1), area of 526.4 m2 (s = 1 081.7), and height of 2.9 m (s = 1.1). Davilla flexuosa, followed by Smilax rufescens, presented the highest IVI (Importance Value Index). A total of 1 839 seedlings from 32 species and 19 families were identified in the seed bank. Enydra sessilis (Asteraceae) had the highest seed density (544), while the family with highest species richness was Cyperaceae. A low similarity between the vegetation surveyed and the seed bank composition was found (only 5 species in common, SSi = 0.10).

The economic cost and impact on the quality of life caused by H. pylori are important. There are several methods to detect the bacteria, but some are invasive, expensive, or both. Objective: We compare an inexpensive serological test based on ELISA for the detection of IgG, using the urea breath test (PYtest) as the reference method. Methods: The area under the ROC curve, sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were calculated. A subset of 45 samples was used for validation of the ELISA test, while the assay was evaluated with 185 additional samples. Results: The cut-off point to discriminate between positive and negative infection status by H. pylori was 0.75, using the optical density ratio of each serum and a positive control. With a higher value of the ratio, the probability of being infected increased. Using this criterion, the test showed a sensitivity of 91.4 % and specificity of 93.7 %. All diagnostic values improved when a gray zone was considered. Conclusion: The serological test developed here is equivalent to the urea breath test.

Can we explain the biodiversity of Papillomaviruses based on this pattern? Objective: To analyse the phylogenetic diversity and phylogeography of most known genotypes and species belonging to Papillomaviridae Family isolated and molecularly characterized by distant latitudinal locations around the world. Methods: We collected 238 gene sequences encoding for the L1 and L2 viral capsid proteins from PaVE database. A geographical heat map based on the PV locations allowed to analyse the distribution and the number of PV species per country. Subsequently, a phylogenetic tree based on concatenated amino acid sequences L1 and L2 was constructed using a combination of Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods with Geneious version 11.2.1 and BEAST version 1.8.4. Statistical analysis with Principal Coordinate Analyses (PCA) using the Jaccard similarity index for presenceabsence were carried out to test the similarity of the groups in the phylogenetic tree based on their viral species, the host and origin country lists. Distance-based redundancy analysis generated an ordination plot of the similarity of viral species list per group of the phylogenetic tree vs. host species per group, the country list per group and the number of samples per group. Finally, the significance of each model was tested by Analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: A clear tendency of most of the papillomavirus (PV) species clustering in the Northern regions appeared. Our phylogenetic analyses largely support the taxonomic division into major papillomavirus genera (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Xi, Upsilon and Chi papillomaviruses), as reported in previous studies. Chelonid PV’s, a papillomavirus in turtles, appeared as the oldest group for all papillomaviruses. Minor inconsistencies were found within some of the major taxonomic groups explained by the exhausted phylogenetic analyses. Due to the different sampling data efforts with little replication in certain groups, hosts and countries, numerical models did not fit to the proposed hypothesis. Conclusions: Phylogeographical analysis allowed determining the global distribution of papillomaviruses species diversity per latitudinal location. As most of the papillomavirus (PV) species were clustered in the Northern regions, this may clearly represent a statistical bias because larger efforts in PV studies have historically been done in the US and Europe. The biogeographical trend of a latitudinal diversity gradient does not apply for papillomaviruses.

Objective: Since there is a need in identifying shade adapted forage grasses for the expanding area under agroforestry/silvipastures, the present investigation took the task of understanding how the morphologically distinct genotypes of guinea grass respond under different shaded intensities. Methods: In the present study, forty-four genotypes related with the shade response were studied in varying shading conditions (pure sunlight, 25, 50 and 75 % shade) created artificially. Results: Based on green and dry matter yields ranking, the genotype IG 01-98 performed the best followed by genotypes IG 01-92, IG 97-5, IG 97-6 and IG 01-89 in decreasing order. Particularly, IG 01-93 was identified as the best performing under 50 % shading conditions. On the other hand, most of the top ranking genotypes performed well both under open and up to 50 % of shade. Morphologically, these genotypes were taller and possessed longer and broader leaves. Under shaded conditions (over 50 %), leaf length and width showed an increasing trend compared to open conditions. Also, chlorophyll content increased with shading intensity.

The subtribe Psittacanthinae contains 14 genera of neotropical mistletoe including Psittacanthus with over 120 species, characterized by large, brightly colored (red, orange, yellow) flowers that are mostly pollinated by hummingbirds. During the 20th century, a number of morphological and embryological studies were conducted mainly on Old World Loranthaceae genera. More recently, attention has been focused on neotropical Psittacanthinae where among the 14 genera, floral anatomy has been examined in only seven. The aim of this study is to describe the floral anatomy of Psittacanthus schiedeanus and compares the results with those derived from related mistletoe, interpreting the variation of the floral characters of the calyculus, nectary, gynoecium and from floral dissections and serial histological sections, detailing the structure of androecium and gynoecium and anthers in the context of the new phylogenetic information. Flowers of P. schiedeanus at different developmental stages were examined using stained serial sections visualized with light microscopy. These flowers have a vascularized, cupular pedicel fused to a bracteole, a non-vascularized calyculus, an annular nectary, a unilocular gynoecium with a single central mamelon and an androecium formed by epipetalous septate stamens. The morphological comparison of pedicel, bracteole and calyculus provides support for the interpretation of the calyculus as a reduced calyx. The annular nectary seems to be a character shared by the entire subtribe Psittacanthinae, which distinguishes it from Ligarinae which has stylar nectary. The unilocular gynoecium formed by a single central structure is a character shared with other genera in Psittacanthinae except Tripodanthus.

They inhabit mainly permanent lagoons and flood areas to the basins of the Amazon and Orinoco rivers. This specie has been reproduced in captivity. However, information concerning the effects of feeding on the productive performance of the specie under culture conditions is very scarce or null. Objective: To evaluate the protein requirement of juveniles M. orinocensis. Methods: We used 425 M. orinocensis fingerlings with a mean weight 0.5 ± 0.1 g and mean length 2.7 ± 0.3 cm, which were randomly distributed in seven treatments with three replications for each, in a closed recirculation system with constant aeration and fed until apparent satiety, two times a day for 60 days. Seven diets were formulated varying the protein level (20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40 and 44 % PB). The following parameters were evaluated: weight gain, feed intake, length increase, apparent feed conversion rate, specific growth rate, protein assimilation efficiency and survival rate. The protein requirement was estimated, using the weight gain, by second-order polynomial regression analysis. Results: The growth data show a gradual increase in the weight gain in relation to the protein level in the diet, until maximum gain of 2.56 g in the fish fed with 32 % PB. The apparent food conversion showed a progressive decrease as the protein level was increased, being for 20 %, 2.9 and for 40 % 1.9. Conclusions: Considering the results of weight gain, the optimal crude protein requirement for M. orinocensis is 34.3 %.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Aquaculture | Dollar fish | Feeding | Nutrition | Ornamental fish,13567,UNILLANOS,undefined,Universidad de los Llanos,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,122

Previous studies on floral anatomy and development in this tribe have concentrated on the highly diversified subtribe Psittacanthinae, while the smaller subtribe Ligarineae has received less attention. A detailed anatomical description of Tristerix longebracteatus helps to fill this information gap. Objetive: The present research analyzes the anatomy of Tristerix longebracteatus flowers, detailing the structure of androecium and gynoecium, including megasporogenesis and microsporogenesis. Methodology: Anatomical serial sections of flowers at different stages of development were prepared, following processing with fixation techniques, incorporation in paraffin, microtome sectioning and staining with Astra-blue and basic fuchsin. Results: The large-sized flowers of Tristerix longebracteatus present a complex pattern of vasculariza-tion with 18-20 vascular bundles at the base of the inferior ovary. A group of three vascular bundles irrigate the 4-5 petals and associated stamens, and ten bundles continue through the gynoecium. The androecium is composed of four or five anthers with simultaneous microsporogenesis. The gynoecium as a single ovarian cavity with a central mamelon in which the archesporial tissue is oriented towards the style. The base of the style forms a nectary similar to that found in the sister genus Ligaria. Conclusions: The gynoecium with a single ovarian cavity and central mamelon is a condition shared by Tristerix (subtribe Ligarinae) and all the genera of the subtribe Psittacanthinae, except Tripodanthus. The base of the style forms a nectary similar to that found in the sister genus Ligaria.

Objective: in the current paper we describe spatial and temporal variations in two spectral vegetation indexes in four near-city mangroves at Havana, Cuba and compare them to a natural control site. Methods: Study was conducted in localities named: Bajo de Santa Ana, Cojímar, Rincón de Guanabo, and El Cobre – Itabo lagoon and as control site was selected northern Zapata swamp. By using Climate Engine platform we extract, from 2 460 Landsat satellite images, mean values of spectral indexes NDVI and EVI in 5 parcels per locality, from 1984 to 2019. Variables were statistically compared among localities and the global trend was described. Results: We detect geographic differences in both indexes, which can be related to structural properties and conservation degree of mangroves in each locality. Global trend of indexes was to increase, but differently among localities. Slighter changes appear in the control site and, among near city mangroves, in Rincón de Guanabo and Cojímar. The ordering of localities from spectral variables was consistent with the ranking in general conservation degree. Conclusions: Spectral responses describe uniquely each mangrove forest, in concordance to each ecological and conservation characteristics.

Because of the harmful effects of pesticides on human and environmental health, and the possibility that pests become resistant to these substances, alternatives compatible with the environment, as potential biological controllers, have been investigated to complement the effect of agrochemicals. The entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) of genera Heterorhabditis and Steinernema have become a focus of study in the field of biological control because of their symbiotic relation with bacteria of genera Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus, which are a complex capable of eliminating host insects in hours. Objective: The objective was to determine the presence of EPN of genera Heterorhabditis and Steinernema in soil samples taken from banana plantations in the Caribbean region of Costa Rica, and to characterize their habitat. Methods: Sampling points were selected within the plantations and surrounding areas; physicochemical and microbiological analyses were undertaken (pH, acidity, organic matter, Ca, K, Mg, P, Fe, Cu, Zn, Mn, texture, biomass and microbial respiration of the soil, EPN isolation). Variables were analyzed statistically to determine differences between them, in sampling sites, and samples with presence and absence of EPN. A principal-component analysis (PCA) was undertaken using the variables of greater influence in both categories to find their combinations that would explain their presence according to habitat conditions. A discriminant analysis was undertaken to determine the efficiency of the variables selected in the diagnosis of nematode occurrence. Results: The variables related to the presence of EPN were shown to correspond to organic matter, carbon biomass and microbial respiration. Of the samples 38.4 % were found to be positive with respect to the presence of EPN, of which 95 % correspond to genus Steinernema and the remaining 5 % to Heterorhabditis. According to the quadratic discriminant equation, from 81.2 % of the samples without nematodes, six belong to the group with their presence, whereas for those with EPN, 55.0 % (nine of 20) belong to the absence group. Conclusions: No statistical difference was found between the selected sampling habitats (P = 0.4296); the three variables mentioned above were thus determined have an influence on the presence of EPN; their large values indicate favorable conditions for their persistence.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Banano | Cosmopolites sordidus | Heterorhabditis | Steinernema,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,127

The impacts of invasive species have serious economic implications since the presence of this type of species can result in a decrease in ecosystem services granted to humans. In marine systems, some human activities such as maritime transport and aquaculture have favored the dispersion of invasive species, especially those with commercial importance. This paper describes the potential distribution of the tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon, an invasive species along the American Atlantic coast. Objective: To describe a potential distribution model of Penaeus monodon in the American Atlantic region and compare the environmental characteristics of this region with those of the Indo-Pacific original niche conditions. Methods: Using geographic and environmental data, we constructed and tested three models to determine the efficiency of MaxEnt v. 3.3 software in predicting new areas for the distribution of this invasive shrimp species. Geographic data were downloaded from such web sites as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System, and the United States Geological Survey, as well from literature. Environmental data were downloaded from Bio-Oracle v2.0 data base. The three tested models were: 1) the first was created using only recordings of Penaeus monodon from the Indo-Pacific (its origin zone) and then projected to the Atlantic (native model); 2) the second was built using only recordings from the invaded area; the training and projection area of this model was the Atlantic (invasive model); 3) the third included recordings from both the Indo-Pacific and Atlantic regions, and the model was trained and projected jointly in both areas (complete model). We extracted the values of the three models for each tiger shrimp sightings in the invaded area; sightings with values ≥ 0.5 were considered as valid prediction of occurrence of the species. Results: We found that the following variables explained 80 % of species distribution: phosphates from the ocean surface, coastal type, chlorophyll a, and maximum bottom temperature. In terms of the models’ ability to predict the occurrences reported in the Atlantic, results were as follows: Native model had a prediction index of 40 %; Invasive model was able to predict 81 % of recordings; and complete model predicted 92 % of total occurrences reported in the invaded area. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that based on the complete model, the countries where the tiger shrimp could establish itself are Mexico and Cuba.

They are related to anthropic actions and natural processes with interspecific interactions involving physical-chemical and environmental variables. Objective: In this research, the seasonality of carbon dioxide emissions related to different strata of mangrove vegetation, soil physical-chemical makeup and physical environmental factors were evaluated. Methods: Nine plots of 20 x 20 m were demarcated (three for each of the three vegetation strata) in the Experimental Site of the Federal Rural University of the Amazon and the Federal University of Pará in Cuiarana, Salinópolis, Pará, Brazil. Duplicate soil samples were taken from each plot during three consecutive seasonal periods and analyzed in the laboratory. Carbon dioxide emissions were monitored for 88 days through the basal breathing of the soil methodology; other variables evaluated were soil moisture and temperature, hydrogenic potential, redox potential, carbon and nitrogen of the microbial biomass, organic matter and composition of sand, silt and clay. Precipitation data was obtained from the CMORPH technique of the Climate Forecast Center-NOAA. Information on tides was obtained from the Brazilian Navy’s Fundeadouro de Salinópolis. Results: The results showed that the highest carbon dioxide emissions occurred in the rainy season 2017 on average 7.5 (14.5 TCO2 ha/year) mg/100 cm3. With 10.5 mg/100 cm3 (21 TCO2 ha/year), the adult stratum was the largest source of emissions. The highest seasonal correlations of the emissions in relation to the incubation intervals occurred in the rainy season, in the adult stratum the days 1,2,3,4,3,3 and 5. Using principal component analysis (PCA) it was found that the highest correlations of carbon dioxide emissions and physical-chemical variables occurred in the adult stratum with 56 % variance.

Changes in land use result in negative impacts on the ecosystem, affecting the functioning of stream communities. Objective: To compare the benthic macroinvertebrate community richness, abundances and compositions in streams of three South Brazilian grassland landscapes and correlate community patterns with environmental and spatial variables. Methods: Fifteen streams along riparian forests were selected in three landscapes (mean geographical distance of 285.1 km) inserted in the Paraná and Uruguai river basins. Of the three landscapes, two are inserted in conservation units (State Park of Guartelá and Palmas Wildlife Refuge). Invertebrates were collected in 20 kick net points along 150 m of the streams between June and November 2015. Invertebrates were sorted in the laboratory with three sieves and were identified to the lowest taxonomic level possible. The taxa were classified in functional feeding groups of shredders/detritivores, predators, scrapers, collectors/filters and gatherers/collectors. For each stream, we measured the environmental variables width and velocity, pH, dissolved oxygen, and temperature; and the relative cover of forest, grassland, plantation and silviculture in the catchments. Results: We found a total of 1 058 individuals, divided in 53 morphospecies and 34 families. Lower abundance of benthic macroinvertebrates was found in the northernmost landscape with higher temperature, and forest in the catchment. These streams were described mainly by predator groups, while streams inserted in the other two landscapes showed a more diverse guild composition of shredders/detritivores, gatherers/collectors, collectors/filterers, and scrapers. Geographical distance was the main factor influencing differences in community compositions among landscapes. Conclusions: Lower abundance of the northernmost landscape may be explained by (i) the low habitat heterogeneity due to dominance of sandy substrates, and by (ii) the anthropogenic land use of agriculture and extensive cattle breeding in the region that is ongoing and started before the creation of the conservation unit.

Objective: To describe the nature of the symbioses, the morphological adaptations of the members, and the possible ecological advantages of the symbiotic life versus the free-living forms. Methods: Plankton samples were collected from Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas, and the South Atlantic Ocean. Consortia were examined during laboratory incubations, including studies of the motility and the feeding currents by high-speed video recordings, and culture tests of the species as symbiotic or free-living forms. Results: The consortia of the diatoms Chaetoceros dadayi and C. tetrastichon with the tintinnid Eutintinnus spp., and C. coarctatus with the peritrich ciliate Vorticella oceanica are examples of an obligate mutualism. The cultures of the host diatoms as free-living organism were unsuccessful. The consortia between Eutintinnus lususundae and the diatoms Chaetoceros peruvianus, Hemiaulus hauckii, H. membranaceus, and Thalassionema sp. are facultative symbioses. These are examples of three or four partner consortia because Hemiaulus spp. is the host of the diazotrophic cyanobacteria Richelia intracellularis. Other example of facultative three partner consortium is the peritrich ciliate Zoothamnium pelagicum with an ectobiont bacteria, and the diatom Licmophora sp. The barrel-shaped chains of the diatom Fragilariopsis dolious encircled the lorica of Salpingella spp., while these chains were almost flat in the free-living stage. The peritrich ciliate Pseudovorticella coscinodisci lives on large pelagic diatoms such as Coscinodiscus and Palmerina. These symbioses are facultative for the diatoms, but they extended their survival under unfavorable conditions. High-speed video recordings of the consortium of Vorticella oceanica and Chaetoceros coarctatus revealed that during the stalk contraction the zooid of reached 5 400 body length s-1, being the fastest organism with respect to its size. The consortia of Chaetoceros densus and an undescribed species of Vorticella is re-discovered. Conclusions: These symbioses have allowed that the sessile peritric ciliates colonize the pelagic environment and the proliferation of diatoms with a polar origin in the tropical sea.",0,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Commensalism | Epibiotic consortia | Peritrich ciliate | Phoresy epibiosis | Plankton | Tintinnid,13567,NA,undefined,NA,1,TRUE,NA,NA,134

It is a pioneer species usually found within disturbed habitats with high ecological relevance because of its allelopathic properties, its resistance to fire and drought conditions. Objective: Provide an integrative description regarding P. aquilinum spores shape and ornamentation, and also on gametophyte morphogenesis, including the type of germination and the prothallic development (highlighting its morphology). Furthermore, the anatomy of young sporophyte grown under in vitro conditions was described. Methods: We used scanning electron microscopy and histological paraffin technique to describe the gametophytic and sporophytic phases. Results: The evaluation of the spores showed the presence of globular morphology and triletes with granulated ornamentation; while their germination was Vittaria-type, the prothallic development corresponded to the Adiantum-type. The antheridia were observed 13 days following to the sowing, whereas archegonia arose at day 17. The first leaf of the sporophyte appeared between days 60 and 70. At fourth month, the in vitro grown sporophyte showed the typical anatomy of the individuals of the species at this age, since it did not exhibit vitrification. The histological analysis of rhizome, the petiole base, first order rachis and lamina showed the three tissue systems well differentiated. The anatomical modifications observed in vitro, such as a non-polycyclic dictyostele and just one band sclerenchyma in the rhizome, may be attributed to the individuals age. Moreover, the stomata are present on the adaxial surface of lamina, corresponding to the anomocytic type. Although these stomata were developed under in vitro conditions, it is important to highlight that they are completely functional.

Recent studies have discovered problems in species classification: they have questioned the accepted genera and the actual number of species. This is true in Costa Rica, where several unidentified species have been reported. Objective: The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the occurrence of the accepted genera in this country, and to describe a new genus and species from Central America. Methods: In 2017, we collected one onychophoran in the Keköldi Indigenous Reserve in Talamanca, Limón, Costa Rica. The specimen gave birth to several offspring. Therefore, seven organisms were analyzed. Light microscopy was used to observe the gross morphology in all samples. The detailed morphology was studied in the biggest specimen with scanning electron microscopy; after that, we performed a phylogenetic analysis with the corresponding sequence of COI. Results: According to our results, a new genus and species of giant onychophoran was found. The genus was identified by its giant size, apical piece of seven scale ranks, large conical primary papillae, dorso-median furrow flanked by two-three accessory papillae, the absence of hyaline organs and a marked sexual dimorphism with respect to the number of legs. The new species presents a particular head pattern, as well as novel structures like cephalic papillae, accessory papillae with rudimentary apical pieces, and a lack of antennal chemoreceptors. Phylogenetic analysis rendered our genus as monophyletic and includes Peripatus solorzanoi, which is grouped within the Central American clade. As our species is clustered inside the Costa Rica-Panamanian group, it is not related to the Caribbean Island nor Guyanan Shield samples, home of Epiperipatus and Peripatus respectively. Therefore, we suggest that those genera do not occur in Central America, and a new genus exists: Mongeperipatus, gen. nov.

Objective: To characterize the hydroperiod and physicochemical variables of water and soil and their effect on the distribution of vegetation in the Sistema de Humedales El Castaño. Methods: A total of 11 permanent sampling units (UM) were established by defined strata: five in the mangrove, two in swamp forest, two in freshwater marshes and two in the flooded pasture. From May 2016 to October 2017 the vegetation was characterized and the water levels and physicochemical parameters (superficial, interstitial and groundwater) were sampled monthly for: salinity, and pH; and the soil for: bulk density, humidity percentage, and redox potential. Results: Mangroves are the closest to the sea, have the lowest diversity (H: 1.66) and species richness (14), they are dominated by Laguncularia racemosa and Rhizophora mangle, have the highest values of interstitial and groundwater salinity, (> 10.8 ups), remain flooded for 4 to 12 months per year, and have a redox potential of 14.57 mV. Immediately, inland, there are remnants of the swamp forests (H: 2.18 and 18 species), dominated by Pachira aquatica, with 5 ups interstitial and groundwater salinity, flooded from 0 to 6 months per year, with a redox potential of 119.07 mV. These forests are followed inland by freshwater marshes (H: 1.92 and 16 species), dominated by Typha domingensis with 6.1 ups interstitial and groundwater salinity, flooded for 5 to 8 months per year and a redox potential of 125.9 mV. Finally, furthest inland is the flooded pasture, a modified herbaceous wetland for cattle grazing (H: 3.44 and 50 species) dominated by Paspalum conjugatum, where interstitial and groundwater salinity is less than 0.5 ups, it stays flooded for 5 to 9 months and the redox potential is 151.23 mV. Conclusions: In each type of vegetation, the structure, composition, and diversity are different, with a high turnover of species that indicates a gradient defined by salinity. The vegetation in the SHC follows the patterns of typical organization of the tropical coastal wetlands, mangroves, swamp forests and herbaceous wetlands, in this case the freshwater marshes and flooded pastures.

Objective: Estimate the age (Et) from the ‘step time’ (Tp) method and calculate the absolute (TCA) and relative (TCR) growth rates for Swietenia macrophylla in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Methods: Equations were adjusted to calculate TCA and TCR with periodic re-measured for 15 years of the normal diameter (d) in 403 S. macrophylla trees in Felipe Carrillo Puerto, Quintana Roo, Mexico. Tp and Et were determined for the calculation of the annual current increase (ICA) and average annual increase (IMA), to define the commercial and technical shifts. Results: The maximum TCR was reached at 28 cm of d (0.015 cm year-1) (thinning application), whereas the highest TCA (0.69 cm year-1) and lower Tp (3.5 years) at 55 cm of d (commercial shift). The maximum ICA when considering Et was 1.43 cm in the 50 cm of diametric category with an IMA of 0.67 cm year-1 at an age of 75 years, while the technical shift (ICA = IMA) was reached at 96 years (increments of 0.78 cm year-1).

Additionally, relative warp analysis, based on 9 landmarks in ventral view of the shell, was performed using 80 specimens of 9 localities from Bolivia and Argentina. Results: According to our results, geometric morphometrics is a suitable method to evaluate differences in shell shape among localities; for instance, distinctions in the shell were noticeable between gastropods of low and high altitudes. On the other hand, it was established that the coloration of this species is independent of large-scale factors since the examined specimens came from environments with similar conditions. Furthermore, the sculpture of the protoconch and anatomy of B. torallyi coincided with the other Argentinian species of the genus.

In addition, these zones are places of great biological diversity. The objective of the present study was to determine the community structure of the aquatic macroinvertebrates in relation to the spatial variations in the littoral zone of the Santa Rosa coastal wetland in Lima, Peru. The study was carried out during six bimonthly periods from August 2015 to June 2016. We established eight sampling sites: three sites in the main lagoon, three sites in the lagoon arm and two sites in isolated small pools. We carried out the sampling with a D-frame of 250 μm mesh aperture with three replicates for each site. The eight evaluated sites were environmentally characterized, and the physicochemical parameters of the water were recorded for each sampling site. We collected 28 655 macroinvertebrates distributed in 76 genera. Diptera and Coleoptera were the orders with the greatest richness: 24 and 19 genera respectively. The most abundant genera were: Buenoa (Hemiptera: Notonectidae), Ischnura (Odonata: Coenagrionidae), Chironomus and Goeldichironomus (Diptera: Chironomidae); these four represented 62.43 % of the total abundance. In the spatial variation, most sites shared the same structure and composition of macroinvertebrates. This was expected because they are connected to the main water body temporarily or permanently, which consequently gives them greater stability and resilience. The sites with shallow depth, smaller extension, scarce aquatic vegetation and greater anthropogenic impact were the only ones with results separated from the general set. Due to the variety of environmental impacts produced by agriculture, livestock, and urban activity on the wetland, it was observed that the sites with deeper and more abundant vegetation were more resilient than the areas exposed to environmental impacts and with less water and vegetation. On the other hand, the physicochemical parameters of water at one site (E1) differentiate the community in the absence of impact.",3,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Aquatic insects | Coastal wetlands | Diversity | Environmental integrity | Peruvian desert,13567,UNMSM,undefined,Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,141

Oaxaca is one of the most diverse states in Mexico for many groups including Lepidoptera and most of its diversity is unknown. Objective: to estimate and describe the species richness and diversity of Papilionidae and Pieridae along an altitudinal gradient and five vegetation types in the Loxicha Region, Oaxaca, Sierra Madre del Sur. Methods: Sampling effort comprised 222 collecting days during a period of seven years. We estimated the alpha diversity for 17 sites within an elevational gradient from 80 to 2 850 m, with five vegetation types: tropical deciduous forest (TDF), tropical sub-deciduous forest (TSDF), cloud forest (low and middle levels) (CF), oak-pine and cloud forest (high level) (OPCF) and oak-pine forest (OPF). Results: We obtained a list of 69 species (27 Papilionidae and 42 Pieridae), of 34 genera and five subfamilies, from literature records and fieldwork. These species are 60 % of the Pieridae and 48 % of the Papilionidae recorded for the state. The Loxicha Region has 36 % of the Pieridae and 30 % of the Papilionidae of Mexico. Both families present different species richness patterns by vegetation type. Papilionidae is richer in the TDF with 23 estimated species and most of the species of this family (84 %) occur below 500 m. Meanwhile, species richness of Pieridae has non-significant differences among vegetations types, except for OPF which has fewer species than the other types.

The visceral cavity of teleostean fishes contains the kidneys, digestive tube and annexed glands, gas bladder, gonads, and spleen. Objective: To analyze and describe the anatomic relationships of the organs of the visceral cavity of the Mexican mojarra, Eugerres mexicanus. Methods: By means of dissections, we analyzed, described and illustrated the splanchnology of the visceral cavity of 10 adult specimens from the State of Chiapas, Mexico. Results: The visceral cavity is delimited by the precaudal vertebrae, the scapular and pelvic girdles, the pleural ribs, the first anal pterygiophore and several myotomes. Both kidneys, with extra-peritoneal character are partially fused to each other, and contact the neurocranium, the precaudal vertebrae, and the gas bladder.

Objective: To investigate if snake populations in Drake Bay are decreasing, and if there is a relationship with prey, time, temperature, rain and moonlight. Methods: We counted snakes seen per hour when walking along a single trail in the coastal forest of Drake Bay, Costa Rica. We walked the trail at night for a total of 842 nights (over 4 000 hours of observations), from 2012 through 2017 and recorded all the individual snakes we could see with head flashlights. We used ANOVA tests to check correlations among counts per hour with moonlight and rain; and graphic analysis for associations with diet, temperature, month and year. Results: We recorded 25 species (five families); which feed mostly on terrestrial vertebrates. Counts per hour have fallen over the years, especially for species that prey on amphibians and reptiles; Mastigodryas melanolomus has remained in similar numbers; and Siphlophis compressus has not been seen since May 2016. Temperature is relatively constant along the year in Drake, but month strongly affected the counts, which increased from August to September. Most species were seen more often in rainy nights (0.11 per hour versus only 0.03 per hour in nights without rain, ANOVA P < 0.05); we saw less Leptodeira septentrionalis on bright nights (0.12 per hour, versus 0.21 per hour in dark nights; ANOVA, P = 0.01), but all other species were unaffected by moonlight (ANOVA, P > 0.05). Conclusion: Night field counts of snakes in Drake Bay, Costa Rica, are not strongly affected by light or temperature, but are lower when there is no rain and show a strong decline from 2012 through 2017, particularly for species that feed on amphibians and reptiles.
