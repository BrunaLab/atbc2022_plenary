During the second half of 1983, 53 cases of gastric carcinoma were diagnosed at the Department of Pathology of Hospital Mexico, of which six were studied ultrastructurally. A pattern similar to that of intestinal epithelium was found in cases of intestinal metaplasia. Well differentiated adenocarcinomas showed marked tumor cell proliferation with irregular ""projections"". In poorly differentiated carcinomas, changes were limited to areas where tumor cells invaded the epithelial surface. In summary, scanning electron microscopy is of great help in research and diagnosis of pathologic changes occurring in mucosal surfaces.",0,3423334,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,2

The venom induced myonecrosis, and a prominent decrease in muscle levels of creatine kinase (CK) as early as 3 hr after envenomation. Inflammatory infiltrate was scarce by 6 hr. but increased markedly at 24, 48 and 72 hr. Samples of infiltrate obtained at 6 and 24 hr contained polymorphonuclear leucocytes as the predominant cell type, whereas at 48 hr and 72 hr the relative number of macrophages increased. Inflammatory cells were located within necrotic muscle cells, as well as in the interstitial space, but there were some necrotic areas devoid of inflammatory cells even one week after envenomation. When correlating the presence of inflammatory cells with degradation of myofibrillar proteins, it was observed that at 6 hr there was little muscle protein degradation. By 48 hr a decrease in ""non collagen"" proteins was observed, together with a reduction in some myofibrillar components, as judged by electrophoresis. Proteolytic enzymes of inflammatory cells may play an important role in myofibrillar protein degradation after myonecrosis induced by B. asper venom.",50,3423335,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,13567,undefined,0,FALSE,3

While the results obtained for mice with higher Toxoplasma inocula were consistent, animals with 10(1) and 10(2) oocysts previous inoculation with Eimeria showed important differences related with those infected only with Toxoplasma. For example, survival time was higher in animals infected with both parasites, especially if inoculated with Eimeria 30 days before Toxoplasma infection. Furthermore the number of T. gondii cysts found in the animals previously infected with Eimeria was lower compared with mice inoculated with Toxoplasma only.
