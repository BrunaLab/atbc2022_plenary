Aboveground nuclear explosions in the early 1960s, before the nuclear test ban treaty, created a spike in the 14C concentration content of the atmosphere. The amount of radiocarbon in the outer layers of wood collected from trunks of trees that had died in known years (1970-1989) on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) and Gigante Peninsula (Panama) was analysed to test the hypothesis that radiocarbon concentration was predictive of year of tree death. The date of tree death was negatively related to the level of 14C, following a trend similar to published data on tree rings from German and Amazonian trees. Combining our data with these data in a statistical analysis revealed a significant predictive effect of radiocarbon on year. Analysis of covariance showed that there was no significant difference among the slopes of the three groups of data, but there was significant heterogeneity among the intercepts. The differences suggest a need for site-specific calibration and refinement of field protocols. The technique shows promise and suggestions are made to improve its usefulness for future studies.",5,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Age structure of gaps | Bomb peak | Gap dynamics | Radiocarbon dating of wood | Tropical rain forest dynamics,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,1,NA,NA,NA,NA

Tethered seeds exposed to disturbance were moved farther and experienced significantly greater variation in litter cover than those protected from disturbance. When seeds of two canopy trees were placed in litter environments simulating those created by chowchillas, the seeds of one species showed significant effects of litter treatment on germination while those of the other showed no significant effects. Seedling cohorts of four tree species were followed for 6 wk soon after germination and all showed higher survival in vertebrate exclosures. The two most abundant species suffered 68% and 35% mortality in six wks, with the majority of that unambiguously due to chowchillas.

Empirical patterns were drawn at four organizational levels: (a) individual levelant species with small-bodied queens were the most frequent partners of myrmecophyte species offering small-sized domatia, while ants with large-bodied queens dominated host species with large-sized domatia, suggesting that host choice by inseminated queens and interspecific conflicts over host dominance seem to be influenced by space limitation; (b) colony level - in eight independent antmyrmecophyte systems, ant colony size was positively correlated to the number of domatia provided by the host, and the mean occupancy level of the domatia by ants was 92%, suggesting that space can be limiting to colony growth; (c) population levelant colony number and distribution was determined by the local availability and distribution of its plant partners; and (d) community level - across ant-myrmecophyte systems, the commonness of ant species were largely determined by the commonness of their specialized host partners.

Here the design of a pot experiment is described that simulates the daily time course of irradiance and light quality in idealized gaps of six different sizes. Differences in response to gap size are illustrated using data from two pioneer species, Ochroma pyramidale, which recruits exclusively in large gaps and clearings, and Luehea seemannii, which colonizes small branchfall gaps as well as large gaps. Ochroma outperformed Luehea in relative growth rate in all except the smallest simulated gap size. Ochroma's superior performance in the larger gaps could be attributed to a larger proportional investment in leaf biomass (i.e. a higher leaf area ratio, LAR), and higher photosynthetic rates both on a leaf area and leaf mass basis. In the smallest simulated gaps LAR was not significantly different between the species, but Ochroma maintained a higher net assimilation rate. These results fail to support the suggestion that gap partitioning among pioneer species arises directly from morphological and biochemical specialization to particular gap light environments. Instead, it is suggested that partitioning may result from a trade-off between seedling growth and mortality determined by species allocational patterns and mediated by interactions with herbivores and pathogens.",33,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Allocation patterns | Gap partitioning | Growth analysis | Light quality | Luehea | Ochroma | Pioneer | Simulated gap | Tropical rain forest,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,6,NA,NA,NA,NA

Light may consequently penetrate into the forest interior over a wide range of angles. It thus seems possible that understorey tree species might be adapted for distinct understorey light conditions. At the Cocha Cashu Biological Station in Madre de Dios, Peru, there are two understorey treelets distinguished by contrasting crown architectures. One, Neea chlorantha (Nyctaginaceae), possesses a much-branched superstructure and displays a smoothly contoured shell of drooping elliptical leaves. The other, Rinorea viridifolia (Violaceae), displays planar arrays of horizontally-oriented obovate leaves held on whorls of stiffly radiating horizontal branches. With the aid of hemispherical photography and the program CANOPY, the light environment at large within a 2.25-ha permanent tree plot, and above and below the crowns of Neea and Rinorea treelets, was investigated. Available light (measured as uncorrected indirect site factor (ISFU) in CANOPY) at control points showed a log-linear increase with height from 2.1 to 14.2 m. The relative amount of lateral illumination also increased with height. Photographs were taken just above and below the crowns of 50 Neea and 50 Rinorea treelets. Neea crowns were more effective at intercepting light from overhead sources, whereas Rinorea crowns were more effective at intercepting light from lateral sources. Adult Neea and Rinorea treelets occurred at locations in the forest where they were exposed to differing angular distributions of incident light, suggesting that the two species were engaged in a form of resource partitioning, a conclusion that is in conflict with the nonequilibrium model of tropical forest tree species diversity.

The diaspores of pioneer trees are characterized by light mass and large wings. Although their parent tree heights are low in most cases, these light diaspores are easily blown upward and widely dispersed. The diaspores of Heritiera, a genus mainly found in primary forest, can be divided into groups with large and small wings by their values of the square-root of wing loading. The frequency distribution of mature tree heights for trees with the large- and small-winged diaspores are skewed into high and low statures, respectively. Therefore, the tree size at maturity may play a vital role in determining the morphology of the diaspores. Among the large-winged diaspores, shape is almost retained, despite size change. Consequently, larger diaspores have more mass per unit of wing area, suggesting that larger diaspores fall more quickly than smaller ones. Diaspore mass is approximately proportional to the nut volume. The enlargement of the nut clearly appears to be beneficial for seedling establishment and survival under a closed canopy. However, increasing nut volume reduces the potential for wind dispersal. The fact that large-winged diaspores were always lighter than their-small-winged counterparts suggests that the heavier diaspores with small wings are not dispersed, preferentially by wind.

Access to the original data of 1971 allowed for a full comparison of the changes and an investigation whether these could be related to changes in elephant numbers and fire frequency.

The large decline in density of small trees was attributed to a severe drought in 1993. Based on large numbers of elephants during the past decades and on relatively low elephant impact on the total tree density, the present study suggests that the current elephant number of 2300 can be sustained in the park without causing detrimental effects, provided that their current range is maintained.",62,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Deciduous and microphyll savanna | Elephants | Savanna structure | Tanzania | Tree density | Tree species | Woodland dynamics,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,17,all,All Open Access,NA,NA

A quantitative analysis also showed that colour attributes were not strongly associated with the observed variation of consumption levels, whereas apparent biomass and aggregation size did correlate with the observed variation in fungivory.

In general, the most fertile soils in the highest rainfall sites supported the greatest species richness and abundance, but this association with fertility broke down at lower rainfall sites. Frogs were richest and most abundant at high rainfall sites, especially on clay soils, presumably because these had greatest water availability. Clay soils supported few reptile species, but these were often at relatively high abundance. High rainfall sites supported the richest reptile faunas. On sand and loam soils, bird species richness varied little along the rainfall gradient, but richness declined very substantially on clay soils. This was probably largely due to the far more marked vegetation structural change on clay soils than on other substrates. Few mammals were reported, and no clear trends were associated with either rainfall gradient or soil texture. Turnover in species composition along the rainfall gradient was gradual and limited on sand and loam soils, but far more marked on clay soils.

These patterns reflect the disparate history, fragmentation and landscape positioning of clay soil environments, relative to the far more homogeneous eucalypt-dominated vegetation on sand and loam soils.

Progeny analysis from this 'self-incompatible' tree using isozyme markers showed that fruits resulting from mixed-pollination (i.e., 50% self- plus 50% cross-pollen on the stigma) set only 1.6% of selfed seeds. The percentage of outcrossed seeds in fruits resulting from open-pollination in two neighbouring planted trees, which flowered in isolation and concomitantly, was estimated at 91% and 71%.

A more detailed analysis, which divided herbivorous species into three sap-sucking and four leaf-chewing guilds, revealed that the correlation between body size and host specificity was caused by differences in these traits between the guilds, while no such correlation was detected within any of the guilds. As the changes in feeding mode, defining various guilds, were unique evolutionary events, it is uncertain whether there is a functional relationship between feeding mode, body size and host specificity, or whether their correlation is only coincidental. It is suggested that, in the sap-sucking community at least, the positive body size versus host specificity correlation is a coincidental by-product of the causal relationship between the feeding mode and both the body size and host specificity.

Although both species are known to be dispersed by caviomorph rodents within short distances (c. 10-20 m and up to 50 m) of parent tree crowns, the analysis of tree positions led to different spatial patterns between species depending on soil drainage characteristics. Overall, while V. americana showed a strongly aggregated spatial distribution, C. procera had a weaker propensity to depart from complete spatial randomness (CSR). A complex distribution, sometimes clustered in areas with hydromorphic soils (swamps and around streams) and sometimes very near CSR outside these areas characterized the C. procera population. When C. procera tree aggregation occurred, there was a slight attraction between juveniles and adults. The aggregation of V. americana trees was evidenced at different levels depending on the scale of investigation.

Selection may favour temporally segregated fruiting phenologies to minimize this competition and also to maintain resident populations of dispersal agents. Alternatively, selection may favour temporally aggregated fruiting phenologies when the effectiveness of seed dispersal agents varies seasonally or when large, synchronous fruit displays enhance dispersal. These evolutionary scenarios assume that plants share seed dispersal agents. This assumption and temporal overlap in fruiting phenologies were evaluated for the Miconia and Psychotria of central Panama. These two genera accounted for 18 and 27%, respectively, of 1096 fleshy fruits found in regurgitation or faecal samples taken from 2054 birds of 103 species netted in the forest understorey.

Of the two sites, the rain forest on spodosols was the less favourable for application of the δ15N method: the available soil nitrogen was isotopically similar to fixed-N2. Hence, the results showed that a reliable estimate of N2-fixation could not be obtained.

The survival and growth of seedlings of three tree species, growing from dung deposited at gorilla nest sites, were monitored for up to 2 y after deposition. A comparison was made between this and seeds (i) deposited in dung on gorilla feeding trails, (ii) dropped (spat out) under conspecific canopies, and (iii) scatter-dispersed (spat out) by other consumers away from conspecific trees but under intact forest canopy. The highest survival and the best performance of seedlings was always at a gorilla nest site, although not every site was favourable for survival or growth. Seedling performance was related to the surrounding vegetation conditions: better performance was observed in seedling clumps with less vegetation cover. Gorillas at Lope apparently provide high quality seed dispersal for these species, not just because they consume large quantities of seeds, but because the pattern of seed deposition, especially in nest sites, can result in the enhanced survival and growth of seedlings.",28,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Gorilla | Regeneration | Seed dispersal | Seedlings | Tropical forest,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,50,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, 3793 trees from 104 species in Kibale National Park, Uganda were monitored. The trees were selected from two sites (Kanyawara and Ngogo) separated by 10 km. Trees were monitored monthly to document community-wide and population-level fruiting and flowering patterns for a maximum of 76 mo. Analysis of two sites over a number of years permitted examination of generalities of patterns found on smaller spatial and temporal scales. Spectral analysis indicated that community-level flowering and fruiting at Kanyawara exhibited regular annual peaks, although the flowering peaks were of shorter duration. At Ngogo, community-level flowering also displayed regular annual peaks, but fruiting had an irregular pattern with no distinct peaks. The abundance of fruiting trees at Kanyawara was negatively related to the minimum temperature in the previous season (3-7 mo prior). Since fruiting tended to peak when the first wet season of the year was ending and the dry season was beginning, this suggests that the minimum temperature in the previous dry season is important in determining how many individuals fruit. Flowering at Kanyawara peaked immediately after the maximum annual period of high irradiance. Within-species synchronization was evident in the flowering for all species examined at Ngogo and for 64% of those at Kanyawara. Fruiting was synchronous within species for 64% of the species at both sites. Despite this general community-level synchronization, the months of peak fruiting and flowering for some species varied markedly among years. Furthermore, for a number of species the timing of fruiting or flowering events differed between Kanyawara and Ngogo. For some species, trends that were suggested from one year of data were not supported when additional years were considered. Although these two sites are close together, share many of the same species, and experience similar climatic regimes, many phenological patterns were site-dependent.",153,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Africa | Flowering | Fruiting | Kibale National Park | Phenology | Seasonality | Seed dispersal | Spectral analysis | Tropical trees,23435,undefined,0,FALSE,52,NA,NA,NA,NA

Differently aged forest fallows, a fire-degraded stand (Paraguay), differently aged logged stands (Venezuela) and mature forest in both sites were selected. In Paraguay, the percentage of resprouts declined from 76% in the young forest fallows (2-5-y old) to 48 and 14%, respectively, in the older forest fallows (10 and 15-y old) and mature forest. In Venezuela, by contrast, the proportion of resprouts from the youngest logged stand (5-y old) to the oldest logged stand (19-y old) and mature forest slightly increased from 10 to 16% and 17%, respectively. Root suckers were more common than above-ground sprouts in any of the sampled stands. In forest fallows, 38% of all species possessed both modes of regeneration, while 20 and 18%, respectively, were either found with above-ground sprouts or root suckers. In the fire-degraded stand, most resprouting species were observed with root suckers (28%), whereas species represented with either above-ground sprouts or both modes of vegetative regeneration were less common (7 and 14%, respectively). In logged stands, species reproducing by both means of vegetative regeneration were more frequent (20%) than the other groups (14 and 8%, respectively).
