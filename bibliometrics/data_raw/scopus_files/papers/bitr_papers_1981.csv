Floral nectar from 21 plants was readily accepted by ants in all but two cases. Some of the nectars were known to contain phenolic compounds and alkaloids.

The canopy avifauna shares many species with scrubby second growth; many common canopy species were also found frequently in more open areas. Rarest visitors to the canopy were primarily those from lower strata. Most common species were omnivorous; restricted insectivores were poorly represented when compared to lower strata. This distribution is correlated with a taxonomic shift from the antbird-woodcreeper-dominated understory to a tanager-dominated canopy avifauna. A majority of common canopy species was significantly seasonal in abundance, the most seasonal resident species tending to be the omnivores. Two sources of overall fluctuation in birds using the outer canopy were an influx of small omnivorous tanagers in the early dry to early wet season, and the presence of temperature-zone migrants, mainly Dendroica castanea, from late wet through the dry season. -from Author",49,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,2,NA,NA

A seasonal pattern of frugivory was observed for the two congeners (bay-breasted and chestnut-sided), both species displaying a strong peak in frugivory in the late dry season. They also were highly frugivorous earlier in the winter, during a general fruiting low, in response to the fruit crops of Lindackeria laurina and Casearia spp. Chestnut-sided and bay-breasted warblers occur commonly at only a few species of fruiting trees, mainly Miconia argentea and Lindackeria laurina. These trees were visited by warblers far out of proportion to the relative abundance of warblers among small omnivorous forest birds. Lindackeria was visited almost exclusively by warblers. Lindackeria appeared to be specialized for dispersal by warblers to a degree not reported for any other migrant-dispersed fruits in the tropics. Chestnut-sided warblers defend small territories, a circumstance which makes preferred fruiting trees an undependable food supply. Bay-breasted warblers aggregate from a large area to feed on preferred trees, so fruit supply is more predictable. Bay-breasted and Tennessee warblers (and other migrants such as red-eyed vireo Vireo olivaceus) are far more intraspecifically gregarious than are most tropical forest residents. It is possibly the tendency to visit fruiting trees in large flocks that makes migrants potentially good dispersers for some plants.-from Author",36,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,11,NA,NA

Vertebrate seed predators may feed on many species of seeds over the course of a year or within the animal population, but, at any one time or with any one individual, strong facultative host-specificity occurs. Vertebrates have a variety of species-specific behaviors that suggest specialization to overcome the defenses of particular seed species. Even the dispersal agents kill seeds as they pass through their guts, and the details of seed-defecation patterns should be important to the seed. Leaf-eating caterpillars seem to be either specialized on one or a few species of plants, or spread over many. Defoliations and severe herbivory occur with many plant species in various seasons or years. Herbivory by large herbivores is probably trivial compared to that of insects. The defenses that the large herbivores have to overcome may well have been selected for by both insects and extinct Pleistocene large herbivores.
