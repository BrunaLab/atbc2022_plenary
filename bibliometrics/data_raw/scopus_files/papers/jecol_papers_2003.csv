Although plants growing below tree or shrub canopies in xeric ecosystems often exhibit higher growth or survival than conspecifics growing in the open, few studies have sought to identify the processes that facilitate plant performance. 2. We tested the relationship between the importance of facilitation and environmental severity in a field experiment in which seedlings of the perennial shrub Enchylaena tomentosa were shaded at different times of year. We measured plant growth and survival on six occasions between June 1999 (winter) and February 2000 (summer). 3. Although seedling relative growth rates (RGR) changed with growing conditions, shade always increased mean RGRs. The intensity of facilitation (the difference in mean RGRs due to shade) did not differ between measurement periods. 4. Shade reduced survival during winter and spring, but had a strong positive effect during summer. Larger seedlings had lower mortality rates during summer, suggesting that prior facilitation of growth indirectly aided survival. 5. Our results provide only partial support for the hypothesis that the importance of facilitation increases with environmental severity. Whereas the importance of facilitation of seedling survival was high under severe conditions, the importance of facilitation of seedling growth did not increase under more severe conditions. 6. We conclude that the relationship between facilitation and environmental severity is more complex than previously recognized, and that the effects of plant interactions can vary between different aspects of plant performance.",96,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Arid lands | Enchylaena tomentosa | Environmental severity | Importance | Positive interactions | Temporal variability,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,1,NA,NA

We studied the genetic and environmental determinants of attack by the specialist stem-attacking weevil, Rhyssomatus lineaticollis on Asclepias syriaca. 2. In natural populations, the extent of stem damage and oviposition were positively correlated with stem width, but not stem height. We hypothesized that both genotypic and environmental factors influencing stem morphology would affect attack by weevils. 3. In a common garden study with 21 full-sib families of milkweed, both phenotypic and genetic correlations indicated that weevils impose more damage and lay more eggs on thicker stemmed plants. 4. Of three other putative resistance traits, only latex production showed a negative genetic correlation with weevil attack. 5. When neighbouring grasses were clipped to reduce light competition, focal milkweed plants received up to 2.6 times the photosynthetically active radiation and 1.6 times the red to far red ratio of light compared with plants with intact grass neighbours. Focal milkweed plants were therefore released from the classic neighbour avoidance response and had 20% shorter internode lengths, were 30% shorter, and had 90% thicker stems compared with controls. 6. Clipping of grass neighbours resulted in nearly 2.7 times the damage and oviposition by stem weevils, thus supporting the hypothesis of an environmental or trait-mediated indirect influence on resistance. 7. Although attack of plants by weevils strongly increases the probability of stem mortality, thicker stems experience lower mortality, thus counteracting the selective impact of weevil-induced plant mortality. 8. The determinants of attack on milkweeds include both genetic variation for stem thickness and an indirect environmental influence of plant neighbours. If milkweeds and weevils are coevolving, the interaction is diffuse because the ecological neighbourhood is likely to modify the patterns of reciprocal natural selection.",44,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Adaptive phenotypic plasticity | Asclepias syriaca | Diffuse coevolution | Herbivory | Interaction modification | Plant competition | Plant-insect interactions | Red : far red ratio of light | Rhyssomatus lineaticollis | Trait-mediated indirect effect,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,3,NA,NA

To explore the role of edaphic controls in the response of arctic tundra to climate change, we analysed Holocene pollen records from lakes in northern Alaska located on glaciated surfaces with contrasting soil texture, topography and tundra communities. Using indicator taxa, pollen accumulation rates (PARs) and multivariate comparison of fossil and modern pollen assemblages, we reconstructed the vegetational changes at Upper Capsule Lake (Sagavanirktok surface) and Red Green Lake (Itkillik II surface) in response to increased effective moisture between the early and middle Holocene. 2. In the Red Green record, low PARs and the continuous presence of taxa indicative of prostrate-shrub tundra (PST; Equisetum, Polypodiaceae, Thalictrum and Rosaceae) indicate that the vegetation resembled PST throughout the Holocene. During the warm, dry early Holocene (11 300-10 000 cal years BP), PST also occurred on Sagavanirktok surfaces, as evidenced by PST indicators (Bryidae, Polypodiaceae, Equisetum and Rosaceae) in this interval of the Upper Capsule record. However, PARs increased, suggesting increased vegetation cover, PST taxa declined and taxa indicative of dwarf-shrub tundra (DST; Rubus chamaemorus and Lycopodium annotinum) increased between 10 000 and 7500 cal years BP. 3. We hypothesize that between the early and middle Holocene the fine-textured soils and smooth topography of Sagavanirktok surfaces led to increased soil moisture, greater vegetation cover, permafrost aggradation, anoxic and acidic soil conditions, slower decomposition and the development of a thick organic layer. In contrast, soil moisture remained low on the better-drained Itkillik II surface, and vegetational changes were minor. 4.

We carried out a factorial experiment to examine how groundwater availability (low and high sites with intermediate or rare flooding), vegetation canopy, leaf litter and seed availability interacted to determine the species richness of a productive wet grassland community in Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve, Cambridgeshire, UK. Seeds of 18 species were added to half the plots in each of eight combinations of elevation, canopy and litter, and seedling emergence was observed for two growing seasons. 2. Both individual and interactive effects on plant diversity and colonization were determined for all four examined factors. Interactive effects explained 41-63% of the total variation in both species richness and numbers of individuals growing from added seeds. 3. Neither elevation nor vegetation canopy had significant individual effects on total species richness, but their interaction was significant. Litter addition limited seedling emergence at the low elevation but favoured it at the high elevation. 4. The relative importance of vegetation canopy and plant litter in affecting plant community composition varied with the community parameter considered (species richness or number of seedlings), elevation and stage of vegetation development. In general, plant litter was more important in determining species richness, whereas the vegetation canopy was more important in determining seed germination and seedling emergence. Plant litter was also more important than vegetation canopy at an early stage of vegetation development and at low elevation. 5. Seed availability was the most important factor in determining overall species richness in the studied community. The influence of the local seed bank was very limited. Seedling emergence and seedling species richness were generally enhanced by lower elevation and seed addition, but depressed by vegetation and litter addition. 6.

We tested the hypothesis that the more frequent occurrence of tree seedlings below the adult trees than in canopy openings might be explained by indirect facilitation. In a temperate hardwood forest, we compared the performance of five target tree seedlings (Picea abies, Abies alba, Fagus sylvatica, Acer pseudoplatanus and Quercus petraea), transplanted with or without a herbaceous competitor (Molinia caerulea), either within the forest or into experimentally created gaps. 2. We quantified changes in understorey biomass, light penetration and available forms of soil nitrogen during three growing seasons. 3. Photosynthetic photon flux density and total biomass of Molinia were significantly higher in the gap treatment than within the forest. Total available nitrogen was higher in the gaps in the absence of Molinia, but higher in the forest in the presence of Molinia. 4. Quercus survival was very low within the forest because of fungal infection, whereas survival was very high for the four other tree species in all combinations of the two treatments. 5. Although the competitive effect of Molinia on the growth of the tree seedlings was much greater in the gap treatment, seedling growth was lower within the forest. We conclude that the tree canopy imposed strong light competition, and that this direct negative influence was much greater than any indirect positive effect of increased availability of nutrients to tree seedlings, due to reduced nutrient uptake by Molinia. 6. Target species responses to treatments were similar, despite strong differences in nitrogen requirements between species.

We explored the role of the seed bank in population dynamics of the summer annual Helianthus annuus. First, we determined seed survival under field conditions. Secondly, we conducted an experiment in which a dispersal treatment (plants allowed/not allowed to disperse seeds) was crossed with a soil disturbance treatment that was predicted to increase seed bank recruitment. Our goal was to evaluate the relative importance of the previous year's seed production vs. the remainder of the seed bank to numbers of plants. 2. Yearly seed survival was variable, ranging from 46 to 83% when seeds were buried in mesh packets and from 12 to 76% for seeds placed on the soil surface. Survival was higher for plots established in 1999 than in 2000. Survival was often higher in later years but was unaffected by the presence of litter. 3. By comparing seedling establishment between dispersal treatments, we inferred that approximately 10-23% of the seedlings were from the seed bank, independent of soil disturbance. 4. Although seed dispersal the previous year led to increased numbers of seedlings by at least 4.5 times, the number of adults only increased 2.5 times and head production only increased 1.5 times because of density-dependent processes. 5. Patches of seedlings emerging only from the seed bank (often at low densities) may have a disproportionate contribution to the next generation. Average head production/ seedling was 3.6 for such seedlings vs. 0.8 for seedlings from both the previous year's seed set and the seed bank. Emergence of seeds from the seed bank in high-density seedling areas may, however, have little effect on patch reproduction as reproductive output was asymptotically related to the number of seedlings initially present.

We measured sediment elevation and accretion dynamics in mangrove forests on the islands of Guanaja and Roatan, Honduras, impacted by Hurricane Mitch in 1998 to determine if collapse of underlying peat was occurring as a result of mass tree mortality. Little is known about the balance between production and decomposition of soil organic matter in the maintenance of sediment elevation of mangrove forests with biogenic soils. 2. Sediment elevation change measured with the rod surface elevation table from 18 months to 33 months after the storm differed significantly among low, medium and high wind impact sites. Mangrove forests suffering minimal to partial mortality gained elevation at a rate (5 mm year-1) greater than vertical accretion (2 mm year-1) measured from artificial soil marker horizons, suggesting that root production contributed to sediment elevation. Basin forests that suffered mass tree mortality experienced peat collapse of about 11 mm year-1 as a result of decomposition of dead root material and sediment compaction. Low soil shear strength and lack of root growth accompanied elevation decreases. 3. Model simulations using the Relative Elevation Model indicate that peat collapse in the high impact basin mangrove forest would be 37 mm year-1 for the 2 years immediately after the storm, as root material decomposed. In the absence of renewed root growth, the model predicts that peat collapse will continue for at least 8 more years at a rate (7 mm year-1) similar to that measured (11 mm year -1). 4. Mass tree mortality caused rapid elevation loss. Few trees survived and recovery of the high impact forest will thus depend primarily on seedling recruitment.

Palynology has been portrayed as a 'blunt' tool for reconstructing variations in arctic tundra vegetation. We tested this characterization in the Arctic Foothills of northern Alaska by analysing 56 modern pollen assemblages from lakes on contrasting glaciated surfaces. The two surfaces, which date to the Sagavanirktok (> 125 000 years BP) and Itkillik II (c. 11 500 years BP) ice advances from the Brooks Range, have considerably different geomorphology, soil characteristics and plant communities. Sagavanirktok surfaces are dominated by dwarf-shrub tundra (DST), and Itkillik II surfaces by prostrateshrub tundra (PST). 2. We used two multivariate approaches, dissimilarity metrics (squared chord distance and Canberra metric distance) and discriminant analysis, to assess the ability of the pollen data to distinguish between the Sagavanirktok and Itkillik II landscapes, and to identify the taxa most strongly associated with one surface or the other. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the performance of the dissimilarity metrics and to determine their 'critical values' for distinguishing between assemblages from like and unlike plant communities. 3. According to the discriminant analysis, taxa indicative of the Sagavanirktok surface include Rubus chamaemorus, Sphagnum and Ericales, whereas Equisetum, Thalictrum and Polypodiaceae were faithful to the Itkillik II surface. These differences between the pollen assemblages make it possible to differentiate between the two landscapes using Canberra metric distance comparisons. The ROC analysis demonstrated that the Canberra metric distance is more effective than squared chord distance for distinguishing between the two surfaces.

The first trees establishing in grasslands may indirectly favour their seedlings in competition with neighbouring herbaceous vegetation by increasing soil fertility with nitrogen-rich litter and by reducing light levels under their canopies. It is predicted that increasing soil nitrogen availability will accelerate invasion of trees by stimulating their growth more than that of herbaceous species. Decreasing light availability is predicted to increase tree invasion by limiting the growth of herbaceous vegetation more than that of trees (competitive release). 2. We tested these predictions using Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum), which is an aggressive alien invader of grasslands in the southern USA, and Hackberry (Celtis laevigata), which is a native tree common in these grasslands. 3. Nitrogen and light were manipulated in two factorial field experiments in grasslands in Texas, USA. In the first, nitrogen was increased and light was decreased in plots with planted Celtis or Sapium seedlings. In the second experiment, light availability to planted Celtis or Sapium seedlings was increased by holding back prairie vegetation. 4. In the first experiment, growth of Celtis and Sapium seedlings increased with nitrogen fertilization while the above-ground biomass of prairie vegetation did not change. Prairie vegetation biomass decreased and tree seedling growth increased under shading. Sapium's growth increased dramatically in the treatment with combined nitrogen and shade. Sapium survival decreased when shade was applied. 5. In the second experiment, Sapium growth increased with increased light. Thus, increased Sapium growth at low light levels in the shade experiment was probably a consequence of decreased competitive interference from prairie vegetation, rather than better absolute performance of Sapium in low light levels. 6. These results provide evidence for facilitation as a mechanism involved in tree invasions of grasslands. Changes in resource levels, perhaps in combination with other factors, may explain rapid conversion of grassland communities to woodlands after the first pioneer trees are established. The marked response of Sapium to the combination of nitrogen and shade suggests that these positive feedbacks may be particularly strong for this alien plant species.",140,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Chinese tallow tree | Facilitation | Light | Nitrogen | Sapium sebiferum,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,10,NA,NA

Environmental fluctuations can hypothetically promote greater species diversity, but this has rarely been experimentally tested in plant communities. We predicted that high temporal variability in soil moisture would promote high diversity in a community of recruiting seedlings. Using a glasshouse experiment designed to imitate field conditions in species-rich limestone pavement habitats, we examined the effects of temporal variability and total quantity of water provided on seedling species richness, evenness and composition within a single growing season. 2. Temporal variability was altered by varying the frequency at which water was added while keeping the total quantity of water constant. Low temporal variability was created by high frequencies of water addition. High variability was associated with more extreme fluctuations between draughted and flooded conditions. Each of three variability treatments was carried out using three total quantities of water added to create a gradient in total soil water availability. 3. Species richness was greatest in higher quantity and lower variability treatments. Higher total quantities of water added buffered the negative effects of higher temporal variability, and lower temporal variability buffered the negative effects of lower quantity. Species richness was negatively correlated with temporal variability in soil moisture content both in the glasshouse and in a field study. Evenness was negatively correlated with richness. Low richness, high evenness communities had low densities and were prone to extinction. Thus, neither richness nor evenness was maintained by higher temporal variabilities within a growing season. 4. Lower species richness under more temporally variable conditions was attributable to both random extinctions due to reductions in total community density and species-specific differences in mortality. Final species relative abundances differed between water treatments, but there were no separate effects of variability in soil moisture content or total quantity of water added. Upland species were more abundant in treatments where drought was more prevalent, either due to low total quantities of water or high temporal variability in soil moisture.

We studied local adaptation to substrate type within a population of the clonal aquatic macrophyte Potamogeton pectinatus and the role that genotypic variation in propagule-provisioning plays therein. 2. P. pectinatus reproduces mainly by means of subterranean asexual propagules (tubers), whose survival and sprouting success depends on the interaction of factors such as the size of tubers, substrate type and predation risk by Bewick's swans. 3. We studied a population of P. pectinatus in which genotypes producing large tubers predominate at the sandy shore and those producing small tubers at the clay-rich shore. Clonal lines originating from different shores were grown on a sandy and a clay-rich substrate in a common-garden. Plants from all clonal lines were grown from tubers of a comparable size range, but the various clones from within each shore differed in the average size of tubers they are genetically determined to produce. 4. The performance of all clones was much lower on sandy substrate than on clay-rich substrate, indicating that the former is a stressful (nutrient-poor) environment. The reaction norms of morphological traits varied significantly among clones, revealing genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity. However, these differences were not related to our correlates of fitness (total tuber biomass, tuber size and tuber number). We found no evidence of local adaptation independent of genotypic tuber size. Instead, tuber size mediated local adaptation: clones producing larger tubers had a higher fitness in sandy substrate, while clones producing smaller tubers had a higher fitness in clay-rich substrate. 5. Our results imply that diversifying selection for tuber size takes place between the two substrate types and confirms the importance of tuber-size provisioning for local adaptation to substrate heterogeneity.",43,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Ecotypes | Fennel pondweed | Nutrient availability | Phenotypic plasticity | Propagule size,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,14,NA,NA

The patterns of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) host specificity between understorey and canopy trees were investigated in three mixed evergreen forest stands in northern coastal California. ECM root tips from the dominant canopy (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and understorey (Lithocarpus densiflora) trees were sampled from 18 soil cores (six per stand) and identified using molecular techniques (PCR, RFLP, and DNA sequencing of the rDNA ITS region). 2. We found 56 ECM taxa; 17 on both hosts, 27 solely on Pseudotsuga and 12 on Lithocarpus. There were no significant differences in ECM taxon richness or diversity across stands, although ECM taxon richness was significantly higher on Pseudotsuga than Lithocarpus. ECM taxa similarity across stands was low. 3. Multiple-host ECM taxa had significantly higher abundance than single-host ECM taxa and 13 of the 17 multiple-host ECM taxa were present on both hosts within at least one core. Twelve of the 14 cores had at least one ECM taxon that was present on both hosts, although the specific taxon varied between cores and stands. In addition, shared ECM taxa often had unequal relative abundances on the two hosts. 4.

Plant growth at high-latitude sites is usually strongly nutrient-limited. The increased nutrient availability predicted in response to global warming may affect internal plant nutrient cycling, including nutrient resorption from senescing leaves. 2. The effect of increased N supply (10 g N m-2 year-1) on nitrogen and phosphorus resorption efficiency and proficiency in six sub-arctic bog species, belonging to four different growth-forms, was studied in northern Sweden. 3. We hypothesized that while increased N supply would not affect N or P resorption efficiency, it would lead to lower N resorption proficiency (higher N concentrations in leaf litter) and higher P resorption proficiency (lower P concentrations in leaf litter). We also investigated whether the basis on which resorption was expressed (leaf mass, leaf area or unit leaf) influenced the patterns observed. 4. Contrasting with our hypothesis, a general trend of decreased N resorption efficiency occurred in response to increased N supply, but the expected decrease in N resorption proficiency was seen in all species except Betula nana. 5. P resorption efficiency did not change in four species (B. nana, Empetrum hermaphroditum, Eriophorum vaginatum and Rubus chamaemorus) but it decreased in Andromeda polifolia, and increased in Vaccinium uliginosum. P resorption proficiency showed the expected increase in only two species (B. nana and V. uliginosum). 6. Apart from P resorption efficiency, the different calculation methods generally produced similar responses of resorption efficiency and proficiency to N supply. 7. Increased N supply at high-latitude sites clearly leads to more N being returned to the soil through leaf litter production. However, decomposition of such litter will probably become P-limited. 8. Considerable interspecific differences in nutrient resorption proficiency were found, indicating that long-term changes in vegetation composition need to be considered when evaluating plant-mediated effects on ecosystem nutrient cycling in response to increased nutrient supply.",184,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Global warming | Internal nutrient cycling | Leaf litter | Nutrient-limited growth,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,16,NA,NA

Most studies of salt marsh plant zonation have been at middle to high latitudes of the northern hemisphere, in euhaline or periodically hypersaline marshes with regular tides. In this study, we examined plant zonation in an irregularly flooded marsh in southern Brazil. Pore water characteristics were compared in four vegetation zones across a marsh elevation gradient. Reciprocal transplants between vegetation zones and removal experiments were performed to examine species interactions in low and mid marshes. 2. There was no distinctive gradient of physical stress across the elevation of irregularly flooded low and mid marshes. Moreover, the three dominant plants, Spartina alterniflora, Spartina densiflora and Scirpus maritimus, were able to grow across the entire elevation gradient, i.e. within zones normally occupied by the other species. The only exception was Spartina alterniflora, which was strongly limited by selective herbivory by the crab Chasmagnathus granulata in the Scirpus maritimus zone. 3. Although intra- and interspecific competition reduced growth of all three species, no competitive hierarchy was found in any vegetation zone. 4. These results suggest that, as in tidal marshes of the north hemisphere, competition is important in structuring salt marsh plant communities. In contrast, however, plant zonation in irregularly flooded marshes cannot be explained by displacement of competitive subordinates to physically stressful habitats. The roles of founder effects and selective herbivory in such marshes therefore merits further investigation.",149,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Competition | Grapsidae crab | Herbivory | Non-tidal marsh,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,all,All Open Access,17,NA,NA

Established individuals removed at random from populations of 11 long-lived herbaceous species coexisting in a local area of ancient limestone pasture at Cressbrookdale in North Derbyshire were subjected to clonal propagation to produce stocks of genetically identical individuals sufficient to create 36 model communities identical in species composition but widely contrasted in genetic diversity. 2. Three levels of genetic diversity were imposed. In one treatment, all individuals of each species were genetically unique. The second contained four randomly selected genotypes of each species. In the third, there was no genetic diversity in any of the species but each community contained a unique combination of genotypes. 3. Over a period of 5 years the communities were allowed to develop in microcosms containing natural rendzina soil and exposed to a standardized regime of simulated grazing and trampling. The treatments were maintained by the removal of flowers, immature seed-heads and seedlings originating from the seed-bank and seed rain. Point quadrat surveys were used to monitor changes in species composition and diversity in the three experimental treatments. 4. During the experiment a distinction rapidly developed between five canopy dominants and five subordinates, a process that caused the vegetation structure to closely resemble that occurring at Cressbrookdale. 5. A gradual loss of species diversity occurred in all three treatments but by the end of the fifth growing season species diversity was higher in the most genetically diverse communities. 6. Ordination of the 36 communities at intervals over a 5-year period revealed a gradual convergence in the species composition of the 4-genotype and 16-genotype communities and this effect was more strongly developed in the latter. A comparable process was not observed in the 1-genotype communities, suggesting that interaction between particular genotypes of different species in local neighbourhoods may be an essential part of the mechanism that determines the predictable composition of a mature pasture community. 7.

In a calcareous dry grassland community in central Europe genets of the clonal sedge Carex humilis form very distinct rings of densely aggregated ramets.

We analysed how ramet demography in C. humilis depends on ramet position within the ring and how this is linked to ramet size. 2. The per ramet population growth rate was > 1 at the periphery of rings but < 1 in the interior, meaning that the population increases at the periphery but decreases in the interior. The population growth rate differed mainly because ramets were smaller in the interior and because smaller ramets produced fewer vegetative ramets. It is unlikely that the smaller ramet size is caused by negative density dependence, interspecific competition, internal control or resource depletion. 3. The study covered four growing seasons and we found considerable variation in ramet demography between years. The net result for the 4 years was that the total number of C. humilis ramets in the population increased.

Cost-benefit models predict that leaf life span depends on its initial photosynthetic rate and construction cost and on the rate of decline in photosynthesis with age. Leaf gas exchange rates and N contents were measured in nine woody evergreen Mediterra-nean species with different leaf life spans to determine the effects of leaf ageing on photosynthetic N use efficiency (PNUE). N costs of leaf construction were assumed to be in part dependent on N résorption from senescing leaves. 2. Leaf ageing had significant negative effects on photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area. As N content per unit leaf area did not decline until the end of leaf life, PNUE also decreased with age. PNUE generally declined faster in species with a shorter leaf life span. There were no significant interspecific differences in maximum CO 2 assimilation rates per unit leaf area and in N resorption that could be related to differences in leaf life span. 3. As PNUE decreases with leaf age, shedding of the older leaves and retranslocation of N to the current year's leaf biomass would result in an increase in the mean instantane-ous efficiency of use of the N retranslocated. However, total CO2 assimilation can be improved by such shedding only when the increase in the efficiency of use of the remobilized N compensates for the remaining N lost in the shed leaves. 4. The photosynthesis of the old leaf cohorts exceeded the increase in photosynthesis that would be obtained from the N retranslocated to the younger leaves, given the observed efficiencies of N resorption. The retention of old leaves thus resulted in a higher whole-canopy CO2 assimilation, despite their low PNUE.",139,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Leaf life span | N resorption | Photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency | Pinus spp. | Quercus spp.,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,21,NA,NA

Unravelling which factors affect where tropical trees grow is an important goal for ecologists and conservationists. At the landscape scale, debate is mostly focused on the degree to which the distributions of tree species are determined by soil conditions or by neutral, distance-dependent processes. Problems with spatial autocorrelation, sparse soil sampling, inclusion of species-poor sites with extreme edaphic conditions, and the difficulty of obtaining sufficient sample sizes have all complicated assessments for high diversity tropical forests. 2. We evaluated the extent and pervasiveness of habitat association of trees within a 10 000 km2 species-rich lowland landscape of uniform climate in south-west Amazonia. Forests growing on two non-flooded landscape units were inventoried using 88 floristic plots and detailed soil analyses, sampling up to 849 tree species. We applied single-species and community-level analytical techniques (frequency-distributions of presence records, association analysis, indicator species analysis, ordination, Mantel correlations, and multiple regression of distance matrices) to quantify soil/floristic relationships while controlling for spatial autocorrelation. 3. Obligate habitat-restriction is very rare: among 230 tree species recorded in ≥ 10 localities only five (2.2%) were always restricted to one landscape unit or the other. 4. However, many species show a significant tendency to habitat association. For example, using Monte Carlo randomization tests, of the 34 most dominant species across the landscape the distributions of 26 (76.5%) are significantly related to habitat. We applied density-independent and frequency-independent estimates of habitat association and found that rarer species tend to score higher, suggesting that our full community estimates of habitat association are still underestimated due to the inadequate sampling of rarer species. 5. Community-level floristic variation across the whole landscape is related to the variation in 14 of 16 measured soil variables, and to the geographical distances between samples. 6. Multiple regression of distance matrices shows that 10% of the floristic variation can be attributed to spatial autocorrelation, but even after accounting for this at least 40% is attributable to measured environmental variation. 7.

Maximum attainable height varies greatly between tree species in tropical rain forests and covaries with demographic and allometric traits. We examined these relationships in 27 abundant tree species in a mixed dipterocarp forest. These species were monitored over 3 years in two 1-ha plots in western Borneo. A 95-percentile upper height limit was used to represent maximum height, to avoid sample size differences among populations. 2. Average growth rate in trunk diameter was regressed against trunk diameter using a maximum likelihood model and assuming that growth rates were exponentially distributed around the average. Estimated average growth rate at small trunk diameters (up to 11 cm) was independent of maximum height among the 27 species, while the degree of growth reduction at larger diameters was larger for species with smaller maximum height. 3. The recruitment rate efficiency of saplings was negatively correlated with maximum height, regardless of the measure used to assess species abundance. In particular, sapling recruitment per unit basal area declined greatly with increasing maximum height, consistent with model predictions of the traits required for the stable coexistence of species at different heights within the canopy. 4. Allometric analyses showed that understorey species had shorter heights at the same trunk diameter, and deeper crowns at the same tree height, than canopy species. Therefore, understorey species showed adaptive morphology to deep shade. 5.

Treeline ecotones, such as the prairie-forest boundary, represent climatically sensitive regions where the relative abundance of vegetation types is controlled by complex interactions between climate and local factors. Responses of vegetation and fire to climate change may be tightly linked as a result of strong feedbacks among fuel production, vegetation structure and fire frequency/severity, but the importance of these feedbacks for controlling the stability of this ecotone is unclear. 2. In this study, we examined the prairie-forest ecotone in south-central Minnesota using two lake sediment cores to reconstruct independent records of climate, vegetation and fire over the past 12 500 years. Using pollen, charcoal, sediment magnetic analyses and LOI properties, we investigated whether fires were controlled directly by climate or indirectly by fuel production. 3.

The diversity and abundance of viable diaspores trapped at the downstream end of a 15-km lowland stream were quantified and related to five potentially predicting variables: species' occurrence in the species pool, distance to the nearest stand and the life-history traits seed buoyancy, seed production and plant height. 2. From 126 samples, 106 614 individuals of vascular plants developed, 95.8% from vegetative diaspores and 4.2% from seeds. Among these plants, three free-floating, 12 submerged, 22 emergent (aquatic) and 70 riparian (semi-aquatic and terrestrial) species were recorded, respectively, accounting for 24.3%, 71.9%, 1,2% and 2.6% of the total number of viable diaspores trapped. 3. Of the free-floating, submerged and emergent species, 100%, 98.9% and 23.7% of the diaspores were vegetative, respectively, whereas it was 2.9% for riparian species. 4. Diaspores of 79% of the total number of aquatic species and 40% of riparian species observed in the established vegetation were trapped. Minimal dispersal distances ranged from 0 to 6 km. 5. Multiple regression analysis conducted for submerged species, showed that 71% of the variation in the diaspore pool could be predicted by occurrence of species in the vegetation, For emergent species, seed production and occurrence of species explained 54% of the variation, seed production being most important. Mean seed buoyancy of emergent species was higher than that of the other groups. For riparian species, seed production, occurrence and buoyancy explained 48% of the variation in the diaspore pool. Seed production per plant was the most important variable. Linear regression revealed a negative relationship between distance and abundance of the diaspore pool for submerged and riparian species. 6. We conclude that the occurrence of species in the species pool is a significant predictor for the dispersal of free-floating and submerged aquatics that rely on vegetative propagation. Seed production and buoyancy are of additional importance with regard to emergent aquatics. Riparian species with a limited terrestrial dispersal capacity may largely extend their range by hydrochory. That is, if they produce large amounts of (small) seeds and provided that these can reach the water body.

The floristic variation in Amazonian lowland forests is poorly understood, especially in the large areas of non-inundated (tierra firme) rain forest. Species composition may be either unpredictable as abundances fluctuate in a random walk, more-or-less uniform, or it may correspond to environmental heterogeneity. 2. We tested the three hypotheses by studying the floristic variation of two phylogenetically distant plant groups along a continuous 43-km long line transect that crossed tierra firme rain forest in northern Peru. 3. The observed floristic patterns were compared to patterns in the spectral reflectance characteristics of the forest as recorded in a Landsat TM satellite image. The topography of the transect was measured in the field, and surface soil samples were collected to document edaphic conditions. The two plant groups, pteridophytes and the Melastomataceae, were assessed in 2-m wide and 500-m long sampling units. 4. Floristic similarity (Jaccard index) between sampling units ranged from 0.01 to 0.71 (mean = 0.27), showing that some units were almost completely dissimilar while others were very alike. 5. Spatially constrained clustering produced very similar subdivisions of the transect when based separately on satellite image data, pteriophytes, and Melastomataceae, and the subdivisions were also related to topography and soil characteristics. Mantel tests showed that floristic similarity patterns of the two plant groups were highly correlated with each other and with similarities in reflectance patterns of the satellite image, and somewhat less correlated with geographical distance. 6. Our results lend no support to the uniformity hypothesis, but they partially support the random walk model, and are consistent with the hypothesis that species segregate edaphically at the landscape scale within the uniform-looking forest.",181,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Amazonia | Beta diversity | Chronological clustering | Floristic composition | Mantel test | Melastomataceae | Peru | Pteridophytes | Random walk model | Satellite imagery | Tropical rain forest,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,29,NA,NA

The difference in gap size requirements observed for neotropical pioneer species is a classic example of habitat partitioning among tropical tree species. Previous research has shown that the three species Miconia argentea, Cecropia insignis and Trema micrantha differ in the minimum gap size that they occupy as adult plants in semi-deciduous tropical forest in Panamá. Here we test whether these differences result from variation in seed germination and seedling establishment requirements, or from differences in susceptibility to herbivores. 2. We planted seeds of Miconia argentea and Trema micrantha into artificially created small (25 m2), medium (64 m2) and large (225 m2) gaps in secondary forest, and transplanted seedlings of all three species into small and large gaps inside and outside mesh cages that excluded invertebrate herbivores. 3. Miconia seedlings emerged and established successfully across a broad range of gap sizes, and transplanted seedlings grew slowly but survived well in all gap sizes. By contrast, emergence and survival of Trema seedlings occurred only in the large gaps and transplants died in small gaps. Survival of Cecropia seedlings was intermediate between Trema and Miconia in the small gaps and growth was greater than either species in the large gaps. 4. Herbivore exclosures reduced foliar herbivory on all three species. The median lifespan of Trema seedlings in small gaps was reduced when the seedlings were exposed to herbivores, but survival of the other species was not affected by the exclosure treatment in either gap size. The growth of Miconia seedlings was lower outside exclosures in both gap sizes. 5. Differences in germination and establishment could generate the contrasting gap size distributions observed between Miconia and Trema, but they are partially offset by measured differences in seed bank density. However, patterns of seedling growth and survival reinforce differences among species at the establishment phase and provide a mechanism for the observed differences in gap size distribution at the sapling stage. 'Cross-overs' in species growth rates result in specialization to different environments and reduce their survival in unfavourable conditions. We found no evidence for a definitive influence of herbivory as a mechanism driving differences in gap size distribution among species.",63,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Barro Colorado Island | Germination | Niche partitioning | Seedling | Tropical forest regeneration,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,31,NA,NA

A framework that summarizes the direct and indirect effects of past land use on forest herb recolonization is proposed, and used to analyse the colonization patterns of forest understorey herbaceous species in a 360-ha mixed forest, grassland and arable landscape in the Dijle river valley (central Belgium). 2. Fine-scale distribution maps were constructed for 14 species. The species were mapped in 15 946 forest plots and outside forests (along parcel margins) in 5188 plots. Forest stands varied in age between 1 and more than 224 years. Detailed land-use history data were combined with the species distribution maps to identify species-specific colonization sources and to calculate colonization distances. 3. The six most frequent species were selected for more detailed statistical analysis. 4. Logistic regression models indicated that species frequency in forest parcels was a function of secondary forest age, distance from the nearest colonization source and their interaction. Similar age and distance effects were found within hedgerows. 5. In 199 forest stands, data about soils, canopy structure and the cover of competitive species were collected. The relative importance of habitat quality and spatio-temporal isolation for the colonization of the forest herb species was quantified using structural equation modelling (SEM), within the framework proposed for the effects of past land use. 6. The results of the SEM indicate that, except for the better colonizing species, the measured habitat quality variables are of minor importance in explaining colonization patterns, compared with the combination of secondary forest age and distance from colonization sources. 7.

Primate frugivores are important seed dispersers for a large fraction of tree species in many tropical forests. The movement, diet preferences and defecation patterns produced by primates may therefore strongly influence seed dispersion patterns and seedling recruitment success. Here we examine the pattern of seed dispersal generated by white-faced monkeys (Cebus capucinus) in relation to adult tree distribution in the 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panamá. 2. Diet breadth of Cebus was remarkably wide. Over four months they consumed fruits of 95 out of an estimated 240 species available. Seeds of 67 species passed intact through the gut and 28 were spat out. 3. Dispersal effectiveness of Cebus was also high. Two Cebus groups on average spent < 10 min feeding in individual trees, had large home ranges (> 150 ha), travelled 1-3 km day-1 and defecated seeds in small clumps throughout the day. 4. Mean dispersal distance of ingested seeds was 216 m (range 20-844 m), with the highest probability of dispersal 100-200 m from the parent plant. For six of nine species studied, the distance between defecation sites and nearest conspecific adults of seeds in faeces was not significantly different from random expectations. 5. The scattered dispersal pattern produced by Cebus suggests that this species contributes relatively little to dispersal limitation (sensu Nathan & Muller-Landau 2000) compared to other dispersers in the community. Long-distance dispersal by Cebus resulted in substantial movement of seeds in and out of the 50 ha plot, and suggests that inverse modelling procedures to estimate dispersal functions from trap data may not adequately describe dispersal patterns generated by this primate.",95,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Cebus capucinus | Dispersal effectiveness | Primate dispersal | Recruitment limitation | Seed dispersal,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,36,NA,NA

Early in growth, plant populations subjected to heterogeneous conditions can achieve significantly higher yields than populations grown in homogeneous conditions that provide the same amount of nutrients. We hypothesized that this yield enhancement would be ephemeral, and that yields of populations grown under different patterns of nutrient supply will converge as time passes. We also predicted that plant size frequency distributions will continue to differ between populations in heterogeneous and homogeneous conditions, that spatial patterns of mortality will differ, and that greater mortality will occur in populations under heterogeneous conditions. An experiment was carried out on Cardamine hirsuta to test these hypotheses. 2. The experiment was harvested after 60 days, when flowering had begun in all populations. At this time, populations grown with the same nutrient supply but different patterns of supply did not differ in yield. Populations grown at higher nutrient levels had greater yields but suffered more mortality. 3. In heterogeneous conditions, plants in nutrient-rich locations were larger than plants in nutrient-poor locations, and larger than plants in identical positions in populations growing under homogeneous conditions. Plants in nutrient-rich patches in heterogeneous treatments suffered more mortality than plants in nutrient-poor patches. Contrary to prediction, total mortality at all levels of nutrient supply was significantly higher in populations in homogeneous conditions. 4. Coefficient of variation in shoot sizes was higher in populations at higher nutrient levels, but unaffected by pattern of nutrient supply. CV of root mass per unit of substrate was greater under heterogeneous than homogeneous conditions. 5. Frequency distributions of shoot size, and root mass per unit of substrate, were strikingly different between populations grown under different patterns of nutrient supply. The differences are interpreted as showing that under homogeneous conditions all parts of the habitat are heavily exploited, giving rise to uniformly high levels of interplant competition. In contrast, nutrient-poor patches in the heterogeneous treatments contain low root masses. Plants in these patches remain small, but have a high probability of survival. We propose that these differences in intensity of habitat occupation, and presumably in competition, explain the lower mortality in populations growing under heterogeneous conditions.",80,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Cardamine hirsuta | Nutrient heterogeneity | Plant competition | Plant mortality | Root biomass | Size hierarchy,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,37,NA,NA

We analysed the combined effects of environmental stress, genetic variation and population size on the performance of Succisa pratensis. 3. Individual plant performance was negatively affected by eutrophication and, to a smaller extent, by acidification. Plants originating from smaller populations performed less well and showed less genetic variation and higher inbreeding coefficients than plants from large populations. Strong interactions between population size and stress treatments reflected the fact that plants from small populations suffered more from deteriorating soil conditions than those from large populations. 4.

The total number of gaps and gap density increased over the study period, while total gap area, mean gap size and maximum gap size fluctuated.

Root development was significantly greater in split-root plants whose neighbours belonged to different plants. Furthermore, root development was relatively greater in the presence of roots of a different plant, regardless of its identity. This discrimination had a vectorial component whereby plants developed more and longer lateral roots towards neighbouring roots of different plants than towards other roots of the same plant. 4. The results thus demonstrate a mechanism of avoiding self-competition that is based on physiological co-ordination among different organs of the same plant rather than on allochemical recognition that depends on genetic differences. 5.

A field experiment in a native grassland in Central Alberta, Canada, tested whether plants alter relative allocation to roots vs. shoots in response to below-ground competition, and whether the mass of a species' root system accounts for interspecific differences in below-ground competitive response. 2. Seedlings of each of 10 native species were transplanted into the naturally occurring vegetation in the field at the start of the growing season. Root interactions between the target plants and their neighbours were manipulated through the use of PVC root exclusion tubes, with target plants grown with or without potential root interactions with their neighbours. Neighbour shoots were also tied back, forcing any target-neighbour interactions to be below ground. 3. Below-ground competition generally reduced plant growth, with its relative magnitude varying among species. 4. An allometric analysis indicated that competition below ground did not result in an increase in the relative biomass allocated to roots for any of the 10 target species. This is counter to the growth-balance hypothesis (and optimal foraging theory). Below-ground competition did increase root:shoot ratios, but this was due to reduced plant size (small plants have larger root:shoot ratios), rather than adaptive plasticity. 5. A species' below-ground competitive ability was not related to its root system size. Although this finding is counter to commonly made assumptions, it is supported by other work demonstrating below-ground competition to be generally size-symmetric. 6. Despite the majority of plant-plant interactions in grasslands being below ground, our understanding of plant competition above ground is significantly more robust. Several wide-spread assumptions regarding below-ground competition are suspect, and more multispecies studies such as this are required to provide a fuller picture of how plants respond to, and compete for, soil resources.",99,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Balanced-growth hypothesis | Below-ground competition | Community ecology | Growth allometry | Size-symmetric competition,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,41,NA,NA

In an asexually reproducing plant (Potamogeton pectinatus L.) the competitive advantage of a larger propagule over a smaller one was determined by a single parameter (α, the competitive asymmetry coefficient), independent of sowing density or average propagule size. Competitive advantage was determined by the relative size difference between propagules instead of their absolute difference. 2. Productivity per germination site increased with the number and size of propagules present, even at densities high enough to result in decreased per capita yield due to plant competition. 3. Both the number of propagules produced by a plant and their size increased with increasing per capita resource capture. Therefore, propagule size was neither equal to the size of the propagule from which the plant germinated nor independent of resource status. 4.

Fragmentation reduces size and increases isolation of plant habitats, and increases the ratio between edge and centre area. Consequences of habitat fragmentation have rarely been studied for common plants, and edge effects are rarely studied for plants in general. We studied density, population structure, fitness components and biotic inter-actions in the locally abundant distylous fen plant Primula farinosa in the centres and at the edges of 27 Swiss fen habitats of different size and degree of isolation. 2. Population sizes ranged from 80 to 106 450 flowering plants and were larger in larger fen habitats than in smaller ones. 3. The densities of plants were lower in more isolated habitats (by 26-46% depending on developmental stage). In the less isolated habitats, the density of seedlings and juveniles was higher in larger habitats. Plant densities were lower at the edge than in the centre of habitats (34-55%), and edges had fewer plants of younger developmental states. Densities of reproductive plants differed only in the centres of habitats, where they were higher in larger habitats, while at the edges these densities were independent of habitat area. 4. Flower morph proportions were independent of size and isolation of habitats. 5. Plants in larger habitats had larger rosette diameters and tended to have more flowers. 6. At edges, seed set was on average 11% lower, and occurrence and degree of herbivory more than 50% higher, than in centres. Capsule frugivory was less likely in larger habitats. Infection by the smut fungus Urocystis primulicola was more likely in larger habitats. 7.

LPBN is a parameterized simulation model of flows of nitrogen (N) in an ecosystem of cyanobacteria, grass and grazers, based on the N dynamics of a grazed Puccinellia lawn in an intertidal marsh on Hudson Bay. This system shows two alternate stable states: (a) lawns that either support a foraging population of lesser snow geese, or are not grazed by geese; and (b) exposed saline sediments that support little or no vegetation. The model represents the flow of N from cyanobacterial fixation, the major N input into the system, to the geese that migrate in autumn; those that do not return represent the major N output from the system. We have modelled N fixation, the transformations of N in the soil, plant growth, lawn regeneration, and goose grazing and grubbing. 2. The model simulates steady-state flows of N similar to those observed in the field at zero and at moderate goose density, and it also simulates the transition to the state of zero plant biomass, a consequence of increased grubbing at high goose density. The simulated steady-state flows are found to be more sensitive to changes in the parameters that describe N fixation and goose biology, than to similar changes in the parameters describing plant biology. 3. Because the model shows the alternate stable states and the transition between them, with values for the state variables that are consistent with field data, we conclude that N dynamics are crucial in determining the stability of the real salt marsh-goose system. The determining factor is the loss of the input of N from fixation when lawn area is reduced because the rate of goose grubbing exceeds that of plant re-establishment.",18,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Coastal ecosystem | Grazing | Grubbing | Lesser snow goose | Nitrogen cycle,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,44,National Center for Atmospheric Research,NA

We both measured and modelled the above-ground and below-ground biomass allocation and root morphology of non-acidic tussock tundra near Toolik Lake, Alaska, after 4 years of fertilization with nitrogen and phosphorus. 2. Compared with control plots, the fertilized plots showed significant increases in overall root weight ratio, and root biomass, root length and root nitrogen concentration in the upper soil layers. There was a strong trend towards relatively more biomass below ground. 3. We constructed an individual teleonomic (i.e. optimality) plant allocation and growth model, and a competition model in which two plants grow and compete for the limiting resources. 4. The individual plant model predicted a strong decrease in root weight ratio with increased nutrient availability, contrary to the results obtained in the field. 5. The increased investment in roots in the fertilized plots found in the field could be explained in the competition model in terms of luxury consumption of nutrients (i.e. the absorbance of nutrients in excess of the immediate plant growth requirements). For slow-growing species with relatively low phenological and physiological plasticity it can be advantageous to increase relative investment into root growth and root activity. This increased investment can limit nutrient availability to other fast-growing species and, thereby, preclude the successful invasion of these species. 6.

We examined salt marsh development over 17 years (1984-2001) in a rapidly accreting, well-drained lagoon of a macrotidal marsh in south-west Spain. Scattered, elevated tussocks of colonizing Spartina maritima expanded radially until they either coalesced or were separated only by narrow drainage channels. We recorded changes in elevation of the tussocks and investigated the cover and biomass of successive species invading them. 2. Sediment accretion produced a mean annual increase in tussock elevation of 3.5 cm. Sarcocornia perennis had begun to invade the raised centres of the tussocks by 1984, subsequently displacing Spartina maritima radially to become dominant by 1990. A hybrid form of Sarcocornia, which appeared on some of the tussocks occupied by S. perennis in 1997, also expanded radially and had achieved dominance on many of the invaded tussocks by 2001, by virtue of its more erect growth form and rapid accumulation of high above- and below-ground biomass. 3. Tussocks not yet invaded by the hybrid remain dominated by S. perennis and have maintained sediment accretion rates and redox potentials similar to those that have been invaded. 4. Genetic analysis, using random amplified DNA (RAPD) markers, indicated that the hybrid was a cross between the diploid Sarcocornia perennis (2n = 18) and the octaploid S. fruticosa (2n = 72), a high-marsh species, and suggested that each hybrid individual may have resulted from a separate pollination of an indigenous S. perennis plant. 5. Invasion by the new hybrid thus probably occurred as a result of pollen flow from high-marsh S. fruticosa, some 1 km distant, to the stigmas of the established dominant S. perennis. Succession might therefore be facilitated genetically rather than simply by the enhanced sediment accretion, which ameliorated the effects of submersion and low sediment redox potentials that presumably exclude S. fruticosa from lower parts of the marsh.",79,Journal,ar,Article,100,9,9,Genetic facilitation | Marsh elevation | Positive interaction | RAPD marker | Redox potential | Sediment accretion | Tidal wetland,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,47,NA,NA

Following the injection of 13C15N-amino acid, 15N-ammonium and 15N-nitrate tracers into soils, rates of soluble nitrogen turnover and the incorporation of 13C and 15N into plant roots and shoots were assessed.

Community assembly is described for two contrasting high Arctic chronosequences representing glacial regression of up to 2000 years on Svalbard. The chronosequences included a nutrient-poor glacier foreland (Midtre Lovénbre) and a series of nutrient-enriched islands (Lovén Islands) progressively released from below a tidewater glacier. 2. Soil development and community assembly paralleled proglacial sequences elsewhere but time scales were extended and mature vegetation types comprised species-poor prostrate communities. 3. Initial colonization by Cyanobacteria stabilized soil surfaces and raised nutrient status. Cyanobacteria formed the dominant ground cover (up to 34%) for 60 years, after when they declined. 4. Vascular plants established slowly and represented minor components of ground cover for the first 100 years. Earliest colonizers were often species with ectomycorrhizal associations, followed by mid-successional species that tended to disappear as ground cover increased. Some species present in the mature vegetation at the oldest sites, established only after 60+ years. 5. Species richness of vascular plants increased for c. 100 years, beyond when only occasional species were added. Bryophytes became increasingly dominant with time. 6. Soil development on the Midtre Lovénbre and Lovén Island chronosequences was similar after 100 years. Differences subsequently developed, with organic horizon depth, percentage organic matter and water content on the older Lovén islands significantly greater than at equivalent Midtre Lovénbre sites. This was associated with increased bryophyte cover but lower vascular plant species richness. One explanation is a slightly more favourable microclimate, coupled with nutrient input from nesting birds. 7. Communities progressively recruit from a limited pool of effectively dispersed species, each with particular ecological requirements that determine their point of entry into the community. A measure of determinism by default is suggested in the way communities assembled. 8.

Little is known, however, about how species richness and environmental factors such as soil fertility and light levels interact to affect ecosystem production. 2. To determine whether some environments promote a positive richness-production relationship, I performed an experiment using artificial plant communities, selected from a pool of six annuals and one perennial species, with different levels of species richness and composition. Each community was grown in either high or low soil fertility and either full sun or 50% shade. 3. Higher species richness significantly enhanced above-ground production. This effect did not depend on environmental treatment due to consistent sampling effects for a particularly productive and competitive species. However, overyielding, which measures the combined effect of complementarity and facilitation, did depend on environmental conditions and was enhanced by increased soil fertility in plots in full sunlight. 4. Relative yield analyses of species of different height and growth form, coupled with data on the performance of each species in monoculture, support the hypothesis that mixtures overyielded by means of light partitioning (rather than facilitation), an effect that was precluded under shaded conditions. 5.

This study analyses the effects of modifying NC concentrations in the lignotuberous Mediterranean-type shrub Erica australis, on resprouting after experimental burning. A factorial experiment with two treatments (shade and burn) was carried out, with three levels per treatment. Plants were shaded (exposure to 100%, 50% or 20% of incident radiation for 1 year), following which they were clipped (control, no fire), or clipped and burned at one of two levels of severity. After this, they were allowed to resprout and grow for 2 years. 3. Shading modified NC concentrations in the lignotuber, but not in the roots. Two years after burning, plants subjected to the greatest shading, which reduced their NC concentrations to 44% (sum of NC) or 19% (starch) of that of control plants, had suffered higher mortality after resprouting, had a significantly lower number of resprouts, of shorter length, and had produced lower biomass per plant than less shaded or unshaded plants. However, plants subjected to intermediate shade, which suffered a reduction in NC concentrations to 70% of that of control plants, did not differ in resprouting response from control plants. 4. Burning caused more direct mortality, and a severe reduction in both number or biomass of resprouts, than just clipping. There were no significant shade x burning interaction effects. 5. While reductions in NC may limit resprouting, such limitation may only occur when NC is reduced to much lower concentrations than caused by commonly experienced conditions.

Savanna species allocated more biomass to roots and maintained lower leaf area per unit plant mass (LAR), and lower leaf area per unit leaf mass (SLA). 4.

The genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity in relative growth rate (RGR) and its components was studied in Hordeum spontaneum (wild barley). Four accessions from each of nine natural populations from Israel and Iran were grown at four nutrient levels. Genetic variation in RGR and its components, differences in phenotypic plasticity, and interactions among growth and relevant morphological characteristics were studied. 2. RGR was reduced by up to 60% at decreased nutrient levels, with contributions from all components (net assimilation rate (NAR), leaf area ratio (LAR), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf mass fraction (LMF)). NAR and LAR (due mainly to LMF) were both reduced by 35% at the lowest nutrient level. 3. For growth-related traits, most genetic variation was found in LMF and LAR. Differences in RGR among populations could be largely explained by smaller seeds resulting in faster growing plants. Although mean population seed weight correlated negatively with humidity at the sampling site, multivariate analyses showed that differences in growth and morphology among populations were not significantly correlated with differences in environmental conditions in their natural habitats. 4. The level of plasticity in RGR did not differ among populations or accessions-within-populations. By contrast, the RGR components LMF and LAR differed in plasticity, both among populations and among accessions-within-populations. RGR seems to be buffered from changes in plasticity by a trade-off in degree of plasticity between the underlying components (NAR and LAR). 5.

Spatial pattern analyses were used to generate hypotheses about the processes that shape the structure of a plant community in the Mojave Desert of North America, with a focus on the semi-shrub Ambrosia dumosa. We analysed spatial distributions and sizes of this species relative to other semi-shrubs, shrubs and annuals, and the relationships between spatial patterns and abiotic and biotic habitat characteristics. 2. The analyses were based on maps of sample plots placed along a transect spanning two adjacent geological substrates: aeolian sand and gravelly, sandy to loamy alluvium. Of these two substrates, sand supported higher total biomasses of Ambrosia and of all woody perennials, while alluvium supported on average higher biomasses of winter annuals. 3. Annuals and seedlings of Ambrosia were much more strongly aggregated with Ambrosia canopies on sand than on alluvium, suggesting that these small plants were more strongly facilitated by Ambrosia on sand than on alluvium. 4. Ambrosia semi-shrubs were spatially segregated on sand but aggregated on alluvium, and the degree of segregation on sand increased with the total above-ground biomass of Ambrosia per unit area, indicating that negative interactions between Ambrosia plants were stronger in more productive habitats. Canopy sizes of Ambrosia in all mapped plots increased with distance to the nearest conspecific neighbour, which suggests that neighbour interactions negatively affected plant sizes. 5. Ambrosia plants on sand were spatially aggregated with Acamptopappus sphaerocephalus semi-shrubs, suggesting that at least one of these species may benefit from the association. Ambrosia plants were spatially segregated from Larrea tridentata shrubs on both substrates, possibly due to negative effects of Larrea roots on Ambrosia roots reported in previous studies. 6. Subtle differences in substrate characteristics were correlated with strong differences in the spatial distribution of Ambrosia plants relative to their neighbours, which suggests that edaphic conditions may affect the spatial structure of the community by modifying complex positive and negative interactions between neighbouring plants.",83,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Ambrosia dumosa | Desert annuals | Habitat quality | Positive and negative plant interactions | Replicated maps | Scale-dependent spatial patterns | Soil texture,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,58,NA,NA

We elucidated the critical life stages and processes in the recruitment of Rhamnus ludovici-salvatoris, a dioecious shrub endemic to the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean), populations of which have been shrinking in recent decades. We evaluated transition probabilities between all stages involved in regeneration from pollination to seedling recruitment, in order to determine the overall probability of an ovule in a flower becoming an established individual in a population. 2. We compared populations in an oak (Quercus ilex) forest and in a more disturbed habitat (an abandoned field). We studied seed rain and probabilities of predation, germination and survival in the main microhabitats within each community. 3. High levels of seed predation after dispersal and unfavourable conditions (water deficit) during germination and recruitment periods were the most critical factors limiting population growth in both habitats. 4. The greater fecundity of shrubs in the abandoned field did not compensate for the lower probability of ovules recruiting new individuals in that habitat compared to the forest. 5. Spatial patterns of recruitment in this species cannot be predicted from seed dispersal patterns produced by frugivorous birds. In both habitats, but especially in the forest, there was strong spatial discordance between seed rain (most seeds were deposited under conspecifics) and seedling establishment. In the forest, most established Rhamnus are found under oaks, whereas in the abandoned field, saplings and juveniles are more equally distributed across different microhabitats. 6. This empirical study supports the idea that habitat disturbance, in general, may considerably alter the patterns of plant recruitment.

A 3-year field study examined the physiological and demographic consequences of resource pulse use by an herbaceous, aridland perennial, Cryptantha flava, as well as potential competitive and facilitative interactions with larger shrubs. 2. We applied a pulse of urea and faecal pellets, simulating Mule deer excretions, to plants growing between and under Sagebrush and Rabbitbrush canopies. 3. We hypothesized that C. flava would show strong positive responses to N pulses in open microhabitats, and such plants had approximately 50% increases in leaf N concentrations within days of pulse application, accompanied by increased photosynthetic rates. Over the next year, higher rates of growth and reproduction were found in the plants receiving supplemental N. 4. We predicted that due to shading, plants would not respond to N pulses when growing under shrubs but supplemental N caused increases in leaf N similar to that in open growing plants. However, the response of both growth and reproduction was less than in the open, suggesting at least partial light limitation. 5. In 2000, a year of below average precipitation, all plants decreased in size, but survival was facilitated under shrubs (93%) relative to that of open plants (84%). 6.

In order to test whether the observed invasion of ombrotrophic bogs in the Netherlands by Molinia caerulea and Betula pubescens is the result of long-term high nitrogen (N) loads, we conducted a 3-year fertilization experiment with Sphagnum fallax turfs. Six different N treatments were applied ranging from 0 (control) to 4 g N m-2 year-1. 2. During the experimental period, ammonium concentrations in the peat moisture remained very low due to high uptake rates by Sphagnum. Tissue N concentrations in S. fallax showed a linear response to the experimental N addition. Excess N was accumulated as N-rich free amino acids such as arginine, asparagine and glutamine, especially at N addition rates of 0.25 g m-2 year-1 or higher, indicating N-saturation. 3. Despite the high tissue N: P ratio (above 35), above-ground biomass production by Molinia was still stimulated at N addition rates of 4 g m-2 year-1, and foliar nutrient concentrations were unaffected compared to the control. In contrast to Molinia, Betula was unable to increase its above-ground biomass. Foliar N concentrations in Betula were significantly higher at N addition rates of 4 g m-2 year-1 and excess N was stored in foliar arginine, making up 27% of the total N concentration. Evapotranspiration was increased at higher N addition rates due to stimulated total above-ground biomass production of the vegetation. 4. N addition at the actual Dutch deposition rate of 4 g m-2 year-1 stimulated the growth of Molinia in this experiment, providing evidence that the observed dominance of Molinia on ombrotrophic bogs in the Netherlands is caused by high N deposition levels. Based on the observed changes in biomass production and tissue nutrient concentrations, we assume that a long-term deposition of 0.5 g N m-2 year-1, or higher, leads to undesirable changes in species composition and increased risk of desiccation.",121,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Betula pubescens | Molinia caerulea | Nitrogen deposition | Ombrotrophic bog | Sphagnum fallax,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,61,NA,NA

At both mires, the contribution of bulk precipitation to the concentration of major ions in mire pore-water was much greater in the ombrotrophic than in the minerotrophic part, because of the raised morphology of the mires, which limited the inflow of mineral soil water to the margins. The only ions strongly depleted in mire pore-water compared with precipitation were K+, NO3- and NH4+ and these were therefore limiting to plant growth. 4. Higher SO42- concentration in pore-water at the Swedish mire, which experienced lower atmospheric inputs of sulphate, was probably caused by oxidative processes during a long dry period in the summer before sampling. 5. Higher rates of NO3-, NH4+, as well as SO42- atmospheric inputs at the Italian mire were reflected in significantly higher N and, partly, S concentrations in ombrotrophic Sphagna.

In 1998, the forests of Lambir Hills National Park experienced a severe drought. Between late January and mid-April, less than one-fifth of the normal expected rainfall was received.

Mortality rates for the pre-drought and drought periods were calculated using maximum likelihood techniques. Forest wide mortality rates during the drought were 7.63% year-1 as compared to 2.40% year-1 during the pre-drought period. Logistic regression was used to investigate habitat effects.

Most plant demographic studies follow marked individuals in permanent plots. Plots tend to be small, so detectability is assumed to be one for every individual. However, detectability could be affected by factors such as plant traits, time, space, observer, previous detection, biotic interactions, and especially by life-state. 2. We used a double-observer survey and closed population capture-recapture modelling to estimate state-specific detectability of the orchid Cleistes bifaria in a long-term study plot of 41.2 m2. Based on AICc model selection, detectability was different for each life-state and for tagged vs. previously untagged plants. There were no differences in detectability between the two observers. 3. Detectability estimates (SE) for one-leaf vegetative, two-leaf vegetative, and flowering/fruiting states correlated with mean size of these states and were 0.76 (0.05), 0.92 (0.06), and 1 (0.00), respectively, for previously tagged plants, and 0.84 (0.08), 0.75 (0.22), and 0 (0.00), respectively, for previously untagged plants. (We had insufficient data to obtain a satisfactory estimate of previously untagged flowering plants). 4. Our estimates are for a medium-sized plant in a small and intensively surveyed plot. It is possible that detectability is even lower for larger plots and smaller plants or smaller life-states (e.g. seedlings) and that detectabilities < I are widespread in plant demographic studies. 5. State-dependent detectabilities are especially worrying since they will lead to a size- or state-biased sample from the study plot. Failure to incorporate detectability into demographic estimation methods introduces a bias into most estimates of population parameters such as fecundity, recruitment, mortality, and transition rates between life-states. We illustrate this by a simple example using a matrix model, where a hypothetical population was stable but, due to imperfect detection, wrongly projected to be declining at a rate of 8% per year. 6. Almost all plant demographic studies are based on models for discrete states. State and size are important predictors both for demographic rates and detectability. We suggest that even in studies based on small plots, state- or size-specific detectability should be estimated at least at some point to avoid biased inference about the dynamics of the population sampled.",68,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Capture-recapture models | Closed population models | Plant census | Plant demography,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,66,NA,NA

The ability of seeds to survive desiccation is an important functional trait and is an integral part of plant regeneration ecology. Despite this, the topic has received relatively little attention from ecologists. In this study, we examine the relationships between seed desiccation tolerance and two important aspects of plant regeneration ecology: habitat and dormancy. This is done by comparative analysis of a data set of 886 tree and shrub species from 93 families. 2. The proportion of species displaying desiccation sensitive seeds declines as the habitat becomes drier, and possibly also cooler, although the latter observation requires cautious interpretation. Desiccation sensitivity is most common in moist, relatively aseasonal vegetation zones, but is infrequent in, though not absent from arid and highly seasonal habitats. 3. The highest frequency of desiccation sensitivity occurs in non-pioneer evergreen rain forest trees, although 48% of the species examined have desiccation tolerant seeds. In contrast, all pioneer taxa within the data set have drying tolerant seeds. 4. Desiccation sensitivity is more frequent in seeds that are non-dormant on shedding (c. 31%), than dormant (c. 9%). Highest frequencies of drying tolerance occur in seeds with physical or combinational dormancy, at 99% and 100%, respectively. 5. Although there is an association between non-dormancy and desiccation sensitivity in both tropical and temperate zones, the relationship does not appear to be causal. 6. Working from the hypothesis that seed desiccation sensitivity represents a derived state in extant species, we use the results to investigate and discuss possible ecological trade-offs and associated fitness advantages. These may explain the hypothesized repeated loss of this trait.

We estimated the dry, living, above-ground biomass (AGB) standing stock and its turnover in a 50-hectare forest plot located in moist tropical forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The estimates were obtained using inventory data collected every 5 years from 1985 to 2000, including measurements of all trees ≥ 1 cm diameter. 2. Four different allometric regressions relating trunk diameter and height with AGB were compared. Based on the most consistent method, we estimated that the Barro Colorado forest holds 281 ± 20 Mg ha-1 (1 Mg = 103 kg) of AGB, lianas included. A third of the AGB is stored in trees larger than 70 cm in diameter. 3. Stand-level AGB increment (growth plus recruitment) was highest in the period 1985-90 (7.05 ± 0.32 Mg ha-1 year-1, mean ± 95% confidence limits based on samples of multiple hectares) and smallest in the period 1990-95 (5.25 ± 0.26 Mg ha-1 year-1), while AGB losses were similar during the three intervals (mean 5.43 ± 0.72 Mg ha-1 year-1). This resulted in significant differences in AGB change (defined as increment minus loss) among census intervals; including branchfalls, the AGB of Barro Colorado Island increased in 1985-90 (+0.82 ± 0.84 Mg ha-1 year-1), decreased in 1990-95 (-0.69 ± 0.82 Mg ha-1 year-1), and increased again in 1995-2000 (+0.45 ± 0.70 Mg ha-1 year-1). The 15-year average was +0.20 Mg ha-1 year-1, but with a confidence interval that spanned zero (-0.68 to 0.63 Mg ha-1 year-1). 4. Branchfalls and partial breakage of stems had a significant influence on the AGB changes. They contributed an average of 0.46 Mg ha-1 year-1 to the AGB loss. About 5% of AGB increment was due to trees less than 10 cm in diameter. 5. To test whether the AGB of tropical forests is increasing due to climate change, we propose that in each forest type, at least 10 hectares of forest be inventoried, and that measurements of the small classes (< 10 cm diameter) as well as large size classes be included.

N dynamics were assessed in two consecutive years with contrasting precipitation. 2. Net N mineralization was lower in stands of the three conifers and one of three broadleaf evergreen species than in stands of the other six broad-leaf species (40-77 vs. 87-250 mg N kg-1 after 16-week incubations) and higher in the wetter year. 3. The proportion of N nitrified was high beneath most species regardless of mineralization rates, soil N fertility and leaf litter quality, and was significantly higher for the wetter year. Ammonium was the predominant form of N in three sites affected by seasonal waterlogging and in two sites the predominant form changed from ammonium in the drier year to nitrate during the wetter year, probably due to differences in soil texture affecting soil moisture. 4. Net N mineralization was linearly related to microbial biomass N, implying that the microbial activity per biomass unit was quite similar beneath all species. Constant microbial biomass during the wetter year suggested that as mineralization/nitrification increased, there was a higher potential risk of N losses. 5. Although the litter lignin : N ratio allowed differentiation of soil N dynamics between broad-leaf species and conifers, its constant value (23-28) in all broad-leaf species made it a poor predictor of the differences found within this group. Across all sites and between broad-leaf species, soil N dynamics were best explained by a combination of leaf litter lignin and soil chemistry indicators, particularly soil total N for net N mineralization and net nitrification, and soil organic C for microbial biomass N.",88,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Litter lignin: N ratio | Microbial biomass N | Net N mineralization | Net nitrification | Temperate forests | Volcanic soils,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,71,NA,NA

The lowland rain forest at Pasoh Forest Reserve in Peninsular Malaysia is subject to disturbance by native wild pigs (Sus scrofa). Female pigs snap off woody plants up to 3.5 m tall to construct nests for reproduction, damaging > 170 000 saplings km-2 year-2. We investigated the ability of 1808 woody saplings to survive and resprout over a 3-year period following pig and experimental stem snap. 2. Most plants resprouted to some degree, but, in understorey conditions, growth of new shoots was slow. More than 90% of stems were alive 3 months after damage, but > 40% had not yet produced a single fully expanded leaf. Mortality at 36 months was higher for resprouting saplings (33%) than for undamaged control saplings (9%). Survival of damaged stems was highly and positively correlated with stump basal diameter. Canopy species consistently showed lower survivorship than midstorey, understorey and treelet species but no differences in survivorship were found for habit (tree vs. liana) or leaf morphology (simple vs. compound). 3. The number and total length of resprout shoots (TSL) were strongly, positively correlated with stump diameter. Canopy species produced greater TSL but fewer new shoots than did smaller-stature species. Trees and lianas produced similar TSL at 3 and 6 months, but trees produced more TSL at 12 and 36 months. Simple-leaved plants consistently had longer TSL than compound-leaved plants. 4. Both species and families differed greatly in terms of survival, TSL and number of shoots. Dipterocarpaceae, which comprises 24% of basal area in the forest, and Euphorbiaceae, the most species-rich family, had especially poor survivorship of damaged individuals. 5. Our results suggest that elevated pig densities found in small forest reserves such as Pasoh are likely to alter tree community composition as a result of the differential ability of species to regenerate following physical disturbance. Regeneration of canopy tree species, particularly in the silviculturally important and heavily dominant family Dipterocarpaceae, may be particularly susceptible to pig-related disturbance.",42,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Dipterocarp forest | Nest building | Pasoh Forest Reserve | Physical disturbance | Sus scrofa,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,73,NA,NA

The structure and functioning of riverine ecosystems is dependent upon regional setting and the interplay of hydrologic regime and geomorphologic processes. We used a retrospective analysis to study recruitment along broad, alluvial valley segments (parks) and canyon segments of the unregulated Yampa River and the regulated Green River in the upper Colorado River basin, USA. We precisely aged 811 individuals of Populus deltoides ssp. wislizenii (native) and Tamarix ramosissima (exotic) from 182 wooded patches and determined the elevation and character of the germination surface for each. We used logistic regression to relate recruitment events (presence or absence of cohort) to five flow and two weather parameters. 2. Woody plant establishment occurred via multiple pathways at patch, reach and segment scales. Recruitment occurred through establishment on (1) vertically accreting bars in the unregulated alluvial valley, (2) high alluvial floodplain surfaces during rare large flood events, (3) vertically accreting channel margin deposits in canyon pools and eddies, (4) vertically accreting intermittent/abandoned channels, (5) low elevation gravel bars and debris fans in canyons during multi-year droughts, and (6) bars and channels formed prior to flow regulation on the dammed river during controlled flood events. 3. The Yampa River's peak flow was rarely included in models estimating the likelihood that recruitment would occur in any year. Flow variability and the interannual pattern of flows, rather than individual large floods, control most establishment. 4. Regulation of the Green River flow since 1962 has had different effects on woody vegetation recruitment in canyons and valleys. The current regime mimics drought in a canyon setting, accelerating Tamarix invasion whereas in valleys the ongoing geomorphic adjustment of the channel, combined with reduced flow variability, has nearly eliminated Populus establishment. 5. A single year's flow or a particular pattern of flows over a sequence of years, whether natural or man-made, produces different recruitment opportunities in alluvial and canyon reaches, in diverse landforms within a particular river reach, and for Populus and Tamarix.

We report an experimental study of the effects of pattern of nutrient supply on the early stages of growth in populations of Cardamine hirsuta. Populations were grown with nutrients provided in one of four spatial patterns (three heterogeneous and one homogeneous). In the three heterogeneous treatments, nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor substrate patches of different sizes were set up in chequerboard patterns, with patches of each type accounting in total for half of the substrate, both by volume and area. All treatments provided the same total quantity of nutrients. 2. After 31 days of growth, populations in the heterogeneous treatments had produced significantly more root, shoot and total biomass than those in homogeneous conditions. The coefficient of variation in shoot sizes, and the variation in root biomass per unit of substrate, were also significantly greater in populations growing under heterogeneous conditions. In the heterogeneous treatments significantly more than 50% of the biomass was located in nutrient-rich patches, and this proportion increased significantly as patch size increased. 3. In heterogeneous treatments, yield of plant parts from nutrient-rich locations was significantly greater than that of plant parts in nutrient-poor locations. It was also significantly greater than that recovered from equivalent locations in the homogeneous treatment. 4. We conclude that the spatial configuration of nutrients significantly affects plant population yield, the spatial distribution of population biomass, and plant size hierarchy during the early stages of population growth, even when total nutrient supply is held constant.

Although it is well established that nitrogen and light play major roles in structuring plant communities across the landscape, it is not as clear how they structure communities within forest stands. Virtually nothing is known about within-stand structure of understorey communities of herbs and small shrubs in near-boreal forests. 2. We tested the hypothesis that fine-scale (5-20 m) variability in N and light structure forest-floor plant communities in two old-growth mixed Pinus resinosa and Pinus strobus forests in north-eastern Minnesota, USA. 3. In each forest, all trees > 1.4 m tall were mapped on a 0.75-1.0 ha area. A grid of subplots 5-10 m apart was established (total n = 147), and N mineralization (μg g-1 soil day-1), soil depth (cm), light (% canopy openness), and percentage cover of all herbs and small shrubs were measured on each subplot. 4. Cluster analysis showed that the dominant understorey species fall into three groups. Group 1 is unrelated to N and light, and is negatively associated with a midstorey of the small tree Acer rubrum and the most abundant tall shrub Corylus cornuta. Group 2 reaches maximum abundance in places (mostly gaps) with relatively high light, but is unrelated to within-stand variation in N availability. Group 3 consists of a single species, Aster macrophyllus, and reaches maximum abundance in areas with low N availability and low abundance of Corylus, but higher than average abundance of P. strobus and Betula papyrifera overstorey trees. 5. N and light have a moderate influence on understorey plant community structure. The plant species do arrange themselves along N and light gradients, but the gradients are likely to be too narrow to allow the degree of differentiation seen at the landscape level.

The ability to transfer resources between separately rooted ramets through connecting stems or roots can increase the performance of clonal plants in heterogeneous environments, However, the degree to which connected ramets share resources differs between and within clonal species. This may be because a higher potential for resource sharing is selected for in more heterogeneous habitats. To test this, it was hypothesized that: (i) genotypes with a relatively high potential for resource sharing will accumulate more biomass in a highly heterogeneous environment than genotypes of the same species with a relatively low potential for resource sharing; (ii) disconnecting ramets to prevent sharing will eliminate this difference between genotypes; and (iii) there will be no relationship between potential for resource sharing and accumulation of biomass in a homogeneous environment. 2. Pairs of connected and disconnected ramets of three genotypes of the stoloniferous herb Fragaria chiloensis that had previously been shown to differ in potential for carbon sharing were grown in two environments in a glasshouse. In the heterogeneous environment, which was designed to mimic a natural pattern of resource heterogeneity encountered by F. chiloensis, one of the ramets in each pair was given lower light and higher nitrogen than the other. In the homogeneous environment, both ramets in each pair were given the same resource levels. 3. In the heterogeneous environment, the genotypes with the highest and the intermediate levels of resource sharing accumulated significantly more biomass than the genotype with the lowest level of sharing. Disconnecting ramets to prevent resource sharing eliminated these differences between genotypes, suggesting that the differences in biomass between the genotypes when grown in this environment were specifically due to differences in resource sharing. The net effect of ramet connection on biomass, measured as the difference between biomass of connected and disconnected ramets, was consistently higher in genotypes with a higher potential for resource sharing. In the homogeneous environment, the different genotypes performed similarly whether ramets were connected or not, and there was no net effect of connection on performance in any genotype. Although only three genotypes were tested in only two environments, these results were generally consistent with the hypotheses, and suggest that resource sharing in clonal plants may represent an adaptation to resource patchiness. 4. A second characteristic that is found in clonal but not in non-clonal plants is 'division of labour', the tendency for ramets to specialize to acquire resources that are locally abundant but scarce for ramets to which they are connected. Genotypes did not differ in their potential for division of labour between ramets, as measured by the effect of connection on allocation to roots in the heterogeneous environment. This suggests that potential for resource sharing may not be strongly associated with potential for division of labour in F. chiloensis.",71,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Clonal plant | Genetic differentiation | Light and nitrogen availability | Physiological integration | Resource patchiness,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,80,NA,NA

All individuals of two successive cohorts that appeared in a 8 × 8-m quadrat were mapped, and their fate and size were recorded at 2-3 month intervals from March 1998 to July 2000. We analysed spatial and temporal changes in the relative importance of plant size, local densities of neighbouring plants and ground surface conditions to determine plant mortality. We also examined spatially non-random mortality and its spatial scales. 3. Patchy seed dispersal from scattered mother plants resulted in a clumped distribution of seedlings. During the growth cycle of L. rubida, we recognized two growth stages that differed in the relative importance of the factors affecting plant mortality. 4. At the earlier growth stage, after germination in March until July, mortality was caused mainly by local density. Smaller plants within areas of high local densities were more likely to die. The spatial patterns of surviving and dead plants tended to be regular and aggregated, respectively, in comparison with those expected from random mortality. The spatial scale of aggregation of the dead plants was 5-25 cm, corresponding to the distance of direct interactions between neighbours. 5. At the later growth stages, in October until May of the following year, mortality was affected mainly by ground surface conditions. Both surviving and dead plants were spatially aggregated at spatial scales of 20-100 cm. Plants tended to survive in microhabitats of smaller gravel, which had a greater water-holding capacity. 6.

Past work on tropical rain forest tree seedlings has been dominated by contrasts between strongly light-demanding and strongly shade-tolerant species.

Seedlings of 15 tree species from Australian tropical lowland forest were grown for up to 1 year in neutral-density shadehouses at three light levels (10%, 0.8% and 0.2% full daylight). All species showed negligible mortality in the 10% and 0.8% shadehouses, but survival was significantly reduced in 0.2% daylight. 3.

The RGRM values in 0.8% and 10% daylight were strongly positively correlated, and showed a strong negative correlation with the dry mass of seed reserves. Interspecific variation in low-light RGRM was driven by unit leaf rate (rate of accumulation of dry mass per unit area of leaf), whereas interspecific variation in high-light RGRM was most closely correlated with leaf area ratio (leaf area per total plant dry mass). 5.

Summer floods whose severity is affected by flooding duration, submergence depth and underwater light availability, have a large impact on the zonation of riparian plant species. 2. We analysed the range and variability of these flooding components in the River Rhine and quantified their effects on the ability of Arrhenatherum elatius, Achillea millefolium, Rumex acetosa and Rumex crispus, to survive periods of submergence under experimental conditions. 3. Survival characteristics were used to model species' lower distribution boundaries for extreme and average floods and were compared with the current field distribution. Different light conditions were simulated by implementing three scenarios of suspended load. 4. Extreme deep Rhine floods are characterized by very low median light transmission levels (i.e. below 0.5%). The largest survival responses in the experiment were observed at such low levels (0.4-3.5 μmol m-2 s-1). Strong effects of light were found in R. crispus and A. millefolium, but responses were weaker in A. elatius and R. acetosa. Submergence depth also affected survival, but not as strongly as light. 5. For the flood intolerant species (A. millefolium and A. elatius) the average flood was predicted to have little effect on field distributions under normal light conditions. However, their actual field distributions in 2000 corresponded to the predicted lower boundaries in the extreme years. This suggests that extreme years determine the distributions of these species for many years. The suspended load scenarios significantly modified the predicted lower boundaries in both extreme and average years, implying that plant lower distribution limits may be significantly shifted upwards or downwards depending on the suspended load of the river system. 6. The predicted lower boundaries of the intermediately tolerant R. acetosa and the highly tolerant R. crispus for both extreme and average years were below the actual field distribution in 2000. This suggests that their current distribution is only partly influenced by major flood disturbances and that other factors, either proximate or historical, may play a prominent role.",203,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Disturbance | Flooding regime | Floodplain zonation | Light attenuation | Submergence | Survival | Suspended load,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,86,NA,NA

As peatlands form they create a temporal archive of community development, allowing the reconstruction of vegetation dynamics through the analysis of sediments and the development of detailed chronologies of successional change. Peatland formation occurs through two mechanisms: (i) terrestrialization, when a water body fills with sediments and peat; and (ii) paludification, the conversion of dry land to peatland. In temperate regions, where high summer temperatures may limit peat accumulation, general models of peatland development suggest that allogenic factors such as climate change control peatland development and that terrestrialization is the primary mechanism of formation. 2. This study evaluates this widely accepted model by comparing the developmental histories of three peatlands within the same climate region in New England in order to: (i) describe the development and timing of successional events among peatlands; (ii) document the roles of paludification and terrestrialization as developmental mechanisms; and (iii) evaluate the importance of climate change vs. autogenic factors in peatland development in this temperate region. 3. Basin morphometry, sediment stratigraphies, and chronologies of community change determined through radiocarbon dating indicate that peatland development at each site involved terrestrialization followed by paludification, with no apparent influence of broad-scale climate change on the timing of these processes. Paludification was consistently initiated coincident with the consolidation of a shrub mat across each lake-basin, and was controlled in extent and rate by the topography of the adjoining uplands. The timing of stratigraphic changes varied among sites, suggesting that autogenic factors associated with the accumulation of peat rather than regional climate change controlled development. These results provide the foundation for a model of temperate peatland development driven by autogenic factors and caution against the use of temperate peatland development as a proxy for climatic reconstruction.",45,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Allogenic control | Autogenic control | Climate | New England | Paludification | Peatland | Stratigraphy | Terrestrialization,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,87,NA,NA

We used a path-analytical model to analyse the possible relationships between these variables and performance. 2. Plants in smaller populations produced fewer seeds per flower head. Their seeds had lower germination rates and higher seedling mortality, and more seeds were dormant or non-viable. 3. Population size was also correlated with genetic measures. Small populations had higher inbreeding coefficients than large populations and observed heterozygosity was positively correlated with population size. The mean genetic diversity (expected heterozygosity) was relatively high (Hexp = 0.42), but not correlated with population size. 4. Less eutrophic habitats appeared to support larger populations. High concentrations of NH4 and NO3 in the soil were significantly negatively correlated with population size. 5. Path-analysis showed that Succisa pratensis is vulnerable to habitat deterioration (eutrophication). Population size was strongly influenced by habitat quality. Reduced performance, however, was better explained by direct genetic effects and by habitat deterioration rather than by effects of population size per se. Both habitat quality and genetic effects are thus important for population persistence, even in the short term. The results suggest that there will be a continuing decline of the small populations, due to deteriorating habitat conditions, decreased genetic variation and a reduced reproductive capacity.",161,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Conservation biology | Fitness | Inbreeding | Path analysis | Small populations,29602,undefined,0,FALSE,NA,NA,88,NA,NA

In the Great Basin of the western United States of America, the invasive annual grass Bromus tectorum has extensively replaced native shrub and bunchgrass communities, but the native bunchgrass Elymus elymoides has been reported to suppress Bromus. Curlew Valley, a site in Northern Utah, provides a model community to test the effects of particular species on invasion by examining competitive relationships among Elymus, Bromus and the native shrub Artemisia tridentata. 2. The site contains Bromus/Elymus, Elymus/Artemisia and monodominant Elymus stands. Transect data indicate that Elymus suppresses Bromus disproportionately relative to its above-ground cover. Artemisia seedlings recruit in Elymus stands but rarely in the presence of Bromus. This relationship might be explained by competition between the two grasses involving a different resource or occurring in a different season to that between each grass and Artemisia. 3. Time reflectometry data collected in monodominant patches indicated that in spring, soil moisture use by Bromus is rapid, whereas depletion under Elymus and Artemisia is more moderate. Artemisia seedlings may therefore encounter a similar moisture environment in monodominant or mixed perennial stands. However, efficient autumn soil moisture use by Elymus may help suppress Bromus. 4. In competition plots, target Artemisia grown with Bromus were stunted relative to those grown with Elymus, despite equivalent above-ground biomass of the two grasses. Competition for nitrogen in spring and autumn, assessed with 15N tracer, appears to be secondary to moisture availability in determining competitive outcomes. 5.

Saturation-excess overland flow was found to dominate the flashy flow regime; acrotelm stormflow, subsurface pipeflow and macropore flow were also found to be important components of the ecohydrological system. 3.

Many narrowly endemic species are restricted to distinctive edaphic environments. The adaptations that make these species successful in their restricted habitat may incur a cost, and decrease their success in more common habitats. We compared growth, biomass allocation and root morphology of two narrowly endemic Hakea species (Proteaceae) of Mediterranean south-western Australia with those of five more widespread congeners, in a glasshouse study. The rare Hakea species occur in endangered winter-wet shrublands that grow on skeletal (0-20 cm deep) soils overlying massive ironstone rock, whereas their common congeners occur nearby on deeper wetland and non-wetland soils. 2. The ironstone endemics differed consistently from their widespread congeners in some important root characteristics. During early development they allocated relatively more biomass to their roots, and had a higher specific root length due to a lower average root diameter and a lower root mass density. Therefore, when compared at the same plant mass, the ironstone endemics had a considerably greater total root length. 3. The ironstone endemics also favoured root growth in deeper layers of the substrate: they invested up to 64% of their root mass in the bottom 10 cm of 40-cm-deep pots, vs. 35% for common species. Only in the ironstone endemics did the extension of the main root axis continue at the same rate after reaching the bottom of the pot. 4. We suggest that the observed differences are the consequence of evolutionary tradeoffs, and represent specializations of the endemic species to increase the chances of getting access to water before the onset of severe summer drought in these habitats. However, while adaptive in a shallow-soil habitat, these traits may reduce success on deeper soils by compromising both below-ground and above-ground competitive abilities.",62,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Biomass allocation | Endemic | Hakea | Ironstone community | Root morphology | Shallow soils | Specialization | Trade-off,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,91,NA,NA

The ongoing enrichment of the atmosphere with CO2 raises the question of whether growth of forest trees, which represent close to 90% of the global biomass carbon, is still carbon limited at current concentrations of close to 370 p.p.m. As photosynthesis of C3 plants is not CO2-saturated at such concentrations, enhanced 'source activity' of leaves could stimulate 'sink activity' (i.e. growth) of plants, provided other resources and developmental controls permit. I explore current levels of non-structural carbon in trees in natural forests in order to estimate the potential for a carbon-driven stimulation of growth. 2. The concentration of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in tree tissues is considered a measure of carbon shortage or surplus for growth. A periodic reduction of NSC pools indicates either that carbon demand exceeds con-current supply, or that both source and sink activity are low. A steady, very high NSC concentration is likely to indicate that photosynthesis fully meets, or even exeeds, that needed for growth (surplus assimilates accumulate). 3. The analysis presented here considers data for mature trees in four climatic zones: the high elevation treeline (in Mexico, the Alps and Northern Sweden), a temperate lowland forest of central Europe, Mediterranean sclerophyllous woodland and a semideciduous tropical forest in Panama. 4. In all four climatic regions, periods of reduced or zero growth show maximum C-loading of trees (source activity exceeding demand), except for dry midsummer in the Mediterranean. NSC pools are generally high throughout the year, and are not significantly affected by mass fruiting episodes. 5. It is concluded that, irrespective of the reason for its periodic cessation, growth does not seem to be limited by carbon supply. Instead, in all the cases examined, sink activity and its direct control by the environment or developmental constraints, restricts biomass production of trees under current ambient CO2 concentrations. 6. The current carbohydrate charging of mature wild trees from the tropics to the cold limit of tree growth suggests that little (if any) leeway exists for further CO2-fertilization effects on growth.",749,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,Carbohydrates | Climate | Elevated CO 2 | Forest growth | Latitude | Season | Storage,29602,undefined,1,TRUE,all,All Open Access,92,NA,NA

We assessed the responses of tree populations in an old-growth Southern mixed-hardwood forest in northern Florida to hurricane disturbance. The most recent, Hurricane Kate (1985), damaged 41% and killed 7% of the overstorey trees, eliminated 8% of the basal area, and increased the area in canopy gaps from 31% to 62%. 2. We focused on changes in recruitment, growth and mortality of trees of the 10 most abundant tree species (> 93% of the basal area). We analysed data from 7149 trees ≥ 2 cm d.b.h., recorded in periodic censuses of a 4.5-ha plot over the period spanning 7 years before and 7 years after the disturbance. 3. After Hurricane Kate, recruitment into the ≥ 2 cm d.b.h. class increased sixfold, and rates of growth and survival increased for saplings and understorey trees, but decreased for overstorey trees. 4. We classified the tree populations into four previously defined syndromes of response to disturbance according to observed mortality, recruitment and growth patterns. Pinus glabra exhibited the Resilient syndrome, with high tree mortality but massive recruitment after the hurricane. Two subcanopy species (Carpinus caroliniana and Ostrya virginiana) and three canopy species (Liquidambar styraciflua, Quercus michauxii and Q. nigra), exhibited the Usurper syndrome, showing low tree damage, some release of understorey trees and saplings, and substantial recruitment. Ilex opaca (subcanopy), and Fagus grandifolia and Nyssa sylvatica (canopy), exhibited the Resistant syndrome, characterized by low tree damage and little increase in recruitment. The main canopy dominant, Magnolia grandifolia, exhibited the Susceptible syndrome; it had large reductions in growth and survival and no detectable release of understorey individuals. 5. Short-term persistence was not compromised by Hurricane Kate in any of the 10 tree populations because the majority of trees were resistant to hurricane damage. The long-term persistence of populations exhibiting the Resistant syndrome appeared to be independent of hurricane disturbance.

A literature comparison of 14 radiocarbon-dated macrofossil records of raised peat bog initiation indicates that there is a relationship between the prevailing climate and the character of the first ombrotrophic vegetation communities at peatland sites in Britain and Ireland. 2. All that is required for ombrotrophy is the separation of the mire growing surface from the influence of surface and subsurface waters. This could occur via vertical accumulation of the peat mass or a lowering of the water table. The establishment of bog species can be rapid once isolation occurs. 3. Peatlands may become ombrotrophic in a variety of water table conditions and climatic regimes. There are at least two distinctive routes to ombrotrophy, via a 'dry-pioneer oligotrophic community' or via a 'wet-pioneer oligotrophic community'. 4. Tregaron South-east Bog does not fit the pattern suggested by the literature comparison. The Fen-Bog Transition (FBT) occurred in a period of increased effective precipitation but the first ombrotrophic community was indicative of relatively dry, 'hummocky' bog and a deep or unstable water table. 5.

Sexual differentiation of Equisetum (horsetails) gametophytes is influenced by environmental conditions, and wild populations tend to be female biased. We show that photon irradiance has a very significant and reproducible effect on sex determination in three species of Equisetum grown in vitro. 2. Under our experimental conditions, high light levels (PAR = 24-48 μmol m-2 s-1) induce most gametophytes to differentiate as female, whereas only males are observed at PAR < 6 μmol m-2s-1. Addition of sugar to the culture medium, however, promotes male development, suggesting that the effect of increasing photon irradiance is not related to the accumulation of photosynthates. 3. According to evolutionary theory, environmental sex determination can cause population sex ratios to deviate from unity, and is favoured when the environment consists of patches that differentially affect fitness as a male or a female. However, in two out of three species, we found that the fitness of males increases faster than the fitness of females with increasing light levels, contrary to the predictions of the Charnov and Bull model. 4.
