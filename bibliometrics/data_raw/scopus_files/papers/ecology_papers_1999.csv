We determined the effects of seed mass on emergence (the total proportion of emerged seedlings) and on the speed of emergence (the time necessary to reach 50% total emerged seedlings) in both greenhouse and field conditions, and we observed the effects of seed mass on the risk of removal by animals in the field. The effects of seed mass on performance were specific to species and habitat. For example, in two species, seed mass had a positive effect on emergence, while another showed a negative effect; for most of the species, effects on performance restricted to only one habitat (shaded forest or gap). Similarly, the results for effects of seed mass on the risk of removal were species- and habitat-specific. In the greenhouse, seed mass did not affect either emergence or the speed of emergence under either high or low light conditions. Our results suggest that: (i) seed mass did not have a general effect on emergence success and (ii) the effects of seed mass on seedling emergence are driven by external ecological factors more than by intrinsic effects of seed mass.

Interactions among plants commonly comprise positive and negative effects operating simultaneously and bidirectionally. Thus, a thorough understanding of plant interactions requires experimental separation and quantitative assessment of the bidirectional positive and negative effects that add up to the net effects of plant interactions. Using the close spatial association of annual plants with a desert shrub (Ambrosia dumosa) in a sandy area of the Mojave Desert of California as a test system, we separated and quantified negative and positive effects of annuals on shrubs and of shrubs on annuals. We achieved the separation of negative and positive effects with an experimental design that included reciprocal removals of neighbors and simulations of physical effects of neighbors using artificial structures. All experimental manipulations were conducted on space originally occupied by Ambrosia shrubs to focus on immediate effects of neighbors on water availability rather than on long-term microenvironmental effects (e.g., nutrient accumulation). We quantified positive effects by calculating the difference between performance parameters of neighbors growing with artificial structures (thatch to mimic the physical effects of the presence of annuals and artificial canopies to mimic the physical effects of shrubs) and those of neighbors growing alone (removals). We estimated negative effects by calculating the difference between plant performance on control plots (shrubs and annuals growing together) and performances of plants growing with the artificial structures. Annuals had simultaneously strong negative and weak positive effects on shrub water status, growth, and reproductive output. Annuals also had an impact on the sex expression of shrubs by inducing shifts toward a higher male proportion in inflorescences of monoecious Ambrosia. In contrast, we found strong positive and weak or no negative effects of the shrubs on survival, biomass production, and seed production of the entire annual community and of selected annual species (the abundant native Chaenactis fremontii and the two dominant introduced annual species Bromus madritensis ssp. rubens and Schismus barbatus). Overall, in net effect, the interaction between shrubs and annuals can be described as facilitation or positive net effects of shrubs on annuals, and interference or negative net effects of annuals on shrubs. However, during the growing season, the ratios between positive and negative effects shifted. Annual plants benefited from the presence of shrubs to the greatest extent early in the growing season, and initial negative effects of annuals on shrubs declined as annuals senesced later in the season.

The seed dispersal system of C. guillaumini is unusually simple because primary seed dispersal and secondary seed dispersal are each effectively carried out by a single species: primary dispersal by the Lesser Vasa Parrot, Coracopsis nigra, and secondary dispersal by the ant Aphaenogaster swammerdami. The quality of seed dispersal by each disperser was measured by comparing seed distributions with seedling distributions. Although parrots dispersed only 7.9 ± 6.0% (mean ± 1 SD) of the seeds away from the crown, these seeds had a probability of becoming established as seedlings that was 35.4 times higher than that of seeds that were dropped beneath the crown or that simply fell from the crown. Ants secondarily dispersed 45.1 ± 23.2% of the seeds. However, ants increased the establishment success of seedlings more weakly and less consistently than did parrots. Establishment success of seeds dispersed by ants was 4.5 times higher in one year but only 1.1 times higher in another year than that of seeds not dispersed by ants.

Adult birds (N = 210) and fledglings (N = 3061) were individually marked, and breeding birds were monitored annually during 1989-1996 to detect banded individuals. Of these 3271 birds, 652 breeding birds were resighted, and 164 of them were sexed through copulatory behavior. Nests were checked annually to monitor breeding performance. Frequencies of return between years were 83.1% for breeding males and 89.5% for breeding females. Frequencies of territory change were 25.6% and 32.8%, respectively. Females >8 yr old rarely changed territories. Dispersing birds departed significantly more from low-quality territories (evaluated through breeding success variables). Breeding failure and mate loss (divorce or death) favored breeding dispersion, both in males and females, but females changed territories more frequently after nest predation. We did not detect effects of resource availability, conspecific breeding density, or mate quality on the frequency of territory change. When all the variables were included into a Generalized Linear Model (GLM), only breeding success, mate loss, and the interaction between the two had significant effects on territory change. Dispersal distance of birds that had changed territory was similar for males and females (median = 302 m). Ninety percent of individuals moved <5 km, and none moved > 10 km. Distance moved depended on the bird's age and territory quality, but a GLM model retained only age as a significant variable: older birds (males and females) dispersed shorter distances. These results indicate that breeding territory change and dispersal distance are different individual decisions and are determined by different selective pressures. Dispersal consequences were significant only for females: they tended to change to territories with a lower risk of predation and obtained higher breeding success in the new location. Moreover, individuals in the new territories had higher breeding success than those occupying abandoned territories the same year. Dispersal distances were not correlated with the new territory quality and probability of breeding failure. Black Kites remained close to their former breeding places; individual competitive abilities may determine the final dispersal distance. Short-distance movements in dispersal are probably related to benefits of philopatry (ecological and genetic) and dispersal costs associated with finding a new territory in a saturated population, such as the one studied.",154,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Age and sex patterns in dispersal | Black Kite | Breeding dispersal | Breeding performance | Dispersal distance | Mate change | Milvus migrans | Spain | Territory fidelity,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,4,all,All Open Access

We aimed to find proximate and ultimate explanations for the high variability, including the possibility that variation in eclosion time represents a diversified bet-hedging strategy. Patterns of variation in pupal period, both among and within populations, were analyzed in several common environment experiments, including one with a half-sib design. We further assessed possible selective forces on eclosion date and its variance using an empirical simulation model. Latitudinal among-population differences in pupal period were shown to have a genetic basis. Within populations, there was a considerable among-sibship variance in this trait that suggests high heritabilities of pupal period. The environmental component of the variance was unlikely to result from a deterministic reaction norm, neither adaptive nor constraint-based, and may thus represent a type of variance on which a bet-hedging strategy can be based. Importantly, there were significant among-sibship differences in the variance itself, and a significant sire effect on offspring variability in the half-sib design. This suggests a possibility for the variance in pupal period to be selected for as such, and for increased random environmental variance (a bet-hedging strategy) to evolve via natural selection. We assumed that seasonal changes in night temperatures and predation rate determine the optimal timing of adult flight period in E. autumnata. Results of modeling suggested that there are apparently flat fitness profiles in relation to eclosion date, which is the probable reason for maintenance of high genetic diversity in pupal period. Unpredictable temperature during adult flight period has a potential to select for high variance in eclosion dates, although the selective pressure appears to be weak.

This modeling study examines C sequestration (C(seq)) in natural ecosystems based on CO2 experiments. Most experiments are conducted by a step increase in CO2 concentration, whereas natural ecosystems are experiencing a gradual increase in atmospheric CO2 (C(a)). To examine the effects of a step vs. gradual CO2 increase on ecosystem responses, we have developed a terrestrial C sequestration (TCS) model that focuses on C and nitrogen (N) interactions in regulating C(seq). We used the model to: (1) compare C(seq) and N demand in response to the step vs. gradual increase in CO2; (2) identify mechanisms underlying different ecosystem responses to the step vs. gradual CO2 forcing; (3) examine key parameters in controlling C(seq); and (4) explore three hypothesized N supply mechanisms in regulating photosynthetic acclimation and C(seq). Application of this model to simulate responses of a forest ecosystem with gross primary productivity of 1200 g C·m-2·yr-1 suggested that a step increase in CO2 from 350 to 700 ppm resulted in C(seq) of 263 g C·m-2·yr-1 in the first year. A gradual C(a) increase led to the C(seq) rates of 27 and 58 g C·m-2·yr-1 in 1987 and 2085 when CO2 reached 350 and 700 ppm, respectively. The model predicted that N demand required to balance the additional C influx was 4.1 g N·m-2·yr-1 in the step CO2 increase and only 0.6 and 1.7 g N·m-2·yr-1 in 1987 and 2085, respectively, in the gradual C(a) increase. The contrasting differences in C(seq) and N demand between the two increase scenarios reflected the nature of C fluxes that were controlled by the sizes of donor pools (i.e., donor-controlled system). Our modeling analysis of four ecosystems (forest with high productivity [HP]; grassland with HP; forest with low productivity [LP]; and grassland with LP) indicated that additional C influx and C relaxation time are the key parameters in determining ecosystem C(seq). The additional C influx varied with ecosystem productivity and N regulation, while C relaxation time differed between the forests and grasslands due to woody tissues and litter in the forests. We conclude that in spite of the fact that the step experiment is one of the most effective approaches in ecosystem studies, its results cannot be directly extrapolated to predict terrestrial C(seq) in natural ecosystems responding to a gradual C(a) increase.

To test this, we studied the relationship between density and growth, mortality, and emigration of brown trout in two alpine streams and a set of stream channels in eastern California. We sampled trout at the scale of 'segments' (5-31 m long riffles, runs, and pools) and 'sections' (340-500 m in length) of Convict Creek over a 3-yr period. Trout were also sampled during 6 yr in seven 90-m sections of Mammoth Creek. For 2 yr, we manipulated trout densities in Convict Creek by removing trout from two sections and adding trout to two other sections. We also manipulated densities in seven 50-m stream channels, using a natural size distribution of trout in one year and underyearlings only in a second year. In both streams, average size (body length or mass) of underyearlings in fall was negatively related to trout density and was furthermore affected by sampling location and year. The strong, negative relationship between individual mass and density of trout could be detected at the spatial scale of whole sections, but not at the scale of individual segments. The Convict Creek and stream channel experiments also revealed strong negative effects of density on average mass of underyearlings in fall, and on proportional mass increase of yearling and older trout from spring to fall. In contrast, mortality and emigration were unrelated to initial stocking densities in the channels. In all our data, the negative effects on growth were most pronounced at densities <1 trout/m2 and the growth-density relationships were well described by negative power curves. Large individuals were always less affected by increasing trout density than were small individuals, suggesting a competitive advantage of large over small trout that increased with density. We conclude that individual growth of brown trout in streams can be affected by trout density to an extent that suggests a substantial influence on population regulation. Results from our multiyear, multiscale, and experimental study indicate that density dependence in the growth of stream salmonids will be difficult to detect in purely observational data, especially in systems with relatively high fish densities (where the growth-density relationship has a flat slope), when data are collected and analyzed at small spatial scales, and when insufficient information is collected to assess the contribution of interannual variation in growth.",279,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Coefficient of variation of mass | Density dependence | Emigration | Individual growth | Mortality | Population regulation | Salmo trutta | Salmonids | Sierra Nevada | Spatial scale | Streams | Trout,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,7,NA,NA

Lamb production decreased in older ewes, while weaning success for parous ewes was independent of age in one population and decreased with age in the other. The age-related decrease in lamb production followed a slight decrease in body mass, which began at ~11 yr of age. Reproductive senescence in this species appears to begin 6-7 yr after the onset of survival senescence. Longevity was positively related to late-summer body mass at 6 yr. Contrary to reproductive cost theories, there was no negative relationship between early and late reproductive success or between early reproductive success and longevity; instead, those relationships tended to be weakly positive. Longevity had a strong positive influence on lifetime reproductive success in both populations. Since the longest lived ewes were among the heaviest as young adults and had high reproductive success throughout their lifetime, longevity appears to be state-dependent; only ewes of higher phenotypic quality survived long enough to reach reproductive senescence.

In defoliation, every second leaf was removed from the saplings. Three days later, two undamaged short-shoot leaves were collected, air-dried, and analyzed for condensed tannins and 34 nontannin phenolic compounds by high-performance liquid chromatography. The clones showed substantial variation in phenolic composition of the leaves and in chemical responses to fertilization and defoliation. A cluster analysis by UPGMA indicated that the phenolic profiles of birch leaves were affected more by genotype than fertilization or defoliation, and the clones could thus be distinguished from each other. In addition, on the basis of their overall phenolic composition, the clones were clustered loosely in three clone groups. The leaves of fertilized saplings contained lower levels of condensed tannins than controls, as predicted by carbon/nutrient balance (CNB) hypothesis. However, fertilization had no effect on the total amount of nontannin phenolics. The concentrations of (+)catechin, 3,4'-dihydroxypropiophenone 3-glucoside (DHPPG), 3-cinnamoylquinic acids, and flavone aglycones were lower in fertilized saplings, whereas the opposite was true for 5-cinnamoylquinic acids and the total amount of flavonol glycosides. Although our results provide support for the CNB hypothesis, they also show that the accumulation of phenolic compounds in birch leaves is strongly coordinated. Different branches of the biosynthetic pathway of phenolic compounds may compete for substrates, and such internal metabolic trade-offs may explain the differential accumulation of the compounds. In fertilized saplings, the concentration of condensed tannins was also negatively correlated with the amount of triterpenoid resin droplets measured from the same saplings. We suggest that a linkage via malonyl-CoA between the biosynthetic routes to terpenoids and flavonoid derivatives, such as condensed tannins, may explain the different responses to fertilization reported for terpenoids and phenolics. Undamaged leaves of partially defoliated saplings contained more DHPPG and flavone aglycones and less cinnamic acid derivatives and (+)-catechin than did leaves of control saplings. The induction of DHPPG and flavonoid aglycones was significantly and negatively correlated with the concentration of myricetin glycosides in fertilized saplings, which may indicate a trade-off between induced and constitutive defense. Moreover, in fertilized saplings, the three clone groups formed by UPGMA clustering differed significantly in the magnitude of induction of DHPPG and flavone aglycones. Different birch genotypes may thus have different modes of chemical defense, and the magnitude of chemical response of a genotype may partly depend on resource availability.

The study was carried out in the high mountains of the Sierra Nevada, Spain, over four years (1988-1991). We selected three populations of H. spinosa located along a wide altitudinal gradient. This plant species was visited during the four years of the study by at least 70 species of insects belonging to five orders and 19 families. The assemblage of floral visitors of H. spinosa was composed mainly of ants and different species of solitary bees and flies, although most pollinators were comparatively rare. There were striking similarities between most pollinator species in the distributions of flight distance between consecutive flowers, which were leptokurtic and highly skewed. Moreover, almost all visitors acted as pollinators, depositing pollen grains enough for seed production. Insects visiting flowers of H. spinosa can be divided into two guilds: nectarivores (small flies and ants) and pollinivores (bees and hoverflies), which differ in pollination attributes. Flower-visitation rates were quite different between the faster pollinivores and the slower nectarivores. All nectarivorous species moved almost exclusively between flowers of the same plant, whereas pollinivores sometimes moved between plants; and pollinivores deposited more pollen grains per visit than did nectarivores.

Modeling causes of the latitudinal gradient in species richness,Taylor P.,Ecology,00129658,80,8,2474-2482,1999-01-01,December 1999,10.1890/0012-9658(1999)080[2474:CRSRBR]2.0.CO;2,"The latitudinal gradient in species richness, wherein species richness peaks near the equator and declines toward the poles, is a widely recognized phenomenon that holds true for many taxa in all habitat types. Understanding the causative mechanism or mechanisms that generate the latitudinal gradient in species richness (LGSR) has been a major challenge, and the gradient remains unexplained. A different latitudinal trend (named 'Rapoport's rule'), in which the mean size of species geographical ranges tends to decline toward the equator, has been hypothesized by G. C. Stevens to play a key role in generating the LGSR when coupled with a version of the 'rescue effect,' in which local populations toward the fringes of geographical ranges are sustained by immigration. The Stevens hypothesis is now commonly cited as a potential explanation for the LGSR and has provoked numerous empirical studies in macroecology and biogeography. However, important aspects of the hypothesis are not obvious in Stevens's verbal model and may go unrecognized, despite their major implications for empirical work related to large-scale ecological and evolutionary processes. Here we present mathematical simulation models that test the logical structure of the Stevens hypothesis, examine effects on global patterns of species richness produced by the mechanisms (Rapoport's rule and the rescue effect) explicitly identified by Stevens, and investigate the additional effect of competition. We find that Rapoport's rule on its own generates an LGSR opposite that of the real world, with species richness peaking at the poles rather than at the equator. The same qualitative result (a 'reverse' LGSR) appears when rescue-effect regions, as described by Stevens, are added to the model. Building upon Stevens's verbal model, we then develop an explicit version of competition and show that competition alone tends to equalize species richness across all latitudes. However, when both Rapoport's rule and competition are included in the model, we find that a qualitatively correct LGSR is produced. Unlike previous hypotheses regarding the LGSR, this version of the model does not rely on a latitudinal gradient in the intensity of competition to produce an LGSR. However, detection of this LGSR depends on the spatial scale at which species richness is sampled, with the LGSR appearing only with regional, not local, sampling. In contrast, when competition is explicitly added to the model with both Rapoport's rule and the rescue effect, an LGSR that is qualitatively consistent with that of the real world does appear in both local and regional samples. This expanded version of the Stevens hypothesis potentially could explain the real-world LGSR, but all three elements (Rapoport's rule, the rescue effect, and competition) are crucial and must operate sufficiently strongly and in specific ways. The LGSR becomes apparent in the model only when parameter values for Rapoport's rule and the rescue effect are large, possibly unrealistically so, and when all points on Earth are filled to the competitively defined 'community species saturation level.'

We present data from a network of 21 forest plots in Manu National Park, Peru, totaling >36 ha and sited over an area of ~400 km2, to explore how tree species are distributed across upper Amazonia at a variety of spatial scales. For each of 825 tree species occurring in the plots we asked three questions: (1) Does the species have a large or small geographic range? (2) Is the species restricted to a single forest type, or is it found in several? (3) Is the species locally abundant anywhere or is it scarce everywhere? The answers served to classify a subset of species under Rabinowitz's classification scheme for rare species. Three main conclusions emerged. First, the great majority of tree species at Manu are geographically widespread. Every species identified to date occurs elsewhere in South America, outside the department of Madre de Dios; more than two-thirds of them have been collected 1500 km away in Amazonian Ecuador. Second, 15-26% of species appear to be restricted to a single forest type, when forest types are defined by historical river dynamics (i.e., terra firme forest, mature floodplain forest, swamp forest, and primary successional floodplain forest). The proportion of restricted species declined with increasing sampling effort, making 15% a more reliable figure. Third, while 88% of species occurred at densities of <1 individual/ha over the entire network of plots, at least half occurred somewhere at densities of >1.5 individuals/ha. Extrapolating these results provides a first guess at how tree species are distributed across the western portion of the Amazon basin.

Californian populations of Mimulus guttatus are polymorphic for pollen quality: many plants produce a high proportion of cytoplasmless pollen grains that render the grains incapable of fertilizing ovules or of supporting bees nutritionally. We found that different genotypes maintained a consistent proportion of inviable pollen within a genotype and over time. The number of pollen grains per flower was also consistent within a plant at each date but declined over time. We studied the ability of British bumble bees (Bombus spp.) to discriminate among plants of Mimulus guttatus on the basis of pollen quality and quantity at three scales: indoors with choices of two genotypes, in outdoor plots of several genotypes that varied in pollen quality, and outdoors at a whole-patch scale where two patches of plants differed in quality. We found that bees could discriminate among plants on the basis of pollen quality provided that flowers still retained most of the pollen. In the two-genotype trials, bees chose genotypes primarily on the quantity of viable pollen, and nectar was much less important. Similarly, where patches of low- and high-pollen quality plants were established, bees responded by visiting the high-quality patch more often and by visiting more flowers within the patch. However, the results from the outdoor plots that contained genotypes of varying phenotypes were inconsistent. A meta-analysis of a large number of separate plots showed that the overall correlation between visitation rate and pollen quality was significant, but variation among plots was also significant. A possible explanation for this inconsistency was suggested in a greenhouse trial in which we showed that, when foraging density was high, depletion of the standing crop of pollen happened quickly, and this reduced the ability of the foragers to choose the higher-quality genotypes.

I evaluated several types of violations of the closure assumption and found that completely random movement in and out of a study area does not introduce bias to estimators from closed-population methods, although it decreases precision. In addition, if capture probabilities vary only with time, the closed-population Lincoln-Petersen estimator is unbiased for the size of the superpopulation when there are only births/immigration or only deaths/emigration. However, for other cases of nonrandom movement, closed-population estimators were biased when movement was Markovian (dependent on the presence/absence of the animal in the previous time period), when an animal was allowed one entry to and one exit from the study area, or when there was trap response or heterogeneity among animals in capture probability.

In October 1990, selected canopy trees in a 50 x 160 m area within a 75-yr-old Quercus rubra-Acer rubrum forest in central Massachusetts were pulled over by a winch, using records from the 1938 hurricane to determine the number of trees and direction of fall. The resulting damage to 65% of trees closely approximated effects of the 1938 storm on New England forests. Damage and mortality varied by tree species and size, indicating the importance of pre-disturbance forest structure and composition in determining the range and severity of impact. Measurements of vegetation and environment in the experimental area and control indicated that, although the manipulated stand sustained dramatic damage and structural reorganization, resilience of trees and understory vegetation provided tight biotic control of ecosystem processes, including nutrient cycling. Continued leaf-out and induced sprouting by damaged trees, increased growth by saplings and understory plants, and seedling establishment on disturbed microsites stabilized the microenvironment.

We investigated the effect of nonnative annual vegetation on resource availability and growth of a native bunchgrass, Nassella pulchra, in a pair of factorial field experiments that incorporated effects of both interspecific and intraspecific competition as well as variation in soil depth. Plots of differing target densities and neighborhoods were used to assess changes in aboveground (light) and belowground (water) resource availability over multiple seasons in two sites with differing soil depth. N. pulchra grown without interspecific competitors grew larger and produced more culms at all planting densities compared to plants in plots with interspecific competitors. Intraspecific competition significantly influenced growth only in the absence of interspecific competition. Reproductive effort, as measured by flowering culm production, was more sensitive than vegetative growth to both forms of competition. Light availability and variability at the soil surface was greatly reduced by the nonnative annual neighborhood. As expected, soil moisture was rapidly depleted by annuals to 30 cm in all plots. In deepsoil plots, soil moisture was reduced at 60-150 cm depths only when annual vegetation was removed, and depletion was correlated with N. pulchra basal area. This result suggests that the interspecific neighborhood reduced root growth in N. pulchra and its subsequent ability to use deep moisture. Within California's inland grasslands, nonnative annual vegetation has changed seasonal patterns of resource availability. We conclude that (1) increased competition for light during the spring, when growth of annuals is most rapid, suppresses growth and reproduction of N. pulchra; (2) by suppressing bunchgrass growth, annual grasses reduce access to belowground resources by competitive interference; and (3) the loss of perennial grasses in California grasslands and the general dominance by nonnative annual species results in the relative underutilization of deep soil resources. These conclusions suggest that the dominance of California grasslands by nonnative annual vegetation has shifted the primary limiting resource from soil moisture to light and the timing of resource limitation from summer to winter and spring.",185,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,"Bunchgrass | California grasslands | Competition | Density dependence | Grasses, annual | Grasses, perennial | Interference | Invasive species | Nassella pulchra | Resource limitation | Soil moisture depletion",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,17,all,All Open Access

Nonrandom spatial distributions of these species in relation to edaphic factors could be one mechanism responsible for maintaining this diversity. We examined the prevalence of nonrandom distributions of trees and palms in relation to soil type and topographic position ('edaphic biases') over a mesoscale (573 ha) old-growth tropical rain forest (TRF) landscape at the La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. All trees and palms ≥10 cm diameter were measured and identified in 1170 circular 0.01-ha plots centered on an existing 50 x 100 m grid. Topographic position was classified for each plot, and slope and aspect were measured. Soil type data were taken from a previous study (Clark et al. 1998). A total of 5127 trees and palms were identified in 267 species. Detrended Correspondence Analysis and Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that highly significant edaphic gradients were present, with swamp or highly fertile soils separated from the less fertile, well-drained upland soils. Species composition remained significantly related to topographic position when soil type was controlled for. The main floristic gradients were still significant when flooded sites were excluded from the analyses. Randomization tests on a weighted preference index were used to examine the relations of individual species to soil types and, within the dominant soil type, to topographic position. Of the 132 species with N ≥ 5 individuals, 33 showed significant associations with soil type. Within the dominant soil type, 13 of 110 analyzable species were nonrandomly associated with one or more topographic positions. For a variety of reasons, including issues relating to sample size and adequate edaphic characterization of landscapes, we suggest that the ~30% of species shown to be edaphically biased in this study is an underestimate of the true degree of edaphically related distributional biases. To evaluate this hypothesis will require mesoscale vegetation sampling combined with quantitative soil analyses at the same scale in a range of tropical rain forests.

The annual return of organic C thus calculated, plus the amount of organic C removed annually from the site by harvesting, burning, etc., provides an estimate of the Net Primary Production (NPP) of that site, averaged over many years. The new method was used to calculate NPP for two adjacent savanna sites in the Nairobi National Park in Kenya, one grazed and one not, and for a dry Miombo woodland site in Zambia. Both the Kenyan and Zambian sites are taken to be at equilibrium, with soil organic C levels at steady state. Soils from the three sites were analyzed by layer for organic C, δ14C, δ13C, soil microbial biomass C, total N, pH, and clay content. Radiocarbon measurements were >100% modern in the surface layers (0-15 cm) of the Kenyan soils (both Vertisols) and in all three layers (0-15, 15-30 and 30-50 cm) of the Zambian soil (an Oxisol), presumably because of 14C coming from the testing of thermonuclear bombs. The 15-30 cm layer of the Kenyan soils dated at ~500 yr and the 30-50 cm layer at ~900 yr. The 14C data were consistent with the presence of a small inert fraction of organic C that accounted for an increasing proportion of total organic C with increasing soil depth. The 13C data indicated that the Kenyan soils had developed under C4 vegetation, whereas the Zambian soils had developed under vegetation dominated by C3 plants. From these results the annual input of C to soil from the ungrazed Kenyan site was calculated to be 388 g C·m-2·yr-1, to the grazed site 380 g C·m-2·yr-1, and to the Zambian soil 373 g C·m-2·yr-1. Taking the loss of C from the Kenyan sites by burning to be 40 g C·m-2·yr-1, the mean NPP for both Kenyan sites is 424 g C·m-2·yr-1. This value for NPP is compatible with earlier estimates of NPP by botanical methods from the same site in Kenya. Woodtaking is thought to be minimal in the protected Zambian woodland, so that here the annual input of C to the soil can be taken as the NPP without great error.

This paper offers a method to test statistically for fuzziness of the partitions in cluster analysis of sampling units that can be used with a wide range of data types and clustering methods. The method applies bootstrap resampling. In this, partitions found in bootstrap samples are compared to the observed partition by the similarity of the sampling units that form the groups. The method tests the null hypothesis that the clusters in the bootstrap samples are random samples of their most similar corresponding clusters mapped one-to-one into the observed data. The resulting probability indicates whether the groups in the partition are sharp enough to reappear consistently in resampling.

This spatial template of related individuals sets the stage for all subsequent density-dependent and frequency-dependent interactions. In this study we document how ant-mediated seed dispersal affects the number and relatedness of seeds in both dispersed and undispersed aggregations and how these patterns influence seedling emergence in the long-lived perennial, Trillium grandiflorum. Experimental hand-pollinations in two years demonstrated that selfing is extremely rare and suggested that self-incompatibility (SI) is a likely explanation. Our multi-locus outcrossing estimate (t(m) = 1.05 ± 0.056) confirms this result and also suggests that seeds within a fruit are likely to have the same pollen parent. Thus a highly outcrossing mating system is the initial determinant of relatedness among seeds within a fruit. We tracked uniquely coded, radiolabeled seeds from 30 and 40 fruits in 1991 and 1992, respectively, to determine how dispersal alters this initial relatedness of seeds. Of the 335 and 876 seeds labeled in these two years, we recovered 63% and 76% of the seeds postdispersal and found that 19% and 23% of the recovered seeds were dispersed > 10 cm from the maternal parent in the first and second years, respectively. In both years, ant-mediated dispersal reduced the number of seeds near the maternal parent. However, the effect of seed dispersal on the number of seeds in aggregations varied among years. Ant-mediated dispersal increased the number of seeds in dispersed aggregations in the first year and decreased the number in the second year. The average seed dispersal distance also differed between years: 2.41 m (±0.33) vs. 0.53 m (±0.06) in years 1 and 2, respectively. Ant-mediated seed dispersal decreased the probability of a seed having a sibling as its nearest neighbor postdispersal by between one-third and one-half. In contrast, seedling emergence was related to neither dispersal nor seed aggregation size in our study. However, the fitness effects of dispersal may be important later in the life cycle of this long-lived species and as such were undetected. One scenario is that plants derived from seeds dispersed out of their sibling relatedness group may gain minority advantage both in terms of mating success (if the population is SI) and other frequency-dependent processes like disease resistance.",125,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Ant-mediated dispersal | Dispersal distances | Genetic structure | Mating system | Outcrossing rate | Radiolabeled seeds | Seed dispersal | Self-incompatibility | Trillium grandiflorum,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,23,NA,NA

We conducted a field experiment with a suspected trophic cascade. Could an entomopathogenic nematode protect bush lupine by killing rootfeeding ghost moth caterpillars? The experiment measured survival of lupine seedlings as a function of density of hatchling ghost moth caterpillars in rhizospheres with or without the entomopathogenic nematode. We modeled lupine survival with a hierarchical family of 'one-hit dose response' models to interpret the results of the experiment. We obtained maximum likelihood estimates of parameters and selected the best-fitting model using the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC). The best model fit the data closely, and SIC model selection was consistent with classical likelihood ratio test results of models nested in the one-hit family. A parallel analysis performed upon a logistic family of models yielded results of poorer fit but largely consistent with results of the one-hit analysis. Finally, we compared our model-centered approach with the conventional methods-centered approach of logistic regression in statistical packages. While these packages give correct calculations, the implications of hypothesis tests are ecologically obscure in the absence of the explicit representation of models and their hierarchical relationships. For understanding ecological data, building an explicit statistical model of the process and testing parameters can be more informative than accepting the implicit model and testing variables in canned statistical packages. The ecological implications were that seedling survival decreased exponentially with increasing densities of root-feeding caterpillars, and the entomopathogenic nematode virtually canceled the negative effect of this herbivore upon seedling survival. However, the significance to the broader community of this trophic cascade remains to be demonstrated. This cascade is a module or vignette within the greater food web, and additional interactions affect its influence: intraguild predation by nematode predators, apparent competition from other herbivores of lupine (each with its own natural enemies), and even more complicated interactions through competing plant species all come into play. As well, genetic variation of both the lupine and ghost moth caterpillars affects these interactions. Evidence does not support the inference that protection from ghost moth caterpillars by the entomopathogenic nematode is key to the 'green' world of bush lupine.",80,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Akaike information criterion | Binary data | Entomopathogenic nematode | Indirect interaction | Natural enemy | One-hit dose-response | Schwarz information criterion | Statistical models | Subterranean herbivory,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,25,NA,NA

We reexamined the values of fragments of different sizes, based this time on abundances of species. We asked whether abundances tend to decrease with decreasing scrub size or are more strongly related to other scrub attribute(s). We censused vertebrates with trap arrays and by direct observation, and we measured 13 potentially important environmental attributes related to area, isolation, and habitat structure in 16 scrubs distributed along the Lake Wales Ridge of central Florida. We correlated abundance of species with the 13 attributes. We calculated the evenness of relative abundance distributions and grouped scrubs based on the shapes of relative abundance distributions. We determined whether or not members of different groups of scrubs possessed different values for any attribute. Finally, we examined both densities of individuals and dispersions of species among large, medium, and small scrubs. Abundance was related to many of the attributes. Abundances of 11 of 18 species were correlated positively with area. Percentage of variation explained by area generally was low, and several of the rare species apparently maintain relatively large populations in small scrubs. Abundances of five species were correlated negatively with measures of isolation. Abundances of three species were correlated both positively and negatively with measures of habitat structure. Environmental attributes related to isolation and habitat structure were correlated most strongly with both evenness and groupings of relative abundance distributions. Total density of individuals (i.e., numbers of captures per trap array) could not be shown to differ among scrubs of different sizes. Individually, the species that reached their highest densities in relatively small scrubs often were the ones considered to be rare. Spatial distributions of species tended to become more homogeneous as area decreased, but the strength of this effect varied among species, perhaps accounting, at least in part, for the different relationships between abundance and area among species. Our results could lead to broad generalizations that seem to be relevant to scrub conservation. For example, because most species are relatively abundant in large scrubs, large scrubs should be selected for reserves over small ones. We suggest, however, that our results actually best serve as a caution about the use of generalizations, based on data from one or a few species, for conservation planning in general. Our results clearly show that the benefits gained for certain species from focusing on the preservation of larger scrub fragments could be offset by harm done to other species, especially rare species. We conclude, therefore, that selection of a system of scrub reserves should be based, in large part, on knowledge of the biologies of as many of the resident organisms as possible. We suggest, however, that any reserve selection procedure for the scrub habitat probably is outmoded, and that ecologists should not even engage in debate about the conservation value of small scrub fragments. When a habitat has declined as precipitously as scrub has, and truly large remaining fragments are, at best, extremely rare, then smaller fragments are likely to be of considerable value, no matter how they compare to larger fragments.",37,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,"Abundance | Florida scrub | Fragmentation | Habitat structure | Isolation | Scrub, Florida | Vertebrates",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,26,NA,NA

Conceptually, three kinds of habitat have been described: (1) 'sources' are consistent net exporters of organisms; 'true sinks' are net importers, and without immigration their populations go extinct; and (3) 'pseudosinks' are also net importers, but without immigration they can sustain populations and sometimes can even become net exporters (sources). Previously, I have described sources and pseudosinks in a metapopulation of the butterfly Euphydryas editha and reported the extinction of populations in sources due to an unusual frost. Here, I describe the recolonization of the former sources by migrants from extant populations in the former pseudosinks. For comparison, a series of vacant patches was created in the former pseudosinks. Recolonization was tracked by sampling the population density in the vacant patches. Patches were sampled for 5 years. Contrary to theoretical expectations, the establishment rate of new populations was 10 times higher in outcrops, the former pseudosinks, than in clearings, the former sources. Initial population density was 150 times higher in outcrops (measured as number of larval webs per square meter). Yet in clearings, only the immigrants had poor reproductive success. On those occasions when a resident population was established, the residents had high reproductive success, and the population grew rapidly. The low recolonization rate of clearings could not be attributed to effects of patch size or spatial barriers. A temporal barrier was hypothesized, in which immigrants arrived too late each year to reproduce successfully on host plants in clearings. The host plant in clearings, Collinsia torreyi, typically senesced during the breeding season, but the host plant in outcrops, Pedicularis semibarbata, did not. The hypothesis proposed that immigrants oviposited later than residents because the immigrants originated in outcrops, which had a different microclimate that delayed adult eclosion. The hypothesis was supported: the newly established resident populations in clearings tended to oviposit 10 d earlier than populations in nearby outcrops. An experiment showed earlier eclosion times in clearings than in outcrops. Another experiment showed much higher larval survival in early clearings than in late clearings. Mortality was correlated with host-plant senescence. The temporal barrier was strong enough to keep clearings as net importers of butterflies from outcrops, meaning that the net flow of butterflies reversed after the frost destroyed the resident populations in clearings. Thus, 'early' clearings had been sources, but 'late' clearings were true sinks, giving the system two kinds of source-sink relationships. After the frost, the metapopulation as a whole underwent a demographic source-sink inversion from one locally stable state to the other. The findings suggest that asymmetric constraints on dispersal, due to temporal structure, may be a mechanism for complex source-sink dynamics in herbivorous insects and possibly other animals.",114,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,"Butterfly phenology | Colonization | Demography, source-sink inversion | Euphydryas editha | Habitat effects on rate of larval development | Habitat-specific colonization rates | Metapopulation | Population effects of host plant | Pseudosink | Source-sink dynamics | Temporal barrier",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,27,NA,NA

Calcium losses from forest floors have been reported at several sites in the northeastern United States. To test for loss of base cations from forest floors at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire (USA), we analyzed samples collected on seven dates between 1976 and 1997. Calcium and magnesium contents of the forest floor did not decline significantly; a change >0.9%/yr would have been detectable. Concentrations of Ca were 40% higher in 1969-1970 than in the current study, but the difference is partly due to changes in collection methods. Magnesium concentrations were too variable to detect a loss of <47% over the 21-yr interval. To determine whether basecation losses were associated with forest growth, we resampled a chronosequence of northern hardwood stands in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. The 13 stands did not show consistent changes in Ca, Mg, and potassium over the 15-yr interval. Losses of these cations were most pronounced in stands logged more than 25 yr earlier. Younger stands, contrary to our expectation that rapid forest growth should cause cation depletion, all gained base cations in the forest floor. Early in stand development these forest floors appeared to accumulate biomass along with living vegetation, rather than serving as a net source of nutrients. Finally, in a regional survey of 28 mature stands in the northeastern United States, some lost significant forest-floor Ca and Mg between 1980 and 1990, while others gained. The average change in Ca and Mg content was not significant; a loss of 1.4%/yr would have been detectable.

On average, each adult palm contributed 98 seedling recruits per year into the population. The pattern of mortality was similar to that of other palms, with mortality being highest among the smallest plants. Those plants with a diameter at soil level >20 mm had an annual mortality <7%. Density dependence was found to act only on the seedling stage of the life cycle. The probability of survival and transition of seedlings to the next size class were affected both by the density of seedlings and the presence of conspecific adults. Matrix modeling indicated that the true finite rate of population increase (λ) was 1.28 and that the observed reverse 'J'-shaped size distribution of plants was a consequence of the density dependence operating in the population. Elasticity analysis showed that the survival elements in the matrix contributed most to the value of λ, and that the position of the transition matrix in growth-survival-fecundity (G-L-F) space was influenced by density. The matrix model incorporating density dependence predicted size distributions and densities approximating the maximum observed in the field.

To test the hypothesis that habitat modification by seaweed canopies can have direct positive effects on rocky intertidal communities, we quantified habitat amelioration by Ascophyllum nodosum canopies and its consequences on understory organisms in the Gulf of Maine, USA. At the upper and lower elevational borders of the algal canopy, we examined the recruitment, growth, and survivorship of common benthic organisms in canopy removal, canopy control, and shaded canopy removal plots intended to mimic canopy habitat modification. The algal canopy greatly reduced potential physical stresses, particularly at high tidal heights. Maximum daily rock temperatures were 5°-10°C lower and evaporative water loss was an order of magnitude less under the canopy than in canopy removal plots. The response of understory organisms to canopy removal, however, was species specific and somewhat idiosyncratic. Nonetheless, in general, at the high intertidal border of the canopy the recruitment, growth, and survival of understory organisms were enhanced by the canopy, whereas at the low intertidal border canopy effects were negative or neutral. Nearly half of the interactions we studied were positive in the high zone. In contrast to positive canopy effects on understory organism recruitment and growth at high tidal heights, consumer pressure was severe under the canopy, particularly at low tidal heights. Green Crab predation is likely responsible for limiting understory mussel densities, while grazing by the snail, Littorina littorea, keeps understory substrate clear of algal recruits. The amelioration of harsh physical conditions by algal canopies can have strong direct positive effects in high rocky intertidal communities by enhancing organism recruitment, growth, and survival. These canopy effects, however, may often be offset by increased consumer pressure at low tidal heights.

Individuals of the annual plant species Abutilon theophrasti, Chenopodium album, and Polygonum pensylvanicum were grown from locally field-gathered seed in controlled greenhouse conditions across gradients of light, nutrients, and water. Frequent harvests were used to determine the growth and allocation (root vs. shoot, and leaf area vs. biomass) responses of these plants over a 57-d period. Growth analysis revealed that each species displayed significant plasticity in growth rates and substantial amounts of ontogenetic drift in root:shoot biomass ratios and ratios of leaf area to biomass across each of the three resource gradients. Ontogenetically controlled comparisons of root: shoot and leaf area ratios across light and nutrient gradients were generally consistent with predictions based on optimal partitioning theory; allocation to roots decreased and leaf area increased under low light and high nutrient conditions. These trends were confirmed, though were less dramatic, in allometric plots of biomass allocation throughout ontogeny. These species did not alter biomass allocation (beyond ontogenetic drift) in response to the broadly varying water regimes. Furthermore, many of the observed differences in biomass allocation were limited to a given time during growth and development. We conclude that, for these rapidly growing annual species, plasticity in biomass allocation patterns is only partially consistent with optimal partitioning theory, and that these plastic responses are ontogenetically constrained.

We developed a dynamic programming model to predict patterns that should be detected along the migratory route if Pectoral Sandpipers use a strategy of early arrival at the breeding grounds (time minimization) or arrival at the breeding grounds with excess energy reserves (energy maximization). The predictions were then compared to data collected at stopover sites in the mid-continent of North America and at the breeding grounds in Alaska over a 5-yr period (1992-1996). During spring migration to their Arctic breeding grounds, Pectoral Sandpipers stop periodically to feed. The length-of-stay at such stopovers, for both time minimizers and energy maximizers, was predicted to vary inversely with date and body fat, and to vary directly with invertebrate abundance. We observed that: (1) length-of-stay was negatively correlated with capture date in Missouri and Nebraska, but not in Texas; (2) length-of-stay was not correlated with body fat at any site; and (3) length-of-stay was positively related to invertebrate abundance at the Nebraska and Missouri sites. As the population moves northward in the spring, three regional patterns are diagnostic of migration strategy. Length-of-stay was predicted to be bimodal (energy maximizer) or constant (time minimizer) with respect to latitude, but neither pattern was observed. The migration window, or period of time during which spring migrants occur, was predicted to decrease with increasing latitude for time minimizers, a pattern that was seen for both males and females. Body fat was predicted to increase with latitude for energy maximizers, a pattern that was seen for females but not males. The evidence suggests that males and females differ in their spring migration strategies. Both sexes attempt to arrive in the Arctic as early as possible after ice breakup in the spring. Additionally, females gain significantly higher fat loads than males (up to 60% body fat for females) during migration, and these energy reserves may later enhance female reproductive success. However, females gained large fat loads only during 1993 and 1995, which had above normal spring precipitation along the migration route. We believe that the correlation between female body fat and precipitation reflects an abundance of high-quality stopover habitat during wet springs. This view is supported by model sensitivity analyses showing that the spacing and quality of stopover habitat can strongly influence observed migration patterns.

The large scale of these observations and some innovative analytical techniques allow extension of the use of diffusion-based models for dispersal to a highly vagile species moving in a heterogeneous environment. Temporal variation in catches of released individuals was removed by using total catch per trap over the lives of released populations of moths as the dependent variable. Spatial variation in total trap catch due to site-specific factors was removed using variation in catches of wild males.

Orchids with pollen packaged into pollinaria would be expected to be particularly vulnerable to the loss of cross-mating opportunities imposed by geitonogamy. We tested the hypothesis that the absence of floral rewards in many orchid species is a means of reducing geitonogamy. Experiments with the deceptive species Orchis mascula and Orchis morio showed that queen bumble bees probe more flowers and stay longer on plants when artificial nectar is added to the flowers. Overall, the data indicated that the evolution of nectar production in deceptive Orchis species would result in moderate to high levels of geitonogamy, as a consequence of the greater number of flowers probed and longer visit duration (~60 s) by pollinators. However, the estimated levels of geitonogamy were less than expected, due both to a time delay before freshly withdrawn pollinaria bend into the correct position to strike a stigma and to extensive carryover of pollen. The time elapsed before a freshly withdrawn pollinarium is in the correct position to strike the stigma was found to vary 30-80 s, depending on the orchid species. Since pollinators usually spend <30 s on an inflorescence, we estimate that natural populations of the study species are highly outcrossed. The fraction of the pollen load carried over from flower to flower was found to be 0.67 in O. mascula. Selection should favor longer delays in pollinaria bending and extensive pollen carryover in nectar-producing orchids. This is corroborated by the nectariferous orchid Platanthera chlorantha, which we found to have a pollinaria bending delay of 80 s and a high pollen carryover fraction (0.87). In general, selection for traits that prevent geitonogamy should occur only when pollinators are abundant. Since fruit set of orchids is usually pollinator limited, additional explanations may have to be sought to explain deception.

We use these models to investigate the system dynamics suppressed by the assumptions contained in differential-equation-based models; specifically, we examine the effects of space and demographic stochasticity. The differential equation implementation of the Lotka-Volterra processes assumes that there are enough individuals in the system that the effects of demographic stochasticity can be ignored and that the interactions between individuals always occur as though the system were continually well mixed or spatially random. The model predicts a neutrally stable equilibrium and infinite persistence, regardless of the size of the system. We use a stochastic birth-death (SBD) model to explore the possible effects of demographic stochasticity on the basic Lotka-Volterra model. The results show that, over a wide range of system sizes, the time to extinction is finite and increases linearly with the total size of the system. We introduce a new type of spatially explicit individual-based model called the Heuristic Asynchronous Discrete Event Simulation or HADES. HADES adds an explicit component of space to the SBD version of our process. We compare the system dynamics of the SBD and HADES models over the same system sizes, using the same demographic parameters, thereby partitioning the effects of demographic stochasticity and space. As system sizes are increased, the dynamics of the HADES model with respect to the SBD model, as measured by time to extinction, move from equivalent to less stable to much more stable. We analyze the effects of space on the system dynamics using animation, statistical point process analysis, and predicted system dynamics (spatial effects on the predation rate). We then show that both the destabilizing and stabilizing effects of space with respect to the SBD dynamics can be accounted for by specific nonrandom spatial patterns. We contrast our results with three commonly invoked mechanisms that affect the stability of predator-prey systems.

Although the importance of area and latitude are both well documented, few attempts have been made to integrate their effects in a single model. Most studies have been conducted by superimposing grids on equal-area projection maps and counting the number of species occurring within grid cells (i.e., quadrats). Unfortunately, different grid-based studies use different quadrat sizes, making comparisons tenuous. We developed a hierarchical model to evaluate the degree to which area (based on a nested series of quadrats of five sizes, 1000-25 000 km2) affects the latitudinal gradient in species richness. The model allows the relationship between latitude and area to be nonlinear and, in its simple form, evaluates how well species richness can be predicted by the additive influences of latitude and area. The complex model evaluates whether an area X latitude interaction accounts for significant additional variation in species richness above that in the simple model (i.e., assesses the scale dependence of the latitudinal gradient). For bats and marsupials, the simple model included only latitudinal effects and accounted for over half of the variation in species richness of each of the two taxa. The interactive effect was nonsignificant for each taxon, accounting for <0.1% of additional variation in species richness in each case. If other taxa or land masses produce similar relationships, then the form of the latitudinal gradient is relatively invariant with respect to area at 1000-25 000 km2 scales, and comparisons among studies at this spatial scale are straightforward.",97,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Areography | Bats | Biodiversity | Geographical ecology | Macroecology | Marsupials | Scale dependence,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,37,NA,NA

This difference should make extinction a relatively more important process in determining species occurrence in paleorefugia, whereas immigration should be relatively more important in neorefugia. Based on these differences, a series of eight a priori predictions relating to the diversity and distribution patterns for the biota of such sites can be generated: (1) the slope of the species-area relationship, and amount of variance explained by it, should be greater in paleorefugia as compared to neorefugia; (2) the negative relationship between habitat isolation and species richness should be stronger in neorefugia as compared to paleorefugia; (3) species richness should be expected to decrease over time in paleorefugia, but to increase over time in neorefugia; (4) the inverse correlation between site distance and community similarity (distance decay) should be stronger in neorefugia as compared to paleorefugia; (5) neorefugia should be enriched in highly vagile species relative to paleorefugia, whereas paleorefugia should be rich in less vagile species relative to neorefugia; (6) geographic factors should be more important predictors of species occurrence for neorefugia than for paleorefugia; (7) paleorefuge sites should possess more and stronger correlations between community composition and environmental covariables (such as soil chemistry, climate, etc.) as compared to neorefuge sites; and (8) the number of competitive co-equivalents held within a system of neorefugia should be greater than the number held within a series of paleorefugia.

Results from these tests were consistent with predictions. These results illustrate that colonization history may influence contemporaneous species diversity and community-composition patterns. They also suggest that (1) equilibrium has yet to be achieved in the example systems after 5000-10 000 yr, (2) the ecological-biogeographic debate centered around the mutual exclusivity of vicariance and dispersal is intrinsically flawed, and (3) optimum reserve-design strategies for biodiversity protection within paleorefuge and neorefuge systems will differ.",113,Journal,re,Review,100,1,1,"Biodiversity | Biogeography, historical | Colonization history, influence on community pattern | Conservation biology | Dispersal | Fens | Iowa (USA), northeastern | Island biogeography | Refugia, paleorefugia vs. neorefugia | Species richness | Talus slopes, algific | Vicariance",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,38,NA,NA

To simulate the effects of increased fire frequency on woody plants of the cerrado savannas of Brazil, I constructed matrix population models for five species, including a subshrub, two shrubs, and two trees, using four years of demographic data. The models projected that four of the five species will decline under frequent burning but will increase in abundance under infrequent burning. For these four, fire intervals of 2-9 yr are required for long-term persistence, depending on the species. The fifth species, a shrub, was virtually unaffected by burning. Similar data for three herbaceous species were obtained from literature sources. Among the eight species, there was a negative relationship between population growth under annual burning and population growth under unburned conditions. Woody plant species performed best under low fire frequency, and herbaceous species performed best under high fire frequency. Three of the study species propagate vegetatively by producing root suckers. Fire stimulates vegetative propagation in all three species but reduces sexual reproduction. Elasticity analysis revealed that vegetative propagation is more important than sexual reproduction for population maintenance of these three species, and that vegetative propagation is relatively more important under frequent burning. However, stasis and progression were always much more important than either mode of reproduction, with stasis making the largest contribution to population growth. Analyses of life history response experiments were performed to determine what demographic variables contributed most to the population decline under frequent burning. The effect of fire on sexual reproduction contributed little to the overall effect of fire on population growth, particularly for clonal species. Fire-induced mortality also had little effect on population growth, except for Miconia albicans, which has extremely fire-sensitive seedlings. The negative effect of fire on individual size tended to make the greatest contribution to the overall negative effect of fire on population growth, and this effect was greater for the two trees than for the shrub species. The results indicate that growth form was the primary determinant of fire response, while ability to reproduce vegetatively is important to a lesser extent.

Additionally, laboratory assays and incubations were used to elucidate the controls on net N transformations in these materials. Net N mineralization under field conditions was similar for well-decayed boles and mineral soils (0.83 and 0.61 g N·m-2 material·yr-1, respectively). Laboratory rates of net N mineralization per mass of total N were similar or higher in well-decayed boles compared to mineral soil. These results are surprising, given that the C:N ratio of well-decayed boles was much greater than that of mineral soil (117 vs. 26, respectively), and given the vastly different physical structure of these materials. Higher field and laboratory rates of net N mineralization relative to total N in boles compared to mineral soil suggest either that organically bound N contained in boles is in a more readily mineralizable form or that C compounds in well-delayed bole material are less readily metabolized by microbial heterotrophs (i.e., C availability is lower) than in mineral soil, resulting in a higher ratio of net-to-gross N mineralization because of reduced N demand by a C-limited microflora. A lower microbial respiration rate and smaller microbial biomass C relative to the total C pool in well-decayed boles than in mineral soil support the latter hypothesis. Furthermore, bole material exhibited a higher specific respiration rate (respired C per unit microbial biomass C), suggesting either a lower C-use efficiency of bole microflora or a lower C availability in boles compared to mineral soil. Both well-decayed bole and mineral soil materials showed low annual rates of net nitrification under field conditions. Using an estimate of the mass of class 4 and 5 boles in similar forest stands in the Pacific Northwest, I estimate that well-decayed boles contribute about 0.16-0.25 g N·m-2·yr-1 of plant-available N. This N flux is lower than other internal N fluxes within this forest, as well as lower than the rate of N input from the atmosphere. Total plant uptake in a nearby old-growth Douglas-fir forest has been estimated at about 4.0 g N·m-2·yr-1, suggesting that well-decayed boles may contribute about 4-6% of plant N uptake.

It is thus often unclear whether a plant's value as a food or its value as a safe shelter has played a larger role in selecting for specialization. Decorator crabs offer a novel opportunity to investigate the relative effects of diet vs. natural enemies in selecting for specialization because these crabs place plant 'shelter' on their backs as camouflage but need not use these plants as food, thus decoupling the plant's value as a food from its value as a shelter. In this study, we show that juveniles of the decorator crab Libinia dubia selectively decorate with the chemically defended brown alga Dictyota menstrualis but treat this plant as a low-preference food. Common omnivorous fishes that are potential predators of Libinia avoid consuming Dictyota due to the alga's potent chemical defenses. In the field, juvenile crabs decorated with Dictyota experience significantly less predation than crabs decorated with an alga that is not chemically noxious to local fishes, and the Dictyota metabolite that most strongly deters feeding by fishes is the specific metabolite that determines decoration choice by this crab. Thus, by behaviorally sequestering defenses from this chemically noxious plant, these small crabs reduce their susceptibility to predation. In the presence of predators, juvenile crabs reduce their rate of feeding, but not of decorating, suggesting that antipredator behavior such as decorating takes precedence over feeding. In addition, only juvenile crabs that are of a size that can be consumed by local fishes decorate at all. Adult crabs that have carapace widths exceeding the gape size of co-occurring fishes do not decorate in either the field or the laboratory. Apparently predation, rather than diet selection, drives decoration specialization in Libinia, highlighting how indirect effects of plant secondary chemistry can impact herbivore behavior, ecology, and evolution.",117,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,"Associational defense | Chemical camouflage | Decorator crab | Dictyota | Enemy-free space | Herbivory | Libinia | Marine chemical ecology | North Carolina, USA | Plant-herbivore-predator interactions | Seaweed | Specialization",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,41,all,All Open Access

Among the best examples of this pattern have been descriptions of vegetation in which species richness declines as soil fertility increases. We tested two hypotheses that have been proposed to explain this pattern. The interspecific competitive exclusion hypothesis proposes that dominant species suppress the growth of competitively subordinate species and exclude subordinate species as fertility rises. In contrast, the assemblage-level thinning hypothesis proposes that individuals of all species tend to become larger as fertility rises, and individuals of all species tend to exclude subordinate individuals of each species. Because total density declines, samples of finite numbers of individuals will result in fewer species by chance alone. To test these hypotheses, we established an experimental productivity gradient in a first-year old field using four levels of slow-release NPK fertilizer (0, 8, 16, and 32 g N/m2). At the end of the growing season, we sampled aboveground biomass and numbers of stems for each species in 72 20 X 20 cm subplots (18 reps x 4 levels), with an average sample size of 260 individual stems per plot. We observed an 80% decline in stem density with increasing fertility, and a 50% decline in species richness along this fertility gradient. A simulation of random thinning along a fertility gradient showed a nearly identical decline in species richness, supporting the assemblage-level thinning hypothesis. We also found that responses of individual species to the soil fertility gradient showed virtually no support for interspecific competitive exclusion. The overwhelming influence of density found in this study suggests that plant species richness along many productivity gradients may be strongly influenced by total stem density, and that differences in competitive ability among species, although generally important, are not necessary to create dramatic changes in species richness along fertility gradients.",129,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Aboveground biomass | Ambrosia artemisiifolia | Assemblage-level thinning | Interspecific competition | Old field | Productivity | Self-thinning | Simulation | Soil fertility | Species diversity | Species richness | Stem density,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,42,NA,NA

Spatial correlation in the incidence of fire was incorporated in the model, with correlations within and among habitat patches. The correlation in the incidence of fire declined with the distance between points in the landscape. The spatially correlated disturbance regime allowed the model to simulate partial burning of patches, with the chance of partial burning depending on the size of patches. Including spatial correlation in the model tended to increase risks of extinction by incorporating correlation between patches but also decreased risks by incorporating imperfect correlation within patches. The model was used to investigate the design of nature reserves that are exposed to disturbance by fire in mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forests of southeastern Australia. We used a number of scenarios to investigate the influence of the spatial configuration of reserves (size, number, and location of patches) on the risk of extinction of greater gliders. The model indicated that large, contiguous areas of old-growth forest were important for the persistence of greater gliders. However, in timber production forests in the Central Highlands region of Victoria, old-growth forest is rare and fragmented. Within a typical timber management area of ~6700 ha, the predicted risk of extinction for greater gliders within 300 yr in the reserved old-growth remnants was 0.44. To reduce the risk of extinction below 0.10, an additional 650 ha of regrowth forest should be reserved from timber harvesting, with these areas concentrated around the largest old-growth patches.

Here we describe how herbivore-driven mortality of a native N-fixing shrub, bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus), increases soil N and light availability, which promotes invasion by introduced grasses to the detriment of a native plant community. Soils under live and dead lupine stands contained large amounts of total N, averaging 3.14 mg N/g dry mass of soil (398 g/m2) and 3.45 mg N/g dry mass of soil (438 g/m2), respectively, over four years. In contrast, similar lupine-free soil was low in N and averaged only 1.66 mg N/g dry mass of soil (211 g/m2) over three years. The addition of N fertilizer to lupine-free soil produced an 81% increase in aboveground plant biomass compared to plots unamended with N. Mean rates of net N mineralization were higher under live lupine and where mass die-off of lupine had occurred compared to soils free of bush lupine. At all sites, only 2.5-4.2% of the total soil N pool was mineralized annually. Soil enriched by lupine is not available to colonists while lupines are alive. The dense canopy of lupine shades soil under shrubs, reducing average photon-flux density in late spring from 1725 μmol · m-2 · s-1 (full sunlight) to 13 μmol · m-2 · s-1 (underneath shrubs). Stand die-off due to insect herbivory exposed this bare, enriched soil. In January, when annual plants are establishing, average photon-flux density under dead lupines killed by insect herbivores was 370 μmol · m-2 · s-1, compared to the photon-flux density under live lupines of the same age, which averaged 83 μmol · m-2 · s-1. The availability of bare, N-rich patches of soil enabled nonnative annuals (primarily Lolium multiflorum and Bromus diandrus) to colonize sites, grow rapidly, and dominate the plant assemblage until lupines reestablished after several years. The N content of these grasses was significantly greater than the N content of the mostly native plants that occupied adjacent coastal prairie devoid of bush lupine. Between 57 and 70% of the net amount of N mineralized annually was taken up by introduced grasses and subsequently returned to the soil upon the death of these annuals.

We reconstructed 300 years of succession from limber pine (Pinus flexilis) to Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmanii) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) in two watersheds recovering from the same fire. More than 1850 live and dead trees were cored and mapped in 25 plots systematically spaced along a topographic gradient. We used tree ring analysis to reconstruct dates of tree establishment and death. Relative species abundances and basal areas were charted at 20-yr intervals, and three measures of ecological similarity were also used to capture different elements of change: simple Euclidean distance, Euclidean distance in ordination space, and Horn's C(H) similarity index. Successional rates for mesic lower slopes and north aspects were roughly twice those on south-facing side slopes. Rates were positively correlated with soil P, N, Fe, organic matter, and Parker's topographic moisture index, and negatively correlated with solar radiation and surface rock cover. Higher rates on mesic plots were primarily the result of heavy overstory mortality of pioneer limber pines ~200 yr postfire, coupled with higher recruitment of spruce and fir 200-300 yr postfire. On mesic sites, successional rates peaked during this thinning phase of limber pine, but rates were stable or slowly increasing 300 yr postfire on xeric sites. Previous studies have shown that Clark's Nutcracker catalyzes early succession by caching limber pine seeds in extensive burns, many of which germinate to form multitrunk pines. Limber pines, in turn, may act as nurse trees for spruce and fir. However, we reconstructed past spatial patterns of trees and found that limber pine mortality in midsuccession was strongly related to its clumped pattern of establishment and tendency to attract spruce and fir. Solitary pines with no spruce and fir neighbors within a 2 m radius had a >80% chance of survival, 1893-1993. In contrast, pines within clumps of six or more trees and surrounded by many spruce and fir trees had only 10-20% chance of survival, 1893-1993. The multitrunk growth form of limber pines may be selectively advantageous on harsh sites, including early postfire environments, but our results suggest that this same growth form may be disadvantageous on mesic sites with heavy spruce and fir competition during mid- to late-successional stages.

The exception is for the fractal dimension of pathways (a measure of tortuosity) in which a threshold occurred between 50% and 80% grass (50% and 20% sand) in patchy landscapes. Increasing the scale of movement by allowing individuals to move through unsuitable habitat (neighborhood size = 12 cells) reduced or eliminated any effects of patch structure on movement. Live crickets can traverse both grass and sand, and thus threshold effects in movement behavior were generally not evident in the field experiment. Only small crickets (15-25 mm) exhibited a threshold response in net displacement (straight-line distance traversed) between 50% and 80% grass cover (50% and 20% sand). Crickets did exhibit significant responses to patch structure, however. Crickets moved faster and with less tortuosity in the control (0% grass) and less-vegetated (20% grass) plots than in plots with greater habitat coverage. Crickets used grass cells significantly more (73%) than expected in the 20% patchy fractal microlandscape; crickets were reluctant to leave isolated cells of grass. Grass provided cover, but sand facilitated movement. While experimentation at the landscape scale is generally intractable or impossible, computer simulation and field experiments founded on neutral landscape models permit initial assessment of how disrupting landscape connectivity affects movement behavior.",146,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Animal movement | Crickets | Experimental model systems | Fractal geometry | Habitat fragmentation | Landscape connectivity | Landscape ecology | Neutral landscape models | Percolation theory | Spatial patterns,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,47,NA,NA

A large-scale atmospheric phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), is a strong determinant of both interannual variation and decadal trends in temperatures and precipitation during winter in northern latitudes, and its recent persistence in one extreme phase may be a substantial component of increases in global temperatures. Hence, we investigated the influences of large-scale climatic variability on plant phenology and ungulate population ecology by incorporating the NAO in statistical analyses of previously published data on: (1) the timing of flowering by plants in Norway, and (2) phenotypic and demographic variation in populations of northern ungulates. We analyzed 137 time series on plant phenology for 13 species of plants in Norway spanning up to 50 yr (44 ± 0.5 yr, mean ± 1 SE) and 39 time series on phenotypic and demographic traits of 7 species of northern ungulates from 16 populations in North America and northern Europe spanning up to 30 yr (18 ± 2.0 yr). Plant phenology was significantly related to the NAO in 97 time series (71% of the total), in which dynamics of the NAO explained, on average, between 9% and 28% of the interannual variation in flowering dates. Following increasingly warm, wet winters, most plant species (9 of 13 species) bloomed earlier by an average of 13.0 ± 0.8 d to 26.4 ± 1.8 d, (mean ± 1 SE), one-third (4 of 11 species) bloomed longer by 13.4 ± 1.1 d to 18.8 ± 1.7 d, and there was an increase in spatial variability in timing of flowering across landscapes by five of six species. Woody plants displayed less sensitivity to climatic variability than did herbaceous species, and early-blooming plants were more strongly influenced by the NAO than were late-blooming plants. Ungulate phenotypic and demographic variables were significantly related to the NAO in 28 time series (72% of the total). Large-scale climatic variability influenced growth, development, fecundity, and demographic trends of all seven species of ungulates studied, and in some populations, the NAO acted together with density dependence. Individuals within mainland populations responded to winter warming with reduced body size and increased fecundity, whereas winter warming in maritime regions led to increased body size but reduced fecundity. Across sex and age classes, between 43% and 70% of the observed range in body mass among years was attributable to the dynamics of the NAO, and within cohorts of female red deer and reindeer, 47-70% of the observed range in fecundity was related to the NAO during the winter preceding cohort birth years. All but two populations of northern ungulates declined following increasingly warmer winters, and the NAO operated, in most instances, in concert with direct density dependence to limit populations. In comparison to the original analyses of these ungulate time series, in 10 of 19 series the NAO explained an equal or greater percentage of variation than that explained by local weather. These observations indicate that large-scale climatic variability has a detectable influence on the ecology of plants and animals in a variety of terrestrial ecosystems, and that the responses of plants to winter warming may, surprisingly, be more subtle than the responses of large herbivores.",470,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,"Climate change | Density dependence | Ecosystem function | Flowering dates | Herbivores, large | North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) | Plant phenology | Plant-herbivore interactions | Population dynamics | Ungulates",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,48,NA,NA

Instead of releasing a native grass from competition, the reproductive output of Festuca idahoensis planted with Centaurea was significantly lower when neighboring Centaurea had been attacked by Agapeta.

Root systems of Centaurea that had been attacked by Trichoplusia exuded higher levels of total sugars, but not total phenols.

Changes in rates of population growth by martens were positively correlated with population densities of three species of small mammals recorded over the same time span: deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), red squirrels (Tamiasciuris hudsonicus), and flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus). We found no evidence of short-term cycles in marten abundance, nor were there significant cross-correlations at lags greater than 1 with prey population densities. Martens also showed evidence of density-dependent population growth. Such density dependence beyond the demographic effect of variation in prey density was possibly due to agonistic interactions among territory holders. Such mixtures of prey dependence and density dependence often have a stabilizing influence in theoretical models, which could contribute to the observed stability of deer mouse, red squirrel, and marten populations in Algonquin Park. Harvest intensity was negatively related to yearly variation in marten population growth.

Understanding density dependence in host-parasite interactions is important for understanding the evolution of parasite virulence and of host defense. Here we investigate density-dependent processes in the dynamics of flea subpopulations. In a first experiment, intended to establish the importance of density dependence in this host-parasite system, the founder density of parasites was manipulated, and reproductive rates of parasites measured. A second experiment was designed to identify the demographic levels at which density dependence arises in the growth of the hen flea population. The experiments show that parasite reproductive rates significantly decrease with increasing founder density.

We also tested the hypothesis that plant feeding allows omnivorous 'predators' to survive periods when prey are scarce. In addition, we compared the response of omnivores and strict predators to variation in plants and prey. We found that variation in plant parts (pods and leaves) and prey species (moth eggs and aphids) affected the survival, dispersal, and population size of big-eyed bugs, Geocoris punctipes, in Maryland lima beans. The survival of big-eyed bugs fed moth eggs was high and unaffected by the availability of lima bean pods or leaves as supplemental food. The survival of big-eyed bugs fed aphids, however, was relatively low and dramatically improved by the availability of pods. Big-eyed bugs fed only pods developed normally through the first and second instar, but development was arrested in the third instar. Only bugs fed high quality prey or mixtures of low quality prey and high quality plant food developed beyond the third instar. Plant feeding, especially pod feeding, allowed big-eyed bug nymphs to survive prey-free periods, but plant feeding was not as important for adult survival when prey were unavailable. The dispersal of adult big-eyed bugs from lima bean plants with pods was significantly lower than the dispersal of big-eyed bugs from plants without pods. The presence of aphids on lima bean plants also reduced the dispersal of big-eyed bugs. Unexpectedly, the presence of moth eggs, high quality prey as measured by big-eyed bug survival in previous experiments, did not reduce the dispersal of big-eyed bugs. Populations of big-eyed bugs were larger in plots of beans with pods than in plots of pod-free beans. Furthermore, the most important predictor of the density of big-eyed bugs was the number of pods per plant. Populations of other omnivorous insects (minute pirate bugs, damsel bugs, and ladybird beetles) were also larger in plots of beans with pods than in plots of pod-free beans. However, other omnivores responded to changes in the numbers of flowers per plant and not to changes in the number of pods per plant or potential prey. Conversely, the most important predictor of the density of strict, non-plant-feeding predators was the density of potential prey (herbivores). Our results indicate that omnivory provides ecological flexibility for big-eyed bugs. Feeding at more than one trophic level furnishes big-eyed bugs with complimentary resources that allow these omnivores to survive when resources at one trophic level are of low quality (e.g., aphids) or when resources at one trophic level are totally unavailable (e.g., prey). Furthermore, the dynamics of omnivorous insects such as big-eyed bugs are intimately associated with variation in their host plants and not with changes in the density of their prey. Omnivorous insects appear to track resources at the lowest trophic level at which they feed, in this case plants, and not resources farther up the food chain (e.g., prey).",150,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Acyrthosiphum pisum | Big-eyed bugs | Corn earworm | Geocoris punctipes | Helicoverpa zea | Lima beans | Omnivory | Pea aphids | Phaseolus lunatus | Plant quality | Population persistence | Prey quality,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,52,NA,NA

We constructed a dynamic state variable model to examine how the measure of fitness, ramet and genet mortality, and the assimilation rates of a parent and its clonal offspring influence behavioral investments in ramet growth, clonal offspring, seeds, and continued resource translocation to clonal offspring after establishment. The model leads to predictions that ramet and genet mortality rates and/or the fitness payoff from producing seeds must be high for seed production to capture a proportion of reproductive investments. If seed production occurs as a result of high ramet or genet mortality rates, then results indicate that it is better to produce seeds early in the season, regardless of ramet size. In contrast, if seed production is favored as a result of its large contribution to fitness, then it is predicted to depend on ramet size more than on time. While the total amount of biomass directed to reproduction is predicted to increase with a ramet's own productivity, the proportion of this biomass invested clonally or sexually depends on the resource environment encountered by that ramet's clonal offspring; more productive surroundings favor investment in clonal offspring that forage locally, reduce the risk of genet mortality, and increase the expectation for future seed production by the genet. The model we present also suggests that a higher rate of translocation to support clonal offspring benefits a genet when the parent and offspring ramets have contrasting productivities. In addition, the model also leads to the predictions that translocation is more advantageous when the currency of fitness selects for increases in ramet size more than ramet number and when the probability of mortality is correlated among ramets.",114,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Clonal plants | Clonal reproduction | Dynamic model | Integration | Seeds | Sexual reproduction | State variable | Trade-off | Translocation,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,53,NA,NA

Although protocols have been relatively uniform, these experiments have yielded mixed results, implicating nitrogen, phosphorus, silica, iron, and several other elements as factors limiting phytoplankton growth. Meta-analysis has the potential to explain much of this variation by exploring the relationship between the magnitude of limitation and various environmental characteristics. We quantified limitation with a simple metric, Δr, that estimates the change in the per unit growth rate of phytoplankton directly attributable to addition of a specific nutrient, such as nitrogen, iron, or phosphorus. Preliminary analyses indicated that experiments lasting ≤1 d exhibited time lags in the numerical response of phytoplankton to nutrient addition, while experiments lasting >7 d confounded nutrient limitation with processes such as increased grazing or depletion of other nutrients. Thus, we restricted the meta-analysis to results from 2-7 d experiments. These analyses showed that phosphorus enrichment usually had little impact on phytoplankton growth, while enrichments of nitrogen and iron increased phytoplankton growth by 0.1-0.3 d-1. Nutrient limitation due to N, P, and Fe varied significantly among sites. Nitrogen limitation was greatest in nearshore, nutrient-polluted, and temperate environments (where most experiments have been performed), while phosphorus and iron limitation were strongest in open ocean, unpolluted, and tropical ecosystems, or those receiving pollutants with high N:P ratios. Because phosphorus-enrichment studies have been most often performed in relatively polluted coastal waters, the possible role of phosphorus in limiting primary production in unpolluted oceanic systems may have been underestimated.

However, these results might be confounded by underlying correlations between egg size and parental attributes. At Coats Island (Northwest Territories, Canada), in 1994 and 1995, we examined the effects of egg size and parental quality on posthatching growth in mass and wing length in the Thick-billed Murre, a colonial, cliff-nesting, Arctic seabird in which the single chick leaves the nest at a young age and at a preliminary stage of development. The relationship between egg size and parental quality was randomized by switching eggs among pairs. The size of the egg originally laid by the experimental females was used as a putative measure of their quality. The size of the egg from which the fostered chicks hatched had little effect on the rate at which they gained mass. Conversely, the rate of wing growth increased with egg size, the main difference occurring at 6-10 d of age, the period at which the primary coverts (the longest feathers on the wings of nestling murres) burst from the sheaths. It appears that the main difference in growth rate was created by the effect of egg size on the age at which the sheaths burst. The difference in feather length created by this effect was maintained through the nestling period. The size of the experimental pairs' original egg was a weak predictor of the growth of the chicks they fostered. In one year, chicks that had their wings grow quickly departed the nest at younger ages than those that had their wings grow slowly. This pattern is observed frequently in nonexperimental Thick-billed Murre studies and was found among unmanipulated chicks in one year of this study. The length of the wing feathers probably has an effect on the chick's ability to depart successfully from the colony.

Using a total of six early-, mid-, and late-season species of sawflies consuming mountain birch foliage, we studied whether and how larval growth rate is buffered against low-quality foliage by plasticity in foraging behavior. We measured species-specific patterns in foraging behavior, the costs and benefits of behavioral plasticity, and postingestive physiological efficiencies along a leaf quality gradient. We conducted the experiments on 20 individual mountain birch trees, which were known from previous tests to vary in quality for herbivores. To our knowledge, this is the first study testing the relationship between compensatory consumption and dispersion of feeding bouts. In spite of species-specific variation in the level of postingestive efficiency, leaves from the same poor-quality trees were hard to process physiologically by all the sawfly species. However, sawfly species differed dramatically in the ways their larvae dispersed their feeding sites and consumed leaf mass on poor-quality trees. Larvae displayed two different responses to low-quality food that were almost mutually exclusive and corresponded to the larval feeding phenology of the herbivore species. Species showing dispersion of feeding sites on poor-quality trees were early-summer species; their larvae generally consumed young and nutritious foliage heterogeneously distributed within canopies. In contrast, late-summer species responded to poor leaf quality by increasing their consumption rate. Behavioral traits and physiological efficiencies did not vary independently, but responded as an integrated hierarchical trait network to variation in leaf quality, which generated relatively stable growth rates. Compensatory consumption was beneficial to larvae because it improved larval performance on poor-quality trees. Dispersion of feeding sites may have been advantageous because larvae are able to find higher quality leaves within the heterogeneous mountain birch canopy.

In community ecology, these measures of effect size will often be some measure of the strength of interactions between taxa. However, indices of interaction strength vary greatly among both theoretical and empirical studies, and the connection between hypotheses about interaction strength and the metrics that are used to test these hypotheses are often not explicit. We describe criteria for choosing appropriate metrics and methods for comparing them among studies at three stages of designing a meta-analysis to test hypotheses about variation in interaction intensity: (1) the choice of response variable; (2) how effect size is calculated using the response in two treatments; and (3) whether there is a consistent quantitative effect across all taxa and systems studied or only qualitatively similar effects within each taxon-system combination. The consequences of different choices at each of these stages are illustrated with a meta-analysis to examine the relationship between competition/facilitation intensity and productivity in plants. The analysis used a database of 296 cases in 14 studies. The results were unexpected and largely inconsistent with existing theory: competition intensity often significantly declined (rather than increased) with productivity, and facilitation was sometimes restricted to more productive (rather than less productive) sites. However, there was considerable variation in the pattern among response variables and measures of effect size. For example, on average, competitive effects on final biomass and survival decreased with standing crop, but competitive effects on growth rate did not. On the other hand, facilitative interactions were more common at low standing crop for final biomass and growth rate, but more common at high standing crop for survival. Results were more likely to be significant using the log response ratio (in[removal/control]) as the effect size than using the relative competition intensity ([removal-control]/removal), although the trends for these conceptually similar indices did not differ. When all studies were grouped in a single meta-regression of interaction intensity on standing crop to test quantitative similarity among studies, survival showed the clearest negative relationship. However, when the same regressions were done for each unique combination of taxon and site within each study to test for qualitative similarity among studies, the slopes averaged over studies tended to be negative for biomass and growth rate, but not different from zero for survival. These results are subject to a number of caveats because of the limitations of the available data-most notably, the extension of effects of interactions on individual growth or survival to effects on population distribution and abundance or community structure is highly problematic. Nevertheless, the fact that none of the meta-analyses demonstrated a significant positive relationship between competition and standing crop but that we frequently found negative relationships is an important pattern that has not been apparent from qualitative surveys of individual studies, and it demonstrates the potential power of meta-analysis in ecology.

We investigate the power and bias of the new test on the basis of simulated data. The power compares well with a test of unit slope in a log-log plot (although it is usually somewhat lower). However, in contrast to the latter method, the test for convexity is much more resistant to measurement error.

In both cases, the variance is intermediate between the Gamma (variance proportional to the squared mean) and the Poisson (variance proportional to the mean) distributions. A negative binomial (with k ≃ 3.5) describes the variance well. The variance is interpreted as resulting from sampling errors, spatial heterogeneity, and environmental stochasticity. Incorporating this error structure, the optimal models linking the two main juvenile stages are, for each area, nonlinear and significantly convex (P < 0.05). The full models are highly significant (P < 0.001), and the examination of the residuals does not reveal any remaining structure. We conclude that the survival of juvenile cod along the Norwegian Skagerrak coast is density dependent, probably because of cannibalism, competition for habitat, and food limitation. The functional form of density-dependence in the per capita survival rate is estimated to be approximately log-linear.",50,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Age-structured interactions | Cannibalism | Competition | Gadus morhua | Gamma variance | Generalized Additive Model | Negative binomial distribution | Norway | Poisson variance | Stochastic population dynamics | Time series analysis,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,59,NA,NA

It has been generally assumed that these inverted biomass pyramids are the direct result of high specific production rates of phytoplankton and a tight coupling between producers and consumers. There are, however, at least two alternative hypotheses: (1) heterotrophic biomass turnover is much slower in oligotrophic than eutrophic systems; and (2) oligotrophic planktonic communities are significantly subsidized by allochthonous organic matter. In this study we assessed these hypotheses by establishing the relationship between plankton biomass structure (partition between auto- and heterotrophs), plankton function (plankton primary production and respiration) and whole-lake gas (O2 and CO2) fluxes in 20 temperate lakes that span a large range in primary production. We show that the balance of phytoplankton production and community respiration (P/R ratio) is always below unity in unproductive lakes where heterotrophic biomass (H) is high relative to autotrophic biomass (A), suggesting that these planktonic food webs function as heterotrophic systems and must be subsidized by allochthonous organic matter. Further, rates of phytoplankton specific production are not highest in communities characterized by dominance of heterotrophic biomass. All except the most productive lakes were supersaturated in CO2 and undersaturated in O2. Our results support the hypothesis that excess CO2 in lakes originates from the breakdown of terrestrial organic carbon by planktonic organisms. A simple model in which both allochthonous organic matter and phytoplankton production support the metabolism of heterotrophs reproduced the patterns and magnitudes of metabolism, P/R ratio, biomass turnover time, and whole-system gas flux among lakes. These patterns of metabolism and structure suggest that inverted biomass pyramids in temperate lakes, and perhaps in other aquatic systems, reflect the heterotrophic nature of these plankton communities rather than turnover rates of autotrophs or heterotrophs.",208,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Autotrophy | Carbon dioxide | Gas exchange | Heterotrophy | Lakes | Oxygen | Plankton | Primary production | Respiration,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,60,NA,NA

With new tools becoming available in analytical chemistry and fluid dynamics, investigators can now quantitatively address the processes governing chemical signals in field habitats. This study identifies the role of amino acids as signal molecules regulating search behavior and foraging success by estuarine mud snails (Ilyanassa obsoleta). For the first time, methods are described for measuring chemical signal production, release, and transport in field habitats, over temporal and spatial scales consistent with olfactory information processing. Rates of advection and turbulent mixing were determined, and shear velocities and roughness Reynolds numbers were estimated to characterize bottom boundary layer flows. Nearly instantaneous chemical measurements were made using a computerized microprobe system and conservative tracer to establish the environmental distributions of signal molecules at rates similar to those sampled by olfactory receptor neurons. In addition, we determined the dissolved free amino acid (DFAA) compositions (up to 18 amino acids), concentrations, and effluent release rates for live intact and injured fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator) and hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria), which are common prey from mud snail habitats. The field site populated by mud snails was found to be more conducive at broadcasting stronger chemical signals over longer distances than most other estuarine and ocean habitats. Live fiddler crabs released amino acids at very low fluxes (0.1 nmol·min-1·g [wet tissue mass]-1), while live intact clams took up amino acids from seawater. Once injured, hard clams and fiddler crabs released DFAAs at 88 and 6804 nmol·min-1·g-1, respectively. Mud snails were significantly attracted to injured clams and crabs, but not to intact prey, as compared with controls. Synthetic mixtures of amino acids, simulating fluids leaking from injured prey, were also highly attractive. When we tested for effects of amino acid composition, concentration, mean volume flow rate (of chemical input), and flux, in separate experiments, only flux directly correlated with the number of mud snails attracted. The attraction of mud snails is thus more tightly coupled to the physical transport of chemical stimuli than to the molecular properties of specific amino acids.",48,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Amino acid | Chemical attractant | Clam | Estuary | Fiddler crab | Foraging | High-performance liquid chromatography | Ilyanassa | Mercenaria | Mud snail | Olfaction | Uca,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,61,NA,NA

Most previous studies that sought to test this trade-off hypothesis compared kinetic parameters of extant strains of bacteria, with mixed results. We employed an experimental approach in which bacterial populations were propagated for many generations under two distinct regimes and their evolutionary responses were monitored. Thirty-six populations of bacteria were allowed to adapt evolutionarily to either abundant (batch culture) or scarce (chemostat culture) resource regimes. The competitive fitness of each derived line, relative to its ancestor, was then measured under both regimes. The trade-off hypothesis predicts that adaptation to either selective regime causes a concomitant loss of fitness under the alternative regime. Overall, our findings failed to support this hypothesis, and several cases contradict it. Only two derived lines showed clear trade-offs, having significantly adapted to the selective regime while becoming significantly less fit in the alternative regime. By contrast, five derived lines significantly improved in the alternative regime even as they adapted to their selective regime. Summing over all 36 derived lines (including those for which the observed fitness changes were nonsignificant under one or both regimes), 15 cases support the trade-off hypothesis, whereas 21 indicate the opposite result. These data therefore refute the necessity, or even general tendency, for evolutionary trade-offs in performance under conditions of resource abundance vs. scarcity. Instead, these data suggest that bacteria are able to adapt to a particular level of resource via multiple evolutionary pathways, which may produce either gains or losses in fitness at some different level of resource.",68,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Bacteria | Bioremediation | Competition | Experimental evolution | Microbial ecology | R and K selection | Resource availability | Trade-offs,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,62,NA,NA

We estimated fruit abundance and mist-netted birds at four distances from edge to forest interior (0-10, 30-40, 60-70, and 190-200 m) in three young (<12 yr) and three old (>40 yr) edges. Fruit-sampling plots (50-m2 plots) at each of the four distances were classified into gap and intact forest. Fruit abundance and frugivore capture rates varied from edge to forest interior, but such changes depended on edge age. At new edges, the total number of fruits was higher at the forest edge than at the forest interior, whereas bird captures showed the opposite trend. At old edges, the total number of fruits and bird capture rates did not vary among the four distances. In a first group of 12 plant and four bird species, the distribution of individuals in fruit (7 species) and captures (3 species) from edge to forest interior differed between old and new edges. In a second group of 18 plant and five bird species, which included those that were not amenable for a comparison between old and new edges and those that were not influenced by edge age, the distribution of individuals in fruit (12 species) and captures (3 species) was not uniform from forest edge to forest interior. Lastly, 124 plant and 19 bird species with <20 individuals in fruit and captures, respectively, were classified into very sparse and sparse species. We found that all but the sparse frugivores were more abundant at the forest edge than in the forest interior. Because very sparse and sparse plant species showed such a clear trend, we used seeds retrieved from mist-netted birds to assess potential seed movement of these species from edge to forest interior. Seeds of very sparse and sparse plant species were found both at forest 'edge' (0-10 m) and at forest 'interior' (the three other distances combined). Our results suggest that birds are not responding to changes in fruit abundance (resource-base-driven mechanism). Instead, they indicate that frugivore capture rates reflect either a direct edge effect or a non-edge induced effect on birds. The apparent uncoupling of processes generating the observed patterns in fruit and frugivore abundance may affect seed dispersal in important ways.

Moreover, these two species breed interspersed on cliffs and potentially compete for nest sites on St. George Island, Alaska, which is the largest of only four known breeding locations of the Red-legged Kittiwake. On St. George Island, nesting ledges used by Red-legged Kittiwakes are narrower than those of Black-legged Kittiwakes, are more often located beneath overhangs, and are concentrated on high-elevation cliffs. To determine whether the nesting distribution of Red-legged Kittiwakes on St. George Island is shaped by competitive displacement by larger bodied Black-legged Kittiwakes, I compared realized niches of the two species (determined by measuring physical characteristics of natural nest sites) with fundamental niches of the two species (determined by observing nest site preferences of kittiwakes on artificial nesting ledges that differed in width, overhang cover, and elevation). The displacement hypothesis predicted that interspecific overlap in physical characteristics of nest sites would be greater for artificial than for natural nesting ledges (fundamental niches would overlap to a greater degree than realized niches). In contrast, nest site preferences of kittiwakes on artificial ledges differed markedly between species and mirrored the characteristics of natural nest sites: Red-legged Kittiwakes preferred narrower ledges, Black-legged Kittiwakes preferred wider ledges, and both species preferred ledges located within high-density clusters of conspecifics. Thus, I rejected the competitive displacement hypothesis and concluded that interspecific competition does not currently shape the breeding distributions of kittiwakes on St. George Island.

During outbreaks of its major pests, geometrid moths, a typical sequence of defoliation lasts 2-3 successive years. We simulated a defoliator outbreak by different combinations of 25% and 75% defoliations over three successive years. We studied patterns of resource allocation during and after the simulated outbreaks by quantifying the effect of different degrees of cumulative defoliation on mountain birch resistance, growth, and reproduction. Bioassays showed that the delayed inducible resistance largely waned within 2 yr, whereas the effects of defoliation on tree growth and reproduction persisted longer. Cumulative defoliations intensified birch resistance only slightly, and the efficacy of resistance remained in the range induced by a single defoliation event in other studies. This suggests that, even after cumulative defoliations, the 'killing power' of induced resistance in mountain birch accounts for only a fraction of that required to end a geometrid outbreak. A low level of defoliation (25%) did not generally affect the trees, but high (75%) defoliation decreased their growth and reproduction and also decreased their palatability to insects. Sequential annual defoliations reduced the mass of female catkins, whereas seedspecific mass and seed viability were most affected by previous-year defoliation. The number of catkins per tree was most affected by defoliation 2 yr earlier. Thus, previous-year defoliation affected catkin and seed properties due to the exhaustion of nutrients required for their development, but earlier defoliation limited the catkin number by affecting bud type determination. Similarly, long shoot number was affected by defoliation 2 yr earlier, but cumulative defoliations also reduced the length of long shoots. Trees maintained leaf biomass at the expense of growth and reproduction; leaf dry mass, leaf area, and specific leaf mass were only slightly and nonsignificantly reduced by previous-year defoliation.

The first assumption is that natural hybridization will not affect the evolutionary history of the hybridizing forms because there is a low probability of producing novel genotypes with higher relative fitness. The second viewpoint is more extreme in that it assumes that all hybrid genotypes will be less fit. Even if rare gene flow does occur it will thus not contribute to patterns of diversification or adaptation because the hybrids will always be selected against. Examples from both plant and animal hybridization are discussed that are not consistent with these assumptions. Numerous instances of natural hybridization are used to demonstrate that extremely low fertility or viability of early-generation hybrids (e.g., F1, F2, B1) does not necessarily prevent extensive gene flow and the establishment of new evolutionary lineages.

The average correlation between the time series was 0.34 (CI(95%) = [0.31, 0.36]) for the grey-sided vole and 0.16 (CI(95%) = [0.13, 0.18]) for the Japanese wood mouse. This average correlation was decomposed spatially using spatial autocorrelation techniques and the nonparametric covariance function. The lower region-wide correlation in the latter species was found to be due to the spatial covariance dropping more rapidly with distance. The spatial scale of the dynamics was measured by the L0 correlation length (the distance at which the covariance is equal to that between two randomly chosen sites within the region). This distance was estimated to be ~50 km for the grey-sided vole and 20-30 km for the Japanese wood mouse. The L0 correlation length was linked to the scaling of the underlying ecological processes through a simple epiphenomenological model motivated by diffusion theory (the exponential covariance model). A review of the ecology of the rodent species indicates that the spatial scale of the pattern of fluctuation of the grey-sided vole is more extensive than can be accounted for by a process of dispersal of voles. Predator movement and regulation of the vole by predators are possible causes of the pattern of spatial covariance. The Japanese wood mouse has a scale of dynamics slightly larger than what may be accounted for by the movement of individuals. This species constitutes a negligible part of predators' diet. Food resource dynamics may be an important regulatory factor and a source of spatial covariance. We interpret the results as indicating that the natural scales of regulation are species specific and can be large relative to the scale of local populations.",127,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Apodemus speciosus | Bootstrapping | Clethrionomys rufocanus | Hokkaido | Nonparametric covariance function | Rodents | Scale of regulation | Spatial correlogram,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,73,NA,NA

However, an alternative interpretation is that seeds may be using environmental signals to inform the timing of their germination and thereby use dormancy as a mechanism of habitat choice. Nicotiana attenuata Torr. ex Wats. (Solanaceae) is typically found for less than three years after fire in the sagebrush, blackbrush, and pinyon-juniper forests of the Great Basin desert of North America. A dormant seed bank is established during this ephemeral post-fire period, and pyrolysis products of α-cellulose (containing only C, H, and O) in wood smoke are known to initiate germination in dormant seeds of this species. We demonstrated in a glasshouse experiment that germination into burned soils (as compared to unburned) results in a 12-fold increase in lifetime seed production, which reflects a minimum estimate of the fitness benefit of making accurate germination decisions. With seed bioassays, we examined the distribution of this smoke signal in the A1 soil layer at several burned areas in southwestern Utah, United States to determine whether the presence of this smoke-derived germination cue predicts the spatial and temporal occurrence of N. attenuata populations after fires. Although we found no evidence for the germination signal in areas that had not been burned for 30 yr, the occurrence of the germination signal did not perfectly coincide with the distribution of populations. We found evidence for its transport by wind and water into adjacent unburned areas (from 40 m to 1 km away from a burned site) and its persistence over time (for ≥7 yr), making this signal an unreliable indicator of the plant's habitat. To resolve this discrepancy, we examined the effect of unburned A0 soil horizon on smoke-induced germination. The litter-containing A0 soil horizon (and aqueous extracts thereof), collected from underneath seven dominant species from later stages of post-fire succession, completely inhibited germination of both dormant and nondormant seeds, even in the presence of a smoke cue in excess of that required to elicit germination. The inhibitory effect was limited to the early stages of germination (48 h after exposure to smoke), and we confirmed these results with natural seed banks. We demonstrated that the A0 soil horizons and their aqueous extracts are not toxic to N. attenuata seeds or growing plants, and they have no effect on lifetime seed production. Moreover, they do not inhibit the germination of the nondormant, conspecific native tobacco, N. trigonophylla, which grows in the same area but is not associated with fire. Hence, these negative factors do not function in allelopathically mediated competitive interactions between N. attenuata and later successional species. We propose that the occurrence of N. attenuata populations after fires can be explained by the combined stimulatory effect of smoke-derived signals on the dormant seed bank and the inhibitory effect of signals from unburned litter, and that both signals are required for N. attenuata to identify its germination niche.",86,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,A  and A  soil horizons 0 1 | Allelopathy | Fire | Germination signals | Litter-inhibited germination | Nicotiana attenuata | Positive and negative control | Seed banks | Seed dormancy | Smoke-induced germination,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,74,NA,NA

Studies in the wild and in gardens with synthetic crosses showed that hybrid eucalypts supported the greatest species richness and abundances of insect and fungal taxa. In an updated review of 152 case studies of taxa associated with diverse hybridizing systems, there were 43 (28%) cases of hybrids being more susceptible than their parent species, 7 (5%) resistant, 35 (23%) additive, 35 (23%) dominant, and 32 (21%) showed no response to hybridization. Thus, most taxa respond to hybrids in ways that result in equal or greater abundance, and hybrids tend to accumulate the taxa of their parent species. These studies suggest that genetic-based plant traits affect the distribution of many species and that the variation in hybrids can be used as tools to examine the genetic components of community structure and biodiversity. Several patterns have emerged thus far. (1) Genetic variation between classes of hybrids (e.g., F1's vs. backcrosses) may equal or even exceed that found between species. (2) As a reflection of this genetic variation, herbivores are more likely to differentiate between hybrid classes than they are to differentiate between pure plant species. (3) The communities associated with different hybrid classes can differ from one another as well as from their parental species. (4) Generalist and specialist herbivores predictably vary in their responses to hybrids. (5) Plant hybrid zones may represent essential habitat for some arthropod species. (6) Even nesting birds respond to hybridizing plants. (7) Including multiple trophic levels and taxa from microbes to vertebrates, susceptible hybrid genotypes support greater biodiversity than resistant genotypes. (8) The effects of hybridization on common or keystone species can either positively or negatively affect biodiversity. The indirect impacts of hybridization on biodiversity may exceed the direct impacts and may result in 'apparent' herbivore resistance or susceptibility at the community level. (9) Although hybrids are often maligned, exotic or problem hybrids generally result from human disturbances, whereas native hybrids are part of natural ecosystems and should be conserved. Three predictions are made: (1) Intermediate genetic differences between the parental species will result in the greatest genetic variation in the hybrid zone, which in turn will have a positive effect on biodiversity. (2) Bidirectional introgression enhances species richness on hybrids, whereas F1 sterility and unidirectional introgression limit the accumulation of species on hybrids. (3) Although susceptible hybrids are likely to support the greatest biodiversity, the impacts of hybridization on keystone species will be crucial in determining the overall effect.",171,Journal,ar,Article,100,6,6,Biodiversity | Conservation and endangered species | Genetic basis of community structure | Genetic diversity | Indirect effects | Keystone species | Plant hybrid zones | Specialists and generalists,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,75,NA,NA

The manipulations included additions and removals of planktivorous and piscivorous fish over a period of seven years, thereby producing changes in planktivory rates on the zooplankton community. Applying autoregressive models to time-series data, collected during weekly samples, we estimated the direct interaction strengths between species, thereby constructing a quantitative interaction web for the zooplankton community. We then used this interaction web to explore the roles of direct and indirect interactions between species in determining the long-term changes in zooplankton biomasses that were observed over the course of the experimental manipulations. The analysis identified Daphnia pulex as a keystone species. This large herbivore had strong direct interactions with other zooplankton species and was strongly affected by changes in planktivory. Consequently, changes in the biomasses of other zooplankton species during the planktivory manipulations were influenced strongly by indirect interactions acting through changes in D. pulex biomass. In addition, we used the analysis to ask whether information about the response of species to planktivory manipulations could be used to anticipate species' responses to other types of perturbation.

Crossbills did not require more time to remove seeds from closed ponderosa pine (P. ponderosa) cones with spines. However, crossbills required significantly more time (18-34%) to remove seeds from open ponderosa pine and Table Mountain pine (P. pungens) cones with spines than from cones whose spines had been removed.

Whereas the evolution of changes in the length of time seeds are retained in closed cones and that of changes in the presence of spines appear independent, changes in the length of time seeds are retained in open cones were associated with changes in the presence or development of spines.

One goal of meta-analysis is testing null hypotheses of no response to experimental manipulations. Many ecologists, however, are more interested in quantitatively measuring processes and examining their systematic variation across systems and conditions. This latter goal requires a suite of diverse, ecologically based metrics of effect size, with each appropriately matched to an ecological question of interest. By specifying ecological models, we can develop metrics of effect size that quantify the underlying process or response of interest and are insensitive to extraneous factors irrelevant to the focal question. A model will also help to delineate the set of studies that fit the question addressed by the meta-analysis. We discuss factors that can give rise to heterogeneity in effect sizes (e.g., due to differences in experimental protocol, parameter values, or the structure of the models that describe system dynamics) and illustrate this variation using some simple models of plant competition. Variation in time scale will be one of the most common factors affecting a meta-analysis, by introducing heterogeneity in effect sizes. Different metrics will apply to different time scales, and time-series data will be vital in evaluating the appropriateness of different metrics to different collections of studies. We then illustrate the application of ecological models, and associated metrics of effect size, in meta-analysis by discussing and/or synthesizing data on species interactions, mutual interference between consumers, and individual physiology. We also examine the use of metrics when no single, specific model applies to the synthesized studies. These examples illustrate that the diversity of ecological questions demands a diversity of ecologically meaningful metrics of effect size.

To assess the consequences of the symbiosis at the plant community level, we conducted a 5-yr field experiment in tallgrass prairie to investigate the influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on plant species composition, relative abundances, and diversity. Replicate plots in which mycorrhizal fungi were suppressed with benomyl application every two weeks during each growing season, were compared to nontreated mycorrhizal control plots on six watershed units at the Konza Prairie in northeastern Kansas. Benomyl successfully reduced mycorrhizal colonization to <25% of mycorrhizal control plots. Mycorrhizal colonization of roots in control plots was inversely related to annual precipitation. Suppression of mycorrhizae resulted in decreases in abundances of the dominant, obligately mycotrophic C4 tall grasses, compensatory increases in abundances of many subordinate facultatively mycotrophic C3 grasses and forbs, but no change in total aboveground biomass, as estimated from canopy density. Suppression of mycorrhizal symbiosis resulted in a large increase in plant species diversity. Two possible mechanisms for mycorrhizal mediation of plant species composition and diversity are: (1) alterations in resource distribution among neighbors via hyphal connections, and (2) differential host species responses to mycorrhizal fungal colonization in communities in which the competitive dominants are more strongly or more weakly mycotrophic than their neighbors. The results of this study demonstrate that mycorrhizal symbiosis can have large effects on plant community structure, and that differential host species response to fungal colonization is a key factor explaining the dominance of warm-season C4 grasses in tallgrass prairie and limiting plant species evenness and diversity.

In one group, we hatched larvae from winter diapausing eggs in a light regime that mimics a relatively early time in the season. In the other group we hatched larvae in a light regime that mimics a late time in the season. In the late (time constrained) group, larvae would have very little time to complete development and reach a large size so that they could attain their full reproductive potential prior to winter. In the first experiment, the behaviors we assess are activity rate, which is an indicator of foraging effort and willingness to take risks, and cannibalism, which is a component of the mortality risk of foraging. As predicted, time-constrained larvae increased their activity rates, perhaps in an attempt to increase weight gain, and as a result they suffered higher rates of cannibalism. In the second experiment, we measured development rate as the rate of molting and age at maturity.

This relationship was corroborated by primary consumer δ15N and δ13C data from the literature, indicating that habitat-specific variation in baseline δ15N and δ13C is a widespread phenomenon in freshwater systems.

In this study we investigate factors that affect the feeding decisions of an omnivorous thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis) that eats both animal prey and plant foliage. In the presence of prey (mite eggs), adult and larval thrips consumed nearly half the amount of plant tissue as did thrips without prey. We manipulated host-plant quality by exposing plants to spider mite feeding. In the absence of prey, systemically induced plant responses following herbivory reduced the amount of feeding by thrips compared to that on uninduced control plants. In the presence of prey, induced responses caused a shift in the feeding preferences of thrips: thrips consumed half the amount of plant material and twice the number of prey on induced plants as did thrips on uninduced control plants. Our findings are relevant to understanding the complex factors that shape food-web interactions in nature. Variation in host-plant quality and availability of prey can exert a strong influence on the feeding preferences of omnivores.

In Trinidad, tributaries of the Guanapo River have high densities of a killirish, Rivulus hartii, but the river also contains a strong piscivore that may affect the quality of the river as a movement corridor linking the adjoining tributaries. We hypothesized that R. hartii in the river, where they are scarce and confined to margins, would show stress as predicted for an animal in transit through a hostile corridor. We predicted that river fish would take in less food, grow more slowly, and contain fewer mature oocytes than tributary fish. We tested these predictions by comparing R. hartii from paired tributary and river sites for food intake, growth, and oocyte counts. We also asked whether R. hartii could spawn successfully in shallow water, such as at the river margins. To determine whether the river would satisfy criteria for its use as a movement corridor (movement along the river and movement in and out of tributaries), we marked 709 R. hartii in a 500-m stretch of river and two adjoining tributaries and recaptured them on seven sampling dates over a 15-mo period. Contrary to our predictions, R. hartii in the river showed no stress in the form of reduced food intake, growth, or suppressed reproductive output. Instead, we detected no difference in food intake of R. hartii sampled from paired tributary-river sites, and river R. hartii displayed a greater growth rate and contained more mature oocytes than did their tributary counterparts. Laboratory and field studies also revealed that R. hartii can spawn viable eggs in shallow water that does not cover their bodies. The movement study confirmed that the river has a conduit function for communication between tributaries, but the river also has a habitat function, as it contains resident individuals that grow and reproduce in the corridor.

Results have been contradictory, with some researchers finding a decrease in the importance of belowground competition and an increase in aboveground competition with increased productivity, and others finding either no relationship, or a positive correlation between the various factors. Belowground competitive intensity (BCI), resulting from root interactions, and total competitive intensity (TCI), resulting from both root and shoot interactions, have usually been measured as the proportional growth reduction due to competition (relative to growth without competition). Instead of direct measurement, aboveground competitive intensity (ACI) has been estimated by assuming that aboveground competition and belowground competition do not interact to affect plant growth, and therefore ACI + BCI = TCI. In this study, Abutilon theophrasti was used as a focal species to determine whether an interaction between the two competitive forms could exist. Target plants were grown with varying degrees of interaction with the roots of neighboring plants, through the use of modified root exclusion tubes, and by tying back the aboveground neighboring vegetation. In total, 16 combinations of varying intensities of aboveground and belowground interactions with neighbors were created at each of two fertilization levels. The strength of belowground competition decreased with fertilization, while neither aboveground competition nor total competition (occurring both above- and belowground simultaneously) varied among fertilization treatments. Not only was there evidence for an interaction between above- and belowground competition, the form of interaction varied with productivity, switching from no interaction in the unfertilized block to a positive interaction in the fertilized block. With fertilization, belowground competition decreased a plant's ability to compete in asymmetric competition for light. These results contrast with existing models of the role of competition in plant communities, and a new model is presented.

The average abundance and population variability (the s-index) generally increased from spring to fall in C. rufocanus but were typically highest in summer for the Apodemus populations. Based on a comprehensive and comparative review of the population and community biology of the species we made four explicit predictions about the pattern of density dependence: (1) the three species were expected to exhibit socially induced direct density dependence, but (2) this was expected to be weaker in the Apodemus species than C. rufocanus; (3) delayed density dependence caused by predation was only expected in C. rufocanus; thus (4) time series of C. rufocanus were expected to reflect a second-order dynamic process, and those of the Apodemus species were expected to reflect a first-order process. Dennis and Taper's method based on the Gompertz model was used to test for direct and delayed density dependence and thereby to test the predictions. Direct density dependence was detected in most series (81.0-97.5%) for all three seasons and for all three species. A significant proportion of the time series of C. rufocanus (11.8-18.5%) exhibited negative delayed density dependence, whereas detection rates in the two Apodemus species did not differ from that expected by chance alone. Autoregressive analyses corroborated this: a secondorder process was commonly found to be the appropriate model for the time series of C. rufocanus, whereas a first-order process was preferred for most time series of the Apodemus species. The high incidence of direct density dependence in all three species and the contrasting results on delayed density dependence between C. rufocanus and the Apodemus species are discussed with reference to social and trophic interactions. Territoriality, delayed maturation, and reduced pregnancy rates are probable causes for the high incidence of direct density dependence in all species. The more unpredictable variability in Apodemus food resource is argued to have a potential to disrupt social regulation and thus to lower the incidence of direct density dependence. A candidate mechanism for the incidence of delayed density dependence is differential vulnerability to predation: the demography of C. rufocanus is much more affected by predators than Apodemus.",42,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,"Apodemus argenteus | Apodemus speciosus | Clethrionomys rufocanus | Density dependence, direct and delayed | Hokkaido (Japan) | Predation | Social regulation",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,90,NA,NA

A previously proposed, theoretical model of intraspecific variation in optimal timing of nest departure in alcids predicts that: (1) variation in growth rate among chicks will result in negative correlations between departure mass and departure age, and (2) in the absence of seasonal declines in chick growth rates (such declines are consistent features of alcid biology), variation in timing of hatching among chicks will cause both mass and age at departure to decline with hatching date. We tested these predictions for Thick-billed Murres and Razorbills, two alcids that employ a unique development strategy. To control for the confounding effects of seasonal variation in growth rates, caused at least in part by variation in the characteristics of adults breeding at different times, we switched eggs at random among breeding pairs in each of two years for both study species. Contrary to prediction 1, there were no significant negative correlations between departure mass and departure age, and in fact, there was one significant positive relationship. Contrary to prediction 2, departure mass did not decline with hatching date; in agreement with prediction 2, departure age often declined with date. Our results suggest that, for Thick-billed Murres and Razorbills: (1) variation in growth rate probably does not influence timing of nest departure in the manner outlined in the model, and (2) it is unlikely that variation in hatching date affects the departure decision in the manner predicted by the model. Based on our experimental results, and previously reported observations of Thick-billed Murres, we develop alternative hypotheses, emphasizing the roles of parental quality and wing growth (rather than increase in mass), to explain the close correspondence between the model's predictions and patterns in the timing of nest departure within the Alcidae that are reported frequently.",32,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Alca torda | Alcidae | Canada | Chick growth | Departure age | Departure mass | Dynamic modelling | Hatching date | Razorbill | Thick-billed Murre | Uria lomvia,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,91,NA,NA

Model performance is optimized to satisfy, simultaneously, each component of a vector of assessment criteria (model outputs), rather than the usual procedure of optimizing performance with respect to a single criterion. Pareto Optimality is used to define the vector optimization. The Pareto Optimal Set reveals which combinations of assessment criteria the model can satisfy simultaneously. Binary interval error measures, which classify whether a parameterization result is within an acceptable range of values, are defined for each criterion. Their use masks small differences in the performance of different parameterizations, allowing the Pareto Optimal Set to reveal conflicts in ability to achieve simultaneously different collections of criteria. POMAC improves the researcher's ability to detect deficiencies and locate their sources. It is more stringent and informative than traditional model assessment procedures because it uses multiple criteria without weighting and aggregating them. The Pareto Optimal Set reveals the presence of deficiencies through the model's inability to satisfy all the criteria simultaneously. POMAC then guides the researcher in locating deficiencies in: inadequate selection of component ecological hypotheses underlying the model, inadequate mathematical representations of these hypotheses, inadequate parameterization, poor selection and formulation of the assessment criteria, or combinations of these. In an example, POMAC is applied to the spatially explicit canopy competition model WHORL using ten assessment criteria. Each criterion was selected to provide information on different aspects of WHORL's functioning: three stand height distribution criteria, three crown morphology criteria, and four criteria focusing on stand competition's characteristic differentiation of growth rates.

We discuss some of the conceptual roadblocks to experimentation and propose several avenues for attacking the problem experimentally. We address the conceptual issues involved in (1) the blurring of the distinction between the processes that initiate the switch among alternative states and the positive-feedback processes that maintain those states, and (2) the role of spatial scale in initiating the switch. We suggest that the switch between alternative states requires, first, a disturbance that removes species involved in the positive feedbacks needed for maintenance and, second, the arrival of other individuals that initiate the switch to the alternative assemblage. The removal of the species that maintain the system must be large enough and over a long enough time to allow the arrival and establishment of members of the alternative assemblage, and so we hypothesize that the switch among alternative states is scale dependent. This scenario suggests that the switch among alternative states can be investigated experimentally through the manipulation of the scale of the disturbance and of the arrival of members of the alternative state. Small-scale disturbances should consistently fail to initiate a switch, while larger-scale events should initiate a switch at least part of the time. We also note that in some cases the scale of disturbance and/or the arrival of recruits cannot be manipulated or controlled and suggest that several approaches other than factorial experiments with ANOVA, such as spatial autocorrelation methods, may be useful. We illustrate the potential and the difficulties of various approaches by discussing two systems in eastern North America that may contain alternative states. Mosaics of mussel beds and algal beds occupy rocky coasts from New England northward, and patchworks of forests and heathlands occur in eastern Canada and in the Appalachian highlands.

We studied the consequences of transitions from cotyledons to juvenile true leaves to adult true leaves in cotton seedlings (Gossypium hirsutum) for their resistance to spider mites (Tetranychus urticae). Mite populations grew much more rapidly on cotyledons than on true leaves. However, there was no detectable difference in the population growth of mites on juvenile vs. adult true leaves. We suggest that population growth of mites is positively affected by the high rates of photosynthesis of cotyledons relative to true leaves, or by some process or attribute correlated with photosynthesis. Conditions that caused increased rates of photosynthesis (exposure to light and elevated concentrations of CO2) caused mite populations to increase. Greater mite population growth on cotyledons was not associated with stored reserves in the cotyledons, as the mites did poorly on cotyledons kept in the dark.

The system operated for 75-95% of the time, and energy balance closure was within 5%, indicating good system performance. Daily rates of evapotranspiration (ET) were on average 1.5 mm/d, while seasonal ET ranged between 100 and 150 mm. Daily ET was strongly correlated with daily fluctuations in net radiation. However, the 'omega factor' (an index of the relative importance of meteorological and physiological limitations to evapotranspiration) was generally <0.5 throughout June and early July, indicating that biological limitations to ET were relatively more important than meteorological limitations during the first half of the growing season. The biological limitation to ET was presumably due to bryophyte desiccation and subsequent reductions in canopy water-vapor conductance, especially under conditions of high evaporative demand.

Multilocus molecular data sets have proved to be particularly useful for hybrid identification and genealogical reconstruction. One widely recognized limitation to this approach is that hybrid and parental genotypic classes often differ minimally in terms of expected marker numbers, and an extremely large number of molecular markers are required to distinguish between them. A more fundamental difficulty, and the focus of this study, concerns the potential for selection to bias marker numbers in hybrids, thus leading to faulty genealogical assignments. In this paper, we compare observed and expected marker numbers in 170 hybrids of known pedigree between two wild sunflower species, Helianthus annuus and H. petiolaris. All 170 hybrid plants had fewer H. petiolaris markers than the expected means. In fact, with the exception of two individuals, marker numbers were more consistent with pedigrees involving three to seven backcrossed generations, rather than the two generations of backcrossing actually employed. Although the implications of these data for genealogical reconstruction are discouraging, it is the actual genetic constitution of hybrids, not the pedigree, that is most predictive of their characteristics or behavior.

Most research has focused on the increase in N input caused by atmospheric deposition and invasion of N-fixing species, and on their effects on resource availability and species composition. However, in contrast to many ecosystems experiencing large increases in N input, many arid ecosystems are experiencing loss of nutrients due to land-use change. An important component of many arid ecosystems on a worldwide basis is the microbiotic crust, a biological soil crust composed of lichens, cyanobacteria, mosses, and algae. Nitrogen fixation by lichens and cyanobacteria comprising the crust is the primary source of N input in many of these ecosystems. We quantified the long-term consequences of surface disturbance in an arid ecosystem on the Colorado Plateau by comparing pristine sites with those of known disturbance history. Disturbance caused an increase in the abundance of cyanobacteria and a decrease in lichens within the microbiotic crust. Carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of the crust reflects this shift in species composition; values for disturbed sites were 4.5‰ higher than undisturbed sites. Nitrogen isotope composition (δ15N) of the microbiotic crust was 1.5-2.2‰ higher for disturbed sites, probably resulting from relatively greater gaseous N loss from the crust. Historic disturbance has caused a long-term decrease in rates of N fixation by the microbiotic crust; nitrogenase activity in pristine sites was 250% greater than sites intermittently disturbed 30 yr ago. The decrease in N input from fixation and continued gaseous N loss has caused a 25-75% decrease in soil N content. Altering relative rates of N input and loss, coupled with input of N from microbiotic crusts with relatively higher δ15N, has caused an increase in soil and plant δ15N at disturbed sites. This decrease in soil N caused by disturbance will likely cause changes in species composition similar to those observed in ecosystems that have been disrupted by excess N input from atmospheric deposition.",192,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,"Canyonlands National Park, Utah, USA | Cryptogamic crusts | Land-use change | Microbiotic crusts | Microphytic crusts | Mineralization | Nitrification | Nitrogen | Stable isotopes",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,101,NA,NA

Although this pattern of displacement is well known, its underlying mechanisms remain little studied. To gain a more detailed understanding of this widespread competitive displacement, I compared the exploitative and interference abilities of the Argentine ant with those of seven species of native ants it displaces in riparian woodlands in northern California. I performed four different manipulative field experiments; each measured different aspects of the competitive ability of the eight species of ants in this study. The main goals of this study were to identify the mechanisms responsible for the Argentine ant's strong competitive ability, to determine if native ants are subject to species-specific trade-offs in exploitative and interference ability typically present among coexisting ants, and if so, to assess whether Argentine ants are subject to this trade-off as well. Argentine ants located and recruited to baits as quickly or more quickly than did native ants-both in areas where Argentine ants and native ants occurred together (i.e., at the edge of invasion fronts) and where they occurred separately (i.e., away from invasion fronts). Along the edge of invasion fronts, Argentine ants also controlled a greater proportion of baits than did native ants. In one-on-one interactions, individual Argentine ant workers experienced mixed success in overcoming individual workers of the seven native ant species. When fighting against native ants, Argentine ants used both physical aggression and chemical defensive compounds, although the latter mechanism was more often successful in deterring opponents. Chemical defensive compounds produced by Argentine ants were repellent but appeared no more so than those of native ants. Although Argentine ant workers were not able to overcome native ant workers consistently, Argentine ant colonies succeeded in displacing most native ant colonies from baits. The discrepancy between worker-level and colony-level interference ability suggests that numerical advantages are key to the Argentine ant's proficiency at interference competition. Like ants in other communities, the native ants in this study were subject to a competitive trade-off in which interference ability and exploitative ability were negatively correlated. In contrast, Argentine ants were proficient at both exploitative and interference competition relative to the native ants they displaced and are thus removed from this trade-off. These findings imply that Argentine ants secure a majority of available food resources where this species comes into contact with native ants. Argentine ants may be able to break the competitive trade-off constraining native ants because of their unique colony structure and because they have escaped their natural enemies. The observation that Argentine ants are uncoupled from the competitive trade-off constraining native ants may provide a general explanation for patterns of dominance within ant communities and for the success of other introduced species.",466,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Ants | Argentine ants | Biological invasion | California | Competition | Competitive asymmetry | Competitive displacement | Competitive trade-offs | Exotic species | Exploitative competition | Field experiment | Interference competition,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,105,NA,NA

Here we report the presence of previously undescribed inducible defenses in marine mussels, a dominant member of temperate rocky intertidal communities. In the Gulf of Maine, estuarine shorelines with low water flow are characterized by high crab predation on the common blue mussel, Mytilus edulis, compared to nearby shorelines with high water flow. Mussels at these high predation sites had thicker shells, relatively more shell mass, and were more tightly attached to the substrate than mussels at low predation sites. Field and laboratory experiments were used to test whether the between-site differences in these traits were the result of phenotypic plasticity. Mussels outplanted to high predation sites produced more byssal threads and attached more firmly to the substrate than did mussels outplanted to low predation sites. In the laboratory, thicker shells were induced by waterborne cues from both the common predator, Carcinus maenus, and damaged conspecifics, and these thicker shells were mechanically stronger than thinner, noninduced ones. Our results contribute to growing evidence that inducible defenses are a pervasive feature of intertidal assemblages.

In New England deciduous forests we tested the hypothesis that the understory stratum is a selective filter that differentially influences growth and survival of tree-seedling species by comparing performance of Acer rubrum, Betula alleghaniensis, and Quercus rubra seedlings in plots where the fern understory was undisturbed, partially removed, or completely removed. We related seedling growth and survival to microenvironmental characteristics of experimental plots in order to further explore mechanisms responsible for the filtering capacity of the fern understory. The presence of a fern understory reduced growth and survival of all seedling species, but the magnitude of the effect differed among species. Mortality resulting from resource limitation in Quercus below the fern understory was balanced by mortality resulting from insect herbivory in fern-free areas. Relative biomass growth rates of all species were negatively influenced by the presence of fern cover, whereas relative height growth rates of Acer and Quercus were uniformly low and insensitive to the presence of fern cover. Growth and survival rates indicate that only Quercus seedlings can emerge from the fern stratum in the absence of understory or overstory canopy disturbance. A trade-off between persistence in low light and maximum growth in understory light levels was observed among species. The relative growth rate of Betula in terms of biomass and height was more responsive to light levels than were relative growth rates of Acer or Quercus, and the growth rate of Betula was higher than that of Acer and Quercus in all light levels. However, survival of Betula below the fern stratum was lower than survival of Acer and Quercus. The fern understory has the capacity to selectively filter tree seedlings as they grow up through it because seedling species respond differentially to the presence of fern cover. The selective filtering of tree seedlings by the fern understory results in a seedling spatial structure that reflects the spatial heterogeneity of the fern stratum.

Ecologists have recently made considerable progress in understanding nutrient cycling and trophic interactions in pelagic systems by application of a new concept, ecological stoichiometry, to consumer-driven processes. In this paper we synthesize these conceptual advances within pelagic ecology and attempt to illustrate how they may be usefully applied in other ecosystems. Stoichiometric theory shows that both grazer and algal elemental composition are critical parameters influencing rates and ratios of nutrient release. Thus, the stoichiometry of nutrient recycling is a feedback mechanism linking grazer dynamics and algal nutritional status. Incorporation of such effects into a fully dynamic stoichiometric model generates profound changes in the predicted dynamics of algae and grazers, suggesting that adoption of a stoichiometric view may substantively alter our view of the interaction between trophic dynamics and nutrient cycling. The basic predictions of stoichiometric models of nutrient release are generally supported by experimental data showing that N:P release ratios are primarily a function of algal N:P ratio and secondarily a function of grazer N:P ratio, and that rates of P release by grazers are also related to food P:C. Furthermore, evidence for effects of nutrient release stoichiometry on phytoplankton communities and pelagic ecosystem function is accumulating, including data showing consistent alterations in algal physiological status and ecosystem-scale changes in N fixation in response to altered grazer community structure and elemental composition. As the general features of the stoichiometry of algae-zooplankton interactions reflect fundamental biological processes linked to plant and animal mineral nutrition, the stoichiometric view of consumer-driven nutrient recycling can easily be applied to other ecosystems, including terrestrial and benthic food webs.

To this end I tagged >3500 individual flowers to track seed set on a per-day basis, performed a hand pollination experiment, and quantified pollinator visitation throughout the flowering season in a population of Lythrum salicaria. I then used the seed production data to construct a hypothetical adaptive surface for two highly correlated characters: date of initial flowering and flowering duration. I found evidence of temporal variation in seed set that can be explained by temporal patterns of pollinator visitation. There were significant effects of date (linear and quadratic) and number of flowering stems on the number of pollinator visits per patch. A significant date X number of stems interaction indicated that the effect of number of stems was dependent on flowering date. Early in the flowering season pollinator visitation was dependent on the density of plants in flower. However, late in the season pollinators stopped visiting the patch for reasons unrelated to flowering plant density. A hand-pollination experiment demonstrated that the paucity of pollinators late in the season resulted in late-season pollinator limitation. Late-season pollinator limitation could explain the shape of the fitness surface. The shape of the estimated fitness surface indicates saturating directional selection on flowering duration and a combination of directional and stabilizing selection on date of flowering initiation. The estimated fitness surface has a single peak located at the earliest date of flowering initiation and the longest flowering duration. This fitness peak is at the same point as the point of highest fitness in the actual fitness distribution. Areas of the phenotype space representing nonexistent phenotype combinations were the locations of fitness valleys on the hypothetical fitness surface.

These hypotheses were tested using 18 enclosures (corrals) within an alpine lake. The factorial design consisted of three UV treatments (+UV, -UV-B, -UV) and two macroinvertebrate densities (ambient, 3 x). High performance liquid chromatography was used to quantify changes in periphyton and phytoplankton abundance and composition in response to UV radiation and macroinvertebrates over a period of 1 mo. Algal and invertebrate responses to UV radiation were habitat- and taxon-specific. Epilithic standing crop was significantly suppressed by UV radiation, primarily due to UV-B radiation inhibiting diatoms by 40%. In contrast, standing crop of epipelic (sediment-dwelling) organisms was significantly enhanced by UV-A radiation, which increased the abundance of cyanobacteria by 50%. UV radiation also significantly altered the taxonomic composition of both epilithon and epipelon. In comparison, picocyanobacterial phytoplankton were unaffected by UV radiation. Zoobenthos (Gammarus lacustris, Chironomidae) and zooplankton (Hesperodiaptomus arcticus, Rotifera) did not significantly alter periphyton or phytoplankton biomass or taxonomic composition. Although total zoobenthos and zooplankton biomass were unaffected by UV radiation, UV-B significantly suppressed the final density of rotifers but not that of heavily pigmented calanoid copepods. These results show that UV radiation affects shallow-water communities in cold and unproductive systems mainly through direct effects, rather than by indirect effects mediated by food-web processes. Access to physical refuges was evidently a key factor determining habitat-specific responses to UV radiation. UV radiation did not adversely affect motile epipelon and zoobenthos that could seek refuge in sediments, but it did suppress attached epilithic taxa. In habitats devoid of physical refuge, UV tolerance was associated with photoprotective pigmentation (i.e., H. arcticus), and possibly a capacity for DNA repair (i.e., epilithic filamentous cyanobacteria and planktonic picocyanobacteria).

We compared the food supply, laying date, clutch size, and breeding success of a small double-brooded passerine bird, the Eurasian Treecreeper (Certhia familiaris) between territories with or without colonies of red wood ants (Formica rufa group) during four years. Both the wood ants and Eurasian Treecreepers forage on tree trunks and utilize the same food resources. It has been shown that the wood ants are able to depress the available food supply for the treecreepers and interfere with their foraging behavior. We found that food abundance was lower in territories colonized by wood ants, and that this difference was more pronounced during the second clutches. In territories without ants, treecreepers started breeding earlier and increased the size of second clutches, whereas birds breeding in territories with ants decreased clutch size in second breeding attempts. In addition to hatching later, nestlings in territories with ants achieved lower body mass near fledging and suffered higher mortality than nestlings in territories without ants. Consequently, double-brooded treecreeper pairs produced an average of 2.3 more fledglings, also of higher quality, in territories without ants than in territories with ants.

On the other hand, most insectivorous plants depend on free-moving, live insects as pollen vectors for sexual reproduction. In Pinguicula vallisneriifolia Webb, the spatial and temporal coincidence between flowers and the first distal leaves presents a potential conflict between the plant-pollinator and plant-prey systems. To examine this possibility, I combined an extensive regional survey to identify the pollinator assemblages and to analyze prey capture with a local intensive study to investigate the mechanisms of interference between the two systems. I analyzed the possible conflicting functions of pollination vs. insectivory under contrasting abiotic scenarios. Field observations and experiments confirmed the pollinator role of small flower visitors and the interference between the plant-pollinator and plant-prey systems. The degree of this interference is determined by the size and foraging behavior of pollinators, given that only small pollinators become entangled on leaves. Plants in bloom had a greater probability of capturing thrips than did plants without flowers. Because P. vallisneriifolia is pollen limited, the capture of small pollinators depleted the availability of the resource that limited plant reproduction. The pollinator-prey conflict is, however, environment specific, because the shadiness of the microsite where the plant grows determines both the distribution and abundance of different-sized insect species and the retention capacity of the mucilage. The present results indicate that plant-pollinator and plant-prey interactions can be strongly determined by species-specific ecophysiological responses of flying insects and sessile plants to abiotic characteristics of the environment.

With maximum likelihood techniques, I fit species-specific, nonlinear regression models of seedling probability of mortality and radial growth as functions of light availability for Trophis racemosa, Castilla elastica, Pourouma aspera, and Cecropia obtusifolia (Family Moraceae, latter two also classified as Cecropiaceae). Models characterizing mortality in the first year of seedling life showed significant differences among the species, both in functional forms and in model parameter estimates. All species decreased in mortality with increases in light to 20% full sun. Above 20% full sun, the mortality of T. racemosa and Castilla elastica continued to decrease, while that of Cecropia obtusifolia remained constant and that of P. aspera increased. At <10% full sun, there was a fivefold difference in mortality probability; T. racemosa had the highest survivorship, followed by C. elastica, P. aspera, and C. obtusifolia. Mortality models for the initial 4 mo of the experiment revealed significant size effects for all species except P. aspera and increased mortality under high light for P. aspera and T. racemosa. In contrast, radial growth of all species increased with light availability. The radial growth models, based upon only variation in light availability and tree size, accounted for 60-86% of the variation in growth. Cecropia obtusifolia occupied the lowest rank in radial growth at <50% full sun and the highest radial growth at light levels >75% full sun. When considered together, the mortality and growth models revealed that differences in species performance could lead to light gradient partitioning. At distinct light levels, each species showed the highest growth relative to other surviving species. Neither growth nor mortality considered alone revealed this specialization.

In general, observed experimental responses were fairly consistent with predictions. The largest discrepancy occurred when sods were transplanted from high- to low-salinity sites and herbivores selectively consumed a particularly palatable plant species in the transplanted sods.

Individual fertilized plot responses were not consistent with predictions (P > 0.05), nor were fenced plots (herbivore exclosures; R2 = 0.15) compared to unfenced plots (R2 = 0.53). For the remaining treatments, predictions reasonably matched responses (R2 = 0.63). We constructed an SEM for the experimental data; it explained 60% of the variance in species density and showed that fencing and fertilization led to decreases in species density that were not predicted from treatment effects on community biomass or observed disturbance levels.

In 1995 we mapped the location of both earthworm surface casts and plants in each of 16 1.2-m2 plots in a species-rich calcareous grassland in northwestern Switzerland. Eight plots have been maintained under current ambient CO2 concentrations (350 μL CO2/L), and eight have been maintained at elevated CO2 (600 μL CO2/L) since March 1994. In addition, total ramet production of each species, as a measure of performance, and cumulative east production at each location (cell) were recorded at peak community biomass in 1995. Plant species within functional groups (graminoids, non-legume forbs, and legumes) differed markedly in their degree of association with casts; however, after two growing seasons elevated CO2 had no effect on plant species or functional group associations with casts. No statistically significant relationship could be demonstrated between plant-species response (i.e., ramet production) to elevated CO2 and the degree of association with casts within any of the functional groups. However, a positive relationship was observed between the mean response of graminoid species to elevated CO2 (measured as the percentage change in mean total tamer production of graminoid species, relative to mean total ramet production at ambient CO2) and their mean degree of association (%) with surface casts at ambient CO2. Thus, graminoid species more frequently associated with casts (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum and Carex caryophyllea) produced more ramets per square meter at elevated CO2 than those less frequently associated with casts (e.g., Agrostis tenuis and Danthonia decumbens). These results, along with the strong and significant positive correlations observed between ramet production and associated cumulative cast mass across CO2 treatments for most plant species in all functional groups demonstrate: (1) that plant species differ significantly in their degree of association with nutrient-rich earthworm surface casts, regardless of the relative abundance of plant species in the community; (2) that graminoid species that are more highly associated with casts may respond more strongly to rising CO2 than those less highly associated with casts; and (3) that nutrient-rich earthworm casts stimulate the growth (ramet production) of most plant species in these grassland communities, even at current levels of atmospheric CO2.

To mimic a specific competitive scenario (i.e., a managed early-successional Pinus stand), Andropogon and Liquidambar were established a year prior to the establishment of Pinus. Competitive effect (the attenuation of resources) and competitive response (the growth of each species as a function of resource availability) were determined. Effect on soil water varied among species, depth of soil, and time. In the surface soil, soil water was largely influenced through non-uptake effects, while uptake effects were predominant in deeper portions of the solum. When competitor abundance was expressed on an aboveground biomass basis, rather than a density basis, species differences in effects on soil water were eliminated. Differences among the species in effects on soil water per unit leaf area or leaf biomass appear to be largely explained by differences in stomatal conductance. Predawn leaf-water potential was integrated over the season using a water-stress integral. Analysis of the water-stress integral suggested that Liquidambar and Andropogon both affected water available to Pinus; however, only Liquidambar affected Andropogon, and only Andropagon affected seasonal water available to Liquidambar. Light was most strongly influenced by Liquidambar density; however, as Andropogon density increased, the effects of Liquidambar were reduced. Andropogon response was correlated with light but not with water stress or leaf nitrogen. This reflects high light requirements and high water use efficiency of C4 plants. Liquidambar response was related to water stress and leaf nitrogen, perhaps reflecting the greater nitrogen requirements of hardwoods. Pinus response was significantly related to all three resources individually, i.e., water stress, light, and leaf nitrogen. Pinus response was better explained by a regression model that included light and water stress than by water stress or light alone. Pinus growth as a function of water stress and light indicated that communities dominated by Liquidambar largely reduced Pinus growth through reduction in light, while communities dominated by Andropogon reduced Pinus growth primarily by increasing water stress.

In this study, subtidal landscapes of a New Zealand fjord were used to study the spatial patterns of epifaunal invertebrate species diversity and to test hypotheses about the mechanisms maintaining the patterns. Patterns of species diversity were quantified along 1000-m2 sections of vertical rock wall habitat at three sites separated by 3-6 km of horizontal distance during April-August 1993. Species diversity data from random 0.25-m2 quadrats at four depth strata (3, 5, 10, and 18 m) within a 20 x 50 m area were contoured to reveal spatial patterns at each site. General patterns consisted of localized patches of 300-660 m2 of high diversity (i.e., H' [Shannon-Weiner diversity index] of 2.0-3.2/0.25 m2 and S [species richness] of 2832 species/0.25 m2) centered at 10 m depth. High-diversity patches, dominated by bryozoans, sponges, and ascidians, were bounded vertically by low-diversity mussel assemblages and horizontally by low-diversity assemblages dominated by encrusting calcareous algae with areas of bare rock. Vertical patterns of diversity were attributed to physical stress from a low-salinity surface layer impinging on shallow areas (e.g., 0-5 m depth) of the landscapes, while horizontal patterns could be partly attributed to large-scale landslides and severe grazing by sea urchins. The hypothesis that the areas of high diversity could be maintained by larval recruitment was tested by deploying an array of recruitment tiles with predator exclusion treatments. Experiments were conducted on the same spatial scale as the documented patterns of diversity (e.g., at 3, 5, 10, and 18 m depth), with tiles placed in and out of the high-diversity patches. Recruitment densities of calcareous polychaetes, bryozoans, and hydroids showed significant depth and habitat effects (i.e., in vs. out of the high-diversity areas) after 3 mo, but no significant effects of predator exclusion treatment. A positive linear relationship between species diversity and number of recruit species in adjacent areas of wall explained 27-57% of the variance. These data also suggested that the size of the high-diversity patches and location within the fjord are important factors affecting this relationship. We suggest that the localized patches of high diversity over hundreds of meters of continuous habitat can be maintained on temporal scales of months either by spatially limited recruitment of short-lived larvae from the patches or by recruitment near established conspecifics. Additionally, there may be a feedback mechanism involving the interaction of increased biogenic structure provided by the high-diversity patches enhancing recruitment. This feedback would then serve to maintain localized areas of high diversity within the extensive areas of low diversity on scales of hundreds to thousands of meters.",102,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Diversity | Epifaunal invertebrates | Fjords | Landscape ecology | Low-salinity surface layer | New Zealand | Recruitment | Rocky subtidal | Species diversity | Stratified water column,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,120,NA,NA

We conducted a series of three field emergence experiments to test hypotheses regarding mechanisms of fern interference with seedling emergence. The fern understory reduced light levels from 3.4% of full sun to 1.1% of full sun beneath its canopy. Soil exposure was lower and litter depth was greater under fern cover, whereas soil moisture and soil organic-matter content were not affected by fern cover. The understory filter differentially influenced tree-seedling emergence. Fern cover decreased emergence of Betula, Pinus, and Quercus but did not affect the emergence of Acer or Fraxinus. The mechanism of fern interference was species-specific: Betula emergence was reduced primarily by low levels of soil exposure, Pinus emergence appeared to be related to reduced light levels, and Quercus suffered higher levels of seed predation under fern cover. The presence of understory fern cover also differentially influenced 1st-yr survival of natural tree-seedling recruitment. Although seedling survivorship during the first growing season was related to seed size, seedling survivorship below ferns by the end of the 1st yr was independent of seed size. Selectivity of the fern filter is caused by differential response of tree-seedling species to the presence of understory cover and was generally not affected by the species identity of the understory plant.

Pollinators responded by visiting damaged flowers less, and exposed plants had lower flower visitation rates than protected plants.

Lizards from populations with small adults grew faster before maturity and slower after maturity than those from populations with larger adults. Size and growth rates were correlated with elevation among sites for chuckwallas both raised in the laboratory and in natural populations. For example, at low-elevation sites, chuckwallas grew comparatively rapidly to reach maturity in a shortened growing season. A high frequency of drought at these hot, dry sites may necessitate storage of energy after maturity as a buffer against the relatively high probability that food will be limited in the following year. Lizards at higher elevation sites, however, are freed from this constraint, allowing them to use energy for growth to reach larger size and therefore to produce larger clutches.

These subtle differences between observed and fitted critical light intensities could be attributed to differences in the light absorption spectra of the species.

To this end, we developed computer simulations that contrast the effectiveness of various search strategies at finding habitat patches in idealized landscapes (uniform, random, or clumped patches), where searchers have different energy reserves and face different mortality risks. Nearly straight correlated random walks always produced better dispersal success than relatively uncorrelated random walks. However, increasing patch density decreased the degree of correlation that maximized dispersal success. Only under high mortality and low energy reserves in a uniform landscape did absolutely straight-line search perform better than any random walk. With low mortality risks and high energy reserves, exhaustive systematic search was superior to the best correlated random walk; an increase in the perceptual range of the searcher (i.e., patch detectability) also favored exhaustive search over relatively straight random walks. For all conditions examined, the 'average distance rule,' a hybrid search rule incorporating both straight-line and systematic search, was best.

The analytical issue is that unmeasured factors may be the active limiting constraint and may induce a pattern of unequal variation in the biological response variable through an interaction with the measured factors. Consequently, changes near the maxima, rather than at the center of response distributions, are better estimates of the effects expected when the observed factor is the active limiting constraint. Regression quantiles provide estimates for linear models fit to any part of a response distribution, including near the upper bounds, and require minimal assumptions about the form of the error distribution. Regression quantiles extend the concept of one-sample quantiles to the linear model by solving an optimization problem of minimizing an asymmetric function of absolute errors. Rank-score tests for regression quantiles provide tests of hypotheses and confidence intervals for parameters in linear models with heteroscedastic errors, conditions likely to occur in models of limiting ecological relations. We used selected regression quantiles (e.g., 5th, 10th, ..., 95th) and confidence intervals to test hypotheses that parameters equal zero for estimated changes in average annual acorn biomass due to forest canopy cover of oak (Quercus spp.) and oak species diversity. Regression quantiles also were used to estimate changes in glacier lily (Erythronium grandiflorum) seedling numbers as a function of lily flower numbers, rockiness, and pocket gopher (Thomomys talpoides fossor) activity, data that motivated the query by Thomson et al. for new statistical procedures. Both example applications showed that effects of limiting factors estimated by changes in some upper regression quantile (e.g., 90-95th) were greater than if effects were estimated by changes in the means from standard linear model procedures.

We took an experimental approach to investigate whether absence of A. carolinensis and A. sagrei from these islands results from the inability of populations to become established and whether the presence of the other species has a negative effect on population density and probability of successful colonization. We introduced propagules of five lizards of each species, either in allopatry or sympatry, on five blocks of three islands each. Populations were censused yearly using mark-recapture methods. Anolis sagrei populations thrived on almost all islands, whereas within three years, many A. carolinensis populations had gone extinct, and most others were very small. We conclude that an inability to successfully establish populations on small islands might explain the absence of A. carolinensis from these islands, but not the absence of A. sagrei. Anolis carolinensis was not more likely to become extinct on islands containing A. sagrei, but population densities of A. carolinensis were lower on islands with both species ('sympatric islands') compared to 'allopatric islands'. In addition, A. carolinensis tended to perch higher, relative to available vegetation, on sympatric islands than they did on allopatric islands. Conversely, the presence of A. carolinensis had little impact on A. sagrei populations. However, inspection of population changes through time suggest that A. carolinensis may have initially had an effect on A. sagrei, but this effect decreased as A. carolinensis populations declined.

A first experiment was conducted on a calibration set, and predictive equations were established between the NIR spectral data of the initial litters and the decay descriptors. These equations were then applied to two validation sets. The 34 litters of the calibration set were incubated for eight weeks in microcosms in the laboratory. The values of litter mass remaining (LMR) in relation to incubation time were fitted to the single-exponential decay model (LMR = e(-kt)). The litter mass loss (LML) values at different sampling dates and the rate constant k were strongly correlated with the initial litter characteristics. The calibrations carried out between measurements of the NIR spectra on the initial litters and the different descriptors of the decomposition patterns of the 34 litters showed that the LML values at the different sampling dates and the rate constant k were correlated with the spectra of the initial litters more closely than with their initial characteristics. The descriptors of litter decomposition patterns could therefore be predicted by NIRS. Among these descriptors, which were all correlated with one another, the easiest to measure (LML after one week incubation in the microcosm) was tested as a litter decomposability index (LDI). LDI was predicted by NIRS on the initial litters in two validation sets, the first consisting of 12 litters incubated under the same conditions in microcosms over a longer period (14 mo), the second consisting of four litters incubated in the field for one year at three stations situated along a climatic gradient. The results showed that the values of LDI predicted by NIRS were significantly correlated with the decay rate constant k in the two validation sets. The values of LDI predicted by NIRS therefore expressed a decomposability scale that was valid for litters decomposing over a longer period under the same incubation conditions and for litters subjected to different incubation conditions. The possibility of predicting litter decomposability by NIRS provides many opportunities, firstly for studying spatial and temporal variability in the rate of recycling of organic matter, and secondly for characterizing the gradual changes in litter quality during decomposition.",82,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Decomposability index | Decomposition | Initial litter characteristic | Litter quality | Near infrared | NIRS calibration | Spectroscopy,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,131,NA,NA

However, there is little experimental field work to support claims of host-shifting via escape from natural enemies, i.e., to enemy-free space. In this study, we took the unique approach of experimentally creating a host shift for a specialized leafmining fly, Liriomyza helianthi (Diptera: Agromyzidae). We manually transferred leafminer larvae from their normal host plant, Helianthus annuus (Asteraceae), to a variety of novel plants: Helianthus maximilianii, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Taraxacum officinale, and Centaurea solstitialis. By exposing transferred larvae on normal and novel plants to natural enemy attack under field conditions, we were able to examine whether host-shifting can provide an herbivore with enemy-free space. Our data show that enemy-free space does exist for L. helianthi immediately following a host shift, as mortality in novel plants averaged 17% less than in the normal host. Nevertheless, there was significant within- and between-year heterogeneity in results over the 3-yr period of the study. We found that escape from natural enemies was related to annual variation in the diversity and abundance of parasitoid species. In years when parasitoid assemblages were dominated by endoparasitoids, mortality of larvae averaged 22% lower in novel hosts. However, when generalist ectoparasitoids, Diglyphus spp. (Hymenoptera: Eulophidae), were present, there was no advantage of developing in novel plants, a result that could be explained by the less discriminating nature of the ectoparasitoids. When overall levels of mortality from natural enemies were high, the benefit of novel plants was also reduced. This pattern suggests that, as available larval hosts become scarce, parasitoids may be more likely to forage on novel host plants in search for prey, thus diminishing the opportunity for enemy-free space. Nevertheless, our study showed that enemy-free space can exist for an herbivorous insect utilizing a novel host plant, and that natural enemies may, in some cases, offset physiological fitness costs often associated with developing in novel plants.

Two spatial scales were explored: among 11 lagoon sites dispersed evenly around the 60-km perimeter of the island and among microhabitats within a site. For each species at both spatial scales, per capita mortality rates of new settler cohorts increased monotonically with density, whereas those of the next older cohort were density independent. Intra- and especially intercohort processes induced density-dependent mortality in new settler cohorts.

Using environmental data collected at semi-exposed rocky intertidal beaches in the northeastern Pacific, I compared predictions of the body temperatures of mussels (Mytilus californianus) based on small-scale (microclimate-level) environmental data averaged over a range of time scales (5 minutes to 1 hour) to those generated using continuous measurements. The error in predicting maximum and mean body temperatures introduced through the use of hourly environmental averages was generally less than 1°-2°C. I then predicted body temperatures of mussels during aerial exposure using historical, hourly weather data from federal meteorological databases. I used environmental data collected over a 30-yr (1961-1990) period on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State to estimate the body temperatures of mussel aggregations at two tidal heights under conditions of aerial exposure during a 'typical' climatological year. Estimated body temperatures commonly fluctuated by 20°C or more during a period of ≤12 h and did not correlate well with air temperatures. The data indicated that mussels were, on average, hotter at this site during spring (April-June) than in summer (July-September) and colder in autumn (October-December) than in winter (January-March), primarily due to the effect of tidal cycles in determining exposure time. Results of simulations where the effects of climate and tidal cycle were decoupled suggested that the timing of aerial exposure, which can vary consistently over relatively small spatial scales (<100 km), can be more important than seasonal (spring vs. summer) differences in climatic conditions in determining body temperatures. Because of the interactive effects of climate and tidal cycle on body temperatures, populations of mussels in this region living at the same tidal height but separated by only tens of kilometers are predicted to experience very different thermal regimes. As a result, the intertidal environment represents a unique habitat for investigating the thermal biology of invertebrates over a range of spatial and temporal scales.",101,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Aerial exposure | Body temperature | Climate data | Environmental averages | Fluctuating temperatures | Microclimate | Mytilus | Physical factors | Rocky intertidal | Tidal cycle,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,139,NA,NA

We reanalyze a well-known data set on the relationship between home range size and body size in mammals. If the distribution of home range sizes as a function of body size is energetically constrained, then it is reasonable to assume that the lower size limit of a home range for a given body mass will also be constrained.

A further complication is that natural populations are subject to occasional catastrophes, and these increase the probability of extinction.

These trends were much less consistent among taxonomic-species webs. This suggests that comparative analyses of connectance among trophic-species webs constructed with varying degrees of moderate observation effort are generally robust.

In this study, interspecific and age-specific variation in the water relations and photosynthetic properties of these lupines were assessed to determine their physiological capacity to colonize these volcanic habitats. Comparative water-relations studies showed that seasonal and diurnal trends in plant water balance were similar between species and age classes. Stomatal conductance and xylem pressure potential of seedlings and adults were closely coupled with soil water potential and leaf-to-air vapor-pressure gradients. Relatively high osmotic potentials were linked with high leaf water contents and cell-wall elasticity. Collectively, these water-relations properties are indicative of mesophytic, herbaceous species with leaf tissues sensitive to soil and atmospheric water deficits. The photosynthetic capacity of L. lepidus was higher over a wider range of environmental conditions than that of L. latifolius. L. lepidus had a higher light saturation point and was able to acclimate photosynthetically to higher temperatures, relative to L. latifolius. The photosynthetic activity of L. lepidus seedlings was significantly greater at higher light and temperature regimes compared to seedlings of L. latifolius. Differing photosynthetic responses to temperature and light help explain the contrasting demographic patterns of these lupines and the relative dominance of L. lepidus in early successional habitats on Mount St. Helens.

We then tested for evidence of natural (phenotypic) selection with data for six species of ducks. At nests, we used six variables to describe vegetation structure/nest position and categorized patch types (pond edge, native grass, planted cover, shrubs, or trees) in which nests were found; nest fates (abandoned, depredated, or successful) were also determined.

For Blue-winged Teal and Gadwall (A. strepera), nest success varied within these gradients in a way that could exert directional selection. Several tests for adaptive nest-site choice were conducted. Nest fate did not influence fidelity of females to patch types. However, Mallards with previously unsuccessful nests dispersed farther than females with previously successful nests. Nonetheless, neither fidelity to patch type nor dispersal distance influenced subsequent nest success. In the long term (over 8 yr), there was a weak tendency within species for nest density to be higher among patch types where relative nest success was higher. In the short term (from year t to year t + 1), this pattern was not observed in a vegetation-structure/nest-position gradient for any species.

By examining how flowering varied across vegetative associations, I determined whether plant size or mass influenced flowering, whether canopy openness or increased soil fertility following fire enhanced flowering, and whether potential flowering stimuli interacted. Individuals of the widespread Serenoa repens and narrow endemic Sabal etonia were monitored (for a total of 9900 plant-year records) for growth performance and reproduction in flatwoods, scrubby flatwoods, scrub, and sandhill that were affected by single or multiple fires. In addition, clipping, fertilizing, and clipping+fertilizing experiments were conducted in three vegetative associations to simulate the effects of fire in order to ascertain which stimuli and their interactions encouraged flowering episodes. Both species exhibited marked resiliency to fire, rapidly resprouting from extensive underground stores. The frequencies of leaf production and flowering increased dramatically following fire in all vegetative associations compared to preburn periods, but especially in long-unburned (>60 yr) associations with substantial preburn overstory canopies. Strong episodic flowering responses were triggered after each of three repeated burns conducted during an 8-yr period at a previously long-unburned sandhill. Size, and hence estimated mass, were significant predictors of whether a palm would flower and, if so, how much it flowered. The loss of a palm's crown by fire, or by clipping, stimulated flowering, but this effect was mediated by light availability. Palms under more complete overstory canopies flowered less than those in light gaps or at open-canopied stands. Fertilization of palms, intended to simulate greater postfire nutrient availabilities, did not stimulate flowering. Logistic regression models were developed for each palm species to estimate the probability of flowering in each vegetative association. These models accurately predicted flowering and nonflowering individuals. However, probability-of-flowering models that were generalized across vegetative associations for each species were less accurate than the association-specific models, which suggests the specific nature of flowering responses.

We measured pollen export, pollen receipt, fruit set, and outcrossing rates on plants exposed to herbivores (most flowers damaged) and protected from herbivores (few flowers damaged) by systemic insecticide. Pollen export per undamaged flower was reduced by one-half in exposed plants, as estimated by pollinator transfer of florescent dye, which demonstrated indirect negative effects on male reproductive success. Damaged flowers on exposed plants had a lower stigmatic pollen load than undamaged flowers on either exposed or protected plants. Furthermore, exposed plants produced fewer fruits and seeds during the year than protected plants. Although damage reduces pollen receipt, hand pollination experiments showed that neither exposed nor protected plants were pollen limited, which suggests that floral herbivores primarily affect female function through their direct destruction of gametes.

Landscape simulation models offer an approach to studying such systems at broad scales. Fire can be simulated spatially using mechanistic or stochastic approaches. We describe the fire module in a spatially explicit, stochastic model of forest landscape dynamics (LANDIS) that incorporates fire, windthrow, and harvest disturbance with species-level succession. A stochastic approach is suited to forest landscape models that are designed to Simulate patterns over large spatial and time domains and are not used deterministically to predict individual events. We used the model to examine how disturbance regimes and species dynamics interact across a large (500 000 ha), heterogeneous landscape in northern Wisconsin, USA, with six land types having different species environments, and fire disturbance return intervals varying from 200 to 1000 yr. The model shows that there are feedbacks over time between species, disturbance, and environment, resulting in the re-emergence of patterns that characterized the landscape before extensive alteration. Landscape equilibrium of species composition and age-class structure develops at three scales from the initial, disturbed landscape. Over 100-150 yr, fine-grained successional processes cause gradual disaggregation of the initial pattern of relatively homogenous composition and age classes. Species such as eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), largely removed from the landscape by past human activities, only slowly re-invade. Next, patterns on the various land types diverge, driven by different disturbance regimes and dominant species. Finally, aging of the landscape causes the probabilities of larger and more severe fires to increase, and a coarse-grained pattern develops from the disturbance patches. Influence of adjacent land types is shown as fires spread across land type boundaries, although modified in spread and severity. As found by others, altered landscapes are likely to retain their modified pattern for centuries, suggesting that nonequilibrium conditions between tree species and climate will persist under predicted rates of climate change. The results suggest that this modeling approach can be useful in examining species-level, broad-scale responses of heterogeneous landscapes to changes in landscape disturbance, such as modified management or land-use scenarios, or effects of global change.",312,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Fire distributions | Fire disturbance | Heterogeneity | Ignition and spread | LANDIS | Landscape ecology | Landscape equilibrium | Landscape model | Spatially explicit and stochastic | Species resilience | Succession | Verification and calibration,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,151,NA,NA

Thus, annual carbon balance must be studied in detail in order to predict the climatic responses of these ecosystems. Closed-chamber methods were used to study CO2 and CH4 in hollow, Sphagnum angustifolium lawn, S. fuscum lawn, and hummock microsites within an ombrotrophic S. fuscum bog. Micrometeorological tower measurements were used as a reference for the CH4 efflux from the bog. Low precipitation during May-August in 1994 (84 mm below the long-term average for the same period) and a warm July-August period caused the water table to drop by more than 15 cm below the peat surface in the hollows and to 48 cm below the surface in high hummocks. Increased annual total respiration exceeded gross production and resulted in a net C loss of 4-157 g/m2 in the different microsites. Drought probably caused irreversible desiccation in some lawns of S. angustifolium and S. balticum and in S. fuscum in the hummocks, while S. balticum growing in hollows retained its moisture and even increased its photosynthetic capacity during the July-August period. Seasonal (12 May-4 October) CH4 emissions ranged from 2 g CH4C/m2 in drier S. fuscum hummocks and lawns to 7 and 14 g/m2 in wetter S. angustifolium S. balticum lawns and hollows, respectively. Aerodynamic gradient measurements at the tower showed slightly higher CH4 flux rates than the average estimates for the whole bog obtained by closed-chamber methods. Winter C efflux comprised 30 g CO2-C/m2 and 1 g CH4-C/m2 out of a total loss of 90 g C/m2 on average in the bog, and there was an estimated annual loss of 7 g C/m2 by leaching. This study shows how delicately the boreal bog's C balance in different microsites depends on climatic variations, especially the distribution of precipitation.

Subpopulations of pythons separated by <2 km differ in reproductive timing, in survival rates at three different life history stages (adults, embryos, and hatchlings), in costs of reproduction, and in reproductive frequencies. Remarkably, these differences all seem to result from a minor divergence in nest-site characteristics. Female water pythons use two main types of nest sites: those with relatively low, variable temperatures (especially hollows within paperbark root systems on the edge of the floodplain) and those with higher, constant temperatures (burrows dug by large varanid lizards in the higher, drier ridges ~2 km away). 'Cool' nests delayed reproduction and reduced survival rates of hatchlings in at least one year. Females ovipositing in 'cool' nests remained with the clutch throughout the 2-mo incubation period, whereas they deserted the clutch within a few days of laying in warmer nests. Most egg-attending females did not feed. Hence, 'cool'-nesting females were emaciated by the end of incubation, and many died from starvation or predation; surviving females required two years to replenish their energy reserves before producing another clutch. In contrast, 'hot'-nesting females had higher rates of survival, and most could reproduce again the following year.

We concluded that, within the limits of uncertainty implied by the available data and our methods of data analysis, the size of the Yellowstone grizzly bear population changed little from 1975 to 1995. We found that grizzly bear mortality rates are about double in years when the whitebark pine crop fails than in mast years, and that the population probably declines when the crop fails and increases in mast years. Our model suggests that natural variation in whitebark pine crop size over the last two decades explains more of the perceived fluctuations in Yellowstone grizzly population size than do other variables. Our analysis used demographic data from 202 radio-telemetered bears followed between 1975 and 1992 and accounted for whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) crop failures during 1993-1995. We used a maximum likelihood method to estimate demographic parameters and used the Akaike Information Criteria to judge the significance of various independent variables. We identified no independent variables correlated with grizzly bear fecundity. In order of importance, we found that grizzly bear mortality rates are correlated with season, whitebark pine crop size (mast vs. nonmast year), sex, management-trapping status (never management-trapped vs. management-trapped once or more), and age. The mortality rate of bears that were management-trapped at least once was almost double that of bears that were never management-trapped, implying a source/sink (i.e., never management-trapped/management-trapped) structure. The rate at which bears move between the source and sink, estimated as the management-trapping rate (h), is critical to estimating the finite rate of increase, λ. We quantified h by estimating the rate at which bears that have never been management-trapped are management-trapped for the first time. It differed across seasons, was higher in nonmast than mast years, and varied with age. We calculate that λ = 1.00 from 1975 to 1983 (four mast and five nonmast years) and 1.02 from 1984 to 1995 (seven mast and five nonmast years). Overall, we find that λ = 1.01 ± 0.04 (mean ± 1 SE) from 1975 to 1995. Our models suggest that future management should concentrate on the threats to whitebark pine, such as those posed by white pine blister rust, global warming, and fire suppression.

We compared the persistence and resilience of a temperate blennioid fish guild at three scales spanning an order of magnitude. Replicate permanent square quadrats of three sizes (4 m2, 25 m2, 100 m2) were delimited within contiguous tracts of reef in two habitats: broken reef and macroalgal forest. Two forms of disturbance were applied to the treatment quadrats. Direct disturbance (fish removal) was applied to treatments in the broken reef habitat. Indirect disturbance (macroalgal removal) was applied to treatments in the macroalgal forest. Both experiments identified several scale-dependent effects. Large quadrats were less variable than smaller quadrats, probably due to reduced edge effects due to movement of fish in and out of the quadrats. The smallest quadrats did not adequately represent the available substratum types within the reef zone. This interacted with species-specific behavioral factors such as mobility and habitat association to consistently bias the blennioid composition within the smallest quadrats toward dominance of the most sedentary blennioid species. Fish responded to disturbance in different ways depending on the stage of their life cycle. Adult fish responded at scales within their motility range of only a few meters. In contrast, newly settling fish responded to the habitat at larger scales. Quadrat size also determined which assemblage dynamics could be measured. Within-year changes in guild composition due to species-specific settlement timing and survivorship could be measured only at larger scales.

Most northern wetlands, such as boreal and arctic ombrogenous bogs and most arctic mesic and wet ecosystem types, are poor in inorganic, plant-available nutrients because mineralization is restricted due to low temperatures and anoxic soils. This is particularly true in the Arctic because nutrient inputs from external sources quite often are small, and nutrient pools in the vegetation also are small. By contrast, the soil and the microbial biomass often contain large stocks of organically fixed nutrients that are largely unavailable to plants. The vegetation is adapted to the low availability of nutrients by the perennial nature of both entire plants and plant tissues, which minimizes the annual nutrient losses and reduces the demand for nutrient uptake to produce new tissues. Furthermore, many of the dominant plant life-forms can use soil organic nitrogen (N), either by direct uptake or through connections with ericoid or ectotrophic mycorrhizae, which reduces competition from other plant groups without the ability to utilize organic N. As soil fertility increases, productivity also increases. However, at least in geogenous ('mineral fed') Arctic wetlands, vascular-plant turnover time is surprisingly constant across nutrient and moisture gradients. This is mainly because communities with a species stock having high leaf turnover rates generally have slow stem and belowground turnover rates and vice versa. Turnover times of the bulk soil organic matter, by contrast, range from a few decades in the most productive systems to several centuries in the most nutrient-deficient and wettest ecosystem types. This is because decomposition rates of the soils are controlled by varying environmental conditions, and nutrients can be strongly immobilized within the soil-microbial ecosystem compartment if the soil is nutrient poor. The composition of the vegetation regulates the turnover of plants and plant nutrients but plays a minor role for the function of the entire plant-soil system. Hence, characteristics of nutrient cycling at the stand level are relatively unimportant for the function of the overall soil-plant-systems, and characteristics of the plants (nutrient resorption, tissue type, longevity, etc.) mirror the functioning of the system rather than play a major role in regulating ecosystem function. However, several uncertainties about the detailed function of the ecosystems are still unresolved and are highlighted in this compilation.",87,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,"Arctic | Boreal | Decomposition | Leaf longevity | Microbial nutrient immobilization | Mycorrhiza | Nutrient cycling, within-stand and ecosystem | Nutrient resorption and storage | Nutrient turnover | Soil nutrient characteristics | Tissue longevity | Wetlands",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,156,NA,NA

Until now, however, theoretical analysis has been hampered because C0 was measured in experiments where cladoceran growth was determined in response to fixed, low food concentrations, not as a result of the cladocerans' grazing activity. C0 is an indirect estimate from nonequilibrium conditions. It still needs to be shown that growing Daphnia are efficient enough to suppress resource concentrations to levels equivalent to their C0. We designed flow-through experiments to establish equilibrium conditions between algal inflow and cladoceran population biomass with three differently sized Daphnia species. The equilibrium food concentration resulting from the daphniids' grazing activity was labeled C*, as it can be used to predict competitive abilities in analogy to Tilman's R*. Equilibrium was reached in each experiment. Daphnia grew to carrying capacity without fluctuations in numbers or biomass, and biomass remained constant after this level was reached. Mortality was compensated for by somatic growth or, in the case of the small species D. ambigua, by production of offspring. When the carrying capacity was reached, algal concentrations remained constant at C*. As predicted from previous growth experiments, larger species suppressed algal concentrations to lower levels, i.e., they were predicted to have higher competitive ability. This prediction was tested in a mixed-species experiment with D. pulicaria and the smaller D. galeata. That experiment clearly demonstrated the mechanism of exploitative competition. In the beginning, the smaller D. galeata performed better, but as soon as the food concentration fell below D. gaIeata's individually determined C*, the smaller species suffered mortality. At this point, D. pulicaria had not yet reached its C*. It continued to grow and replaced D. galeata. Numerical values of D. pulicaria's C* were slightly higher than the independently determined, corresponding C0 values. This was to be expected as C0 applies to zero mortality. However, the rank order among species was identical for both characteristics.

These changes can negatively affect subsequent herbivores. I studied induced responses in annual wild radish plants, Raphanus raphanistrum and R. sativus (Brassicaceae), which included increased density and total number of setose trichomes on newly formed leaves of previously damaged plants compared to undamaged controls. I also characterized the effects of induced responses on the preference and performance of several herbivores and the net consequences for plant performance in the field. Wild radish plants damaged by caterpillars or sprayed with a natural plant response elicitor, jasmonic acid, supported reduced growth of generalist noctuid larvae compared to unmanipulated control plants. Induced responses did not affect the growth of specialist Pieris rapae larvae. In choice and no-choice experiments, induction reduced the feeding by noctuid larvae but did not reduce gross growth efficiency, an indicator of insect growth per unit of plant material consumed. Finally, colonization of plants by leafminers was lower on plants that received previous damage, compared to controls. In field experiments conducted over 2 yr, herbivory by naturally occurring grasshoppers was lower on induced plants than on both unmanipulated controls and leaf damage controls (plants with leaf area removed without the associated induced response). Plant fitness, as estimated by fruit and seed production, was enhanced for induced plants compared to controls. These results demonstrate that induced responses to herbivory can reduce the preference and performance of a variety of herbivores and ultimately increase plant fitness in natural environments.

Twelve out of 13 Cyperaceae species examined in the current study were capable of absorbing soil amino acids in the non-mycorrhizal state. With two exceptions (two species in the genus Kobresia), species from subalpine or alpine habitats exhibited lower rates of total nitrogen uptake compared to species from more temperate habitats, which is possibly explained by lower growth rates in the alpine and subalpine species and a lower overall demand for soil nitrogen. The alpine and subalpine species exhibited higher rates of glycine uptake relative to NH4+ and NO3- uptake, compared to species from the more temperate habitats. This may reflect specialization toward the uptake of organic N in the alpine and subalpine species. In three ecosystems where sedges commonly occur, amino acids were present in the soil pore water, but in highly variable amounts. Seasonal maximum amino acid concentrations in alpine soil pore water ranged from 13 to 158 μmol/L in four dry meadow sites. The most common amino acid in these alpine soils was glycine. In a subalpine fen habitat, aspartate was the most commonly observed amino acid, and total amino acid concentrations were 15-20 μmol/L. In a shortgrass steppe habitat, glutamate was the most abundant amino acid, and total amino acid concentrations were 25-45 μmol/L. Soil protease activities correlated positively with soil protein content when all three ecosystems (alpine, subalpine fen, and shortgrass steppe) were considered together. The addition of protein (as casein) significantly increased soil protease activity, indicating that soil protein content contributes to the capacity to generate soil amino acids. Soil protein contents correlated positively With total soil N content when the alpine and shortgrass steppe sites were considered together. The retention of NH4+ and amino acids on the alpine soil was high compared to soils of lower organic matter content that have been investigated in past studies. We conclude that (1) the potential to take up amino acids in non-mycorrhizal roots of the family Cyperaceae is widespread among species native to a variety of different habitats, (2) amino acids are available for uptake (though most abundant in the alpine), (3) the potential to generate soil amino acids is proportional to soil protein concentration, and (4) soil amino acids can be retained in the soil at high levels, leading to the conclusion that the soil binding affinity of amino acids may constrain uptake by plant roots and microorganisms.",172,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Alpine | Amino acids | Ammonium uptake | Carex | Cyperaceae | Cyperus | Kobresia | Nitrate uptake | Nutrient uptake | Proteolysis | Shortgrass steppe | Subalpine fen,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,160,NA,NA

On average, growing-season length decreases by 30% from shallow to deeper parts of the snowbed. Past work has shown that plant cover and soil fertility decline with delayed snowmelt date along this steep habitat gradient. We experimentally uncoupled the relationship between snowmelt schedule and site fertility by adding snow to plots at naturally shallow snow depths and removing snow prematurely from plots with naturally deeper snow in the summers of 1991-1994. Seeds of R. adoneus were transplanted into manipulated plots and adjacent control plots in 1990 and 1991. Seedling shoot size and survival were monitored over the course of the experiment. Production of true (adult) leaves by newly emerging seedlings was significantly reduced by the delayed snowmelt schedule. Seedlings failing to produce true leaves during their first summer were at a strong survival disadvantage over the winter months. Leaf length for seedlings that produced true leaves was not affected by snowmelt or location on the snow depth gradient; nor did leaf length affect overwinter survival. We defined seedling establishment as the successful transition from seed to seedling of age two years. At this age, all seedlings have produced true leaves. Effects of growing-season length on seedling establishment rate were pronounced in inner portions of the snowbed. There, average establishment success increased from <1% under natural conditions to 5% with experimental extension of the growing season. In contrast, establishment rate in plots near the snowbed edge tended to increase when snowmelt was experimentally delayed. Possibly, delaying snowmelt in relatively fertile outer plots enhanced establishment by synchronizing seed germination with warmer mid-season soil temperatures in the snowbed environment. Regrowth of other plant species into planting microsites occurred more extensively in early snowmelt plots than in late snowmelt plots but had little effect on seedling establishment. Pooled across the entire cohort of germinating seedlings, emergence, survival over the first winter, and survival during the second growing season contributed significantly to variation in establishment rate (R2 = 37%, 7%, and 32%, respectively) but were poorly intercorrelated (r = -0.15). These findings show that sites favorable at any one stage in establishment do not remain favorable at other stages. We conclude that the relationship between growing-season length and seedling establishment success in snow buttercups depends on other aspects of microsite quality. In nutrient-poor habitats, short growing seasons play a major role in restricting establishment. However, in more fertile sites, the timing of snowmelt and its associated effects on the quality of the microclimate for seed germination may be more critical than the period of time from snowmelt until the onset of winter.

We studied the effects of a pathogenic water mold, Saprolegnia ferax, on competitive interactions between the Cascades frog Rana cascadae and the Pacific treefrog HyIa regilla. Previous studies have shown that outbreaks of Saprolegnia infection in the Cascade mountains of Oregon, USA, result in high embryonic mortality for Rana but not for Hyla. Thus, we examined how infections of Saprolegnia during amphibian embryonic development could influence larval recruitment and competitive interactions between larval Rana and Hyla. We manipulated the presence of Saprolegnia and embryonic Hyla and Rana in replicated artificial ponds and determined mean survivorship to hatching per pool from daily observations during embryonic development. Pools were then followed throughout larval development, and we recorded mean mass of tadpoles at metamorphosis and time to metamorphosis per pool. The presence of Saprolegnia differentially affected larval recruitment of the two species; larval recruitment of Rana was reduced by 46.2% in the presence of Saprolegnia, whereas Hyla survival was not affected. However, larval Rana that survived Saprolegnia infection developed faster and were larger at metamorphosis compared to individuals not exposed to Saprolegnia. In the absence of Saprolegnia, Rana had strong negative effects on the growth, development, and survival of Hyla. However, in the presence of Saprolegnia, the outcome of competitive interactions between the two species was reversed.

Because light is a major environmental factor limiting growth and survival of many forest species, its distribution may affect stand-level regeneration patterns. We examined spatial patterning in light availability and seedling regeneration in old-growth, second-growth, and selectively logged stands of tropical moist forest in northeastern Costa Rica. Our objectives were to determine how the frequency distribution and spatial pattern of understory light 'microsites' differ among tropical wet forests; whether patterns of seedling regeneration are linked to spatial patterning of light availability; and whether these relationships differ among old-growth, second-growth, and selectively logged forest stands. We used both sensor-based and hemispherical photograph-based methods to measure light availability along three 130-160 m long transects in each of eight stands (three old-growth, three second-growth, and two selectively logged). Woody seedling abundance was assessed at 4 m2, 25 m2, and full-stand scales (430 m2), and species richness was computed at the 25-m2 and full-stand levels. Data were analyzed using both conventional parametric approaches and spatial statistics. Mean light availability did not differ markedly among stand types, but variance and frequency distributions of light availability did. Second-growth stands had significantly higher unweighted canopy openness along solar tracks and a higher frequency of microsites at intermediate light levels. Old-growth stands had greater representation of both low- and high-light microsites, and greater overall variance in light availability. Old-growth stands also had slightly higher abundance and species richness of woody seedlings. Light availability was significantly spatially autocorrelated in all stand types, but patch size (analogous to gap size) was twice as large in old-growth stands, based on sensor data. Seedling abundance was also spatially autocorrelated over greater distances in old-growth than in second-growth stands, often at similar spatial scales to light distribution. The selectively logged stands demonstrated spatial autocorrelation of light and seedling abundance over distances intermediate to the other two stand types. Despite the similarities in patterns of light and seedling distributions, relationships between woody seedling abundance, species richness, and the three light availability measures were not strong or consistently positive, regardless of whether standard regressions or partial Mantel tests were applied. Although seedling abundance is likely to be affected by a wide variety of factors, the similarities in the scales of spatial autocorrelation of light and seedling abundance suggest that current seedling abundance distributions may reflect past patterns of light distribution within the stands. Our results confirm the importance of examining spatial dependence of resource availability in studies of forest dynamics, but they also underscore the limitations of a single period of data collection.

Total aboveground biomass (TAGB) increased with increasing site age and ranged from 4.8 Mg/ha in a recently abandoned site to 287 Mg/ha in the 50-yr-old secondary forest site. Results indicate that secondary forests would reach TAGB levels equivalent to those of primary forests in the Los Tuxtlas Region after 73 yr. Furthermore, mean annual aboveground biomass accumulation (ABA) of secondary forests was strongly and inversely related to the duration of prior land use. Aboveground pools of C, N, S, and P were also positively correlated with secondary forest age. For forests between 6 mo and 50 yr of age, C pools increased from 2 to 136 Mg/ha, N increased from 72 to 1167 kg/ha, S increased from 9 to 147 kg/ha, and P increased from 5 to 147 kg/ha. In contrast, C, N, and S pools in mineral soil to a 1-m depth remained relatively stable throughout the successional chronosequence and averaged 207, 20, and 3.4 Mg/ha, respectively. Mineral soil pools did not differ with respect to forest age or prior land use history and did not differ from soil pools of primary forest, cornfield, and pasture sites in the Los Tuxtlas Region. Dynamics of the combined aboveground and mineral soil C pools (i.e., excluding C in root biomass) were characterized by increasing contributions from aboveground pools with increasing forest age; aboveground C pools accounted for 9% and 42% of the combined pool in the youngest and oldest forests, respectively. In contrast, changes in combined aboveground and mineral soil pools of N and S during secondary succession were relatively small because >90% of N and S mass was located in mineral soil pools.",284,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,"Aboveground biomass | Carbon sequestration | Greenhouse gas flux | Land use | Los Tuxtlas, Mexico | Mexico | Nutrient dynamics | Secondary forests | Tropical ecosystems",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,165,NA,NA

Similarly, changes in decomposition and nutrient mineralization are likely to occur if the soil warms and the soil moisture conditions are altered. Plant and microbial responses have usually been investigated separately, and few, if any, studies have addressed simultaneous responses to environmental changes in plants and soil microorganisms, except in models. We measured simultaneous responses in biomass, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) incorporation in plants and microorganisms after five years of factorial fertilizer addition, air warming, and shading. We expected increased N and P uptake by microorganisms after fertilizer addition and also after warming, due to increases in mineralization rates in warmer soils. Plant productivity and N and P uptake were expected to increase after fertilizer addition but less after warming, because microbes were expected to absorb most of the extra released nutrients. Shading was expected to decrease plant production and also microbial biomass, due to the reduced production of labile carbon (C) in plant root exudates associated with reduced photosynthesis. We found that the plants responded strongly to fertilizer addition by increased biomass accumulation and N and P uptake. They responded less to warming, but more than expected, showing a decline in N and P concentrations in many cases. There were few significant responses to shading. The strongest response was found in combined fertilizer addition and warming treatments. All functional vascular plant groups responded similarly. However, mosses declined under those conditions when vascular plant growth was most pronounced. Contrary to our expectation, microbial C, N, and P did not increase after warming, but microbial N and P increased after shading. As expected, fertilizer addition led to increased microbial P content, whereas microbial N either increased or did not change. In general, microbial C did not change in any treatment.

We experimentally manipulated biota over a 30-40 d period in two streams with distinctly different macrobiotic assemblages: one characterized by high densities of omnivorous shrimps (Decapoda: Atyidae and Xiphocarididae) and no predaceous fishes, and one characterized by low densities of shrimps and the presence of predaceous fishes. To incorporate the natural hydrologic regime and to avoid confounding artifacts associated with cage enclosures/exclosures (e.g., high sedimentation), we used electricity as a mechanism for experimental exclusion, in situ. In each stream, shrimps and/or fishes were excluded from specific areas of rock substrata in four pools using electric 'fences' attached to solar-powered fence chargers. In the stream lacking predaceous fishes (Sonadora), the unelectrified control treatment was almost exclusively dominated by high densities of omnivorous shrimps that constantly ingested fine particulate material from rock surfaces. Consequently, the control had significantly lower levels of inorganic sediments, organic material, carbon, and nitrogen than the exclusion treatment, as well as less variability in these parameters. Tenfold more organic material (as ash-free dry mass, AFDM) and fivefold more nitrogen accrued in shrimp exclosures (10.6 g AFDM/m2, 0.2 g N/m2) than in controls (1.1 g AFDM/m2, 0.04 g N/m2). By reducing the quantity of fine particulate organic material and associated nitrogen in benthic environments, omnivorous shrimps potentially affect the supply of this important resource to other trophic levels. The small amount of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) that remained in control treatments (composed of sparse algal cells) was of higher quality than that in shrimp exclosures. This is evidenced by the significantly lower carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio (an indicator of food quality, with relatively low C/N indicating higher food quality) in the control relative to the shrimp exclosure treatment. In contrast, the stream with predaceous fishes (Bisley) was characterized by very low numbers of shrimps, and macrobiota had no significant effect on benthic sediments, organic matter, C, N, and C/N. All parameters were highly variable through time, with levels and ranges in variability similar to the shrimp exclusion treatment in the Sonadora. Our experimental results are consistent with findings of an independent survey of six streams in four different drainages. Four streams that had an abundance of omnivorous shrimps, but lacked predaceous fishes, had extremely low levels of fine benthic organic and inorganic material. In contrast, two streams that had low densities of shrimps and contained predaceous fishes had significantly higher levels. Results show a strong linkage between species and ecosystem characteristics: interstream differences in the quantity and quality of fine benthic organic matter resources were determined by the nature of the macrobiotic assemblage.

Foliage of Aechmea magdalenae, an understory CAM bromeliad, has a higher maximum photosynthesis rate, and greater nitrogen, chlorophyll, and water contents on a leaf-area basis compared to three sympatric C3 species. Leaf characteristics of two other understory CAM bromeliads, Ananas comosus and Bromelia plumieri, were similar to that of Aechmea. Aechmea, compared to three sympatric C3 species, allocates less biomass to roots and more to foliage. The annual aboveground relative growth of Aechmea was lower than it was for the C3 species, despite Aechmea's higher photosynthetic capacity. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the efficient use of transient periods of high light for carbon gain is critical to the success of this CAM species as an understory plant.

We carried out field experiments to test the resource availability hypothesis as well as the crown architecture hypothesis, which attributes changes in the time of budburst in the year following herbivory to changes in the proportion of different bud types. We examined predictions from these hypotheses using a defoliator, Choristoneura fumiferana; a defoliator/stem feeder, Zeiraphera canadensis; and a stem galler, Adelges abietis; on white spruce, Picea glauca. The time of budburst and final leaf size of unexploited midcrown shoots of white spruce were compared to those of adjacent exploited shoots. We also evaluated budburst in a manipulated field study, in which tree growth was reduced through root pruning and increased through fertilization. Partial defoliation by C. fumiferana and Z. canadensis did not affect budburst, but did result in smaller leaves. Almost complete defoliation of shoots by C. fumiferana and galling by A. abietis resulted in delayed budburst. Reductions in leaf size were directly related to the amount of herbivory (i.e., low or high) by C. fumiferana and Z. canadensis. Budburst of trees whose growth rate had been decreased by root pruning or increased by fertilizing occurred later and sooner, respectively, than budburst on unmanipulated trees. The time of budburst was inversely correlated with foliar nitrogen and water content and the length of unexploited shoots. These results supported the resource availability hypothesis. The influence of resource availability on time of budburst was observed at the shoot, branch, and whole-tree levels. When >50% of stems were destroyed by Z. canadensis, budburst occurred earlier or at the same time in the following spring. This was due to the production of basal buds, which burst before all other buds on a shoot. The production of early-bursting basal buds more than compensated, or just compensated, for a small delay in budburst of terminal, distal-lateral, and medial-lateral buds. Thus, changes in the time of budburst in the year following herbivory were due to changes in crown architecture as well as to changes in resource availability. We predict that increased intra-tree heterogeneity in the time of budburst should make P. glauca more, rather than less, susceptible to two of the herbivores studied because of the presence of a highly nutritious food source, newly burst buds, for a longer period of time. We suggest that the influence of previous herbivory on the time of budburst in the next growing season is a commonly overlooked factor that may have a large influence on herbivore abundance and distribution.",35,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Adelges abietis | Budburst phenology | Choristoneura fumiferana | Fertilization | Herbivory | Insect herbivores | Picea glauca | Plant architecture | Plant defense | Resource availability | Root pruning | Zeiraphera canadensis,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,171,NA,NA

At the northern edge of the Great Plains, we examined five stands in each of undisturbed prairie, successional prairie(fields abandoned for ~50 yr that had undergone succession to native grasses), and abandoned fields of similar age planted with Agropyron cristatum, a C3 perennial tussock grass introduced from northern Asia. We attributed differences between successional prairie and A. cristatum stands to the introduced species and not to cultivation. A. cristatum fields contained few native species, resulting in significantly lower species richness and diversity. Growth forms most similar to A. cristatum, i.e., C3 grasses, were most likely to be excluded. Soils under A. cristatum had significantly less available N, total N, and total C than soils under successional prairie. A. cristatum fields had significantly higher shoot mass than successional prairie, but root: shoot ratios in A. cristatum fields were less than half those under successional prairie, because root mass was significantly higher under native grasses. C:N ratios did not vary significantly between A. cristatum and native grasses, suggesting that the lower N and C content of soils under A. cristatum was not caused by differences in nutrient concentrations. Instead, the relatively low root mass of the introduced grass was probably responsible for decreased rates of N and C addition to the soil. Because total C was 25% less in soils under A. cristatum than under successional prairie, the planting of A. Cristatum over millions of hectares of the Great Plains may have left 3.3-4.8 X 1014 g of C in the atmosphere that would otherwise have been stored as soil organic matter by native grasses. In contrast to the large effects of A. cristatum, almost no significant differences were found between undisturbed and successional prairie. Thus, the identity of the species dominating after disturbance played a larger long-term role in determining ecosystem function than did the disturbance itself.

The proposed approach is applied to the dynamics of a spatial and individual-based predator-prey model. The selected spatial scale is smaller than the one obtained by a previously proposed method whose similarities and differences we discuss. Two models, the simplest candidates for approximating the dynamics of densities at the selected scale, are examined: a predator-prey system of differential equations that ignores the local nature of the dynamics, and an extension of it that adds demographic noise. These approximations perform poorly, failing to capture broad statistical features of the predator and prey fluctuations. These findings indicate that spatial factors are nonnegligible at the selected intermediate scale of aggregation. Thus, predator-prey systems and other oscillatory ecological systems may display a dynamic regime at an intermediate scale of aggregation in which local interactions are still important.

Thus, plants acquired N early in the season when they were actively growing, and the highest net microbial N immobilization occurred later in the season, after plant senescence. The potential for microbial competition for N may have been limited by: (1) constraints on microbial growth from the seasonal alpine freeze-thaw cycles, and (2) influences of roots on N cycling by soil microorganisms.

In this litterbag experiment, naphthalene was applied to reduce the microarthropod population density from half of three replicate plots established at each site. This enabled us to quantify the mass loss contributed by the fauna (MLCF) at each site and permitted an analysis of the influence of site-specific differences in the composition of the microarthropod assemblages on decomposition rates. We hypothesized that microarthropod regulation of the microbial populations involved in leaf litter decomposition would be stronger in humid tropical forests, which experience conditions of low climatic variability. In these conditions, there can be an enhanced degree of biotic interactions between microarthropods and their microbial food sources. The elevated extent of these interactions should be expressed as a greater influence of microarthropods at the tropical sites and could result in a site-specific effect of faunal assemblages on decomposition. Decomposition of the oak litter proceeded faster in Puerto Rican and Costa Rican forests than in a temperate forest in North Carolina, USA. Microarthropods had little effect on decomposition in the temperate forest, whereas their influence was pronounced at tropical sites. Mass loss of litter from plots with reduced microarthropod populations was similar at the tropical sites. When plots with intact faunal communities were compared, differences in the tropical sites were apparent, suggesting that there was a site-specific faunal contribution to decomposition at these sites. Oribatid mites constituted a dominant component (41-64%) at each of the sites. Species richness of oribatids and Fisher's alpha diversity were similar in each of the three sites. The Shannon index revealed a lower diversity at LUQ. Abundance of microarthropods was lowest at LAS. Species accumulation curves for each site, though similar in form, were distinctive, as were diversity accumulation patterns in samples of increasing size.

Each of the two patches in each population was initially colonized by founder demes that were monomorphic with respect to two different marker alleles of a single locus. The rate of transfer of individuals and the resultant degree of interbreeding (heterozygosity) between the two demes were monitored by capture-recapture methodology and genetic analyses over the reproductive season. Females were predominantly philopatric in these populations; more than four-fifths of the founder deme females settled and reproduced in their original patch. However, corridors significantly facilitated the transfer of females. The transfer rate of males was generally very high; approximately four-fifths, independent of the experimental factor (absence or presence of corridors). The sex-specific transfer pattern gave rise to very high rates of interbreeding (heterozygosity).

However, such mismatches can also arise due to natural or anthropogenic changes in the environment, thus providing the data needed to test hypotheses about the ecological effects of local or global environmental change. Here, we present a method that allows this type of comparison to rigorously test for the population-level effects of past and ongoing environmental change in situations where no long-term monitoring data exist. Our approach hinges on the fact that changing environmental conditions will cause population size structure to lag behind that predicted by current demographic rates. We first develop the methods needed to calculate the likelihood of an observed population structure, given different stochastic models of demography responding to environmental changes. We next use simulated data to explore the method's power in the face of estimation errors in current vital rates, environmental noise, and other complications. We conclude that this method holds promise when applied to slowly growing, long-lived species and when model structures are used that allow for realistic time lags in population structure. Researchers using this approach should also be careful to assess the importance of other phenomena (rare catastrophes, recent founding of populations, genetic changes, and density dependence) that may compromise the method's accuracy. Although large data sets are required for the method to be accurate and powerful, the data required will be readily obtainable for abundant and easily sampled species.

Understanding these effects requires descriptions of dispersal at local and regional scales and statistical models that permit estimation. Classical models of dispersal describe local or long-distance dispersal, but not both. The lack of statistical methods means that models have rarely been fitted to seed dispersal in closed forests. We present a mixture model of dispersal that assumes a range of disperal patterns, both local and long distance. The bivariate Student's t or '2Dt' follows from an assumption that the distance parameter in a Gaussian model varies randomly, thus having a density of its own. We use an inverse approach to 'compete' our mixture model against classical alternatives, using seed rain databases from temperate broadleaf, temperate mixed-conifer, and tropical floodplain forests. For most species, the 2Dt model fits dispersal data better than do classical models. The superior fit results from the potential for a convex shape near the source tree and a 'fat tail.' Our parameter estimates have implications for community dynamics at local scales, for vegetation responses to global change at regional scales, and for differences in seed dispersal among biomes. The 2Dt model predicts that less seed travels beyond the immediate crown influence (<5 m) than is predicted under a Gaussian model, but that more seed travels longer distances (>30 m). Although Gaussian and exponential models predict slow population spread in the face of environmental change, our dispersal estimates suggest rapid spread.

The geomorphology of this region typifies that of low-lying, limestone coastlines considered highly susceptible to sea-level rise (e.g., much of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Yucatan Peninsula, and low-lying limestone islands throughout the world). This coast is microtidal, shallowly sloping, and has a rate of relative sea-level rise similar to that of eustatic rise. To determine patterns of forest change in relation to sea-level rise, we examined patterns of tree species zonation, tree recruitment, and tree mortality in relation to site elevation and tidal-flooding frequency. To reconstruct histories of forest change in relation to sea-level rise, we estimated age distributions of Sabal palmetto, the most widely distributed tree species at our site, relating age structures of stands to reconstructed histories of tidal flooding in the stands. Finally, to assess the relative roles of flooding stress (hypoxia), salt exposure, and competition from encroaching salt-marsh vegetation in the decline of forest stands, we examined patterns of soil redox potential, groundwater salinity, and density of halophytic vegetation among stands in different stages of decline. Zonation among tree species was related to tidal-flooding frequency. For most trees, seedlings were absent from the most frequently flooded stands in which the species occurred. Reconstructed flooding histories of stands and age estimates for S. palmetto suggest that many decades elapse between cessation of regeneration and local elimination of a tree species. Even during the relatively short duration of the study (4 yr), however, composition of some stands changed in the direction predicted from species zonation and sea-level rise. Forest understory replacement by halophytic vegetation appeared to follow, rather than cause, failure of tree regeneration. Tidal flooding rarely produced severe reducing conditions in soil, but groundwater salinity was correlated with tidal-flooding frequency. Forest retreat in this system, therefore, involves the development of relict (non-regenerating) stands of different tree species at different flooding frequencies. Exposure to salt appears to be the major cause of tree regeneration failure, with flooding stress and interference from marsh vegetation playing minor or negligible roles. These interactions differ somewhat from those on deltaic coasts or coasts with high freshwater outflows, where flooding stress may play a larger role in regeneration failure, and from sandy coasts, where erosion may play a larger role in forest retreat.

The alternative model suggests that the underlying structure of the basins themselves may be gradually changed by the changing environmental factor. Consequently, the basin of the chaotic attractor may disappear, because it intersects the alternative basin; hence the term basin boundary collision. The implications of this model can be dramatic, such as sudden and unpredictable extinctions or dramatic and unexpected changes in ecosystem syndromes.

Juvenile leaves generally have a lower leaf mass per area (LMA) and are often more horizontal in orientation than adult leaves. This paper examines the hypothesis that the shift from juvenile to adult foliage is related to the scaling of mechanical support costs. A simple model of stem allometry and production was used to show that low values of LMA and leaf area per unit crown area (LAI) should increase the growth rates of small, open-grown seedlings, but not larger saplings or trees. This result occurs because relatively little biomass need be invested in stems and branches to spread out the leaf mass of a seedling, favoring the option of increasing light interception by increasing crown area. In contrast, the large support requirements of trees make increasing crown area expensive and favor shifts to higher LAI and LMA, thereby increasing within-crown light interception and light use efficiency. Reported LMA values for juveniles are lower than for older trees under similar light levels, and there is evidence for similar trends in LAI. However, juvenile foliage may have a variety of other functions, including the enhancement of shade tolerance, and trade-offs may also occur between efficient light interception and protection against herbivores and mechanical damage.

Weather, diet composition, and prey availability were examined for their effects on individual growth. Two ecotypes were revealed whose distribution coincided with differences in prey availability. Individuals from populations that had continuous access to prey and water across years exhibited fast growth, early maturation, high fecundity, and low adult survival. In contrast, individuals from populations that experienced variable prey availability exhibited slow growth, late maturation, low fecundity, and high adult survival.

The relationship between the adult-to-juvenile survival ratio and the mean age at maturity was in the direction predicted by life history theory, but it was not significant. Strong correlations between mean age at maturity and both juvenile growth and the adult-to-juvenile growth ratio indicate that growth may affect the timing of maturity more strongly than survivorship in some species.

Annual survivorship curves from adults in these two populations showed a marked concavity not illustrated in the other populations, supporting the prediction of life history theory that high reproductive effort results in a high survival cost of reproduction.

As expected, seedlings of species with the highest adult abundance in 150 ha experienced the highest local densities of both conspecific seedlings and trees.

In the southwestern United States, increased abundance of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa var. glandulosa) has been attributed to heavy grazing by livestock. Here, we test the hypothesis that P. glandulosa invasion of grasslands requires, first, reductions in herbaceous biomass and density such as those that accompany livestock grazing and, second, episodes of high soil moisture availability. No combination of grass density (nonmanipulated or reduced 50%) or defoliation (none, moderate, heavy) significantly affected P. glandulosa seedling emergence within a watering regime (natural and supplemented) at our field site in semiarid southern Texas. Seedling emergence on plots receiving only natural rainfall was high (42%), despite the fact that precipitation was substantially below normal. Supplemental watering, to generate moisture levels approximating years of unusually high annual rainfall, increased emergence to 59%. Seedling survival after 2 yr was high (62-77%) and statistically comparable across the density, defoliation, and watering treatments. Net photosynthesis (A(n)) of 1-yr-old seedlings was enhanced by supplemental watering, but reductions in grass density or biomass had little effect on seedling A(n) or xylem water potential. Height, aboveground biomass, and leaf area were comparable among 1- and 2-yr-old seedings across all density, defoliation, and watering combinations. High seedling Emergence and survival on unwatered plots, even during a 'drought year,' suggests that Prosopis recruitment is not contingent upon unusual or episodic rainfall. Reductions in biomass and density of herbaceous vegetation had no influence on seedling emergence, growth, or survival, suggesting that Prosopis invasion is minimally influenced by grass competition. Historic grazing at this site appears to have altered herbaceous composition and reduced above- and belowground biomass production below the threshold level required for competitive exclusion of woody vegetation. Such data suggest that rates and patterns of seed dispersal may be the primary determinants of P. glandulosa encroachment on present-day landscapes in semiarid regions. Minimizing livestock dispersal of seed (in the case of leguminous shrubs) and maintenance of an effective fire regime (through production of fine fuels) may be crucial for sustaining herbaceous composition and production in grazed systems prone to invasion by unpalatable woody plants.",195,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Chloris cucullata | Competition of invasive woody plants in grasslands | Grazing | Photosynthesis | Plant invasion | Prosopis glandulosa | Savanna | Seedling establishment | Tree-grass interactions | Woody | Xylem water potential,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,189,all,All Open Access

We identify the role of fine-scale light heterogeneity in controlling broad-scale community behavior in SORTIE, an empirically derived, stochastic forest simulation model. SORTIE employs a very detailed measure of local light based on a 216-point sample around every tree. We test the importance of this fine-scale description of local light by reformulating SORTIE with less detail in this algorithm. Predicted forests are compared at several scales from total tree biomass (coarse grained) and patterns of forest succession to the local spatial pattern of light availability at the forest floor (fine grained). SORTIE is surprisingly insensitive to the amount of detail used in the calculation of the local resource, light. In all simulations, 48- and 16-point samples accurately reproduce the local light environment and thus predict forest development without appreciable error. A one-point sample of light significantly alters the estimates of the local light environment, but the emergent forest dynamics are insensitive to these alterations. The robustness of the forest model to the altered light environment stems from two very different mechanisms. First, the alterations of the light environment have very short correlation lengths in time and space. This allows fine-scale averaging to occur on the landscape. Second, the functional relationships among light availability, growth rate, and mortality risk in several key species tend to prevent the altered light environment from affecting individual tree performance. These results demonstrate that emergent forest dynamics in SORTIE do not require detailed local light estimation to capture the interaction between local resource heterogeneity and the functional responses of trees.

Even in the most-studied populations, however, scientists continue to dispute the relative importance of various potential causes of the cycles. Over the past three decades, theoretical ecologists have cataloged a large number of mechanisms that are capable of generating cycles in population models. At the same time, statisticians have developed new techniques both for characterizing time series and for fitting population models to time-series data. Both disciplines are now sufficiently advanced that great gains in understanding can be made by synthesizing these complementary, and heretofore mostly independent, quantitative approaches. In this paper we demonstrate how to apply this synthesis to the problem of population cycles, using both long-term population time series and the often-rich observational and experimental data on the ecology of the species in question. We quantify hypotheses by writing mathematical models that embody the interactions and forces that might cause cycles. Some hypotheses can be rejected out of hand, as being unable to generate even qualitatively appropriate dynamics. We finish quantifying the remaining hypotheses by estimating parameters, both from independent experiments and from fitting the models to the time-series data using modern statistical techniques. Finally, we compare simulated time series generated by the models to the observed time series, using a variety of statistical descriptors, which we refer to collectively as 'probes.' The model most similar to the data, as measured by these probes, is considered to be the most likely candidate to represent the mechanism underlying the population cycles.

A principal curves ordination will simultaneously estimate the species response curves and locate sites on a single ecological gradient. By means of theoretical argument and simulations, they are shown to be superior to both correspondence analysis and multidimensional scaling, outperforming them in 77% and 72% of simulations, respectively. The species response curves used in the simulations varied from simple Gaussian form with equal maxima and tolerances to complex multimodal curves with varying maxima and tolerances. Simulations were conducted both with and without noise. When species response curves are smooth, and a reasonable initial configuration is provided, principal curve gradient analysis can succeed even when the curves are complex and beta diversity is high. Principal curves can also be adapted for direct gradient analysis in order to relate species composition to environmental variables. Although ordination techniques are used both to uncover ecological gradients and to represent species composition, it is argued that these two aims are distinct. Hence, a single ordination technique cannot generally achieve both objectives simultaneously. However, by superimposing a principal curve on a principal components biplot, joint representation of an ecological gradient and species composition can be achieved. Information from either an indirect or direct principal curve gradient analysis can be added to the biplot, thereby relating environmental variables to species composition and locations of sites on the gradient. Two ecological data sets, comprising abundances of hunting spiders and species of grasses, are analyzed using principal curve gradient analysis. The results are contrasted with previous analyses, using canonical-correspondence analysis and canonical-correlation analysis, and indicate that principal curve gradient analysis can find one-dimensional gradients that explain species composition as well as, or better than, higher dimensional solutions from other techniques. This, in turn, can lead to a more succinct representation and better understanding of ecological systems.",83,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Biplots | Correspondence analysis | Gaussian ordination | Gradient analysis | Multidimensional scaling | Principal components | Principal curves,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,192,NA,NA

Asynarchus larvae predominate in temporary wetlands and are aggressive intraguild predators on Limnephilus larvae, which only predominate in permanent basins with salamanders. We first conducted a field experiment in mesocosms (cattle tanks) to quantify the predatory effects of different life stages of salamanders on the two caddisfly species. Two life stages of the salamanders (larvae and paedomorphs) preferentially preyed on Asynarchus relative to Limnephilus. Subsequent laboratory experiments revealed that high Asynarchus activity rates and relatively ineffective antipredatory behaviors led to higher salamander detection and attack rates compared to Limnephilus. In a second field experiment (full factorial for presence and absence of each of the three species), we found that salamander predation on Asynarchus had an indirect positive effect on Limnephilus: survival was higher in the presence of salamanders + Asynarchus than with just Asynarchus. In the laboratory we compared the predatory effects of salamanders with and without their mouths sewn shut and found the observed indirect positive effect on Limnephilus survival to be mainly the result of reduced numbers of Asynarchus rather than salamander-induced changes in Asynarchus behavior. We argue that indirect effects of predator-predator interactions on shared prey will be mainly density-mediated and not trait-mediated when one of the predators (in this case, Asynarchus) is under strong selection for rapid growth and therefore does not modify foraging behaviors in response to the other predator. The reciprocal dominance of Limnephilus and Asynarchus in habitats with and without salamanders probably reflects a tradeoff between competitive superiority and vulnerability to predation. The high activity levels and aggressiveness that enable Asynarchus to complete development in temporary habitats result in strong asymmetric competition (via intraguild predation) with Limnephilus. In permanent habitats these same behaviors increase Asynarchus vulnerability to salamander predation, which indirectly benefits Limnephilus.

Conditions favoring such mutualisms are poorly known but likely include plants and pollinators whose life cycles are synchronized. In this paper, we describe a new pollinating seed-consumer mutualism between a Sonoran Desert cactus, Lophocereus schottii (senita cactus), and a pyralid moth, Upiga virescens (senita moth). We compare this mutualism with the yucca mutualism in terms of life history traits, active pollination, and selective abortion. Senita cactus flowers were pollinated nearly exclusively by nocturnal senita moths, but a few halictid bees also pollinated flowers. Only 40% of flowers set fruit during the years of study, apparently due to resource limitation. All phases of the senita moth's life history were associated with the senita cactus. During flower visitation, female senita moths collected pollen, actively pollinated flowers, and oviposited one egg. After flowers closed, emerging larvae bored into the tops of developing fruit, where they consumed seeds and fruit tissue. However, not all seeds/fruit were consumed by larvae because only 20% of eggs produced larvae that survived to be seed/fruit consumers. Senita cactus and senita moth interactions were mutualistic. Moths received food resources (seeds, fruit) for their progeny, and cacti had a 4.8 benefit-to-cost ratio; only 21% of developing fruit were destroyed by larvae. Life history traits important to this mutualism included low survival of senita moth eggs/larvae, several moth generations per flowering season, host specificity of senita moths, active pollination, oviposition into flowers, and limited seed/fruit consumption. Active pollination by senita moths in the presence of co-pollinators supports the prediction that active pollination can evolve during a period of coexistence with co-pollinators.

Grazing rate was positively related to biomass on short swards, yet there was no significant relationship for tall swards. Bite mass and bite rate also differed in their relationship to biomass across sward heights, with the strongest relationships being found on short swards. Bite rate and bite mass were inversely related, as predicted by current theory for dense grass swards.

Studies of wetlands in western Europe and of other terrestrial ecosystems in North America frequently show that nutrient enrichment leads to changes in species composition, declines in overall plant species diversity, and loss of rare-and uncommon species. We therefore used an extensive literature survey and analysis of data on plant species composition, species richness, productivity or standing crop, and C:N:P stoichiometry in plant tissues and surface soils to draw conclusions about the nature of nutrient limitation in temperate North American bogs, fens, marshes, and swamps, and to infer their potential response to nutrient enrichment. We searched all major bibliographic data bases for studies containing such data (through March 1998) and added relevant data from our own ongoing research. We analyzed plant and soil data sets by wetland type and by wetland soil type, and the plant data set also by growth form. Existing studies appear to confirm common generalizations: (1) plant community type changes across broad nutrient gradients; (2) species richness declines as various indicators of nutrient availability increase beyond some threshold; and (3) rare and uncommon species are almost always associated with species-rich communities. However, (1) these generalizations do not always hold within community types; (2) for many community types, the threshold beyond which richness declines has not been established, and high or low diversity may occur below that threshold; and (3) the failure of many studies to include bryophytes precludes drawing strong conclusions about nutrient availability and diversity in peatlands. Marshes had significantly lower mean nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratios in live tissue than other wetland types (bogs, fens, and swamps), which did not differ significantly from each other. Mean N:P ratios in live tissues were significantly higher in peatlands than in mineral-soil wetlands. Nitrogen: phosporus ratios in litter did not differ significantly between peatlands and mineral-soil wetlands but were higher than in live tissues. Among growth forms, the highest mean N:P ratios in live tissues occurred in bryophytes, and the lowest in vascular herbaceous species. Only bryophyte live tissues differed significantly from other growth forms; litter N:P ratios were not significantly different among growth forms. Average N:P ratios in surface soils were lower in marshes and swamps than in bogs and fens. Wetlands on mineral soils had lower average N:P ratios than wetlands on peat soils. Average surface soil N:P ratios rose sharply at high soil organic-matter contents (≥90%) and were generally greater than 16 at organic-matter concentrations above 20%. In combination, plant tissue and surface soil N:P ratios suggest that a large proportion of North American wetlands are either P limited or co-limited by N and P, especially those occurring on organic soils. Only marshes have N:P ratios in both live tissues land surface soils that consistently indicate N limitation, although soils data suggest that the majority of swamps are also N limited. Vascular herbaceous species appear to be N limited, but no pattern is apparent among other growth forms. Inferences drawn from N:P stoichiometry need to be verified by examining ecosystem response to experimental fertilization. High variances in plant and soil N:P ratios suggest that understanding nutrient limitation at both the community and individual-species level may be necessary to predict changes in species composition and richness with nutrient enrichment.",415,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Bryophytes | Diversity | N:P ratios | Nitrogen | North America | Nutrient availability and plant diversity | Nutrient enrichment | Nutrient limitation | Phosphorus | Plant-tissue nutrients | Productivity | Soil nutrients | Standing crop and plant species richness | Temperate zone wetlands | Wetland nutrient limitation | Wetlands,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,197,NA,NA

We present experimental evidence that terrestrial arthropod inputs have an indirect but prominent effect on a stream benthic community by altering the intensity of fish predation in the food web. Two key elements of the stream food web, terrestrial arthropod inputs and the presence of predatory fish, were experimentally manipulated by using greenhouse-type covers and enclosures (or exclosures) in a forest stream located in northern Japan. When terrestrial arthropod inputs to the stream were experimentally reduced, fish predation pressure shifted dramatically from terrestrial to aquatic arthropods. The ensuing depletion of aquatic arthropods resulted in a subsequent increase in periphyton biomass. This field experiment revealed that terrestrial arthropod inputs were a primary factor controlling cascading trophic interactions among predatory fish, herbivorous aquatic arthropods, and benthic periphyton.

The present study examines analogous evolutionary responses to vertical gradients in light availability, through an analysis of patterns of photosynthetic variation among late-successional tropical tree species that differ in adult stature. Larger statured tree species are expected to have higher values for light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A(max)) as adults, due to the inevitable gradient in light availability through the canopy. However, we argue that larger statured species should also show a higher A(max), and other 'sun-plant' characteristics, as saplings under relatively uniform low light conditions in the forest understory. This prediction follows if the potential for photosynthetic acclimation is finite, and if developmental processes that determine adult-phase physiology also affect the physiology of sapling leaves. We examined relationships between photosynthetic parameters and tree species' stature using comparative data on 28 late-successional species at Pasoh Forest Reserve, West Malaysia. Species chosen for study represent four genera that each include taxa ranging in size from understory treelets to canopy-level trees, thus enabling 'phylogenetically corrected' analyses and stronger inference that observed patterns reflect evolutionary convergence. A(max) of understory saplings, as measured on a leaf area, mass, or nitrogen basis, was positively correlated with asymptotic height (H(max)) reached by mature trees of a given species. These relationships were similar in each of the four main study genera, thus supporting the hypothesis of an evolutionary response in photosynthetic characteristics to the vertical gradient in light availability through the canopy. Understory species also commonly exhibited higher leaf-level photosynthetic rates at low light levels than did canopy species within a given genus; however, such 'crosses' in photosynthetic light response curves were only pronounced when photosynthesis was expressed on a leaf mass basis. Midcanopy leaves from adult trees displayed A(max)(area) values similar to leaves from understory saplings of a given species, while A(max)(mass) values for adult trees were lower than those of saplings. This pattern corresponded to lower values for specific leaf area in adult trees than in saplings, a difference that was systematically greater in larger statured species. In sum, a range of both adult tree and sapling physiological parameters, including photosynthetic capacity, light saturation point, and leaf nitrogen content, may be predicted as a function of asymptotic species height. Previous research on vertical gradients in photosynthetic characteristics of forest trees has focused on proximate mechanisms, such as light acclimation responses and nutrient reallocation within individual tree canopies. The present study documents evolved differences among species that also contribute to the overall pattern of photosynthetic variation within forest canopies.

A model of resource competition predicts that increases in diversity cause community stability to increase, but population stability to decrease. These opposite effects are, to a great extent, explained by how temporal variances in species abundances scale with mean abundance, and by the differential impact of this scaling on population vs. community stability. Community stability also depends on a negative covariance effect (competitive compensation) and on overyielding (ecosystem productivity increasing with diversity). A long-term study in Minnesota grasslands supports these predictions. Models of competition predict, and field experiments confirm, that greater plant diversity leads to greater primary productivity. This diversity-productivity relationship results both from the greater chance that a more productive species would be present at higher diversity (the sampling effect) and from the better 'coverage' of habitat heterogeneity caused by the broader range of species traits in a more diverse community (the niche differentiation effect). Both effects cause more complete utilization of limiting resources at higher diversity, which increases resource retention, further increasing productivity. Finally, lower levels of available limiting resources at higher diversity are predicted to decrease the susceptibility of an ecosystem to invasion, supporting the diversity-invasibility hypothesis. This mechanism provides rules for community assembly and invasion resistance. In total, biodiversity should be added to species composition, disturbance, nutrient supply, and climate as a major controller of population and ecosystem dynamics and structure. By their increasingly great directional impacts on all of these controllers, humans are likely to cause major long-term changes in the functioning of ecosystems worldwide. A better understanding of these ecosystem changes is needed if ecologists are to provide society with the knowledge essential for wise management of the earth and its biological resources.",1439,Journal,cp,Conference Paper,100,1,1,Biodiversity | Community assembly | Covariance effect | Diversity-invasibility hypothesis | Diversity-productivity hypothesis | Diversity-stability hypothesis | Ecosystem functioning | Human-dominated ecosystems | Overyielding effect | Portfolio effect | Productivity | Stability,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,203,NA,NA

On the basis of these studies, it has been concluded that competition for N between plants and microbes is minimized along this seasonal gradient. In this study, we examined more deeply the links between microbial population dynamics and plant N availability in an alpine dry meadow. We conducted a year-round field study and performed experiments on isolated soil microorganisms. Based on previous work in this ecosystem, we hypothesized that microbial biomass would decline before the plant growing season and would release N that would become available to plants. Microbial biomass was highest when soils were cold, in autumn, winter, and early spring. During this time, N was immobilized in microbial biomass. After snow melt in spring, microbial biomass decreased. A peak in the soil protein concentration was seen at this time, followed by peaks in soil amino acid and ammonium concentrations in late June. Soil protease rates were initially high after snow melt, decreased to below detection limits by midsummer, and partially recovered by late summer. Proteolytic activity in soil was saturated early in the growing season and became protein limited later in the summer. We concluded that the key event controlling N availability to alpine plants occurs after snow melt, when protein is released from the winter microbial biomass. This protein pulse provides substrate for soil proteases, which supply plants with amino acids during the growing season. On average, microbial biomass was lower in the summer than at other times, although the biomass fluctuated widely during the summer. Within the summer months, maximum numbers of amino-acid-degrading microorganisms and the maximum amount of microbial biomass coincided with the peak in soil amino acids, when plants are most active.

Siphonalean green algae often dominate the standing stocks and productivity of Caribbean mangrove island environs and are also abundant in virtually all calm-water reef habitats. The experimental organism Avrainvillea longicaulis is particularly abundant in the study sites west of Carrie Bow Cay and Curlew Cay, Belize. The recycling of protoplasm out of older epiphytically impaired blades of A. longicaulis, and simultaneous formation of apical siphon extensions elsewhere, leads to rapid proliferation of new bladeshypothetically, at relatively low energy cost to the plant. The rapidity of siphon extension occurs at least an order of magnitude faster than that possible by photosynthetic production alone, resulting in fully formed proliferations within 3 d. At the same time, the older epiphytized blades become empty, first at the tips, then progressively toward the holdfast, appearing translucent-brown and flaccid within 3 d, followed by senescence. We hypothesize that A. longicaulis rapidly responds to epiphyte colonization/impairment by reallocating protoplasm for new growth through protoplasmic streaming. The alternative hypothesis, that the herbivorous crab Thersandrus compressus might beneficially control epiphytes on A. longicaulis, was falsified by its strong negative effects (i.e., decreased growth and increased host mortality). The hypothesis that allelopathic secondary chemicals may play an antifouling role also was not supported by our experiments; i.e., the consistently vigorous growth rates of the five dominant epiphyte species attached to A. longicaulis were not significantly less than populations of the same species attached to carbonate rock. All of the manipulative results (i.e., experimental induction of blade abandonment followed by new proliferation), as well as the populational survey findings (i.e., greater proliferation by epiphytized plants) and physiological data (i.e., photosynthetic inhibition by epiphytes), support the blade abandonment/proliferation hypothesis, thereby documenting an effective epiphyte-control strategy.",45,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Avrainvillea | Belize | Coral reefs | Epiphytism | Seagrass beds | Siphonalean algae | Thersandrus compressus,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,205,NA,NA

Observations of BCI mammals have been compiled for 49 years. Frugivorous mammals experienced famine between September and January in 1931-1932, 1958-1959, 1970-1971, and 1993-1994. The most recent famine is evident from an 11-yr record of natural deaths of mammals and a 2-yr record of population densities. Famine occurred every time a mild dry season followed an El Nino event in the 49-yr record. This coincidence is statistically improbable, as demonstrated by a randomization test. A 2-yr cycle of high, then low community-level fruit production has been observed twice for BCI when a mild dry season followed an El Nino event. We used 260 litter traps to monitor community- and species-level fruit production from 1 January 1987 through 30 June 1996. Community-level fruit production was greatest during the 1992 El Nino event and lowest one year later, after the mild 1993 dry season. We also reinterpret an earlier 2-yr record of fruit production in light of our 9.5-yr record of fruit production. Community-level fruit production was elevated during the 1969 El Nino event and was very low one year later, after the mild 1970 dry season. We hypothesize that (1) El Nino conditions enhance fruit production; (2) high fruit production consumes stored reserves, limiting the next reproductive event; and (3) mild dry seasons reduce fruit production. Each plant species may respond to any combination of the three components of this hypothesis. Community-level fruit production is extremely low when species sensitive to components 1 and 2 are entrained with species sensitive to component 3, or when a mild dry season follows one year after an El Nino event. El Nino events bring dry, sunny conditions to BCI and a large portion of the wet tropics. Drought and sun may both favor fruit production in wet tropical forests. Drought is known to synchronize flowering, and sunny conditions may relieve light limitation. The El Nino Southern Oscillation has a strong 24-mo periodicity. This creates a strong tendency for dry, sunny years to alternate with wet, cloudy years in Central America and elsewhere in the tropics. We present evidence that this alternately enhances and reduces fruit production on BCI. Terborgh hypothesized that predators regulate frugivorous mammals in tropical forests. As a corollary, he further hypothesized that famines occur on BCI because several large predators are absent and frugivores escape predation. We extended censuses to the nearby mainland to evaluate this hypothesis. Poachers, who are active on the mainland, reduce the abundances of game species below levels maintained in the presence of large felids and raptors. There was evidence for famine in poached, mainland populations, and we rejected the hypothesis that reduced predation pressure is a prerequisite for famine.",285,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,"Barro Colorado Island, Republic of Panama | Ciurus granatensis | Dasyprocta punctata | El Nino Southern Oscillation | Famine | Fruit and seed production | Mazama americana | Nasua narica | Odocoileus virginianus | Panama | Tayassu tajacu | Tropical forest",20308,undefined,0,FALSE,206,NA,NA

In this study, we show that the coral Oculina arbuscula persists on reefs in temperate North Carolina where seaweeds are common by harboring the omnivorous crab Mithrax forceps, which removes seaweeds and invertebrates growing on or near the coral. In the field, corals from which crabs are experimentally removed develop a dense cover of epibionts, exhibiting reduced growth and increased mortality relative to corals with crabs, which remain epibiont-free. This crab is unusual in that it readily consumes all local seaweeds in laboratory choice assays and is not deterred by chemical defenses that suppress feeding by local fishes, sea urchins, and other crabs. This allows Mithrax to defend corals from overgrowth by chemically noxious seaweeds like Dictyota and Sargassum that are avoided by most local herbivores. However, further field manipulations under reduced light conditions demonstrate that the outcome of the crab-coral interaction is context-dependent: crabs only benefit corals in well-lit areas where seaweeds are abundant. Field observations and tethering experiments show that, by living in association with Oculina, Mithrax gains a refuge from predation. Additionally, crabs grow faster when associated with live corals than with structurally equivalent dead corals, apparently because they are able to consume lipid-rich coral mucus. This mucus provides a dietary supplement that may help corals attract and retain low-mobility symbionts such as Mithrax, securing for the coral long-term and predictable protection against competitors. Structurally complex but competitively inferior organisms, like some corals and coralline algae, provide the biogenic habitat complexity upon which many other species depend. Because these sessile organisms may be dependent on symbionts to remove superior competitors, mutualisms can play an important, but currently underappreciated, role in structuring marine communities where biotic interactions are intense. In this study, the mutualism between Oculina and Mithrax promotes the persistence of both species in habitats from which they might otherwise be excluded by competition and predation.",85,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Associational escape | Chemical defense | Competition | Context-dependent interactions | Coral | Crab | Mithrax | Mutualism | Oculina | Predation | Seaweed | Temperate reef,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,208,all,All Open Access

In this paper, we examine the effect of plant species interactions on the maintenance of plant species number across intertidal zones characterized by different soil conditions in a New England salt marsh community. In this system, plant species number is low in the high intertidal and lower middle intertidal, and high in the upper middle intertidal. To understand the causes of this unimodal pattern of change in species diversity, we experimentally tested for the influence of competition, facilitation, and physical factors across this physical gradient. We established plots with and without plant neighbors, transplanted plant species into these plots, and measured mortality, leaf area, and flower number for a single growing season. We found that competition plays a more important role in the high intertidal habitat by decreasing leaf area and flower production and causing 100% mortality of one of the species tested. In contrast, physical factors are critical in the lower middle intertidal, causing 100% mortality of three of the four species tested, with or without neighbor interactions. In the upper middle intertidal, direct positive interactions were important to the higher species number. Three of the four species had 100% mortality without neighbors but minimal mortality or leaf area loss with neighbors. These positive effects were due to one particular facilitator species, Juncus gerardi L., which ameliorates the soil conditions that develop in its absence thus allowing other species to co-occur. Without Juncus, our data predict that plant species number would not be as high in the upper middle intertidal. We show that the rise in species number in the upper middle intertidal is dependent on three co-occurring conditions: the absence of a competitive dominant, less harsh physical conditions than the lower middle intertidal, and the presence of a facilitator species.",121,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Atriplex patula | Compensatory Mortality Hypothesis | Competition | Direct positive interactions | Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis | Iva frutescens | Juncus gerardi | Limonium nashii | New England | Physical stress | Salt marsh | Solidago sempervirens | Species diversity,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,209,NA,NA

From a comprehensive analysis of the spatial pattern of a plant population and its environment, we infer scenarios of links between demographic processes, plant spatial patterns, and environmental heterogeneity. The palm tree Borassus aethiopum has easily identifiable demographic stages, a root foraging strategy enabling adults to reach distant nutrient sources, and a marked senescence starting with the onset of reproduction. We analyzed map data for palm individuals (in three different life history stages plus two sexes for adults) and for nutrient-rich patches (clumps of other tree species and termite mounds) in three vegetation types (facies) of a humid savanna of West Africa (Lamto, Ivory Coast). Spatial analyses were based on Diggle's nearest neighbor functions F and G and on Ripley's K function. The main results were as follows: (1) juveniles and seedlings are aggregated, while adults have a random pattern or are more loosely aggregated; (2) all stages except female adults are spatially associated with nutrient-rich patches, but association distances increase with stage in the life cycle; and (3) seedlings are associated with female adults, whereas the association of juveniles at longer distances is not clear-cut. We propose from these results a parsimonious scenario linking spatial pattern and mortality pattern during the life cycle. The initial pattern of seedlings (close to maternal trees) results from low dispersal distance. Later stages (older seedlings and juveniles) are mostly restricted to nutrient-rich patches through nutrient shortage away from these patches (environment-induced mortality) and form dense clumps of immature palms. Competition on nutrient-rich patches then favors the few juveniles that manage to survive farther from these patches (density-dependent mortality). Finally, the last surviving juvenile of a clump suddenly experiences almost no competition with conspecifics, due to the long distance between clumps of juveniles, and owing to its root-foraging ability, it can now recruit to the adult stage, subject only to senescence. Pattern variations among savanna facies are consistent with this scenario.",231,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Borassus aethiopum | Density-dependent mortality | Diggle's nearest neighbor tests | Distance-dependent mortality | Intraspecific competition | Population dynamics | Ripley's K function | Root foraging | Seed dispersal | Soil patchiness | Spatial association,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,211,NA,NA

The two consumers differ in their foraging behavior and their ability to remove microalgae from rock surfaces. T. eisini is a digger, moving slowly and grazing the algae down to almost bare substrate, whereas T. aureotincta is a grazer, moving more quickly and leaving behind a larger fraction of the algal layer. These complementary foraging strategies result in a size-structured algal resource, with each size class differentially accessible to each of the consumers. Our model recognized three accessibility states for an algal patch: a refuge (recently grazed by the digger and currently inaccessible to either consumer), a low level (exploitable only by the digger), and a high level (exploitable by both consumers). We assumed that all interactions between consumers and resources were linear and examined the relatively short time-scale dynamics of feeding, algal renewal, and individual consumer growth at fixed densities of consumers. Thus, our model complemented related models that have focused on population dynamics rather than foraging behavior. The model revealed that coexistence of two consumers feeding on a single algal resource can be mediated by differences in the consumers' foraging modes and the resource structure that these behaviors create. We then estimated model parameters using data from Schmitt's experimental studies of Tegula. The fits to the experimental data were all very good, and the resulting parameter values placed the system very close to a narrow coexistence region, demonstrating that foraging complementarity in this system facilitates coexistence. The foraging trade-offs observed here are likely to be common in many consumer-resource systems. Indeed, mechanisms similar to those we discuss have been suggested in many other systems in which similar consumers also coexist. This model not only demonstrates that such an argument is theoretically plausible, but also provides the first application of the model, showing that the observed conditions for the Tegula system fall very close to the appropriate parameter space.

Coefficients of variation increased over successional time and were consistently greater for nitrate-nitrogen than for soluble reactive phosphorus. Semi-variogram analysis showed that nutrient concentrations were spatially dependent on all dates, but to different degrees and over different distances. The distance over which nutrient concentrations were spatially dependent, as measured by the semi-variogram range, tended to decrease with successional time. The strength of spatial dependence, as measured by the slope of the ascending limb of the semivariogram, increased with successional time.

We evaluated differences in the drought experienced and drought tolerance among the subspecies. Drought tolerance was measured by two traits: the xylem pressure (Ψ(x)) causing xylem cavitation and Ψ(x) causing loss of leaf turgor (Ψ(dp)). As expected from habitat, ssp. wyomingensis experienced a more severe summer drought than ssp. vaseyana (minimum Ψ(x) = -7.5 MPa and -3.8 MPa, respectively). Despite the large difference in drought exposure, the subspecies exhibited similar drought responses, including a reduction in transpiration (E) below 0.5 mmol·s-1·m-2, a shedding of 60-65% of foliage, and >95% decline in soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance. The similarity in the drought response was consistent with pronounced differences in Ψ(x), causing 50% loss in xylem conductivity by cavitation (Ψ50). The Ψ50 was -4.9 MPa in ssp. wyomingensis vs. -3.0 MPa in ssp. vaseyana; ssp. tridentata was intermediate (Ψ50 = -3.9 MPa). Differences in cavitation resistance were preserved in a common garden, suggesting that they arose by genetic differentiation. A water transport model indicated that the greater cavitation resistance in ssp. wyomingensis was a necessary adaptation for its more arid habitat, and that the similar restrictions of E among subspecies were required to avoid hydraulic failure. The Ψ(dp) was also lower in ssp. wyomingensis than in ssp. vaseyana. Although Ψ(dp) decreased in both subspecies during drought, the adjustment was not sufficient to maintain turgor.

Recently a number of ecologists have attempted to clarify the concepts of 'strong-' and 'weak-interactors' in a community, and to derive techniques for quantifying interaction strengths in the field, using metrics that are consistent, comparable, and of relevance to theoreticians. In this paper, we examine potential biases in different empirical approaches to quantifying variation in interaction strengths within and among natural communities. Using both simulated and published data, we explore the behavior of four commonly used or recently proposed empirical measures of the strength of consumer-prey interactions. The type of index used, the experimental protocol, and the underlying model of predator-prey interaction all strongly influence one's perception of both (1) the distribution of interaction strengths among species (e.g., presence of 'keystone' species), and (2) the specific identity of the interactions that appear to be most important. Raw treatment differences tend to emphasize effects on very abundant prey, while the three proportional indices tend to emphasize effects on extremely rare prey. Two of the proportional indices are inherently asymmetric about zero, and they inflate positive or negative effects, respectively. When predators exhibit a saturating functional response, the three proportional measures of per capita effect are biased toward a skewed distribution of interaction strengths dominated by effects on the rarest prey. Predator interference causes the per capita measures to emphasize the effects of rare predators. Estimates of per capita effects are also problematic when (1) the per capita effects are back-calculated from experiments designed to measure collective effects (e.g., predator exclusions), and (2) the collective effect of a predator is constant across a wide range of predator densities, as may be common for keystone predators. Finally, since all of the indices show time-dependent behavior, they are differentially suited for different experimental protocols (e.g., short-term vs. long-term results, or community initially near vs. far from equilibrium). All the indices explored here have the potential to provide useful, complementary information about ecological impacts of species in natural communities. In this analysis, we attempt to clarify what each index actually measures and the conditions under which each is most revealing.",187,Journal,ar,Article,100,5,5,Density dependence | Food web | Functional response | Interaction strength | Keystone species | Per capita effects | Predator-prey interaction | Simulation | Species impact | Species interactions,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,219,NA,NA

Thirty-two of these ponds had been surveyed previously between 1967 and 1974. We found that the distributions of amphibian populations (1988-1992) were strongly related to two habitat characteristics: pond hydroperiod and forest canopy cover. Most species exhibited nonrandom distributions with respect to these pond characteristics. Between surveys, the distribution of each species changed, and most species experienced multiple population colonizations and extinctions. Turnover in the distribution of populations among ponds (estimated via Jaccard's similarity coefficient) averaged nearly 50% among species. The substantial number of species colonizations (40 cases) and extinctions (34 cases) between surveys resulted in little net change in number of breeding populations for most species; just four species experienced net changes of more than two populations. Historical information indicated that, for many ponds, hydroperiod and canopy cover changed between surveys. In several cases habitat changes associated with forest succession apparently had negative impacts on amphibian populations. In ponds that now dry each summer and are under closed canopies, two-thirds of the breeding populations present during 1967-1974 were extinct during the recent survey. No population colonizations occurred in these ponds between surveys, in marked contrast to other ponds, in most of which amphibian species richness either was maintained or increased. In addition, tendencies for ponds to experience population colonizations and extinctions also were associated with pond isolation.

The resident antlions (Myrmeleon immaculatus) at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, Michigan, USA, seldom relocated their pits, and we wondered whether this site fidelity could be understood as an optimal (or near-optimal) response to observed spatial and temporal variation in prey availability. To determine this, we considered a large number of compound foraging strategies, each composed of the number of days over which the antlion evaluates foraging success at a site, weighted-average foraging success during this interval, below which threshold the antlion moves to a new site; and the length of the random walk taken by the antlion to a new pit location. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we determined the expected net energy gain from each of these strategies by antlions rewarded according to the field data set. The overall highest gain strategy generally agreed with our a priori expectations for the observed pattern of patchiness in prey availability over space and time. Moreover, the corresponding optimal frequency of pit relocation, 1.65 moves over the observation period of ~8 wk, is in rough agreement with field observations. However, the gain surface was relatively flat: 60% of the investigated strategies yielded within 8% of the maximum gain. When costs of pit relocation were reduced, maximal gain strategies shifted to generate frequent movement, suggesting that thee magnitude of such sampling costs may control the foraging strategy in environments with high spatiotemporal variability.",25,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Antlions | Autocorrelation | Energy gain strategy | Monte Carlo simulation | Myrmeleon immaculatus | Neuropterans | Optimal foraging | Pit traps | Sampling costs | Sit-and-wait predation | Spatiotemporal variability,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,221,NA,NA

Areas in the highest P-enriched zones (>1000 mgP/kg), once dominated by open-water sloughs and surrounding monocultures of sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense, a stress-tolerant low-nutrient-status species), are now dominated by cattail (Typha domingensis, a competitive, high-nutrient-status species). Areas of moderate (750-500 mg/kg) and low (<500 mg/kg) P soil concentrations have maintained their original plant composition. Analysis of nutrient-use efficiency indicates that sawgrass is highly efficient in nutrient resorption and nutrient proficiency, but this efficiency decreases at high soil P concentrations. Both indices indicate that suboptimal concentrations of P, which limit growth and optimize retention of P within the plant, exist in the Everglades. This information, when coupled with the low levels of P found in the plants, soil, and pore water of the unenriched portions of the Everglades, indicates that this ecosystem is extremely P limited. High molar N:P leaf ratios suggested P limitations for sawgrass at unenriched sites, but not in highly enriched areas. Intermediate P loadings resulted in either N or P limitations. Increased leaf P concentrations correspond to decreased phenolic content of sawgrass leaves, suggesting that this species' metabolic growth response follows the carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis of decreased production of phenolics with increased nutrient supply.

We linked leaf-level nutrient dynamics with leaf-litter decomposition and explored how the observed patterns were reflected in nutrient cycling at the ecosystem level. Comparisons were made among growth forms (evergreen and deciduous shrubs and trees, graminoids and Sphagnum mosses) and between mire types (fens and bogs). A literature review showed that the predominant growth form was more important as a determinant of leaf-level nutrient-use efficiency (NUE) than mire type (fen vs. bog). Evergreens had the highest N and p use efficiency. The growth form differences in NUE were mainly determined by differences in N and P concentrations in mature leaves and not by differences in resorption efficiency from senescing leaves. Sphagnum leaves had lower N and P concentrations than the other growth forms, but because of a lack of data on nutrient resorption efficiency the NUE of these mosses could not be calculated. Nitrogen use efficiency did not differ among fen and bog species, whereas bog species had a higher P use efficiency than fen species. However, a complete evaluation of mire-type or growth-form effects on NUE is only possible when data become available about nutrient resorption from senescing Sphagnum leaves. As leaf-level NUE is negatively correlated with leaf-litter nutrient concentrations, there is a direct link between NUE and litter decomposition rate. Rates of litter decomposition of Sphagnum mosses are lower than in the other growth forms, but there is still much speculation about possible reasons. The role of litter chemistry of Sphagnum mosses (including decay inhibitors and decay-resistant compounds) in decomposition especially warrants further study. The strongly deviating nutritional ecology of Sphagnum mosses clearly distinguishes fens and bogs from other ecosystems. Moreover, N and P concentrations in mature leaves from vascular plant species from fens and bogs are in almost all cases lower and leaf-level N use efficiency is higher than in species from other ecosystems, irrespective of the growth form considered. Both literature data and data from a comparative study on soil nutrient cycling in temperate fens and bogs in the United States (Maryland), The Netherlands, and Poland showed that nutrient mineralization did not differ clearly between fens and bogs. The comparative study further showed that cellulose decomposition in bogs was lower than in fens and that nutrient mineralization was higher in forested than in herbaceous mires. The occurrence of dominant growth forms was clearly related to soil nutrient-cycling processes, and observed patterns were in agreement with patterns in the components of NUE as found in the literature study. We conclude that a protocol with standardized procedures for measuring various nutrient-cycling process rates that is used by scientists in various wetland types and geographical regions is a useful tool for unravelling large-scale patterns in soil nutrient-cycling processes in wetlands and for linking plant-mediated nutrient dynamics with ecosystem nutrient-cycling processes.",273,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,Bogs | Climate control of nutrient cycling | Decomposition | Evergreen | Fens | Leaf life-span | Litter chemistry effects on decomposition | Mineralization | Nutrient cycling | Nutrient resorption | Nutrient-use efficiency | Sphagnum | Temperate,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,223,NA,NA

The empirical results for aphids indicate that within species, individuals of different sizes may not be structurally identical; large individuals appear to have proportionally smaller wings, and as theory predicts, appear to compensate for this by having proportionally larger wing muscles than small individuals. Interspecifically, aphids appear to be structurally identical both in terms of wing area, wing beat frequency, and in the relative size of the thorax. As predicted both intra- and interspecifically, large migrants, although having larger gonads, nevertheless have proportionally smaller gonads than small migrants.

The common practice of quantifying CO2 responses as a single 'response ratio' thus obscures two qualitatively distinct kinds of effects. The present experiment examines effects of elevated CO2 on both early and asymptotic growth parameters in eight C3 herbaceous plant species (Abutilon theophrasti, Cassia obtusifolia, Plantago major, Rumex crispus, Taraxacum officinale, Dactylis glomerata, Lolium multifiorum, and Panicum dichotomoflorum). Plants were grown for 118-172 d in a factorial design of CO2 (350 and 700 μL/L) and plant density (individually grown vs. high-density monocultures) under edaphic conditions approximating those of coastal areas in Massachusetts. For Abutilon theophrasti, intraspecific patterns of plant response were also assessed using eight genotypes randomly sampled from a natural population and propagated as inbred lines. The species and genotypes examined generally showed enhanced early relative growth rates (RGR) under elevated CO2; however, such early growth responses did not necessarily correspond to increases in asymptotic size. As a result, interspecific and genetic correlations between early RGR enhancements and asymptotic size enhancements were weak. Effects of elevated CO2 also varied systematically among the size metrics examined. The maximum leaf area attained by individually grown plants was generally reduced under elevated CO2; however, most species showed positive effects of CO2 on vegetative mass at final harvest. Final biomass responses were greatest in species showing large enhancements in root growth. In addition, CO2 responses of plants grown in dense monocultures differed from plants grown individually, showing reduced responses for both early RGR and final biomass. Average reproductive responses to elevated CO2 were positive for individually grown plants, but negative for dense monocultures. It has previously been suggested that differences in species' growth rates may be the best single predictor of plant growth responses to CO2. Here we found that RGR (at ambient CO2) appeared to limit potential early growth responses among species, but that there was no such relationship between RGR and asymptotic size responses. We suggest that the latter may be determined in part by the degree to which large carbon sinks are formed late in plant ontogeny. The overall pattern of early and asymptotic growth responses to elevated CO2 varied widely both among and within species, and we found little evidence for the existence of discrete 'functional types.' We argue that both early and asymptotic responses are of fundamental interest from a modeling and a physiological perspective.

In this paper, we show that intermittent rarity can arise in simple community models as a result of competitive interactions within and between species. Intermittently rare species are typified as weak invaders in fluctuating communities. Although the dynamics of intermittent rarity are highly irregular, the distribution of time spent in phases of rarity ('rarity times') involves strong regularity. Specifically, intermittent rarity is governed by a well-defined power law. The scaling exponent (-3/2) is a universal feature of intermittent rarity: it does not depend on species demographic parameters; it is insensitive to environmental stochasticity; and the same exponent is found in very different models of nonstructured populations. The distribution of rarity times implies that the dynamics of rarity have no characteristic time scale. Yet, in practice, the universal scaling law offers a general form of prediction, in which one can calculate the frequency of occurrence of rarity phases of any given duration. Data on marine fish communities support the prediction of a -3/2 power law underlying the dynamics of intermittently rare species.

Although theory predicts that these interactions may be common in assemblages of three or more competitors, experimental studies of this process are rare. Here, I report a study of a northern California riparian community, where I tested the hypothesis that the sedge Carex nudata had direct competitive effects on other plant species, as well as indirect facilitative effects, by suppressing a second competitor, the common monkey-flower Mimulus guttatus. Results of a field experiment, in which I manipulated the presence of Carex and M. guttatus in a factorial design, uncovered three qualitatively different interactions between Carex and three target species. I found evidence of indirect facilitation for the liverwort Conocephalum conicum, such that Carex 'facilitated' Conocephalum in the presence of M. guttatus, while Carex competed with Conocephalum in the absence of M. guttatus. Plant distribution patterns supported the widespread occurrence of this interaction. Carex also had an indirect positive effect on the scarlet monkey-flower M. cardinalis, though the magnitude of this effect was similar to direct Carex competition. Lastly, Carex had no influence on the moss Brachythecium frigidum. The mechanisms underlying the plant interactions in this study are discussed and incorporated into a general hypothesis that indirect facilitation among competitors is most important in assemblages of species that vary in competitive mechanism.",172,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Carex | Competition and facilitation | Facilitation in plant communities | Indirect effects | Mimulus | Plant competition | Riparian plant communities | Species diversity,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,231,NA,NA

We explore the effect of trophic rank upon the 'strength' of the species-area relationship, as measured by z, the slope of a log(species) vs. log(area) plot. We present a simple model for communities closed to immigration, composed of 'stacked specialist' food chains (where each plant species supports a specialist herbivore, which in turn sustains a specialist carnivore, etc.), that predicts z should increase with trophic rank; the model brings out some of the spatial implications of sequential dependencies among species. We discuss empirical examples in which the z values of taxa differing in trophic rank were reported and lament the shortage of well-documented examples in the ecological literature. Several examples fit the expected pattern, but others do not. We outline several additional reasons why z values might increase with trophic rank, even for generalists. If the qualitative assumptions of the model are relaxed, the predicted effect of trophic rank on z should weaken or even be reversed. Trophic rank may not have a systematic effect on the species-area relationship if (1) there are strong top-down interactions leading to prey extinctions; (2) communities are open, with recurrent immigration, particularly at higher trophic ranks; (3) consumers are facultative generalists, able to exist on a wide range of resource species; or (4) systems are far from equilibrium. Our aim in this thought piece is to stimulate community ecologists to link theoretical and empirical studies of food web structure with analyses of spatial dynamics and landscape ecology, and to encourage empirical studies of the species-area relationship focused on comparisons across taxa varying in trophic rank.",347,Journal,ar,Article,100,4,4,Distribution | Generalist | Island | Patch | Specialist | Specialist vs. generalist food webs | Species-area | Trophic rank and species-area relationship,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,232,all,All Open Access

We measured the effects of a nectar-robbing bumble bee, Bombus occidentalis, on male and female reproductive success of Ipomopsis aggregata (Polemoniaceae). We artificially varied nectar-robbing rates within 20 natural I. aggregata populations in Colorado. Using powdered fluorescent dyes as pollen analogs, we estimated the amount of pollen donated (male fitness component) and the amount of pollen received (female fitness component) by plants with different levels of nectar robbing. We also measured percentage fruit set per plant, seed set per fruit, and average seed mass as additional components of female fitness. Nectar robbing significantly decreased both male and female fitness components. Heavy nectar robbing (>80% of available flowers robbed) significantly decreased dye donation, pollen receipt, and average number of seeds per fruit at the whole-plant level. Furthermore, nectar robbing significantly decreased dye donation by individual flowers. Although nectar robbing has often been regarded as unimportant to plant reproductive success, we document significant effects of nectar robbing on components of both male and female fitness of I. aggregata. Our results suggest that interactions among nectar robbers, pollinators, and their plant hosts may have important consequences for plant fitness.",123,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,Bombus occidentalis | Cheating behavior | Hummingbirds | Ipomopsis aggregata | Nectar robbery | Pollen donation | Pollen receipt | Reproductive success,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,233,NA,NA

Using data from the literature for 184 sites around the world, I found that nature reserves had one-half of the exotic fraction of sites outside reserves, and island sites had nearly three times the exotic fraction of mainland sites. However, the exotic fraction and the number of exotics were also dependent on site area, and this had to be taken into account to make valid comparisons between sites. The number of native species was used as a surrogate for site area and habitat diversity. Nearly 70% of the variation in the number of exotic species was accounted for by a multiple regression containing the following predictors: the number of native species, whether the site was an island or on the mainland, and whether or not it was a nature reserve. After controlling for scale, there were significant differences among biomes, but not continents, in their level of invasion. Multiple biome regions and temperate agricultural or urban sites were among the most invaded biomes, and deserts and savannas were among the least. However, there was considerable within-group variation in the mean degree of invasion. Scale-controlled analysis also showed that the New World is significantly more invaded than the Old World, but only when site native richness (probably a surrogate for habitat diversity) is factored out. Contrary to expectation, communities richer in native species had more, not fewer, exotics. For mainland sites, the degree of invasion increased with latitude, but there was no such relationship for islands. Although islands are more invaded than mainland sites, this is apparently not because of low native species richness, as the islands in this data set were no less rich in native species than were mainland sites of similar area. The number of exotic species in nature reserves increases with the number of visitors. However, it is difficult to draw conclusions about relative invasibility, invasion potential, or the roles of dispersal and disturbance from any of these results. Most of the observed patterns here and in the literature could potentially be explained by differences between regions in species properties, ecosystem properties, or propagule pressure.",1481,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,Dispersal | Disturbance | Exotic species | Extinction | Immigration | Invasibility | Islands | Nature reserves | Plant invasions | Propagule pressure | Weeds,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,234,NA,NA
