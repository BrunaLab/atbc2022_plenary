Within 2 km of the primary smelter, up to 8% Zn, 1500 ppm Cd, 1200 ppm Cu and 1100 ppm Pb by weight were found at the surface of the A1 soil horizon. Washed, oven dried foliage of trees located near the smelters contained up to 4,500 ppm Zn and 70 ppm Cd by weight. The Lehigh Gap area of Blue Mountain near the smelters is sparsely vegetated or completely barren over an area of about 485 ha. Forests in burned and unburned areas were sampled for density and cover of tree, shrub, and herb species. Sassafras albidum and Nyssa sylvatica are the most common tree species in the burned, severely denuded areas: Arenaria patula is the most common herb. Very few tree seedlings are found near the smelters. Species which normally invade burned areas, including Populus tremuloides, Betula populifolia, Comptonia peregrina, and Pteridium aquilinum, are rare or absent at Lehigh Gap. Inhibition of seed germination and/or seedling growth by high levels of soil Zn is probably preventing establishment of these invader species. Quercus rubra and Pinus strobus seedlings planted in pots of high Zn soil collected near the smelters produced much less root and shoot growth than normal. Minimum toxic foliar levels for Q. rubra are approximately 250 ppm Zn and between 5 and 30 ppm Cd. Arenaria patula tolerated 100 ppm Zn in sand culture and a foliar content of 13,000 ppm Zn, and is probably a zinc tolerant ecotype. Solution concentrations of up to 100 ppm Zn and 10 ppm Cd did not affect seed germination of Q. rubra, B. populifolia, and P. tremuloides, but at these metal concentrations the radicle fails to elongate. Radicle elongation occurs, but is significantly reduced, at ≥ 1 ppm Zn or ≥ 5 ppm Cd in solution culture. Saturation extracts of soils collected 1-5 km from the smelter contained 40-1.6 ppm Zn and 1.0-0.02 ppm Cd; thus only the Zn content of soils within 5 km of the smelter appears high enough to stunt root growth. The combined stresses of high soil zinc levels plus fire appear to be the primary cause of the vegetation damage at Lehigh Gap. Either stress alone would have caused much less damage. Erosion and desiccation are important secondary factors preventing revegetation of the barren areas.",44,Journal,ar,Article,100,1,1,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,1

Heavenly Valley Creek showed significant increases in NO3-1 N and ultraviolet absorbance increases were traceable to subsurface discharge from the sprayed area. Evidence indicated that substances present in the spray area discharge and the streamwater are inhibitory to algal photosynthesis at in situ concentrations. This effect may be due in part to NO3-1 N which undoubtedly becomes stimulatory through dilution in the lake. Discharge from the spray area can be traced into Lake Tahoe by following patterns of UV absorbance which correlate closely with patterns of primary productivity. This correlation, combined with estimates of continuing heavy NO3-1 N loading of Lake Tahoe by Heavenly Valley Creek, reveals the long term impact of land disposal of effluent on the ultra oligotrophic lake.",4,Journal,ar,Article,100,3,3,20308,undefined,0,FALSE,2
