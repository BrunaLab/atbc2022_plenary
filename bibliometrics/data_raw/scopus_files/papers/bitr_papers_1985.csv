Defoliation levels averaged 5.5% on mature leaves. Herbivory on mature leaves was significantly negatively correlated with total leaf phenols. These chemicals may be deterring herbivory on pioneer and gap leaves, but a more likely primary cause is that total phenols are higher in plants in direct light than in those in shade conditions.-from Authors",29,Journal,ar,Article,100,2,2,13817,undefined,0,FALSE,26
