AB The evolution of delayed dispersal and reproduction in cooperative breeders can be viewed as selection between alternative life-history tactics: (1) stay-and-foray (SAF), in which individuals delay dispersal and reproduction and compete for breeding vacancies in the vicinity of the natal territory, and (2) depart-and-search (DAS), in which individuals disperse soon after fledging to wander in search of a breeding vacancy. Using demographic data collected from red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis), we evaluated a demographic model of the evolution of delayed dispersal and reproduction based on selection between these tactics. Because males of this species exhibit both tactics regularly, we could estimate all model parameters directly. Our estimates provide empirical support for key assumptions of demographic models of the evolution of delayed dispersal and reproduction, such as a disparity in survival between those adopting SAF and those adopting DAS during the first year of life, a low rate of successful dispersal in those practicing DAS, and low reproductive success at early ages among breeders. We show, in a population in which the fate of dispersers could be documented, that the fitness of individuals delaying dispersal and reproduction can equal or exceed that of individuals attempting early reproduction, even without indirect fitness benefits due to helping behavior.

AB The existence of elevated metabolic loads associated with the detoxification of plant allelochemicals has been proposed to be an important selective force in the evolution of dietary specialization of herbivorous insects. In this study we have examined the effects of one host plant toxin (nicotine) and three nonhost plant toxins (xanthotoxin, precocene II, and canavanine) on the growth and energy metabolism of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera: Sphingidae).
   Although M. sexta has three mechanisms for reducing the toxic effects of nicotine, nicotine has a dose-dependent growth-inhibiting effect on third-instar larvae at dietary concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 8.0%. Thus, herbivory by adapted species, as well as nonadapted species, can potentially select for higher levels of defensive chemicals in plants. At higher concentrations, where the effects of nicotine are most pronounced, growth reduction is associated with reduced consumption (which reduces the amount of food assimilated) and an increase in the duration of the instar (which increases the amount of the assimilate pool that must be allocated to maintenance metabolism), thus leaving less assimilate for allocation to growth. The respiration rates of larvae on diets containing up to 1% nicotine are the same as the respiration rates of larvae on nicotine-free diets, while the respiration rates of larvae on diets containing 4 to 8% nicotine are lower than those of larvae on the nicotine-free diet. Thus, the processing of nicotine does not impose a significant metabolic cost on M. sexta larvae, and it is invalid to infer increased metabolic costs of detoxification from the observation of concomitant decreases in growth rate (GR or RGR) and the efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) of larvae on toxin-containing diets.
   In a manner similar to nicotine, the growth-reducing effects of the nonhost plant toxins (xanthotoxin, precocene II, and canavanine) can be explained on the basis of their effects on consumption and the duration of the third instar. In no case is growth reduction a consequence of an increase in metabolic rate. Instead, reductions in growth result from the diversion of assimilate from growth to energy metabolism mandated by a longer instar, and from decreases in the size of the assimilate pool resulting from decreases in consumption and/or assimilation. Thus, the effects of allelochemicals on the energy budget of M. sexta result from their activity as metabolic toxins and feeding deterrents reducing rates of growth and consumption, and not from their diversion of energy from growth to allelochemical processing.
   We conclude that (1) the processing of host plant allelochemicals does not impose a significant energy demand on Manduca sexta and (2) the energy costs of allelochemical processing are unlikely either to constrain the expansion or to drive the contraction of the host plant range of M. sexta. Therefore, we suggest that the concept of metabolic load is not a useful one in understanding the effects of plant allelochemicals on the growth and efficiency of food utilization or in explaining the evolution of dietary specialization of lepidopteran herbivores.

AB We used bacteria to study experimentally the process of genetic adaptation to environmental temperature. Replicate lines of Escherichia coli, founded from a common ancestor, were propagated for 2,000 generations in 4 different thermal regimes as 4 experimental groups: constant 32, 37, or 42-degrees-C (thermal specialists), or a daily alternation between 32 and 42-degrees-C (32/42-degrees-C: thermal generalists). The ancestor had previously been propagated at 37-degrees-C for 2,000 generations. Adaptation of the groups to temperature was measured by improvement in fitness relative to the ancestor, as estimated by competition experiments. All four experimental groups showed improved relative fitness in their own thermal environment (direct response of fitness). However, rates of fitness improvement varied greatly among temperature groups. The 42-degrees-C group responded most rapidly and extensively, followed by the 32 and 32/42-degrees-C groups, whose fitness improvements were indistinguishable. The 37-degrees-C group, which experienced the ancestral temperature, had the slowest and least extensive fitness improvement. The correlated fitness responses of each group, again relative to the common ancestor, were measured over the entire experimental range of temperatures. No necessary tradeoff between direct and correlated responses of fitness was apparent: for example, the improved fitness of the 42-degrees-C group at 42-degrees-C was not accompanied by a loss of fitness at 37-degrees-C or 32-degrees-C. However, the direct fitness responses were usually greater than the correlated responses, judged both by comparing direct and correlated responses of a single group at different temperatures and by comparing direct and correlated responses of different groups at a single temperature. These comparisons indicate that the observed adaptation was, in fact, largely temperature specific. Also, the fitness responses of the generalist group across a range of temperatures were less variable than those of the thermal specialist groups considered as whole.

AB Adaptation of plant populations to nutrient-poor environments may follow two essentially different pathways: maximizing the assimilation of nutrients or minimizing the loss of nutrients. Our hypothesis was that plant species that are adapted to nutrient-poor soils can replace species that are characteristic for relatively nutrient-rich habitats by features that enable them to restrict their nutrient losses. We chose Festuca rubra and Arrhenatherum elatius as species to test this hypothesis. In a long-term field experiment in a hayfield it was observed that Festuca was very common and Arrhenatherum was almost absent in the unfertilized plots, whereas after fertilization Festuca disappeared and Arrhenatherum increased strongly. It was hypothesized that differences in nutrient and carbon losses resulting from mowing were responsible for the different success of the two species in the unfertilized plots. A pot experiment was carried out in a greenhouse with clipped and unclipped and with unfertilized and fertilized treatments in a factorial design with four series. In the fertilized treatments Arrhenatherum replaced Festuca; its heavier seeds resulted in more rapid early growth and its more erect architecture enabled it to overtop Festuca after some time. In the two unfertilized treatments Festuca replaced Arrhenatherum, but much more rapidly in the clipped pots than in the unclipped ones. Losses of nitrogen due to clipping were much greater in Arrhenatherum than in Festuca because of the strongly increased allocation of nitrogen to aboveground parts in Arrhenatherum in response to clipping. It was concluded that differences in nitrogen loss resulting from clipping have an important impact upon the competitive balance between plant species under nutrient-poor conditions.

AB Among gregarious, placental mammals, breeding synchrony usually occurs by adjustment of the timing of estrus, not births, and it has been suspected that the former process governs synchronized parturition. Gestation length data gathered on wild plains bison (Bison bison) over a 5-yr period demonstrate: (1) females in good body condition who were mated after the seasonal peak shortened gestation by almost-equal-to 6 d, synchronizing births with other females; (2) no similar adjustments occurred among females in poor condition; and (3) those females that shortened gestation incurred a cost because their neonates were, on average, almost-equal-to 20 kg lighter when 6 mo old. Reproductive synchrony may also be achieved by a less radical tactic; unmated females use olfactory cues to explore the status of other females prior to their own estrus but not after. These data suggest that there is adaptive variation in gestation length in bison cows in good condition and that assumptions about the constancy of gestation are unwarranted.

AB Despite the central role suggested for regulatory mutations in many evolutionary scenarios, there is relatively little information available about the type and extent of regulatory differences between species, or to what extent differnces between species are independent of variation within species.  To address this issue we have studied the regulatory system of beta-glucuronidase, a gene implicated in a murine androgen-inducible pheromone-signalling system.  We examined the changes in beta-glucuronidase hormonal regulation which have occurred during the radiation of a group of 12 closely related species of mice by assaying beta-glucuronidase activity in six different tissues after treatment with estrogen, and with androgen alone and in combination with either estrogen or growth hormone.  We also examined in some detail the extent of variation in regulatory responses within species.  We found extensive variation in regulatory phenotypes both within and among the species surveyed, suggesting that many of the species examined are currently polymorphic for various regulatory factors that affect inducibility of beta-glucuronidase.  The variation we observed reflects changes in the ability of the beta-glucuronidase gene to respond to hormonal influences, rather than changes in aspects of the hormonal signalling system exterior to the gene.  The marked differences among species in the renal and uterine responses to hormonal induction of beta-glucuronidase are not easily related to the phylogeny of the genus Mus.  If hormonal induction of the gene for beta-glucuronidase is subject to natural selection, it appears to be subject to widely fluctuating selective forces.  We review evidence that the apparently disorderly evolution of the hormonal responsiveness of beta-glucuronidase does not appear to be a unique property of this regulatory system.  In contrast to the evolution of many protein sequences, which are tightly correlated with phylogeny and proceed at a relatively constant rate, some, perhaps, many, regulatory phenotypes are in rapid evolutionary flux, providing an extensive range of phenotypes upon which selection can act.

AB Two of the central hypotheses of the triangular model of primary plant strategies were tested by a novel technique involving seven grasses of contrasted ecology grown in pure stands and an additive mixture on an experimental matrix of crossed gradients of mineral nutrient stress and vegetation disturbance. The experimental design allowed reductions in vegetative and reproductive vigor resulting from interspecific competition to be distinguished from those arising from direct effects of nutrient stress and vegetation disturbance. It was also possible to determine the extent to which competitive suppression of each species was affected by stress and disturbance.
   In isolation, all species showed maximum vegetative and reproductive vigor at high soil fertility and low disturbance. In the mixture, absolute reductions in biomass and flowering due to competition were greatest at high soil fertility and low disturbance, and the species of most extreme strategy became restricted to areas of the matrix broadly consistent with those predicted by strategy classification. When standardized for differences in biomass in pure stands, the effect of competition remained relatively constant across the stress-disturbance matrix for all species except Poa annua, which was less restricted by competition at high intensities of stress. There were marked and consistent differences between species in their susceptibility to competition. At both high and low soil fertility, two species of natural occurrence on infertile soils (Festuca ovina, Bromus erectus) were poor competitors relative to Arrhenatherum elatius, a widespread dominant of productive grasslands. The effect of competition was least severe on flowering of annuals in low-stress portions of the matrix. If competition is assessed simply as the percentage of reduction in biomass between pure and mixed stands it appears that competition intensity is constant across different intensities of stress and disturbance. However, observations that maximum reductions in biomass coincided with low stress and low disturbance, that competition decreased in importance as a factor reducing yield and flowering (relative to stress and disturbance) as stress and disturbance intensities increased, and that there was a consistently inferior competitive ability of plants from infertile soils at all positions on the matrix all support the hypothesis that competition declines in importance as a vegetation determinant in the vegetation of infertile soils.

AB The clearwinged grasshopper, Camnula pellucida, exploits incident solar radiation to raise internal body temperatures above ambient levels. Under adequate temperature and light conditions, grasshopper body temperatures may exceed air temperatures by 10-degrees-15-degrees-C with both nymphs and adults preferring to thermoregulate near 40-degrees-C, their optimal temperature for development. Comparison of age-specific phenology data collected from field sites with projections from computer simulation studies on grasshopper development, indicated that incident solar radiation can highly accelerate maturation of grasshoppers. Also, prolonged exposure to temperatures above 35-degrees-C is beneficial to grasshoppers, as it is detrimental to the fungal pathogen Entomophaga grylli (US pathotype I), which is a major cause of natural mortality in many species. E. grylli protoplasts grew little or not at all if incubated at a constant 35-degrees-C in tissue culture medium. Studies, conducted in vivo at constant temperatures, verified that E. grylli has an upper thermal limit of survival and development near 35-degrees-C. In nature, however, these organisms are exposed to fluctuating temperatures. Further in vitro studies revealed that protoplast survival and development were significantly affected by incubation at 40-degrees-C for as little as 2 h per day and almost totally inhibited by 40-degrees-C for 8 h each day. In vivo incubation studies also showed an increase in the incubation period and a decline in the proportion of grasshoppers dying of E. grylli mycosis with increased daily exposure to 40-degrees-C. Infected grasshoppers were also held at 25-degrees-30-degrees-C and allowed to range freely between shaded and lighted areas, so body temperatures could be raised through normal basking activity. Compared to a control group held in diffuse light, E. grylli mycosis was almost totally eliminated from the basking grasshoppers. The few individuals treated with solar radiation that died from E. grylli infection survived significantly longer then infected individuals not exposed to the solar simulator. Computer simulations using field-collected temperature, moisture, and solar radiation data revealed that behaviorally regulated thermal effects on E. grylli survival and development could limit disease development in some locations and seasons. Although it is unclear that the behavioral trait of basking is an adaptive response to selection pressures caused either by the pathogen or by other selective factors, it is clear that thermoregulatory behavior provides survival advantages to C pellucida. In addition to their specific biological significance, these results demonstrate that behavioral exploitation of a physical resource in the environment can be used to profoundly alter biological relationships between species, in this case, allowing one organism to eliminate an antagonist by causing its mortality.

Electronic, light-emitting diode, and capillary recording devices were used to measure foraging behavior. Individual dives were a flattened U shape in profile, and occurred in bouts lasting almost-equal-to 15 min. Dive patterns were nocturnal; most dives occurred between 2000 and 0400. Murres probably concentrate their foraging effort at times when prey is most available as it migrates closer to the surface in the evening as part of the deep scattering layer. Although dives averaged 18 m in depth and 55 s in duration, most time-at-depth was spent between 21 and 40 m. Thus, murres made a large number of shallow, short-duration dives. Maximum dive depth was 210 m, while maximum dive duration was 224 s. Descent and ascent rates averaged 0.94 and 0.85 m/s, respectively. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, blood volume, and pectoralis myoglobin levels were measured in the laboratory as 52.8%, 18.0 g/100 mL, 12.3% body mass, and 1.9 g/100 g, respectively. Total useable oxygen store was calculated as 44.8 mL/kg, giving an estimated aerobic dive limit (ADL) of 47 s. Murres exceeded the calculated ADL in 48% of their dives. Long-duration diving is probably a more efficient foraging strategy for murres given their relatively small size and limited oxygen storage capabilities. The observed dive depths raised questions of potential problems with decompression sickness (bends) and lung collapse.

AB This study investigates the responses of house mice (Mus domesticus) to two species of introduced mammalian predators in Western Australia, the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and cat (Felis catus), and to an endemic carnivorous marsupial, the western quoll (Dasyurus geoffroii). In four study areas containing no mammalian predators, mice showed little discrimination between traps bearing fecal odors of the predators and traps bearing conspecific odors or no odor. Mice in these areas also used sites of different vegetation density roughly in proportion to their abundance, irrespective of the intensity of lunar illumination or whether densities of predator feces were high or low. These results suggest that predator-naive mice do not respond to predator odors or to different levels of predation risk. In contrast, mice in 12 other study areas containing one to three species of mammalian predators avoided traps with predator odors, and generally selected relatively dense vegetation. They also used sites of greater vegetation density on moonlit compared to dark nights, and in two study areas where the density of cat feces had been experimentally increased. These results indicate that mice in areas exposed to mammalian predators distinguish predator odors and use denser vegetation when the perceived risk of predation is increased.
   In further experiments, I introduced predator-naive and predator-experienced mice to study areas containing cats and foxes. Survival rates of experienced mice a month after release were 2 1/2 times higher than those of their naive counterparts, and hence support the hypothesis that a habitat shift to dense vegetation is an effective anti-predator response.

AB A phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) restriction sites was used to examine the geographic history of the Cyprinodon nevadensis complex of pupfishes, a group of four species (seven extant subspp.) in two endorheic (closed) basins of the Death Valley System in California and Nevada (Owens River Valley and Ash Meadows-Death Valley).  The mtDNA results suggest that the group contains mtDNAs from two divergent clades.  One such clade is represented by the mtDNAs of the Owens Valley pupfish (C. radiosus) and the existing species in the Colorado River (C. macularius), while the other includes the mtDNAs of the Ash Meadows-Death Valley species (C. nevadensis, C. salinus, and C. diabolis) and a species located much farther to the east (C. fontinalis from the Guzman Basin, Chihuahua, Mexico).  These results, together with evidence from other studies, suggest two separate invasions of the Death Valley System by pupfishes carrying phylogenetically divergent mtDNAs.  The C. nevadensis complex apparently is either an artificial group or else it is monophyletic and its genetic history includes loss of the original mtDNA in either Owens Valley or Ash Meadows-Death Valley following genetic introgression after an invasion y a pupfish carrying a divergent mtDNA.

AB Restriction sites data can be analyzed by maximum likelihood to obtain estimates of phylogenies. The likelihood methods of Smouse and Li, who were able to compute likelihoods for up to four species under a simplified model of base change, can be extended numerically to deal with any number of species. The computational methods for doing so are outlined. The resulting algorithms are slow but take multiple gains and losses of restriction sites fully into account, unlike parsimony methods. They allow for the failure to observe potential sites that are absent from all species. Analysis of the five-species hominoid data of Ferris and coworkers confirms the pattern found by Smouse and Li with four species-that a chimpanzee-gorilla clade is favored, but not statistically significantly over other tree topologies. A large data set produced by computer simulation has also been analyzed to confirm that the method works properly. The methods used here do not allow for different rates of transitions and transversions. They can be extended to do so, but only at a cost of considerably slower computations. The present method is available in a computer program.

AB Species richness undergoes a progressive decline with increasing latitude from 30-degrees to 60-degrees-N for crayfish and from 35-degrees to 70-degrees-N for freshwater amphipods.  Rapoport's rule, which predicts a correlation between latitude and geographical range of distribution, is realized for both these crustaceans.  The latitudinal gradients are determined by the mean annual temperature range, surface geology, temporal emergence from glaciation, and possibly strength of competitive interactions.  Empirical differences in the magnitude of Rapoport's rule among taxa (mollusks, fish, mammals, reptiles and amphibians, crayfish, amphipods) reflect dispersion capabilities and ecophysiological properties.

AB Many yeasts in the genus Pichia are killers (yeasts that secrete proteins toxic to other yeasts). The genus is subdivided into complexes comprised of species with similar morphologies, physiological abilities, and percentage of (guanine + cytosine) comprising their nuclear DNA. Here, we test the hypothesis that ecological factors influence the types of toxins produced by members of two Pichia complexes (the Pichia kluyveri and Pichia opuntiae complexes). Members of each complex are separated by geography or host range, but all live in decaying cactus tissue.
   Similarities among killer toxins were investigated by testing strains from each complex in the laboratory for their ability to kill a standard set of 70 yeasts. Principal components analysis demonstrated that the killer phenotype was constant within a species, but not within the complexes. The probability that a toxin would kill a particular yeast depended on some ecological characteristic of the yeasts tested as sensitives (i.e., the region, host plant, or habitat from which the yeasts were collected).
   We further tested the hypothesis that ecological factors influence killer phenotype by analyzing within-community patterns of killing. Killer strains from two different cacti were tested for their ability to kill a subset of the yeasts actually collected from the same pockets of rotting cactus tissue from which the killer strains were collected or from rot pockets in neighboring cacti. When the yeasts tested for sensitivity were classified a priori by their probability of interacting with each killer strain, it was shown that the sensitivity to killer toxin was correlated with the probability of interaction. Further, the yeast community composition of a rot pocket depended on the presence or absence of a killer strain in that pocket.
   We demonstrated that killer toxins could change community composition by growing strains of two sensitive yeasts in the presence of a killer or a non-killer strain of P. kluyveri. The killer strain reached a higher cell density than the non-killer strain in the presence of sensitive yeasts. The density of sensitive yeasts grown with a killer strain was lower than that of a strain grown with a non-killer strain of P. kluyveri.

AB Net-spinning caddisfly larvae of the family Hydropsychidae are known to prefer microhabitats with large, stable substrate and high water flow velocity. It is often assumed that net spinners in high-velocity microhabitats have higher feeding or growth rates than larvae in less preferred sites, but there is no direct evidence to support this assumption. We hypothesized that net-spinning caddisflies would select microhabitats that offered the greatest feeding rates. This hypothesis was tested by field experiments in which we determined if net-spinning caddisfly larvae preferred high-velocity sites even when substrate size and type were held constant. We then measured feeding rates of net spinners in microhabitats with different flow characteristics. High-flow positions were selected by 96% of hydropsychid larvae colonizing artificial moss substrates. Artemia nauplii released into the water column were captured by individual larvae in high-flow sites at a rate of 0.016%/m, significantly higher than the capture rate in low-flow sites. Combining this rate of prey capture with mean hydropsychid densities of 1125 individuals/m2, we estimate that hydropsychid larvae in riffles remove drifting invertebrate prey at a rate of almost-equal-to 18%/m. Assuming exponential prey removal, a prey item in the drift would travel an average of only 5.5 m before being consumed. This study is one of the first to show that the distribution of a stream filter feeder is related to the feeding rates obtainable in different microhabitats.

AB The deep-sea communities of the continental slope and rise off the eastern coast of the United States have a remarkably high diversity-measured regionally or locally either as species richness or as the evenness of relative abundance among species.  In a 1,500-2,500-m depth range off New Jersey and Delaware, 233 30 x 30-cm samples contained 798 species in 171 families and 14 phyla.  Addition of stations from sites to the north and south approximately doubled the number of samples and doubled the number of species to 1,597.  Species-area curves do not level off within stations or when stations are added together.  Moreover, the proportion of species represented by single individuals is high at all scales of sampling, which indicates that much more sampling is needed to adequately represent the species richness either locally or regionally.  Diversity changes very little through time at a single site or with distance along a 180-km transect at a depth of 2,100 m.  Diversity is maintained by a combination of biogenic microhabitat heterogeneity in a system with few barriers to dispersal, disturbance created by feeding activities of larger animals, and food resources divided into patches of a few square meters to square centimeters initiated by specific temporally separated events.

AB From southeastern Queensland to southern Victoria over a transect of 11-degrees latitude, the Moreton taxon of the Australian grasshopper Caledia captiva exhibits a cline in chromosome structure that involves change from a metacentric to an acrocentric genome. In this study, we show that embryonic development time covaries with chromosome structure along the transect. Both development time and chromosome short arm length exhibit an overall negative correlation with latitude, but with maxima just south of the northern limit of the taxon's distribution. Selection for such a pattern appears to arise from changes in voltinism along the cline in season length that exists along the transect. Populations with the highest temperature thresholds for avoidance of embryonic diapause also have the slowest development time and probably represent the northern extreme of a primarily univoltine life cycle. North of this region bivoltinism increases in frequency and, as expected from a split of the season length, development time decreases. Maximum chromosome short arm length occurs in the vicinity of the northern univoltine populations, rather than at the limit of distribution where bivoltinism prevails. We conclude that variation in chromosome structure could be contributing to the heritable variation for development time that forms the basis for adaptive change in this trait. These results provide justification for investigating causal relationships between chromosome structure and development time, with an ultimate aim of understanding the adaptive significance of chromosomal variation in C. captiva.

AB We measured the timing and magnitude of nitrogenase activity and N2 fixation by lupines colonizing early successional volcanic sites at Mount St. Helens. Nitrogenase activity (measured by acetylene reduction) in Lupinus lepidus growing at a pyroclastic site exhibited significant diurnal trends, with lowest ethylene evolution rates at night. Nitrogenase activity also followed seasonal trends, with high rates in June, very low levels in August, the dry warm part of the season, and a partial recovery of nitrogenase activity in September after precipitation resumed. A comparison of typical nitrogenase activities measured at several sites suggested that rates of N2 fixation were highest in L. lepidus growing at disturbed low N sites. Adult lupine C and N composition also varied during the growing season, with trends correlated with seasonal patterns of nitrogenase activity.
   Seasonal N2 fixation in L. lepidus and L. latifolius was measured using N-15 isotope. Both species fixed almost-equal-to 60% of their N during the first season of growth with some evidence of preferential allocation to aboveground biomass. N fixation by Lupinus lepidus individuals was almost-equal-to 18.1 mg/g biomass or an average of 15.4 mg per plant, while L. latifolius fixed an average of 16.3 mg/g biomass, equivalent to 22.9 mg per plant. Average net C fixation during the same period was 355 and 589 mg per plant for L. lepidus and L. latifolius, respectively. Despite these rates, the current distribution of L. lepidus into a few, small patches that occupy < 1% of the surface area indicates that annual N inputs by lupines are < 0.05 kg/ha and thus probably-not the primary source of N input into developing Mount St. Helens pyroclastic sites except at a local scale.

AB With the aim of assessing the principal structuring forces for algal biomass development, I conducted field studies along a productivity gradient of Swedish and Antarctic lakes. In accordance with predictions from current ecological theory, the regression line of planktonic algal biomass vs. the concentration of total phosphorus shows a steeper slope for Swedish (functionally three trophic levels) than for Antarctic lakes (functionally two trophic levels). This difference suggests that, besides the effect of nutrients, the food chain composition in aquatic systems has a crucial impact on the biomass development of planktonic algae. However, at very high productivity, phytoplankton biomass in the Antarctic lakes approached levels similar to those in Swedish lakes, suggesting that the algae "grew away" from being grazer regulated and instead became nutrient limited. The mechanistic connections between the components in the food chain, suggested by theory and the descriptive field study, were evaluated in an enclosure experiment. It may be concluded that classical food chain theory can explain a great deal of the variation.in the relation between phosphorus concentration and phytoplankton chlorophyll, frequently used by limnologists.

AB The goal of this study was to explore how leaf and canopy level differences interact in determining total canopy productivity. Maximum rates of carbon gain and transpiration were found to be higher in leaves of the deciduous oak Quercus lobata than in the co-occurring evergreen oak Quercus agrifolia. However, the efficiency of water and nitrogen use is greater in leaves of Q. agrifolia. A biochemically based model of annual leaf photosynthesis using environmental field data indicates that the evergreen habit in Q. agrifolia partially compensates for the lower photosynthetic capacity of leaves and increases the amount of photosynthate produced per unit water or nitrogen. Simulations indicate that with low N or water availability, the evergreen species can produce canopies with greater annual production than the deciduous species; the converse is true at higher levels of resource supply. Some of the patterns of distribution of these species in northern California may be explained by examining the relationships between resource availability and estimated annual production.

AB Clarkia tembloriensis exhibits a wide range of variation among its natural populations in outcrossing rate and in separation of male and female function in space (anther-stigma separation or herkogamy) and in time (protandry). Here we show that outcrossing rate is highly correlated with protandry and anther-stigma separation. Both genetic and environmental variation contribute to inter- and intrapopulation variation in protandry and anther-stigma separation. Interpopulation differentiation for protandry and anther-stigma separation was found to be polygenic. Genetic variation for protandry and anther-stigma separation within populations was demonstrated by a significant among-family variance in two populations with contrasting breeding systems. Environmental effects on the expression of mating system traits were manifested in two ways. First, significant variation among lathhouse benches suggests that small-scale environmental heterogeneity may affect the development of floral traits. Second, protandry was shortened under hot summer conditions. Hence, hotter and drier habitats, typical of the more self-pollinating populations of C. tembloriensis, can promote self-pollination purely through environmental effects.

AB I introduce a Markov probabilistic model of transitions among discrete morphological states as a method for describing and testing nonrandom patterns of evolutionary change.  The Markov model assumes one-generational dependency, i.e., that the future direction of evolutionary change depends on the current morphology of a species, not on any history of changes.  This model is very flexible, allowing for any number of discrete states to describe morphology, yet permit rigorous testing of even complex evolutionary hypotheses.  I apply this model to changes in seed dispersal mechanisms within 571 genera of Neotropical plants, using cladistic methods to infer the ancestral and derived states within each genus.  I then test a series of progressively more complex hypotheses about the constraints that might shape the patterns of observed evolutionary transitions:  1) no transition constraints; 2) all dispersal mechanisms are equally labile evolutionarily; 3) the probability of particular evolutionary transition among dispersal mechanisms depends on the descendant state but on the ancestral state; 4) transition probabilities differ among pairs of dispersal mechanisms, but are reciprocal within such pairs.  More complex hypotheses matched the data significantly better than did simpler hypotheses.  However, only one of the hypotheses (reciprocal transitions) fit the observed data and then only for the most cautious interpretation of the frequencies of transitions within genera.  These results suggest that evolutionary transitions among major adaptive syndromes are indeed ordered, and the observed patterns of transitions suggest possible reasons for such macroevolutionary structure.

AB Allometric considerations have suggested that small herbivores are inefficient at or incapable of extracting energy from the microbial fermentation of structural carbohydrates.  This notion is at odds with accumulating empirical evidence that demonstrates well-developed fiber digestion abilities for a number of small rodent genera.  To examine the apparent inconsistency, we have constructed a model of plant fiber utilization tailored specifically for hindgut fermenters.  Computer simulations provide estimates of fiber and overall dry-matter digestibilities as a function of body size, energy demand, and diet.  Our calculations indicate that small mammals can obtain significant benefit from fiber fermentation, especially at moderate fiber levels.  Comparisons with literature data are in general agreement, although fiber digestion abilities are still underestimated for the smallest animals.  In an empirical test of the model, Neotoma obtained over 21% of their digestible energy solely from the microbial fermentation of plant fiber.  We also observed an interesting pattern of allometric sorting predicted by the model.  Smaller woodrats significantly reduced the fiber content of their diet, a behavior presumably reflecting energy limitations.

AB This study quantifies the influence of the persistent variation in maternal investment in individual offspring on larval fitness in a population of the oriental fire-bellied toad Bombina orientalis. Offspring fitness was evaluated by exposing newly hatched larvae to interspecific tadpole predators and assessing the effect of ovum size on the probability of surviving predation. The experiment incorporates natural variation in temperature that occurs during development. Embryos that developed in colder ponds took longer to hatch and hatched at a larger size. Larger size afforded larvae significant protection from predation. In addition, larvae that developed from large eggs in cold ponds had a higher probability of surviving predation than larvae that developed from small eggs. A significant interaction between egg size and developmental temperature, however, resulted in larvae that developed from large eggs in warm ponds having a lower probability of surviving predation. Larger eggs resulted in larger snout-to-vent lengths at all temperatures. In warm ponds, however, tails of larvae from large and small eggs were of equal length. Thus, diminished locomotory ability due to larger amounts of inert yolk can be invoked to explain the increased susceptibility to predation of larvae that developed from large eggs in warm ponds. In cold ponds tail length was substantially greater than in warm ponds, and larvae from large eggs tended to have longer tails than those that developed from small eggs. This allowed larvae from large eggs to achieve the advantages of increased body size.
   Thermally induced plasticity during early development resulted in an unpredictability regarding the adaptive value of a particular egg size. This result fits within a growing theoretical literature that indicates that environmental uncertainty can result in the natural selection of developmental plasticity in egg size, even though the fitness ramifications are realized in subsequent stages. Thus, increased maternal investment in offspring is not necessarily associated with an increase in offspring fitness, and the evolution of developmental plasticity in egg size may be the result of environmental uncertainty during the larval stages of life.

AB Heterostyly has been viewed as both an antiselfing device and a mechanism that increases the proficiency of pollen transfer between plants.  We used experimental manipulation of the morph structure of garden populations of self-compatible, tristylous Eichhornia paniculata to investigate the function of floral polymorphism.  Outcrossing rates (t), levels of intermorph mating (d), and morph-specific male and female reproductive success were compared in replicate trimorphic and monomorphic populations.  In trimorphic populations, t and d averaged 0.81 (2 SE = 0.03) and 0.77 (2 SE = 0.03) respectively, with no difference in either parameter among morphs.  Ninety-five percent of outcrossed seeds were therefore the result of intermorph fertilizations.  Male reproductive success of the long-styled morph was low, especially in comparison with plants of the short-styled morph.  Outcrossing rates for each morph were higher in trimorphic than monomorphic populations where t averaged 0.71 (2 SE = 0.01), 0.30 (2 SE = 0.04) and 0.43 (2 SE = 0.1) for the long-, mid-, and short-styled morphs, respectively.  Seed set was lower in monomorphic populations, particularly those composed of the L morph, reflecting reduced pollen deposition.  Floral polymorphism therefore increased both outcrossing rate and fecudity but the magnitude of the differences varied among morphs.  If the ancestral condition in heterostylous groups resembled the L morph, as has been suggested, data from this study suggests that the selective basis for the establishment of floral polymorphism could have been increased pollen transfer rather than higher levels of outcrossing.

AB In this study, I examine the effects of natural and experimentally induced variation in life cycle timing on offspring fitness in Arphia sulphurea and Chortophaga viridifasciata, to understand the selective pressures shaping phenology in these two species of nymph-overwintering grasshoppers.  Because these species lack embryonic diapause, hatching varies over a two month range under natural conditions.  I used a cold treatment to delay hatching of some egg pods and extend the natural range of hatching dates.  Due to the shorter time for growth and poorer growing conditions late in the fall, late-hatching nymphs of both species grew to a smaller size before winter and suffered higher overwinter mortality, compared to early nymphs.  In addition, late nymphs that did survive the winter became reproductive later in the following year's breeding season.  Size-dependent mortality of offspring during the winter is a strong selective pressure favoring early reproduction in these species.  Female adult life history traits appear responsive to the seasonal declines in offspring fitness, in that late-maturing females began reproducing sooner after adult maturation and reproduced at a more rapid rate, even at the expense of having shorter adult longevity and producing fewer total egg pods.  Experimental manipulations were crucial in understanding the fitness consequences of intrapopulation variation in the timing of specific life-cycle events for these species.

AB We present heritability estimates for final size of body traits and egg size as well as phenotypic and genetic correlations between body and egg traits in a recently established population of the barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) in the Baltic area. Body traits as well as egg size were heritable and, hence could respond evolutionarily to phenotypic selection. Genetic correlations between body size traits were significantly positive and of similar magnitude or higher than the corresponding phenotypic correlations. Heritability estimates for tarsus length obtained from fullsib analyses were higher than those obtained from midoffspring-midparent regressions, and this indicates common environment effects on siblings. Heritabilities for tarsus length obtained from midoffspring-mother regressions were significantly higher than estimates from midoffspring-father regressions. The results suggest that this discrepancy is not caused by maternal effects through egg size, nor by extra-pair fertilizations, but by a socially inherited foraging site fidelity in females.

AB In southern France, Diplozoon gracile (Monogenea, Polyopisthocotylea), parasitizes four sympatric cyprinids.  One of these host species, Barbus meridionalis, naturally hybridizes with another species of barbel, Barbus, barbus, which is never parasitized by D. gracile under natural conditions.  This hybridization has previously been studied and described as an introgression of B. barbus by B. meridionalis.  The hybrids are parasitized by D. gracile, and parasite prevalence increases in proportion to the introgression rate, i.e., the percentage of B. meridionalis genes.  The causes for this preferential distribution of the parasite in the hybrid population are analysed on the basis of ecological and ethological differences between the two parent species.

AB Many organisms reproduce by releasing gametes into the environment. However, very little is known about what proportion of released eggs become fertilized. We examined the influence of spawning group size, degree of aggregation, position within an aggregation, and water flow, on in situ fertilization in the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus franciscanus. This study was conducted at a depth of 9 m on the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Males were simulated by syringes filled with sperm; females were simulated by sperm-permeable containers filled with eggs. Individuals were placed 0.5 or 2.0 m apart within a 2 x 2 or 4 x 4 (group size of 4 or 16 individuals) experimental array. The results indicate that group size, degree of aggregation, position within a spawning group, and water flow all affect fertilization success. Fertilization success ranged from 0 to 82%. Increases in group size and aggregation, decreases in flow velocity, and central and downstream positions within an aggregation all lead to increases in fertilization success. Thus, individual reproductive performance is dependent on, and highly sensitive to, population parameters and environmental conditions.

AB The selection on residual mass (relative to body size) at fledging was investigated in the Collared Flycatcher Ficedula albicollis and the Great Tit Parus major. Directional selection for high fledging mass was evident in 6 of 7 yr in Collared Flycatchers but only in 1 of 5 yr in Great Tits. Three different methods of demonstrating and testing stabilizing selection are compared. Stabilizing selection on relative mass occurred in both species, but the frequency with which this was established depended on which method was used. None of the methods seemed to be universally reliable, and the problem of defining and testing stabilizing selection is discussed. In Collared Flycatchers mass seemed to be most important for juvenile survival. Also in Great Tits mass was important, but in addition other traits (e.g., hatching date) strongly influenced juvenile survival in this species. This possible difference between the two species is suggested to relate to differences in their territory establishment.

AB We tested the hypothesis that environmental stresses decrease overall plant resistance to insect herbivory in the field and evaluated biochemical mechanisms proposed to explain insect response to stressed plants. To impose a stress treatment, we severed lateral roots and rhizomes of a native crucifer (bittercress, Cardamine cordifolia) and quantified plant and herbivore responses for treatment and control clones. Severing roots and rhizomes once, early in the growing season: (1) produced moderate, but detectable, changes in plant physiological traits, specifically greater transient leaf water deficits at midday (P < .05) and elevated nitrate-nitrogen concentrations (P < .05); (2) altered plant quality, by causing an increase in soluble carbohydrates (P < .003), isoleucine concentrations in leaves (P < .01), and possibly glucosinolate concentration (P < . 10), but made no differences in most primary nutrient concentrations, including total nitrogen, total free amino nitrogen, total amino acids, proline, and leaf water content; and (3) led to increased herbivory by chewing and leaf-mining (P < .001), but not by sap-feeding, insect herbivores. Trends toward decreased plant stature and fruit reproduction were not significant after 1 mo. In addition to the significant effect of our treatment, we found extensive variation in the magnitude of response to stress and herbivory among replicates. We hypothesize that environmentally induced physiological variation among plants within a plant population commonly distributes insect herbivory disproportionately onto a subset of the individuals, and in so doing influences the demography, distribution, and evolution of that plant population.

AB Insect defoliation is commonly associated with and assumed to be a cause of mortality in Australian eucalypts, particularly in rural regions where trees suffer from the eucalypt dieback syndrome. To test this, leaf growth and defoliation were measured in the canopies of Eucalyptus trees from June 1982 to June 1986, and related to tree health and eucalypt dieback. Over 5000 leaves were monitored, including replicates of branches, canopy heights, individual trees, species, and sites. Three types of sites were selected, representing the most common conditions in the eastern Australian tablelands: woodlands (comprised of healthy trees but with slight signs of dieback), healthy trees in pastures, and dying trees in pastures. Within each site the commonest native tree species were selected for study; species were not always the same between adjacent sites because of interspecific differences in distribution patterns.
   Some eucalypt species suffered much greater defoliation than others, and this was related to their observed susceptibility to dieback. Eucalyptus nova-anglica (peppermint) and E. stellulata lost up to 300% and 274% of leaf surface area, respectively, in one year, and these trees suffered severe dieback. In contrast, E. caliginosa and E dalrympleana annually lost as little as 20% and 8%, respectively, and showed little evidence of dieback. Other aspects of leaf growth were quantified for each canopy, including numbers of leaves flushing, amounts of leaf area affected by galls and miners, and leaf longevities. More than half of the leaves monitored senesced from causes other than insect damage. Defoliating insects appeared to have a greater impact on eucalypts in Australia than they do on forest and pasture trees of other continents.

AB Because resource movement is restricted within and among branches of woody plants, different patterns of folivory are likely to differentially affect plant fitness. I examined experimentally the effects of folivory pattern on growth and seed output in the understory tropical wet forest shrub Piper arieianum (Piperaceae) in Costa Rica. I removed 10% of a plant's leaf area in two constrasting manners, either from a single reproductive branch or throughout the canopy. I also conducted the experiment at two times of year, 3 mo before flowering and during flowering, to determine the effects of damage relative to the phenology of reproduction. Leaf area was removed to simulate damage by natural folivores. I followed the effects of the removal for 1 yr, both for experimental plants and for control plants from which no leaf area was removed.
   Response to experimental folivory varied by treatment both at the branch and whole plant level. When 10% of a plant's leaf area was removed from single reproductive branches 3 mo before the main flowering season, those damaged branches grew less and produced 80% fewer viable seeds than did similar branches on control plants and plants that lost 10% of their leaf area, but with the losses scattered throughout the plant. These differences among treatments for individual branches translated into differences over the entire plant: plants with damage concentrated on one reproductive branch grew less overall and produced fewer seeds than plants of the other two treatments. Thus, restricted movement of resources in P. arieianum following leaf damage to single reproductive branches resulted in decreased whole plant fitness. When this same experiment was conducted at the time of flowering, there were no differences among treatments in seed production or growth, either at the branch or plant level. Results of these two experiments demonstrate that the effects of folivory are dependent on the timing of the loss relative to the reproductive phenology of the plant; resources necessary for fruit production are accumulated before flowering and not subsequent to it in P. arieianum. In 32% of plants in which damage was concentrated, seed production was reduced due to either abortion of the damaged branch (17%) or abortion of its bud inflorescences (15%). In the remaining 68% of branch-defoliated plants, neither level nor timing of flowering was affected by the experimental folivory, suggesting that reduction in seed production was due to a decrease in resource availability and not to a lack of pollinator visitation.
   Together these results add to the evidence that resource movement is restricted in woody plants, even in the face of a stress such as herbivory. The results further suggest that relatively small amounts of folivory can have major detrimental effects in woody plants and that damage pattern as well as damage level must be measured.

AB Assimilation of soil organic matter and fresh plant debris by Millsonia anomala, a tropical geophagous earthworm, was investigated by measuring changes in the C-13/C-12 ratio of their tissues when fed on organic matter naturally labelled by C-13. Individuals collected from a soil colonized by C4 plants (C4 soil) that were fed on C3 soil had > 50% of tissue C derived from the C3 Soil after 33 d. Assimilation of organic matter associated with different particle size fractions was investigated with individuals fed for 25 d on C4 soil with C4 particle size fractions substituted in turn for the equivalent C3 soil particle fraction. A significant labelling of earthworms was observed with both the 250-2000-mu-m and the 0-20-mu-m particle size fractions. Addition of fresh C3 plant debris to the C4 soil also resulted in a significant change in earthworm C isotope ratio. Assimilation of fresh plant material was greater than that of soil organic matter. This shows that young M. anomala are able to assimilate young organic matter (fresh plant debris, coarse soil organic matter) as well as fine soil organic matter, both of which classically have been regarded as strongly resistant to decomposition in models of soil organic matter dynamics.

AB We analyze a two-locus population-genetics model for the queen-workers conflict over the sex ratio in social Hymenoptera. We assume that the total number of reproductives and the proportion of females among them are both functions of a queen's trait-alpha and of a workers' trait-beta, which are controlled by one locus each. We determine the conditions for a pair {alpha, beta} to be an evolutionarily stable state (ESS), that is, to be such that no combination of mutations at the two loci is able to invade a population fixed for the pair of genes determining {alpha, beta}. Our results, in some respects, validate the alternative game-theoretic approach, based on maximization of a given pair of queen's and workers' inclusive fitnesses, while showing the limitations of this approach in some other respects. If all mutations are assumed to have a small effect and if linkage between the two loci is not too tight, we show that, indeed, for any ESS {alpha, beta}, alpha and beta-maximize the queen's and the workers' payment functions, H and G, respectively, but the ESS predicted by H and G does not always coincide with the ESS predicted by the queen's and workers' inclusive fitness functions. Very strong linkage, however, may destabilize some of the maxima of H and G but preserve as ESSs those among them that maximize a joint, queen-workers payment function, T. We show that ESSs can be of two kinds: (1) isolated points, in which the proportion of females is intermediate between one-half and three-fourths and the colony productivity is less than maximal, because of conflict between queen and workers; (2) a continuum of points, with a corresponding spread of female proportions, usually within [1/2, 3/4] but also, rarely, beyond this interval. At these points there is full agreement between the two parties, and the colony productivity is accordingly maximal.

AB Dioecy is unusually common in the Hawaiian Islands, yet little is known about the evolutionary biology of this breeding system.  A native shrub, Wikstroemia, has an unusually diverse array of breeding systems:  two forms of dioecy, cryptic and morphological dioecy, as well as hermaphroditism (perfect flowers).  The existence of two forms of dioecy is significant for three reasons:  1) the presence of cryptic unisexuals that are functionally unisexual, but retain the appearance of hemaphroditism in both sexes, is strong evidence for the ancestral status of hermaphroditism; 2) the production of nonfunctional pollen, by female cryptic unisexuals, is a new instance of a phenomenon which has previously been reported for a few other species; 3) the two forms of dioecy are morphological markers which are useful in hybridization studies for tracing the genetic basis of their inheritance.  Crosses were made between cryptically unisexual individuals (C), between morphologically unisexual individuals (M), and between the two types of unisexuality.  The offspring of crosses between individuals with the same sex type usually resulted in offspring with that sex type, but most of the progeny of between-sex type crosses were, unexpectedly, perfect-flowered hermaphrodites.  These results show that genetic control of sex determination is not homologous in all populations, suggesting that dioecy has evolved at least twice in Hawaiian Wikstroemia.  The genetic data further suggest that males are the heterozygous sex.

AB A factorial experiment was performed to evaluate the relationships between defoliation and canopy closure, recognizing that a major effect of grazing in nature is to prevent that closure. Short (Eustachys paspaloides) and mid-height (Themeda triandra) grasses from the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania, were grown for 12 wk in a balanced factorial experiment. Treatments combined clipping and canopy closure, simulated by raising an opaque cardboard collar as plant height increased. At harvest, plants were separated into morphological parts, dried, weighed, and analyzed for nitrogen (N) and nonstructural carbohydrates (CHO). Simulated canopy closure of unclipped plants reduced photon flux density at the plant base by 12% perpendicular to the light source and 55% at a 45-degrees- angle from the lights. Multivariate analysis revealed that experimental treatments produced completely distinct results. Simulated canopy closure of undefoliated plants more than doubled plant height, reduced tiller number by 65% in the short grass and 90% in the mid-height grass, converted differentiation from production of many small tillers to a few very large tillers, changed allocation patterns toward more stem and sheath, and shifted the short grass from a CHO-dominated economy to a more N-balanced economy. The time course of yield from defoliation reached a decided. maximum at 9 wk in the short grass but was much lower and remained comparatively constant in the mid-height grass. Comparing clipped-unshaded plants (simulating grazing) with unclipped-shaded plants (simulating no grazing) revealed that, for both grasses, compensation for defoliation was complete in total yield, yield of live tissues, crown mass, root mass, and total number of leaves. Neither species compensated in residual leaf mass, total leaf area, leaf area per unit of plant biomass, or stem mass. Defoliation shifted leaves of both species to lower CHO and higher N concentrations. In general, the short grass was modified more by canopy closure, the mid-height species by clipping. Greater defoliation tolerance of the short-statured species was due to much greater tillering, significantly greater N accumulation, greater allocation to leaf blade and sheath, less allocation to crown and root, a greater foliage concentration per unit canopy volume, a lower rate of foliage death, and the ability to sustain a considerably higher leaf area per unit of plant mass.
   This experiment indicated that growing unclipped plants isolated in pots grossly distorts morphology, growth, and chemical properties compared to plants experiencing the canopy closure normally encountered in ungrazed grasslands. Therefore, failure to account for the self-limiting consequences of canopy closure can mislead conclusions from laboratory experiments designed to test the consequences of defoliation.

AB The presence of leaf litter of different depths within a tropical forest creates many different microsites for plant establishment. The amount and distribution of leaf litter within a forest can influence patterns of plant establishment. In this study, we determined the spatial variability in leaf litter in the forest understory, and investigated how different litter depths (bare, 1, 6, and 12 cm) affected the establishment of several tropical tree species in both growth house (sun and shade) and field (gap and understory) experiments in the semideciduous tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. The tree species used in this study (Aspidospermum cruenta, Ceiba pentandra, Cordia alliodora, Gustavia superba, Luehea seemannii, Ochroma pyrimidale) were chosen to represent a range of seed masses and a gradient in the light requirement for establishment of the species.
   The spatial distribution of leaf litter was not correlated between adjacent sampling points within the forest understory, suggesting that the establishment environment for seedlings, with respect to litter, is highly variable at scales of 1-20 m.
   The presence of litter affected five of the six species, but the nature and the magnitude of the effect were species specific. The smaller seeded shade-intolerant species had fewer seedlings establishing under leaf litter than on bare ground.The species ranged from strongly negatively affected (Luehea) to moderately negatively affected (Cordia, Ochroma) to affected only by extreme amounts of litter (Ceiba). The presence of litter influenced Gustavia, one of the larger seeded shade-tolerant species, but did not affect Aspidospermum, the other larger seeded species. The effect of litter on Gustavia depended on the light environment. Gustavia had more seedlings establishing under litter in the sun, but the presence of litter had no effect in the shade. Differences among the smaller seeded shade-intolerant species in the amount they were negatively influenced by litter were not correlated with seed mass.
   Data from our field study were consistent with our growth house results for the shade-intolerant species. Additional data from the field study indicated that these species with similar habitat requirements differed in the developmental stage at which they were affected by the presence of litter. Luehea had fewer seeds germinating under litter while the other two species, Ochroma and Cordia, were affected only after germination.
   Interspecific comparisons done for each light level and litter depth indicated that the presence of litter caused reversals in the relative ranking of species success. For example, Gustavia preferentially established under relatively deep litter depths in the sun where Luehea could not establish. In conclusion, the presence of litter can potentially increase seedling diversity within the forest by creating heterogeneity in the establishment environment and by causing reversals in species' rankings.

AB Within the genus Cnemidophorus, parthenogenesis has arisen by hybridization several times. This provides the opportunity to investigate general features of hybridization events that result in the formation of parthenogenetic lineages. The relationships of mtDNA from all bisexual species of Cnemidophorus known to be parents of parthenogens were investigated to evaluate phylogenetic constraints on the hybrid-origin of parthenogenesis. No phylogenetic clustering of the parental species, either maternal of paternal, was apparent. However, the combination of bisexual species that have resulted in parthenogenetic lineages are generally distantly related or genetically divergent. This contrasts with the expectation if parthenogenesis in hybrids is due to the action of a single rare allele, but is consistent with the hypothesis that some minimal level of divergence is necessary to stimulate parthenogenetic reproduction in hybrids.

AB To understand the factors that structure ectomycorrhizal-basidiomycete communities at a local scale, we measured the strength of the relations among the fungal communities, the tree communities, and the environment of a series of forest ecosystems in southern Quebec. We collected fruit bodies belonging to ectomycorrhizal-basidiomycete families and genera, sampled the woody vegetation, and described soils and landforms at 11 permanent sampling stations. We first calculated similarity matrices among stations, one for each descriptor (fungal species abundance, woody species abundance, and abiotic variables). We then explored the dependence among these matrices using Mantel and partial Mantel tests, path analysis, and comparisons of ordinations and classifications. Similarity among ectomycorrhizal fungus communities was strongly and significantly correlated with tree community similarity, even when controlling for the effect of environmental similarity. When the tests were made with a similarity matrix based on those tree species that are known to be hosts of ectomycorrhizal fungi, abiotic similarity explained a significant portion of the residual variation in the similarity among fungus communities. To explore this complex relationship further, we analyzed species associations. The preference of fungus associations for different sets of abiotic conditions showed that some factors affecting fungal species distribution were different from those affecting the distribution of their tree hosts. Direct and indirect gradient analyses showed that humus characteristics seemed to be important niche dimensions of ectomycorrhizal fungi. The continuum concept was useful to interpret the complex relations among symbiotic species. Trees were the main component of the realized niche of ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycetes, but the fungal symbionts of a particular tree species followed that tree species for only a part of the abiotic gradients over which the host tree was found. This type of distribution predicts that beta diversity of fungi would be generally higher than beta diversity of ectomycorrhizae-forming trees. It also means that the ratio of fungus species richness to woody species richness would be high for most community gradients. Our results and those of previous mycosynecological studies agree with these predictions. The results have implications for the conservation of biodiversity: site selection for conservation based on vegetation classification or mapping, or on distribution of tree species, may miss important fungal species.

AB In stage-based demography, animals are often categorized into size (or mass) classes, and size-based probabilities of surviving and changing mass classes must be estimated before demographic analyses can be conducted. In this paper, we develop two procedures for the estimation of mass transition probabilities from capture-recapture data. The first approach uses a multistate capture-recapture model that is parameterized directly with the transition probabilities of interest. Maximum likelihood estimates are then obtained numerically using program SURVIV. The second approach involves a modification of Pollock's robust design. Estimation proceeds by conditioning on animals caught in a particular class at time i, and then using closed models to estimate the number of these that are alive in other classes at i + 1. Both methods are illustrated by application to meadow vole, Microtus pennsylvanicus, capture-recapture data. The two methods produced reasonable estimates that were similar. Advantages of these two approaches include the directness of estimation, the absence of need for restrictive assumptions about the independence of survival and growth, the testability of assumptions, and the testability of related hypotheses of ecological interest (e.g., the hypothesis of temporal variation in transition probabilities).

AB Pumpkinseed sunfish (Lepomis gibbosus) typically exhibit a strong ontogenetic diet shift. Small (juvenile) pumpkinseeds feed primarily on soft-bodied littoral invertebrates and compete with small bluegill (L. macrochirus), while large (adult) pumpkinseeds feed extensively on snails. We compared pumpkinseed and snail populations in two Michigan lakes that contain bluegill (Three Lakes II and Three Lakes III) with populations inhabiting Wintergreen Lake, a lake lacking bluegill. In the absence of bluegill, pumpkinseeds were abundant and juveniles grew well; however, snail abundances were low and adult pumpkinseeds grew poorly. Furthermore, no ontogenetic diet shift to snails occurred in Wintergreen Lake, and the pharyngeal muscles and bones used to crush snails were smaller than in fish from Three Lakes II. Pumpkinseeds from Wintergreen Lake also required significantly more time to crush and handle thick-shelled snails, but not thin-shelled snails and nongastropod prey, than did fish from Three Lakes II. In a field caging experiment in Wintergreen Lake snail densities increased fourfold when pumpkinseeds were excluded.
   Historical data as well as the among-lake comparisons-suggest that the changes in Wintergreen Lake occurred in response to the selective elimination of the pumpkinseed's juvenile-stage competitor, the bluegill, via a winterkill event in the late 1970s. It appears that removal of bluegill released juvenile pumpkinseeds from competition and increased pumpkinseed recruitment into the adult stage, which resulted in the overexploitation of the adults' snail resource. These events then led to changes in adult pumpkinseed diet, growth, morphology, and feeding ability. These data are consistent with predictions from a two-stage life history model developed for the pumpkinseed-bluegill interaction and illustrate some of the important indirect consequences of interactions involving stage-structured populations.

AB The degree of spatial dependence in a landscape can be modeled by varying the landscape's fractal dimension, D. I simulated landscapes in which D varied independently of environmental variability. Individuals of 10 species with modes placed evenly along the dominant environmental gradient were randomly placed on these landscapes and were allowed to reproduce, disperse, and compete. The results demonstrate that the effect of a landscape's environmental variability on species coexistence is affected by the degree of spatial dependence in a complex manner. Increasing the fractal dimension (decreasing spatial dependence) allows more species to exist per microsite and per landscape. However, extremely high fractal dimensions cause fewer species to coexist on the landscape scale. Observed habitat breadths are increased (and beta diversity is decreased) as a function of D. I suggest that these patterns can be explained by habitat area, the mass effect, ecological equivalency, and global biological constraints.

AB Aging may be a consequence of mutation accumulation or of negative pleiotropic correlations between performance late and earlier in the lifespan. This study used artificial selection on flies derived from two different base stocks to produce "young" and "old" lines, propagated by breeding from young and old adults respectively. Virgin and mated adults of both sexes from the "old" lines lived longer than "young" line flies. "Young" and "old" mated females did not differ in fecundity or fertility early in the lifespan, but "old" line females had higher fecundity and fertility late in life. The results therefore suggested either that the response to selection had revealed the effect of mutation accumulation, or that pleiotropy involving characters other than early fecundity must have been involved. Development time from egg to adult was longer in the "old" lines. Competition of selected line larvae from one base stock against mutant marked larvae from the same base stock revealed that, at a wide range of larval densities, "old" line larvae showed lower survival rates than "young" line larvae. Thorax length and wet weight were significantly greater in the "old" line flies from one base stock. The results may imply that the selection regime in the "old" lines favored extended growth during development to produce a more durable adult soma, despite the cost in increased larval mortality and delayed reproduction, because the potential reproductive benefits later in life were increased. However, the differences between larvae from "old" and "young" lines could also be attributable to density differences, and this possibility needs systematic investigation.

AB Parapatric speciation across sharp ecological gradients is an alternative to the more usual allopatric model as both a general explanation of organismal diversification and as an explicit statement regarding differentiation of tropical forest biotas (Endler, 1977, 1982a, 1982b). The relevance of this model to species of small mammals distributed across a 3,000 meter gradient on the eastern flank of the Peruvian Andes is examined here by phylogenetic analysis of comparative mitochondrial DNA sequences, relying on both freshly collected samples and extracts taken from skins preserved in museum collections. These analyses falsify the applicability of the gradient model in this case. Moreover, the phylogenetic approach employed here provides an explicit test of the feasibility of the gradient model for any other taxon, either plant or animal, of the lowland Amazonian forest.

Parents were offered supplemental food during the nestling period and the following variables compared with those from non food-supplemented pairs: (1) nesting success, (2) fledgling number, (3) fledgling mass and linear body size, (4) proportion of fledglings resighted (a) after transition to independence from the parents, and (b) after the first winter postfledging, and (5) the probability that a fledgling became a breeder. Food-supplemented pairs had a higher nesting success and produced more fledglings. The fledglings of food-supplemented pairs were heavier and bigger in tarsus length than controls, but experimental and control fledglings were seen in equal proportions both after transition to independence and after the first winter. The production of potential breeders was increased ninefold in food-supplemented pairs. The study demonstrates that in this urban habitat food limitation causes low fitness not through lowered survival, but through the production of a low number of potential breeders.

AB We examined effects of natural and experimentally created reductions in food abundance on the reproductive ecology of Black-throated Blue Warblers (Dendroica caerulescens). The study was carried out between 1982 and 1985 on four 30-ha plots of temperate deciduous forest within and near the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA. Experimental food reduction using aerially sprayed Bacillus thuringiensis created significant differences in caterpillar biomass between one sprayed and two unsprayed plots throughout the breeding season in 1983. Where caterpillar abundance was reduced, Black-throated Blue Warblers made significantly fewer nesting attempts and diets of nestlings included fewer caterpillars. Clutch size, hatching success, and number of young fledging per nest did not differ among the food reduction site and controls. Also, the reduced number of nesting attempts per pair on the food reduction site in 1983 did not significantly lower production of young per pair. No detectable differences in caterpillar biomass between sprayed and unsprayed sites were created in 1984 or 1985 because natural caterpillar abundances were already low.
   Natural declines in food abundance for Black-throated Blue Warblers occurred from 1982 through 1985, primarily because of a decrease in caterpillar abundances. Significant reductions in number of young fledging per nest, nestling growth rates and survival, and number of nests attempted per pair corresponded with the natural decline in food abundance. Of those measures, a reduced number of nesting attempts per pair lowered annual production the most. When effects of food limitation were calculated separately from those of nest predation, food limited annual breeding productivity to below that needed to balance annual mortality in at least one of the four years of this study. These findings indicate that neotropical migrant bird species are probably limited periodically by food when breeding in north-temperate habitats.

AB A classical data set is used to predict the effect of selection on sexual dimorphism and on the population means of three characters - stature, span, and cubit - in humans.  Given selection of equal intensity, the population means of stature and of cubit should respond more than 60 times as fast as dimorphism in these characters.  The population mean of span should also respond far more rapidly than dimorphism, but no numerical estimate of the ratio of these rates was possible.  These results imply that sexual dimorphism in these characters can evolve only very slowly.  Consequently, hypotheses about the causes of sexual dimorphism cannot be tested by comparing the dimorphism of different human societies.  It has been suggested that primate sexual dimorphism may be an allometric response to selection for larger body size.  We show that such selection can indeed generate sexual dimorphism, but that this effect is too weak to account for the observed relationship between dimorphism and body size in primates.

AB We investigated a simulation model of neighborhood competition and compared the predictions of this model to empirical patterns of ant diversity and spatial arrangement. We modeled two kinds of competition: mortality of juveniles that found nests near established colonies and competition between established colonies through local crowding. The results of the model indicated that spatial arrangement is affected by the relative strength of intra- and interspecific competition as well as by colony birth and date rates. Thus regular spatial arrangement of colonies cannot be used as a test of any type of competitive effects, since other spatial arrangements can also result from strong competition between colonies. Regular intraspecific spatial arrangement is most readily produced by increased mortality of young colonies that settle near established conspecifics (no competition between species). In these model communities, spacing is increasingly regular as density increases (density-dependent spacing). Where competition occurs only between established colonies, nest spacing is random, and the spatial statistics are not related to nest density. Persistence was defined as the length of time that all species in a simulation coexisted. Where competition was intense, intra- and interspecifically, persistence in generations was increased by low colony death rates and by large absolute numbers of colonies. The adult-adult component of interspecific competition is relatively less important to species persistence than are adult-juvenile effects.

AB Evolutionary host-size models assume that host quality for parasitoid growth and development is a linear function of host size. To test this assumption, we compared the growth patterns of the hymenopteran parasitoid Aphidius ervi when it developed in different nymphal instars of apterous pea aphids, Acyrthosiphon pisum. At daily intervals, unparasitized aphids and aphids that were parasitized at age 24, 48, 72, and 120 h (corresponding to nymphal instars L1-L4) were dissected. We weighed parasitoid larvae and host remains to determine changes in their relative growth rates, based on wet mass (WM) and dry mass (DM). The growth in DM of unparasitized aphids followed a sigmoid curve. Aphids that were parasitized by A. ervi continued to grow for 5-7 d before their DM started to decline. Trajectories of the parasitoid's growth during its larval and pupal stages could be described by nonlinear equations. The maximum larval DM and the time from oviposition to adult eclosion of parasitoids varied with host age at parasitization, and thus suggested differences in host quality. We propose that, for parasitoids developing in growing and feeding stages of the host, host quality is not a linear function of host size at parasitization but reflects the degree of integration of the two systems.

AB Mechanisms of interactions between Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and red alder (Alnus rubra) seedlings were assessed in experimentally manipulated stands. The density of each species was varied systematically, creating a matrix of competitive regimes that consisted of five monoculture densities and 25 mixtures of all possible pairwise combinations of the monoculture densities. Response surfaces for growth rates, leaf area, photon flux density, soil moisture content and depletion, and plant water potential were generated within the matrix. Regression coefficients quantified the effects of species densities on response variables, and correlation analysis yielded insight into interrelationships between variables. Tree performance, leaf area per square metre of ground surface area, resources, and physiological variables were all quantitatively altered by alder density, Douglas-fir density, and the interaction between species densities.
   Alder was the dominant competitor and overtopped the Douglas-fir. Competition for light was mediated by density effects on the leaf area of each species per square metre of ground surface area. Increasing alder leaf area reduced the light reaching the understory Douglas-fir. In contrast, increasing Douglas-fir leaf areas increased the light penetrating through to the understory conifers, due to Douglas-fir's suppression of alder leaf area per square metre. Soil moisture limitations were also created by increasing the density of both species and resulted in increasingly negative leaf water potentials for both species. Growth rates concurrently declined as plant water stress increased. Response variables were assembled into a conceptual modeling proposing how species density regulated growth through the interactions between resource limitations and impairment of physiological function.

AB Life history theory suggests that the optimal evolved level of reproductive effort (RE) for an organism depends upon the degree to which additional current reproductive investment reduces future reproductive output. Future reproduction can be decreased in two ways, through (i) decreases in the organism's survival rate, and/or (ii) decreases in the organism's growth (and hence subsequent fecundity). The latter tradeoff-that is, the "potential fecundity cost"-should affect the evolution of RE only in species with relatively high survival rate, a relatively high rate of fecundity increase with body size, or a relatively high reproductive frequency per annum. Unless these conditions are met, the probable benefit in future fecundity obtained from decreasing present reproductive output is too low for natural selection to favor any reduction in RE below the maximum physiologically possible. Published data on survival rate, reproductive frequency and relative clutch mass (RCM) suggest that many lizard species fall well below the level at which natural selection can be expected to influence RE through such "potential fecundity" tradeoffs. Hence, the relative allocation of resources between growth and reproduction is unlikely to be directly optimized by natural selection in these animals. Instead, energy allocation should influence the evolution of RE only indirectly, via effects on an organism's probability of survival during reproduction. Survival costs of reproduction may be the most important evolutionary determinants of RE in may reptiles, and information on the nature and extent of such costs is needed before valid measures of reptilian RE can be constructed.

AB Presence of the invertebrate predator Chaoborus americanus induces Daphnia pulex to assume an alternate, less vulnerable morphology, characterized by small protuberances (neck teeth) on the dorsal anterior margin of the head.  Whereas previous studies on the demographic characteristics of this induced morphology in single genotypes indicated an unavoidable "cost" (delayed maturity), the results of this study indicate substantial genetic variance for induced life-history response.  In addition, the degree of neck-tooth expression, while genetically variable, is a poor predictor of clone-specific life-history changes and fitness gain in the presence of Chaoborus predation.  These results reveal several important characteristics of this system of inducible defense.  First, the most notable trait of the morph (neck teeth) varies among genotypes.  Therefore, the induced morph does not represent an on-off state.  Second, the relative expression of neck teeth among clones is a poor predictor of induced life-history changes or of relative gain in fitness in the presence of Chaoborus predation.  This fact suggests that induced characteristics other than neck teeth may cause the reduced vulnerability of the induced morph.  Third, the life-history consequences of induction are highly variable among genotypes, which indicates substantial genetic variance for life-history plasticity.  Although some genotypes express delayed maturity in the induced morph, this is not a general result.

AB Medium to small woody plants of North America tend to look leggy as a result of their relatively thick lateral branches.  In contrast, trees that regularly attain great size have relatively thinner, shorter laterals.  These differences in body plan arise from differences in the intensity and frequency of inhibition of lateral branches.  This correlation between maximum attainable size and branching habit supports several lines of speculation concerning the limits to size in woody plants.  A simple verbal model, based on the economics of photosynthetic gain versus structural costs, accounts for both the observed limits and the correlation between size and branching habits.  We conclude that life-history differences may account for much of the unexplained variation in the arrangement of branches in woody plants.

AB The magnitude and direction of phenotypic selection on emergence date and seedling size in Erigeron annus was measured to determine the heterogeneity of selection among sites and the proportion of fitness variance explained by seedling size and emergence date.  Three disturbance treatments (open, annual vegetation, perennial vegetation) were imposed to test the hypothesis of stronger selection on seedlings in competitive environments.  Selection was most heterogeneous early in the life cycle, with significant spatial heterogeneity in the magnitude of selection on a local scale.  The disturbance treatments affected only fecundity selection gradients and selection was strongest in open plots.  Significant variation in the sign of selection differentials on emergence date was observed for establishment and fall viability selection episodes; at later stages selection varied in magnitude but not direction.  Seedlings in the earliest cohort experienced high mortality during establishment, but increased size and fecundity later in the life cycle.  Both stabilizing and disruptive selection on emergence date were observed during establishment, but in general selection was purely directional.  At Stony Brook most selection on emergence date operated indirectly through seedling size, whereas at the Weld Preserve direct selection was stronger.  There were persistent effects of both seedling emergence date and rosette diameter on adult fitness components, and October rosette diameter explained 18% of the total phenotypic variance in fecundity.  Overall, viability fitness components were much more important than fecundity selection.  Winter survivorship was the single most important episode of selection.

AB Genetic variation for seedling and adult fitness components was measured under natural conditions to determine the relative importance of the seedling stage for lifetime fitness in Erigeron annuus. Variation in lifetime reproductive success can result from both the persistent effects of genetic variation expressed among seedlings and from variation in adult fitness components. Analysis of covariance was used to separate the stage specific from the cumulative effects of genetic variance expressed earlier in the life cycle. E. annuus produces seeds through apomixis, which allowed measurement of the fitness of replicate genotypes from germination through the entire life cycle. There were significant differences among genotypes for date of emergence, seedling size, survivorship and fecundity, but heritabilities were low, indicating slow response to selection. For all characters, environmental components of variance were one to two orders of magnitude larger than genetic variance components, resulting in broad sense heritabilities less than 0.1. For seedling size and fecundity, all of the genetic variance was in the form of genotype-environment interactions, often with large negative genetic correlations across environments. In contrast, genotypes differed in mean survivorship through one year, but there were no genotype-environment interactions for viability. Genetic differences in viability were primarily expressed as differences in overwinter survivorship. Genotype x environment interactions among sites and blocks were generated early in the life cycle while the genotype x environment interactions in response to competitive environment (open, annual cover, perennial cover) first appeared in adult fecundity. Genetic variation in lifetime fitness was not significant, despite a fourfold difference in mean fitness among genotypes.

AB In a montane rain forest at almost-equal-to 2500 m in Venezuela we fertilized plots with N, with P, or with N and P for 4.5 yr. We measured trunk growth in circumference in control plots and in those fertilized with N and P, and measured litterfall in all four treatments. There were five 12 x 12 m plots per treatment. N was applied at 225 kg.ha-1.yr-1 and P at 75 kg.ha-1.yr-1 for the first 2 yr, and subsequently N was applied at 150 kg.ha-1.yr-1 and P at 50 kg.ha-1.yr-1.
   Rates of trunk growth in N and P fertilized plots were roughly double those in control plots (1.4 vs. 0.6 mm/yr). Total litterfall averaged 4.3 Mg.ha-1.yr-1 in the control plots. In the 4th yr after fertilization litterfall was significantly higher in plots fertilized with N + P (1.50 g.m-2.d-1) than in control plots (1.00 g.m-2.d-1). There were no significant differences in rates of litterfall between treatments during the first 3 yr after the first fertilization.
   The changes of rates of litterfall with time were significantly different between treatments. Litterfall in control plots fell by 9% per year, that in P-fertilized plots fell by 5% per year, and litterfall in N- and in N + P-fertilized plots remained approximately constant. Nitrogen concentrations in litterfall were unaffected by fertilization with N or with P. Phosphorus concentrations were significantly increased by P fertilization. We conclude that N is more limiting than P in this forest.

AB We constructed a discrete-time model for growth and reproduction of the cladoceran Daphnia and solved it numerically for resource allocation patterns to maximize the intrinsic rate of increase r under various environmental conditions.  Conditions modeled include different functional forms for the size dependencies of predation risk and net production.  Growth after maturity can maximize r when net production and survival rate increase with body size.  The optimal period for growth after maturity increases with the reproductive life span, but the life span need not be long to favor growth.  The shape of the net production curve influences the extent to which body size is increased by delaying maturity or by growing after maturity.  When net production increases with body size but survival rate does not, growth after maturity is not optimal.  However, simultaneous allocation to growth and reproduction can occur in the instar (time step) preceding maturity.

AB The idea that plant polyphenols act as digestibility-reducing compounds is well entrenched. This hypothesis has recently been countered with the proposal that the presence of surfactants in the gut fluids of herbivores may preclude the digestibility-reducing effects of plant polyphenols. We examined three marine isopods, three limpets, and a rock lobster, and established that surfactants are present in the digestive fluids of all of these organisms. However, further determinations of the efficacy with which these surfactants can prevent the complexation of proteins by brown-algal polyphenols in vitro revealed substantial differences between species. Moreover, in cases where the surfactants were ineffective, polyphenols reduced in vitro digestibility in a dose-dependent manner. We therefore conclude that the presence of gut surfactants does not necessarily preclude protein precipitation by polyphenols in vivo. Thus polyphenols might still be regarded as digestibility-reducing compounds, since gut surfactants only counter these effects in some cases.

AB Although the possibility of complex dynamical behaviors-limit cycles, quasiperiodic oscillations, and aperiodic chaos-has been recognized theoretically, most ecologists are skeptical of their importance in nature. In this paper we develop a methodology for reconstructing endogenous (or deterministic) dynamics from ecological time series. Our method consists of fitting a response surface to the yearly population change as a function of lagged population densities. Using the version of the model that includes two lags, we fitted time-series data for 14 insect and 22 vertebrate populations. The 14 insect populations were classified as: unregulated (1 case), exponentially stable (three cases), damped oscillations (six cases), limit cycles (one case), quasiperiodic oscillations (two cases), and chaos (one case). The vertebrate examples exhibited a similar spectrum of dynamics, although there were no cases of chaos. We tested the results of the response-surface methodology by calculating autocorrelation functions for each time series. Autocorrelation patterns were in agreement with our findings of periodic behaviors (damped oscillations, limit cycles, and quasiperiodicity). On the basis of these results, we conclude that the complete spectrum of dynamical behaviors, ranging from exponential stability to chaos, is likely to be found among natural populations.

AB Male and female lacewings tremulate during courtship, establishing duets that always precede copulation.  Three distinct courtship songs are found in populations of the green lacewing Chrysoperla plorabunda (P1, P2 and P3 song morphs).  Analysis of five features of the songs for individuals collected from Connecticut, Idaho, Oregon and California showed few differences within song morphs, but sympatric song morphs differed significantly in temporal features of the songs and their mode of presentation.  Playback experiments using recorded songs were performed on females with all possible sympatric and allopatric combinations of females and recorded songs.  The results showed that females strongly prefer to duet with recordings of males of their own song type and usually showed no responses to songs of other types.  Thus, song differences are effective barriers to reproduction between the sympatric morphs.  Our results support the hypothesis that the three song morphs are true biological species.

AB Since habitats are generally spatially heterogeneous, an important component of niche variation may be determined by the relationship between individual variation in feeding among and within habitats. We characterized variation in diet among and within individual tiger salamander larvae (Ambystoma tigrinum nebulosum) among and within sites in natural ponds. We also analyzed prey variation among sites. There was significant variation in diet among sites, controlling for variation in larval size among sites. Prey taxa varied significantly among sites. There were also significant size-associated differences in diet within sites. Controlling for larval size we found no further evidence of significant interindividual differences in diet within sites. Intrapopulation variation in diet among sites is likely a consequence of adaptive phenotypic plasticity in feeding behavior of individuals on a spatially variable prey assemblage. This result supports Van Valen's hypothesis that selection should favor multiple phenotypes within populations. Variation in diet among sites is directly analogous to the within- and between-phenotype components of niche variation defined by Roughgarden. Size-associated differences in diet represent a significant ontogenetic component to niche variation in feeding within populations of larval salamanders.
   Studies of food web structure that ignore predator diet and prey differences among sites are an incomplete summary of predator-prey linkages. In addition, phenotypic plasticity in feeding behavior as a source of niche variation has implications for traditional ecological theory of intra- and interspecific interactions, which has rarely included variation other than morphological size differences among animals.

AB 1. Genetic variability in the relationship between plant size and fecundity (fecundity allocation) was investigated in 10 inbred lines (genotypes) of Arabidopsis thaliana. For each genotype, a range of plant sizes was established by planting seeds at various densities. Plant size (above-ground biomass excluding seeds), fecundity (number of seeds produced), and percentage germination of seeds were recorded for 20 individuals representative of the range of plant sizes displayed for each genotype as a result of the density treatments.
   2. There was a significant (P < 0.001) positive relationship between plant size and fecundity for all genotypes. Size-fecundity regressions were primarily linear within the range investigated and the slopes differed significantly between genotypes. The y intercepts were either significantly positive or not different from zero. Seed viability generally did not depend on the number of seeds produced.
   3. Genotypes with relatively large maximum plant sizes had relatively low fecundities. This trade-off is consistent with r/K-selection theory; such genotypes are regarded as having a 'K-type strategy'. There is no basis for predicting, however, that such a 'strategy' will confer superior fitness in contexts of competition.
   4. The rank-order of fecundity was not consistent for all plant sizes. Individual genotypes with greater-than-average fecundity when relatively large in size tended to have lower-than-average fecundity when smaller, whilst the converse was true for genotypes having lower-than-average fecundity when relatively large.
   5. The results indicate that absolute allocation to fecundity at a given plant size. and the variation in fecundity allocation across different sizes, can vary significantly at the level of the genotype in this species. This may be an important component in defining differences in fitness between individuals in the context of competition.

AB 1. The effects of increased nitrogen or phosphorus supply on the productivity of Sphagnum-dominated ombrotrophic bogs in northern and southern Sweden were studied. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition in southern Sweden (high-N site) exceeds that in northern Sweden (low-N site) by about tenfold.
   2. Vertical height growth of the Sphagnum carpet was measured by the cranked-wire method. Length growth of individuals was measured by autoradiography after labelling with (CO2)-C-14. The results of both methods were significantly correlated, but the cranked-wire data were systematically lower.
   3. Productivity of Sphagnum at the low-N site increased almost fourfold after additional nitrogen supply (4 g N m-2 year-1), but no increase was found after additional phosphorus supply (0.4 g P m-2 year-1). At the high-N site, phosphorus supply caused an almost threefold productivity increase, but nitrogen supply did not result in any productivity increase. Thus, in an area with a high atmospheric nitrogen supply, plant productivity is P-limited instead of N-limited.
   4. At an intermediate nitrogen supply (2 g N m-2 year-1) the recovery of the supplied nitrogen in the Sphagnum carpet was not different for both sites (60% and 69%, respectively). However, at a high nitrogen supply (4 g N m-2 year-1) nitrogen recovery at the low-N site significantly exceeded that at the high-N site (73% and 47%, respectively). At the low-N site, the supplied phosphorus was not recovered, but at the high-N site the phosphorus recovery was 85% (intermediate phosphorus supply) and 100% (high phosphorus supply), respectively.
   5. It is suggested that a high atmospheric nitrogen supply may affect the carbon balance of ombrotrophic bogs, because productivity is under these circumstances not N-limited, but decomposition is probably increased by high loads of nitrogen. In the end, this may turn these C-accumulating systems into C-emitting systems.

TI SEASONAL ALLOCATION OF BIOMASS AND NITROGEN IN 4 CAREX SPECIES FROM

AB 1. Allocation of biomass and nitrogen were studied for 1 year in experimental populations of Carex diandra, C. rostrata and C. lasiocarpa (species from mesotrophic fens) and C. acutiformis (a species from eutrophic fens). These species were grown at two levels of N supply (3.3 and 20.0 g Nm-2 year-1, respectively).
   2. At low N supply, total biomass did not differ between the species. At high N supply, the total biomass of C. lasiocarpa and C. acutiformis ('high-productive species') significantly exceeded that of C. diandra and C. rostrata ('low-productive species'). In all species, percentage nitrogen allocation to the leaves exceeded percentage biomass allocation to the leaves.
   3. The high-productive species had a higher shoot:root ratio, a higher percentage biomass allocation to the leaves (leaf weight ratio, LWR), a higher total nitrogen content and a higher percentage nitrogen allocation to the leaves than the low-productive species. However, the low-productive species had higher leaf nitrogen concentrations (on a weight basis) than the high-productive species.
   4. Parameters which are related to light interception, such as the specific leaf area (SLA: m2 of leaf per kg of leaf), the leaf area ratio (LAR: m2 of leaf per kg of plant), the leaf area index (LAI: m2 of leaf per m 2 of soil) and the ratio between total leaf area and total root length, did not differ consistently between the high-productive and the low-productive species.
   5. Compared with the high-productive species, the low-productive species invested relatively more biomass and nitrogen in plant parts which contribute to the acquisition of below-ground resources.
   6. At low N supply, there was a decrease in all species of the shoot:root ratio, LWR, LAR, LAI, and the ratio between total leaf area and total root length.
   7. The rank order of potential productivity of the species in this study did not match the rank order of nitrogen availability in their natural habitat. It is suggested that the distribution of these species is not only determined by their potential productivity, but also by specific demands on the water chemistry and by their competitive ability.

AB 1.  In some social mammals living in matrilineal groups, complete dispersal from the natal area is unusual, even when population density is high and reproductive performance depressed.
   2.  Female red deer on the Island of Rum (Scotland) aggregate in unstable matrilineal groups.  The degree of spatial association ('proximity') between individuals increases with their degree of relatedness as well as with their dominance rank but declines with increasing age.
   3.  As population density doubled between 1974 and 1983, the degree of spatial association between female kin declined.  At all ages, individuals spent less time close to their relatives and more with unrelated animals when population density was high.
   4.  These results emphasize that in mammals with fission/fusion societies like red deer, dispersal is a gradual process and that it does not necessarily involve the total abandonment of the natal area by individuals as they disperse.

AB 1. Demography and allometry of the dioecious tree Cecropia obtusifolia were studied in a 5-ha permanent plot at Los Tuxtlas rain forest, Mexico. Treefall gaps were aged and a significant positive correlation was found between gap age and tree size. Active regeneration of the species was suggested by the high proportion (>35%) of young individuals. The population was highly clumped among young juvenile trees and became less aggregated as density within-gaps decreased among older trees. New and successful recruitment was restricted to recently formed (<3 years since opened) and large (>100-m2) gaps. Oldest individuals (35 m high) were growing in 37-year-old gaps. 2. Tree height and stem diameter increased allometrically with a slope <1.5 in trees >0.3 m tall. The margin between the actual tree diameter (d) and the theoretical minimum buckling diameter (d(min.)) declined exponentially from c. 20 in juvenile trees to almost 1 in the oldest trees (>30 years old). Whilst the number of leaves remains fairly constant before branching, it increases linearly as the number of branches increase. Changes in area per leaf during the life cycle yield an overall allometric pattern between tree height and total leaf area. 3. Seed and seedling mortality was >99%. Reduced light, falling debris, movement of rotting logs and soil dryness were important mortality factors in pre-reproductive stages. Oldest adults died standing, apparently due to senescence. Maximum life expectancy is reached when trees attain a non-suppressed canopy position (c. 20 m high). Individuals showed high growth rates (a stem-diameter increment of up to 2cm year-1). Growth-rate variation in juvenile stages seem to be related to high environmental heterogeneity. In adult stages the number of conspecifics growing in the same gap seems to affect diameter growth rate negatively. First reproduction occured at about 3 years of age (when 10cm in diameter) and increased with age. Annual fecundity rates of individuals ranged from 1.4 x 10(4) to 1.4 x 10(7) seeds and increased allometrically with stem diameter and number of branches. 4. The most important environmental filter in the life-cycle of C. obtusifolia operates from the seedling to the juvenile stage. This finding does not support the suggestion that pioneer limitation to gap regeneration is determined during germination. The allometric and demographic traits of C. obtusifolia correspond to those expected for a shade-intolerant species that colonizes ephemeral sites, and they contrast with those of purported shade-tolerant tree species reported in the literature. However, rather than finding two clearly distinguishable types of life-histories, a continuum of demographic life-cycles was found. Therefore, the dichotomous pioneer-climax framework should be viewed as a means of identifying the extremes of a continuum of tree life histories.

AB 1. Relationships between lowland rain-forest structure, dynamics and site conditions were examined by the establishment of plots and profile diagrams within mature-phase forest at 13 sites and with permanent plots at three of these sites where trees have been enumerated over 20 years.
   2. Most forest structural measures were intercorrelated but forest stature was uncorrelated with HCl-extractable soil nutrient concentrations and was apparently related to topography, soil depth and soil water. The relationship between diameter and height varied between forests and was correlated with HCl-extractable P and Mg for dry-land sites.
   3. Tall forests generally had more slender canopy trees for a given height than short forests. Vertical stratification was associated with the presence and stand density of emergent trees, which comprise an architecturally and floristically distinct guild. Where emergents are scattered or absent, the main canopy and understorey were dense and no vertical stratification of crowns was perceptible; where emergents formed a continuous canopy, the main canopy was sparse, the understorey less dense and tree crowns were more separated into two horizontal strata. This type of forest appears to be confined to continuously moist soils on lower slopes, flat or undulating land.
   4. Leaf size in the subcanopy was positively correlated with measured soil nutrients, and with the relationship between diameter and height. Among canopy trees it was not correlated with soil nutrients, nor with other aspects of forest structure.
   5. Plots were originally established within mature phase, avoiding canopy gaps. Since establishment, gaps have accumulated within the permanent plots. Tree mortality was significantly clustered on clay soils, but not on sandy soils where windthrow was apparently less frequent and trees more often died standing.
   6. Mean proportional diameter increments of large trees were not correlated with measured soil nutrients; but mean proportional diameter increments of recruits were correlated with measured soil nutrients.
   7. A guild of tree species with the seed and/or seedling characteristics and the fast growth of pioneers, but with plagiotropic branching and crowns which reach the forest canopy or even emerge above it, was an important component of the building phase on soils with high mineral concentrations, but was sparsely distributed on other soils.
   8. Standing volume and net volume increment were dominated by the mature phase; but soil nutrients probably influenced volume increment in the building phase.
   9. Two inland forests, Bukit Mersing and Lambir, exhibited no net change in stand volume over 20 years. At Bako, a coastal forest on shallow freely draining soils, stand volume increased by 15.9% of the initial measurement. This increment occurred among trees of the largest diameter class while there was a net loss of volume in the small classes.

AB 1. Two experiments were carried out in an ancient English deciduous woodland to determine the relationship between the occurrence of gaps - unoccupied spaces - in the ground layer and the ability of Narcissus pseudonarcissus to occupy them. In the first experiment, seeds and bulbs of Narcissus were planted into gaps and their fates were followed for 10 years. A second experiment examined the survivorship, mortality, clonal growth and flowering of bulbs and seeds grown in pots at different densities in open and shaded sites.
   2. In the first experiment, bulbs planted into gaps in a shaded site performed similarly to controls (naturally established individuals). Plants growing from seeds or seedlings died, as did the controls. It is concluded that the existence and persistence of gaps is a function of the demography of the species rather than of an inherently inimical environment.
   3. In the second experiment, survivorship of established bulbs showed a more-or-less constant probability of death, whilst that of seedlings showed declining probability of mortality. Clonal growth rate was density-dependent but establishment of plants from seed was not. Mortality was density-independent, except at high density in open ground. Clonal growth was twice as fast in open ground as in shaded sites.
   4. The results of these experiments are brought together in a scheme suggesting that a wide range of densities of N. pseudonarcissus is possible at the site due to the changing balance between reproduction and mortality in a periodically disturbed environment. The implications of this conclusion are explored in relation to ground occupancy and the development of mixtures in the ground flora of ancient British woodlands.

AB 1. Epiphytes on Quercus petraea and Fraxinus excelsior were studied in the native woodlands around Loch Sunart, western Scotland, to obtain information on community variation and habitat requirements of the Lobarion pulmonariae alliance at an unpolluted site.
   2. Percentage cover data for 119 species were obtained from 207 randomly located 20-cm x 20-cm quadrats on Quercus and Fraxinus and from a further 18 quadrats subjectively sited in Lobarion communities on Quercus. Bark pH and cation levels and direct and diffuse radiation inputs (hemispherical photography) were measured for each quadrat.
   3. The bark chemical factors and radiation estimates, respectively, showed many strong inter-correlations. Mean bark pH was 0.7 units higher and mean bark Mg and K were, respectively, 1.8 and 3.7 times higher in Fraxinus than in Quercus. Bark pH was positively correlated with bark Ca in Quercus, whereas in Fraxinus, bark pH increased with girth but was unrelated to cation levels. In Quercus, bark Mg content declined with increasing altitude probably due to increasing insect defoliation of the canopy at higher altitudes. Bark pH or cation concentrations were positively correlated with soil exchangeable cation levels.
   4. Correlations between the epiphytic flora and environmental variables were explored using numerical classification (two-way indicator species analysis), indirect ordination (detrended correspondence analysis) and direct ordination (canonical correspondence analysis).
   5. Height on the bole and bark angle were identified as the most important factors influencing epiphytes. They probably determine the degree to which water is available on, or evaporated from, the bark surface. Bark pH correlated strongly with the second ordination axes but radiation was a relatively unimportant predictor of epiphyte community composition.
   6. Classification of the floristic data resulted in the recognition of eight quadrat groups. Species of the phytosociological Lobarion pulmonariae alliance were distributed between two groups, one predominantly on Quercus, the other, with richer representation of cyanobacterial lichens, on Fraxinus. Both groups were characteristic of bark with high pH and high cation levels, and were best developed in low-altitude sites, possibly indicating that acidic inputs may restrict their colonization at higher altitudes. Neither group was strongly associated with high light levels which were previously thought to be important for Lobarion lichens.

AB 1. Within the distribution area of the freshwater pearl mussel (Margaritifera margaritifera L.), the maximum observed life span attained in a population varies from 30 to 132 years and the maximum shell length from 80 to 145 mm. For both life-history traits, the growth constant k is a major determinant. The growth constant describes the shape of the average individual growth curve, the lower its value, the slower is the asymptote approached. Maximum size and life span increase as the growth constant declines and the maximum age almost equals the time necessary to complete the growth pattern.
   2. With increasing latitude, from North Spain up to the polar circle, the growth constant declines, whereas age and size increase. This must be attributed to the close relationship between the growth constant and metabolism. As temperature decreases (towards the north), metabolic rate declines and the rate of growth decreases; the asymptote is approached slowly and this leads to a long life. Simultaneously, there is probably a shift in the anabolic-catabolic-balance increasing the asymptotic size and hence the maximum size.
   3. The growth constant and maximum life span also respond to the productivity of the habitat. There is a negative correlation between growth constant and eutrophication, and the maximum life span is reduced as the concentration of nitrate increases.
   4. Implications for Bergmann's rule and for the theory of ageing are discussed. It is concluded that this variability is a case of phenotypic plasticity with no adaptive value because: (i) plasticity must be attributed to unavoidable physiological responses; (ii) between populations the relationships between maximum life span, maximum size and reproductive output are positive, whereas trade-offs would be expected if variation in life-history tactics was the source of plasticity; and (iii) the demographic consequences of plasticity may be highly disadvantageous.

AB 1. Populations of an annual plant, Abutilon theophrasti, were grown at four densities (100, 500, 1500 and 4000 m-2) and two CO2, concentrations (350 and 700 mul l-1) to examine the influence of CO2 environment on density-dependent patterns of demography and reproduction. Variables measured included survivorship, proportion of plants flowering and fruiting, number of fruiting individuals, number of seeds per individual, total seed production per population, mean seed mass, and germination of seeds produced in each environment.
   2. All variables, except the number of fruiting individuals, declined with increasing density, and at the highest density no individuals set seed. The number of fruiting individuals was highest at a density of 500m-2. In the elevated CO2 environment, survivorship was significantly reduced but the proportion of plants flowering and fruiting and the number of fruiting individuals in each population all increased. Total population seed production was higher in the elevated CO2 environment at all densities, although the differences were not significant. Significant effects of CO2, concentration were observed only for population-level variables, but not for mean individual fecundity or seed size. Seed germination declined with increasing maternal density, and no germination was recorded for seeds produced at 1500 m-2 3. Simple models of population dynamics, utilizing difference equations, were constructed to examine potential population-level consequences of these density and CO2 effects. In the absence of a persistent seed pool, the simulated populations exhibited damped or stable oscillations under low germination values, but displayed non-cyclic ('chaotic') oscillations or went extinct for higher germination due to the complete failure of seed-set at high density. Because of its higher fecundity, the elevated-CO2 population generally exhibited greater oscillations, and the critical germination value at which the simulated populations went extinct was much lower for the elevated-CO2 than for the ambient-CO2 population.

AB 1. Pollen, charcoal, chemical, physical, magnetic and tephra analyses of C-14-dated Holocene lake sediments from Dallican Water, Catta Ness, north-east Shetland, are presented and interpreted in the light of models of Holocene climatic change, the Shetland archaeological record, and local documentary evidence. The sequence was subdivided and analysed using principal components analysis, a numerical zonation of the pollen data using optimal and binary divisive techniques, and measures of palynological richness and rates of change between samples. 2. Sedimentation began at 9900 years BP, and until 9620 BP consisted of minerogenic sediments eroded from raw soils. Vegetation was herbaceous until 9500 BP, when Betula woodlands began to develop. 3. During the period 9620-7500 BP woodland diversified (Betula, Corylus avellana, Juniperus communis, Quercus, Alnus glutinosa and possibly Ulmus and Fraxinus excelsior) with tall-herb communities that included a high proportion of ferns. Lake sediments became predominantly organic as soils became more stable, with some leaching of cations, and erosion was reduced. 4. From 7500 to 5400 BP tree cover changed little, but the herb and fern communities were replaced by plants of heathland and mires. Erosion increased slightly and charcoal accumulation was high. These changes suggest the presence of Mesolithic people, and, associated with them, a mammalian herbivore (possibly red deer), which reduced the herb and fern communities by grazing. 5. After 5400 BP, vegetation passed through a series of successional stages, returning within a few hundred years to a type similar to that prevailing earlier than 7500 BP. Contemporaneously, erosion decreased as soils restabilized. Charcoal accumulation was low. We suggest that the herbivore had become extinct, and the islands became uninhabited. 6. From c. 4800 BP, Calluna vulgaris and other mire plants increased, probably due to natural soil leaching and acidification. The extent of peatland greatly increased, sealing sources of supply of erodible material. Pollen and charcoal data suggest that people were present on the island from c. 4500 BP, supporting archaeological dating for occupation of Shetland by agricultural communities. The first phase of clearance on Catta Ness was c. 4000 BP, and lasted for c. 400 years. Woodland then increased to its former levels. 7. Woodland was almost completely cleared from the area within 150 years c. 3120 BP, probably as a deliberate act to extend rough grazing. This dramatic event cannot be correlated with any known cultural changes in the Shetland archaeological record, and probably results from local human activity. Heath plants increased substantially, and sediments became more organic as erosion sources continued to diminish. 8. Vegetation and land use have remained more or less constant for the past 3000 years, despite major cultural changes, such as the building of brochs c. 2000 BP and the arrival of Norse people c. 1150 BP. Documentary evidence suggests that the area of land under cultivation on Catta Ness has not changed within the last 350 years. 9. This study has confirmed the former presence of Alnus glutinosa on Shetland, and indicated that Quercus was also present. Thus, the early Holocene woodlands of Shetland were, at least locally, more diverse than had hitherto been realized. 10.
   At least two layers of volcanic ash occur in the sediments, probably originating from Icelandic sources. A layer of basic ash c. 9300 BP is identified as the Saksunarvatn ash previously described from the Faroe Islands. A complex layer of acidic ash c. 4000 BP is probably part of the Hekla 4 ash fall. These horizons hold considerable potential as dating horizons within the Holocene of the north-east Atlantic, and contribute to understanding of the distribution of Holocene tephras in the area. This is the first complete Holocene tephra record to be obtained from the British Isles.

TI HATCHING SUCCESS OF LAPWINGS ON FARMLAND - DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HABITATS

SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY

DT Article
DE LAPWING; FARMLAND; HATCHING SUCCESS; FARMING PRACTICES; PREDATION
ID VANELLUS-VANELLUS; MAYFIELD METHOD; NEST SUCCESS; PREDATION
AB 1. Nest site choice and reproductive success of lapwings was studied during 1988-90 at a farmland site dominated by cereal crops in central Sweden.
   2. The most important factor causing breeding failures was farming operations, which accounted for 85% of all nest losses. Difference in hatching success between habitats; unsown tillage (9% hatching success), sown tillage (78%), fallow fields (31%) and grassland (67% hatching success) was an effect of different farming practices.
   3. Only 13% of the females were estimated to hatch a first clutch, but a majority (66%) of the females that lost the first clutch was estimated to lay a replacement clutch (67% hatching success), giving an estimated proportion of 55% females hatching a clutch.
   4. Although most failures were caused by farming practices, predation accounted for 14% of nest losses. Predation risk was negatively correlated to the number of close neighbours (R2 = 90%), indicating that the density of nests in the colony was very important.
   5. There was also a general anti-predator effect in large colonies, which was independent of the number of close neighbours, since nests in large colonies (>5 nests) were less likely to be robbed than solitary nests and nests in small colonies (2-5 nests).
   6. Nest survival was higher at sites far (>50 m) from trees or other perches suitable for avian predators than at those situated close to (<50 m) these perches, indicating that birds were important predators of lapwing nests.
   7. Lapwings seemed to minimize the influence of avian predators by breeding in aggregations, 92% of the nests were found in colonies (up to 28 nests), and preferring nest sites far away from perches for avian predators.
   8. Paradoxically, lapwings preferred to breed on tillage, which (when unsown) was the habitat with most nest losses. However, a majority of the failed breeders laid a replacement clutch and 57% of the females is estimated to hatch a clutch in tillage, which is slightly better than in other habitats.

AB 1. Theoretical issues on the evolution of life-history traits of birds in predictable and stable insular environments predict smaller clutch size and higher adult survival rates than on the nearby mainland.
   2. Prediction of higher adult survival rates of the blue tit Parus caeruleus L. on Corsica, where clutch size is 27% lower than in a habitat on the mainland, has been tested from capture-recapture studies using models which include both survival and recapture probabilities.
   3. Average adult survival rates for both sexes combined were similar on the mainland and the island. Females survived slightly better on the island while males survived better on the mainland.
   4. Such results do not support the assumption of a negative correlation between fecundity and adult survival and run counter to the dogma of higher survival rates of birds on islands. They are discussed in the light of the specific constraints of each environment, especially food resources. Other components than clutch size, especially post-fledging survival and age at first breeding must be involved in the trade-offs between fecundity and adult survival.

AB 1. The use of supplementary feeding experiments to investigated the relationship between food supply and clutch and egg size in birds has yielded disparate results, some authors showing an advancement in laying date and/or increased clutch size in response to additional food whereas other studies have found no effect.
   2. Here we investigate the nutritional requirements of egg formation in lesser black-backed gulls Larus fuscus L., through a series of feeding experiments providing additional food of different quality.
   3. Provision of additional food on the nesting territories did not result in a decrease in the amount of time spent away from the colony by females, although fish-fed males did spend more time on territory during the early part of the pre-laying period in a year of normal food supply.
   4. Courtship feeding rates were very low in comparison with other studies and were not influenced by provision of additional food.
   5. Providing either supplementary fish or fat during the pre-laying period demonstrated that in a year of apparent low food availability, clutch size was depressed by protein, but not energy, limitation. A second experiment, supplying either fish or cooked egg to pre-laying birds, suggested that in addition to these general protein requirements, egg production may further be limited by the supply of specific nutrients, contained in the egg, but not present in sufficient quantity in the fish supplement. The possible identity of these specific nutrients is discussed.
   6. There was no advancement in laying dates of fed birds compared with controls in the same year. This contrasts with studies on other species and suggests that clutch size may not be primarily determined by laying date in lesser black-backed gulls.
   7. Chicks hatching from the eggs laid by females receiving an egg supplement prior to laying tended to be skeletally larger and heavier on hatching, but any potential advantages of hatching from larger eggs were short-lived. There was no difference in subsequent growth or survival of chicks of egg-fed parents compared with controls.

AB 1. Spring declines are a common feature of small mammal demography. We tested the hypothesis that meadow voles from populations experiencing severe spring declines should exhibit severe stress responses as indicated by high free corticosterone levels.
   2. Three populations in southern Ontario were live-trapped intensively in the spring of 1985, all animals were bled each time, and measurements of total corticosterone, corticosterone-binding globulin (CBG), and total androgen (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone) were obtained by radioimmunoassay.
   3. Population density was correlated to stress responses: in populations with the highest densities, both males and females had the highest total corticosterone, lowest CBG, and highest free corticosterone levels; males had the highest wounding levels. However, these populations declined the least. In contrast, the population with the lowest density had males and females with the lowest total corticosterone, highest CBG, and lowest free corticosterone levels and males with the lowest wounding levels. This population declined the most.
   4. Total corticosterone and CBG levels in males were about half those in females, and in females varied significantly with reproductive condition, with lactating and pregnant females having the highest levels. Only in pregnant females was body mass positively related to total corticosterone and CBG levels and this is probably related to impending parturition. In males, androgen levels were similar among populations and not correlated to total corticosterone or CBG levels nor to body mass. In females, androgen concentrations were only 4% that of males. In males, CBG, free corticosterone, androgen levels, and wounding rates showed significant repeatability.
   5. We conclude that stress responses were not related to population demography in our study and reject the Christian stress hypothesis and the adaptive stress hypothesis of Lee and Cockburn as explanations for spring declines in this species. We propose an adaptive model to account for the differences in the hormonal response to breeding between species in which the males are semelparous and those in which males are iteroparous.

TI RULES OF THUMB FOR PREDATION HAZARD ASSESSMENT - PREDICTIONS FROM A

AB Before an animal can evaluate the benefits and costs associated with a particular behavior, it must first assess them. Since perfect information is impossible to acquire, it has been suggested that animals use simple rules of thumb to acquire information. The use of rules, however, may lead to substantially inaccurate perceptions. In this article, we present the results of a dynamic optimization model developed to study the opportunity for the evolution of rules of thumb for predation hazard assessment. There are four main conclusions from this model. First, selection will not always favor perfect estimates, if one assumes there is some cost in acquiring accurate information. There is a zone of tolerance where inaccurate perceptions perform just as well as perfect knowledge of predation hazard. This implies that animals need not have perfect, only sufficient, information in order to behave optimally. Second, this zone of tolerance is generally shifted toward overestimating predation hazard: animals that overestimate hazard will have a lower mortality than animals that underestimate hazard. Third, animals should attempt to track fluctuating predation hazard rather than act on the average predation hazard. Finally, the model is robust: several simplying assumptions can be relaxed, and the same general conclusions are reached. We suggest instances where animals are using simple rules to assess predation hazard and outline an experimental protocol to study the use of rules of thumb for predation hazard assessment.

AB 1. The wavelet transform is introduced as a technique to identify spatial structure in transect data. Its main advantages over other methods of spatial analysis are its ability to preserve and display hierarchical information while allowing for pattern decomposition. 2. Two applications are presented: simple one-dimensional simulations and a set of 200-m transect data of canopy opening measurements taken in 12 stands dominated by Pseudotsuga menziesii ranging over three developmental stages. 3. The calculation of the wavelet variance, derived from the transform, facilitates comparison based on dominant scale of pattern between multiple datasets such as the stands described. 4. The results of the analysis indicate that while canopy pattern trends follow stand development, small to intermediate disturbances significantly influence canopy structure.

AB 1. The immigration and rise to dominance of Picea abies within Fiby Forest, Sweden, was investigated by pollen and charcoal analysis of tiny (c.1-m2) bogs which contained a 4000-year record.
   2. A mixed deciduous forest that existed 4000 years ago was replaced in a stepwise manner by a boreal community. The detailed dynamics of the changeover were controlled by catastrophic disturbances 2500 and 2200 years ago.
   3. Two long periods of disturbance by burning and grazing kept the woodland open in structure. Eventual abandonment of this management practice initiated a succession that resulted in the present dominance of Picea, over 2000 years after its immigration into Fiby.
   4. A model is presented describing the role of disturbance in facilitating the response of vegetation to climatic change.

TI NEST PLACEMENT RELATIVE TO FOOD AND ITS INFLUENCE ON THE EVOLUTION OF
   AVIAN COLONIALITY
SO AMERICAN NATURALIST
LA English
DT Article
ID CLIFF SWALLOWS; INFORMATION-CENTERS; PREDATORS; BENEFIT; COST
AB A model proposed by Horn, in which he showed that animals can reduce their travel distances by nesting in the center of their foraging arena whenever food is unpredictable, is often cited as a potential cause of avian coloniality.  We investigate to what degree the model may account for the evolution of colonial nesting in cliff swallows (Hirundo pyrrhonota) and other birds.  Two critical assumptions of the model, that foraging arenas are externally bounded and that potential nesting sites are distributed uniformly, do not hold for cliff swallows.  Consequently, the model cannot apply to cliff swallows or explain why they live colonially.  Rigorous evaluation of these assumptions is necessary before testing the model for a given species because, as we show for swallows, the model's predictions can be upheld even when both assumptions are violated.  Reduction in travel distance by nesting at a central site is probably a general result for any central place forager that exploits a spatiotemporally variable food source.  This result per se does not mean that the geometrical model explains coloniality.  Because the model's critical assumptions probably seldom hold for natural populations, the model is unlikely to explain the evolution of avian coloniality in general.

AB 1. Algorithms for Dirichlet tessellation of spatial points are developed and implemented on personal computer. Up to 3000 tessellations of points in an area of any rectangular dimensions can be scaled appropriately and viewed on computer screen or output to laser printer.
   2. The program also calculates Dirichlet cell areas and their coefficient of variation (CV) as well as the average nearest neighbour distance between points.
   3. Simulations revealed the polynomial relationship between the CV and the minimum spacing between points. The relationship is used to predict the percentage of maximum spacing that is exhibited by a population. This value times the maximum spacing distance possible between objects in an area (hexagonal arrangement) yields the minimum allowed distance (MAD) that is characteristic of individuals of some territorial or 'inhibitive' species.
   4. The program and relationship were used to analyse the spatial attack patterns of the bark beetles, Dendroctonus brevicomis LeConte, Tomicus piniperda (L.), and Pityogenes chalcographus (L.) and determine their MADs. All three species exhibited spacing between attack sites, in agreement with known behavioural mechanisms that are proposed for avoiding intraspecific competition for food resources.

AB 1. The generation of shoot thrust was measured in eight contrasted herbaceous species (Arrhenatherum elatius, Bromus erectus, Campanula rotundifolia, Cerastium fontanum, Hypericum perforatum, Koeleria macrantha, Poa trivialis and Urtica dioica) using a framework of weighted windows that could be opened by an expanding shoot.
   2. The species that occur as vegetation dominants in their usual habitats (A. elatius, B. erectus and U. dioica) were found to have the greatest ability to generate thrust.
   3. To test the prediction that shoot thrust was positively related to competitive ability, additional data were obtained by growing all eight species together in a productive turf in a glasshouse.
   4. The rate of development of thrust was positively correlated with an index of competitive ability obtained in the productive, undisturbed conditions of the mixture experiment.
   5. When associated with certain other attributes such as a tall leaf canopy, shoot thrust may be an important characteristic influencing the ability to forage for resources during competition and the potential of a plant to attain dominance in vegetation.

AB 1.  The insect wing appears to degenerate with use, so that wing wear increases with increased flight activity.  Wing degeneration may affect an insect's mortality.
   2.  The rate of mortality is known to increase with age in worker bumble bees.  This study examines whether wing wear can account for mortality in foraging bumble bees.
   3.  Workers in eight wild-foraging colonies of bumble bee (Bombus melanopygus Nylander) were divided into two treatment groups:  clipped (the outer margin of each forewing trimmed, reducing wing surface area by an average of 18%) and unclipped controls.  The mortality and behaviour of foraging individuals was assessed with colony watches and night censuses.
   4.  Treatment did not detectably affect the proportion of foraging bees, the lengths of foraging or within-nest bouts of foragers, or pollen load sizes, but wing-clipping did cause bees with the greatest amounts of initial wing wear to stop foraging.
   5.  Mortality was positively related to natural wing wear among unclipped bees.  In addition, relative to control foragers, foragers with clipped wing margins experienced significantly reduced life expectancies.
   6.  These results support the hypothesis that wing wear is a proximate factor responsible for an increase in mortality in older workers.  The wing-wear hypothesis therefore provides one functional reason for foragers to adopt a currency that maximizes the ratio of net benefit to cost (i.e. 'efficiency').

AB 1. Sibling competition can de defined as operating when there is a density-dependent reduction in growth, survival or reproduction in closely interacting siblings utilizing the same space and resources relative to the growth, survival or reproduction that occurs when siblings are not interacting. This definition should be distinguished from hypotheses that make predictions about the intensity of inter-actions between siblings relative to those between non-siblings at the same density.
   2. Two general classes of theoretical model incorporate sibling competition: one concerns the evolution of sex, the other seed germination-dormancy patterns. Unfortunately, the lack of documentation of sibling competition as a significant selection pressure in nature limits the utility of models that attempt to explain the evolution of specific life-history features in response to sibling competition. At present there is little support for the notion that interactions between siblings are more severe than between genetically unrelated non-siblings.
   3. Life-history factors likely to promote sibling competition include fruit, seed and dispersal dimorphisms, synaptospermy, amphicarpy, cleistogamy, barochory, the phalanx growth pattern, and low growth habit.
   4. Future research should focus on determining: (i) how widespread sibling competition is in plant populations, including an assessment of its relative importance as a selection pressure; (ii) the relation of sibling competition to plant breeding and dispersal systems; (iii) the importance and relevance of sibling competition to models that attempt to explain the evolution of sex or seed-dormancy patterns; (iv) the influence of sibling competition on population genetic structure; (v) the possibility that some plants may benefit from sibling interactions (kin selection).

AB 1. Data are presented comprising the first quantitative survey lice from Neotropical birds. The data were collected in the Andean foothills of south-eastern Peru using a novel scheme for quantitative sampling of ectoparasites from freshly killed hosts.
   2. In total, 685 birds representing 127 species in 26 families were sampled for lice; 327 (47.7%) birds were parasitized, with a mean intensity of 6.6 lice per bird and a mean richness of 1.1 louse species per host species.
   3. The bulk of variation in louse load was among host species nested within genera, although some variation occurred at higher taxonomic levels.
   4. Lice were extremely host-specific; nearly all species were restricted to a single species of host (monoxenous).
   5. Thirteen metapopulations of lice (10%) had significantly skewed sex ratios, of which four were skewed toward males, representing the first male-biased sex ratios reported for chewing lice. Thirty-four metapopulations (27%) had significantly skewed age ratios and showed an overall bias toward adults.
   6. Results are discussed in relation to current life-history theory and are compared with the findings of a recent survey of lice from temperate-zone birds. Tropical lice are neither more speciose nor more abundant than temperate-zone lice, which is consistent with the view that the environment for chewing lice is delimited by the body of the host rather than by 'external' conditions.
   7. Non-quantitative host-parasite records are reported for lice collected from an additional 75 birds representing 45 species in 20 families.

TI EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND POPULATION FLUCTUATIONS IN SOAY SHEEP
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE DEMOGRAPHY; EARLY DEVELOPMENT; SHEEP; CYCLES
ID FEMALE RED DEER
AB 1. In the Soay sheep population of Hirta (St. Kilda), high winter mortality occurs every 3-4 years following summers when population density exceeds 2.2 sheep ha-1. During these die-offs, more than 50% of adults, 70% of yearlings and 90% of lambs die and population density falls by around 65%.
   2. This paper investigates the extent to which density-related changes in early growth might be responsible for fluctuations in over-winter survival and population size. Individual differences in birth weight and subsequent growth rates exert a strong influence on the survival of lambs through the neonatal period and through the first winter of life when the effects of population density on survival have been taken into account.
   3. High population density in summer is associated with reductions in the weight of lambs entering the winter and low birth weights the following spring. Density-related changes in birth weight are closely correlated with changes in neonatal mortality. However, annual variation in neonatal mortality contributes little to fluctuations in population size.
   4. Despite the relationship between individual variation in birth weight and survival through the first winter, density-related changes in the weight of lambs at birth and at 4 months contributed little to density-related changes in survival through the first winter. This was primarily because birth weight and early growth were most heavily depressed in springs that followed die-offs and were followed by winters when mortality (and density) were low. These results indicate that density-related changes in lamb growth are unlikely to be an important cause of die-offs in this population.

AB 1. We consider models for host-parasitoid interactions in spatially patchy environments, where in each generation specified fractions of the host and parasitoid subpopulations in each patch move to adjacent patches. In most previous work of this general kind, the movement is not localized in this way, but involves 'global' mixing of the populations prior to dispersal.
   2. A remarkable range of dynamical behaviour is exhibited by a mathematically explicit model with constant host reproductive rate, deterministically unstable local dynamics and dispersing hosts and parasitoids that only move to nearest-neighbour patches in a density-independent way. The density of the host and parasitoid subpopulations in a two-dimensional array of patches may exhibit complex patterns of spiral waves, spatial chaos, a so-called static 'crystal lattice' pattern, or they may become extinct. The probability of extinction rises rapidly when the number of patches present decreases below some characteristic arena size which varies with the scale of the spatial dynamics.
   3. The different types of spatial dynamics that are observed depends critically on the fractions of hosts and adult parasitoids that disperse in each generation from the patches in which they emerged. Low rates of host dispersal tend to lead to chaotic patterns unless this Tate is very low and parasitoid dispersal rates very high, in which case 'crystal lattice' patterns may occur. Intermediate to high rates of host dispersal tend to result in spiral patterns. The effect of varying host rates of increase, within-patch parasitism that is inherently stabilizing and random patch-to-patch variation are also discussed.
   4. The results are relatively insensitive to the details of the interaction. Thus, a similar range of behaviour (spirals, chaos and crystal lattices) is discernible from a very general 'cellular automaton' model in which only qualitative categories of patch densities are specified together with a very simple set of 'transition rules'. The diffusive dispersal of the explicit model is parallelled by making the new state in each generation depend, not only on the current state of the given 'cell', but also on the states of a specified set of neighbouring cells.

TI DENSITY-DEPENDENT MATING SUCCESS AND COLOR POLYMORPHISM IN FEMALES OF

AB 1. Female-limited colour polymorphism is very common in odonates.  One of the forms has male-like colouring (androchromotypics), while the other(s) is cryptic (gynochromotypics). Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain the maintenance of this polymorphism: (1) higher reproductive isolation of androchromotypics, balanced by higher predation on this form; (2) androchromotypics avoid unnecessary long matings, but suffer greater predation; and (3) androchromotypics avoid male harassment at high density, but have lower mating success at low density.
   2. To test these hypotheses I measured survivorship and mating success of andro- and gynochromotypic females of Ischnura graellsii in two natural populations with different densities in Galicia (NW Spain).
   3. Contrary to the predictions of hypotheses 1 and 2, mean longevity and daily survival rate was the same for andro- and gynochromotypics.
   4. Mating success was the same for andro- and gynochromotypics at high density but the proportion of unmated females was greater in andro- than gynochromotypics at low density. Furthermore, androchromotypics mated with longer inter-copula intervals at high density, and mating duration was also density-dependent. These results suggest that hypothesis 3 is the most appropriate to explain the maintenance of the polymorphism.
   5. Androchromotypics were larger than gynochromotypics in the high density population. As body size is related to larval nourishment, this suggests an effect of larval competition on the maintenance of polymorphism.
   6. It is proposed that both the mating behaviour of this species (long copulations) and the existence of changes in population density during the season are the main factors that maintain the polymorphism in I. graellsii.

AB 1.  Are local ecological communities ever saturated with species?  That is, do they ever reach a point where species from the regional pool are unable to invade the local habitat because of exclusion by resident species?
   2.  We review the theoretical evidence for saturation in various community models and find that non-interactive models predict the absence of saturation as expected, but that interactive models do not uniformly predict saturation.
   3.  Instead, models where coexistence is based on niche space heterogeneity predict saturation, whereas those where coexistence is based upon spatial heterogeneity yield mixed predictions.
   4.  Thus, theory says that species interactions are a necessary but not sufficient condition for local saturation in ecological time.
   5.  We then argue that unsaturated (Type I) assemblages are likely to be ubiquitous in nature and that even saturated (Type II) assemblages may not show hard limits to richness over evolutionary time-scales.
   6.  If local richness is not often saturated, then regional richness is freed from local constraint, and other limits on regional richness (which, in turn, limit local richness) become important, including phylogenetic diversification over evolutionary time-scales.
   7.  Our speculations inevitably suggest that the principal direction of control for species richness is from regional to local.  If correct, then the key to community structure may lie in extrinsic biogeography rather than in intrinsic local processes, making community ecology a more historical science.

AB 1. In the view of the contrasting ecologies of the closely related species Veronica chamaedrys, V. montana and V. officinalis, the morphological effects of changes in light quality and quantity were investigated using the technique of growth analysis. By definition, the term 'weight ratio' refers to the quotient of the dry weight of a particular organ to the total dry weight of the plant.
   2. Three light climates were investigated: unshaded; muslin shaded (c. 37% full daylight, with no change in light quality); canopy shaded, using Ricinus zanzibariensis, also about 37% full daylight, but with lowered red:far-red (R:FR) ratio.
   3. There were no species differences in relative growth rate (the efficiency of growth) or unit leaf rate (the assimilatory efficiency of the leaves). Although both rates fell with photon flux density (PFD), only relative growth rate decreased when R:FR ratio was also lowered.
   4. Leaf area ratio (total leaf area as a quotient of total dry weight per plant) and specific leaf area (the relative thinness of the leaves) increased with reduced PFD, although the magnitude was species specific, with V. officinalis being least susceptible to change. Low R:FR ratio partially inhibited the increase of leaf area ratio in V. montana and both specific leaf area and leaf area ratio in V. chamaedrys, whereas it had no influence on V. officinalis.
   5. Whilst leaf weight ratio was stable in V. officinally, it was significantly smaller under low PFD in both V. chamaedrys and V. montana. Leaf weight ratio was further reduced by low R:FR ratio in V. montana.
   6. Stem weight ratio and petiole weight ratio were increased by both low PFD and low R:FR ratio. Stem weight ratio was ranked in the order V. chamaedrys > V. montana > V. officinalis. V. montana allocated most biomass to petiole. In full light V. chamaedrys and V. officinalis had similar petiole weight ratios but V. officinalis exhibited a greater increase when shaded.
   7. Root weight ratio fell with PFD. Sensitivity to R:FR ratio was manifest only in V. officinalis, which consistently had the greatest root weight ratio of the three species whereas V. montana had the lowest.
   8. The ability to increase stem weight ratio in response to shading, whilst simultaneously reducing leaf weight ratio and root weight ratio, is suggested as maximizing the carbohydrate economy of the plant. On this premise, V. officinalis is least well adapted to long-term shading, whilst V. chamaedrys and V. montana are equally well suited.
   9. Growth form in all three species dictates that increasing stem and petiole biomass results in greater horizontal spread and may confer the ability to forage for light. With respect to both the proportion of biomass allocated to stem, and its sensitivity to PFD and R:FR ratio, V. officinalis exhibits least propensity to forage. The petioles of both V. officinalis and V. montana may be of particular importance for the acquisition of light in shaded habitats.

AB 1. The growth responses of Veronica chamaedrys, V. montana and V. officinalis to five levels of irradiance in conjunction with dry, normal and waterlogged soil were investigated using growth analysis.
   2. There were no significant differences between species in either relative growth rate (RGR) or unit leaf rate (ULR) and both rates fell with lowered irradiance. Reductions caused by waterlogging were greater than those caused by drought. Water regime had more influence on RGR than did irradiance.
   3. Low irradiance caused increases in leaf area ratio (LAR), specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf weight ratio (LWR), although increases in LAR and SLA were suppressed by either soil water deficit or saturation. For both V. chamaedrys and V. montana, waterlogging had the more suppressive effect. Mean SLA in V. officinalis, calculated across the five irradiances, was the same between normally watered plants and those subject to drought. Drought had no effect on LWR in either V. chamaedrys or V. montana. whereas it was increased by waterlogging. In contrast, LWR in V. officinalis remained unaffected by waterlogging but was decreased by drought.
   4. Stem and petiole data were combined. The compound weight ratio increased with decreasing irradiance and also with increasing soil water content, although the effect of water treatment was dominant over that of irradiance.
   5. Regression analysis demonstrated a positive, linear relationship between root weight ratio (RWR) and irradiance. Root weight ratio also increased with decreasing soil water content and was, in fact, influenced primarily by water treatment. Of the three species, V. officinalis had the highest RWR and showed the greatest reduction in RWR under low irradiance. Overall, waterlogged V. chamaedrys suffered the largest reduction in RWR.
   6. Given its low RWR and high LAR and SLA, V. montana would be unable to optimize water use in environments in which low soil water potential was concurrent with high irradiance. In fact, V. montana suffered leaf chlorosis under these conditions. V. officinalis possesses a high RWR but low LAR and SLA and was tolerant of both waterlogging and drought, irrespective of irradiance. Of the three species, V. chamaedrys was least tolerant of waterlogging. At low irradiances the shade responses of V. montana would enable it to maintain a more-favourable carbohydrate balance than V. officinalis, irrespective of water regime.

AB 1. Veronica chamaedrys, V. montana and V. officinalis were grown in either shaded or unshaded conditions in a field experiment lasting 18 months. V. officinalis failed to grow beneath shading as a result of slug grazing. Between May and October of the first year, unshaded V. officinalis had the highest relative growth rate (RGR) and shading significantly reduced RGR in both V. chamaedrys and V. montana but to a greater extent in V. chamaedrys.
   2. The proportion of biomass allocated to roots was rapidly reduced by shading, but at the end of the experiment differences between species and light environments were negligible. Root phenology was unaffected by shading. In unshaded plants, allocation to stem (SWR) was higher in both V. chamaedrys and V. montana than in V. officinalis. Shading increased SWR and allocation to petioles but only altered stem phenology. The difference in SWR between shaded and unshaded plants of V. montana became less with time. Total al location to leaves (TLWR) in unshaded plants was ranked V. montana > V. officinalis > V. chamaedrys. The contribution of dead leaves to TWLR was greatest in unshaded plants. Shading increased TLWR in V. chamaedrys but not in V. montana.
   3. In unshaded plants, biomass allocation to sexual reproduction was ranked V. officinalis > V. chamaedrys > V. montana. Whilst shading reduced allocation to sexual reproduction in V. chamaedrys, it increased allocation in V. montana. Inflorescences were subdivided into: pedicels plus peduncles; capsules plus calyces; and seeds. A second quotient ('relative allocation') was devised by expressing the biomass allocated to each of these subgroups as a proportion of the total allocated to inflorescences. Whereas shading had no influence on relative allocation in V. montana, there was an increase in the pedicel + peduncle component in V. chamaedrys. Pedicels + peduncles accounted for 50% of inflorescence biomass in unshaded V. chamaedrys, but only 30% in V. montana and V. officinalis. Relative allocation to seeds was ranked V. montana > V. of officinalis > V. chamaedrys,
   4. Growth form, photosynthetic characteristics and slug grazing all hindered the proliferation of V. officinalis under shading. V. officinalis had a high RGR and allocated c. 25% of plant biomass to inflorescences.
   5. Shading modified allocation within and between vegetative and reproductive organs of V. chamaedrys. V. chamaedrys did not acclimatize to shading; increases in SWR in the second year, coinciding with tree canopy expansion, were supplementary to those incurred in the first year.
   6. Shading had little effect on the allocation of biomass within either vegetative or reproductive organs of V. montana: changes detected in previous short-term experiments were transient. At high irradiances, V. montana was susceptible to chlorophyll photodegradation and could not sustain sexual reproductive output.

AB 1. Veronica chamaedrys, V. montana and V. officinalis were grown outside, in a loam/grit soil, for 18 months either in full light or subject to canopy shading. V. officinalis failed to grow in shade. Vegetative and reproductive organs were analysed for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium and ash. The proportion of the total amount of a particular element in a plant that is allocated to a specific organ can be expressed as a quotient of the proportion of total plant biomass (i.e. carbon) allocated to that organ. The allocation index (AI) was calculated for each element and each organ.
   2. Shading increased nitrogen and potassium concentrations in all organs, which is suggested to be symptomatic of an imbalance between nitrogen metabolism and carbon fixation. Leaf nitrogen AIs, however, were lower in shaded plants, indicating that a constrained photosynthetic activity reduces the sink strength of leaves for nitrogen.
   3. Whilst phosphorus increased in leaves of shaded V. montana, it increased in stems, pedicels and peduncles of V. chamaedrys. These particular organs of V. chamaedrys exhibit a pronounced elongation response in shade.
   4. Shading increased leaf magnesium concentrations and Als. Species means for both these quantities are inversely proportional to the availability of light in natural habitats occupied by each, which is ranked V. officinalis > V. chamaedrys > V. montana.
   5. The percentage of ash in seeds was ranked V. officinalis > V. chamaedrys > V. montana: a particular balance of mineral nutrients and energy equips each species with proportionately more of the resources that are most likely to limit seedling establishment. Shading decreased the percentage of ash in V. chamaedrys seeds: seeds produced, and probably destined to germinate, in low light have a higher ratio of energy to mineral nutrients than seeds produced in full light. The allocation of ash to seeds was not plastic in V. montana.
   6. Of the three species, roots of V. officinalis contained the highest concentrations of phosphorus and ash (total minerals), and had higher root AIs for all elements but nitrogen. The mineral nutrient characteristics of both established plants and seeds of V. officinalis are consistent with its autecology: the acquisition of nutrients and adequate provision of nutrients to seeds are vital in dry, infertile soils.
   7. Genotypic differences elucidated by this experiment, such as leaf magnesium concentration, show a gradation between the three species that accords with their individual autecologies and morphological responses to changes in irradiance.

AB 1.  Colobines are widely described as folivorous and a prediction of low basal metabolic rate appears to be supported by low activity levels, but energy budget estimates based on data from a field study of Colobus polykomos question these assumptions.
   2.  Annual diet and activity budgets are shown to change seasonally:  unripe tree seeds are the preferred food type, with increased time spent feeding during the peak of seed production.  Time spent resting is highest during wet seasons, when seeds are not available and only leaves are eaten.
   3.  The high energetic value of seeds compared to fruit flesh, young and mature leaves, is demonstrated.
   4.  Energy budgets are estimated for adult males and females (non-reproductive, pregnant and lactating), using daily energy expenditure (DEE) as maximum, and average daily metabolic needs (ADMN) as minimum values.
   5.  A simple model is employed to demonstrate that a diet of 100% seeds supplies sufficient calories for all estimates of energy intake and expenditure, whereas a diet of 100% leaves is unable to meet DEE and only the highest estimates of feeding rate (grams of leaves min-1) approach ADMN.
   6.  The advantages of detoxification, and the limitations of energy production for small-bodied fore-gut fermenters are outlined.
   7.  Evidence that C. polykomos is hypometabolic is considered, and it is concluded that the adaptations they show to periodic shortages of high energy foods are behavioural rather than physiological.

AB 1. The variable mating system of the dunnock enabled us to measure how different amounts of male help influenced reproductive success. Male help became increasingly valuable as brood size increased, but the addition of one male's help increased success more than the addition of a second male's help.
   2. Removal experiments confirmed that differences in reproductive success were caused by differences in male help.
   3. Females laid a larger clutch when they expected two males' full-time help than when expected male help was less.
   4. We used data on the value of male care to predict how males should allocate their effort between two synchronous broods. As predicted: (a) a polygynous male preferred to invest full-time in one brood rather than part-time in both, (b) in polygynandry, where two males shared two females, each male preferred to feed at different nests rather than to both help one brood and leave the other unaided.
   5. In polygynandry, a male chose to feed the brood of the female with whom he had gained a greater share of the matings (and hence paternity). However, mating share did not influence the provisioning rate of a lone male helping a female, he worked equally hard whether he gained all or just a share of the matings.
   6. Males preferred mating to chick feeding and, with two fertile females, spent most time with the female closest to laying.
   7. We conclude that with choices involving trade-offs between two mating efforts, two parental efforts, or mating versus parental effort, males chose the option which led to greatest reproductive success.

TI STUDYING THE DYNAMICS OF STRUCTURED POPULATION-MODELS - A VERSATILE
   TECHNIQUE AND ITS APPLICATION TO DAPHNIA
SO AMERICAN NATURALIST
LA English
DT Article
ID GROWTH; REPRODUCTION; INDIVIDUALS; AGE
AB We introduce a versatile model formulation, called the escalator boxcar train, that can be used to study the dynamics of populations structured by age, size, or any other physiological trait.  Spanning the entire spectrum between the classical, age-structured, Leslie matrix models and continuous-time, physiologically structured population models, it combines the computational case of the matrix models with the flexibility of the continuous-time models:  it allows the population dynamics to depend on an arbitrary number of individual characteristics and can account for nonlinear interactions of the population with its (fluctuating) environment, for density dependence in individual behavior, and for a continuous reproduction process.  Application of the technique to a model for the dynamics of a Daphnia population reveals that a food-dependent maturation delay induces a very specific type of population cycle, in which the demography of the population plays a major role.  The influence of "growth-curve plasticity," that is, the change in size at each age with a change in food density, on individual feeding behavior (at higher food densities individuals are larger and hence eat more) is a potential mechanism to stabilize the dynamics.  The influence of growth-curve plasticity on reproduction (primarily the increase in maturation delay with a decrease in food density) greatly destabilizes the system.

AB 1. In some studies but not in others the average clutch size decreases with density.
   2. We propose that density-dependent fecundity occurs because, as density increases, proportionally more poor-quality sites (with small clutches) are occupied, and not because the clutch size in all territories decreases. This mechanism will only cause density dependence if the habitat is heterogeneous at the scale of the home range or territory of an individual.
   3. Density-dependent fecundity will be found in some populations but not in others because of differences in the scale of habitat heterogeneity.
   4. Results from an experimental study on tits (Parus sp.) support the hypothesis.

AB 1. The effects of gap age and size on understorey herb communities and their light environments (indirect skylight and direct sunlight estimated from hemispherical canopy photographs) were investigated in a tropical rain forest in Los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico. Thirteen gaps, ranging in size from 70 to 700 m2 and ranging in age from young (1-2 years old) to old (much greater than 5 years old), were studied.
   2. The mean amounts of relative indirect skylight and relative direct sunlight were 0.083 and 0.116, respectively. Both kinds of light increased significantly with gap size and decreased significantly with gap age, but a significant interaction indicated that size was more important in new gaps than in intermediate-aged gaps.
   3. Herbaceous communities were very diverse; 52 species were found in total. Most species occurred at low frequencies in most sites. The number of species per gap (mean = 15.2) was not affected significantly by gap age or size, although the Shannon - Weaver diversity index H' (mean = 2.1) was significantly highest in young gaps (mean = 2.4) followed by intermediate-aged gaps (mean = 2.1).
   4. Total standing leaf area produced by herbs (mean = 0.795 m2 m-2) was significantly affected by both gap size and age; it was highest in intermediate-aged, medium-sized gaps (1.935 m2 m-2).
   5. Hemiepiphytic aroids were numerically important at most sites. Terrestrial aroids and large monocots were also found to be important groups at many sites, not numerically, but by their relative contributions to total standing leaf area.
   6. Species assemblages differed considerably between sites (mean proportional similarity, PS = 40.8%). Intermediate-aged gaps were more similar to each other (mean PS = 52-7%) than young gaps were to each other (mean PS = 35.3%). Mature forest sites were the least similar to all the other sites (mean PS = 28.9%).
   7. Gaps of the same age and size were more similar in species assemblages than those that differed in size or age, but this trend was only of marginal significance.
   8. There were reproductives at all sites; the highest relative number was in the intermediate-aged sites, not the bright sites, new gaps or young gaps.
   10. The influence of gap size on the light environment is important in understanding the dynamics of the herbaceous communities. Gaps of intermediate age, the part of the forest that is in the 'building phase', are just as critical as the new-gap phase of the forest dynamics.

TI REGULATION AND STABILITY OF A FREE-LIVING HOST-PARASITE SYSTEM -

   SURVIVAL; BEHAVIOR
AB 1. The population dynamics of red grouse, Lagopus lagopus scoticus and the parasitic nematode, Trichostrongylus tenuis were explored to determine whether interactions between the parasite and host were sufficient to generate cycles in grouse abundance. Two alternative models were used that explicitly consider the dynamics of either the free-living, or arrested larval stages of the parasite.
   2. Providing that the life expectancy of the free-living larvae is more than 2-4 weeks, the parasite can readily establish in grouse populations. Larval arrestment tends to reduce the intrinsic growth rate of the parasite and thus increases the size of the host population required for the parasite to establish.
   3. Grouse numbers will tend to cycle when the parasites exhibit low degrees of aggregation and parasite-induced reductions in host fecundity are greater than parasite-induced increases in host mortality. The population cycles produced in the model have the slow increase followed by a rapid decline characteristic of the grouse population studied at Gunnerside.
   4. The period of the cycles is determined by the intrinsic growth rate of the grouse population and either larval life expectancy (Model I). or the duration of larval arrestment (Model II). Cycle periods decrease as host population growth rate increases, and lengthen with increases in either free-living larval life expectancy, or the duration of larval arrestment. If the duration of larval arrestment is sufficiently long (>6 months), the cycles die out and the dynamics of the grouse-nematode system are very stable.
   5. Estimates of all of the model's parameters may be made from long-term records of grouse populations. Numerical analysis of the model's behaviour suggest that a model with limited arrested larval stages more closely corresponds to the grouse populations in the North of England. The 4-5 year cycles exhibited by these populations will be more sporadic, or absent on estates where the parasite is unable to establish.
   6. The analysis shows that the empirical data collected on T. tenuis are consistent with it being the cause of the cycles observed in grouse populations in the North of England.

AB 1. The retention characteristics of stretches of four low order streams in south-east England were manipulated over a period of 2 years by the addition of small traps which accumulated leaf litter. Unmanipulated control stretches were retained in each stream. Our aim was to test the prediction that the local density of 'shredders', invertebrates which comminute autumn-shed leaves, would increase in response to leaf litter availability. One stream naturally retained a high leaf litter biomass, two had few natural leaf packs and one was intermediate.
   2. After manipulation had begun, simultaneous samples of the benthos and leaf litter were taken from control stretches and the traps and intervening stream bed ('intertraps') in the manipulated stretches.
   3. The effects of manipulation were slight in the highly retentive site, in terms of both litter standing stock and shredder abundance. The other three sites showed rapid responses, with increased leaf litter and shredder abundance in traps compared with controls.
   4. In the least retentive site, manipulation significantly increased the biomass of coarse particulate organic matter in the intertrap samples. In one other site, there was also an increase in shredder density in the intertraps.
   5. The changes associated with manipulation were consistent despite the differences in pH among streams, which determined the species assemblage of shredders at each site, but not the pattern of response to increased retention.
   6. The results indicate that resource limitation may occur among mobile detritivorous invertebrates in low-order streams. The nature of the limiting resource is discussed; it is speculated that leaf litter may be limiting as a habitat for shredders as well as a source of food.

LA English
DT Article
DE FORAGING CONSTRAINT; FOOD AVAILABILITY; FORAGING BEHAVIOR

AB 1. Two groups of Nephelopsis obscura, fed ad libitum on Tubifex tubifex, were compared: one was maintained in an environment with a mud substratum (MS leeches) allowing prey anti-predator responses, the other without a substratum (NS leeches) providing prey directly available to the leech.
   2. NS leeches showed a 4.7 times higher feeding rate and 3.7 times higher growth rate than MS leeches resulting in NS leeches attaining maturity at a mean size of 750 mg after 85 days compared to a mean size at maturity of 270 mg after 109 days for MS leeches.
   3. Direct observation of foraging behaviour of three size-groups of starved N. obscura revealed three foraging modes: immediate prey ingestion; delayed prey ingestion; and no prey ingestion after encounter. The change from the immediate to delayed foraging mode resulted in a threshold above which successful foraging on prey with a mud substratum became impossible. Feeding on directly vulnerable prey without a substratum continued until the gut capacity was reached.
   4. The life-history traits exhibited by NS leeches result from the potential for feeding to gut capacity while the life-history traits of MS leeches result from the timetables imposed by the foraging constraint. Based on instantaneous feeding and growth rates of similar sizes of NS and MS leeches, coefficient of size-specific feeding ability loss (FAL) and growth ability loss (GAL) were calculated for constrained MS leeches and shown to be an increasing function of leech size (weight).

AB 1. Models were developed to examine two factors that may influence optimal territory shape in heterogeneous habitats, resource availability and defence costs. These models were tested in a study of a population of red-capped cardinals (Paroaria gularis, L.) in Manu National Park, south-eastern Peru.
   2. Cardinals defend territories along the shores of oxbow lakes and rivers, with each territory containing two short stretches of shore that are on opposite sides of the water.
   3. Analysis of samples of arthropod prey showed no differences between the two shores, allowing the foraging model to be rejected and indicating that resource distributions do not determine the shape of the cardinals' territories.
   4. The probability of detecting an intruder on the same shore decreased with increasing distance from the territory owner. Intruders on the shore opposite the territorial pair were more likely to be detected immediately than were intruders on the same shore. Intruders detected immediately were easier to evict than intruders that were not detected immediately, and intruders tended to avoid the shore opposite the territorial pair.
   5. The data supported the defence model: reduction in defence costs due to increased intruder detectability appears to be the factor that favours the inclusion of two shores in each cardinal territory.
   6. I suggest that in patchy habitats, the effects of defence costs may result in territories that are suboptimally shaped for foraging, and that defence considerations should be included in future studies of territory shape.

AB 1. We analysed the effects of cohort structure, density, egg hatch inhibition and cannibalism on estimated per capita growth rate (r') in populations of Aedes triseriatus established in artificial habitats in Massachusetts.
   2. As density increased from 0.5 K to 0.75 K to the estimated carrying capacity (K = 60 larvae per 100 ml), r' decreased, along with other measures of success: survivorship, female size, and development rate.
   3. Cohort structure and recruitment schedule significantly influenced r'. Populations initiated as eggs achieved r' values greater than cohorts started as first instar larvae and substantially greater than those populations consisting of single cohorts.
   4. We did not observe a significant relationship between hatch rate and larval density. In addition, hatch inhibition did not require direct larval contact with eggs.
   5. We found no evidence for cannibalism in our experimental habitats, which were stocked with leaf detritus and treehole water, suggesting that refugia offered protection not gained in a simpler laboratory setting or that large larvae had sufficient levels of alternative food sources (Koenekoop & Livdahl 1986).
   6. Egg-initiated cohorts exhibited the greatest developmental asynchrony during the first month of the experiment, whereas cohorts added as 2-day-old larvae displayed highly synchronized development. Increased competitive interactions in this latter treatment may explain the small size attained by adult females emerging from these populations. Differences among multiple cohort groups increased with increasing density.
   7. Our results emphasize the need to incorporate overlapping stages into experimental designs for populations that develop asynchronously, and the value of using r' as a descriptor of success rather than the individual components of success (e.g. survivorship, size, and development rate) which can lead to misinterpretations of productivity.

AB 1. Oystercatchers that breed on the saltmarsh of the Frisian island of Schiermon-nikoog occupy two different types of territory. In 'resident' territories the nesting area and the feeding area are adjacent. In 'leapfrog' territories the nesting area and the feeding area are separated by distances of 200-500 m.
   2. Between 1984 and 1989, residents fledged on average 3.5 times as many chicks per year as leapfrogs.
   3. The discrepancy in fledgling production arose primarily through increased mortality of leapfrog chicks due to starvation. This was indicated by low body weights of leapfrog chicks found dead and successful enhancement of leapfrog chick growth through supplementary food. In addition, the presence of a sibling reduced the probability of fledging for leapfrog chicks, but not for resident chicks, providing further evidence that leapfrog chicks competed for a limited food supply.
   4. Leapfrog parents fledged fewer chicks, not because of poor feeding conditions in their feeding territory (intake rates of leapfrogs exceeded those of residents), but because they failed to transport a sufficient amount of food to the chicks. To supply their chicks with the same amount of food as did residents, leapfrog parents should have spent c. 4000 s per low water period in transport flights: no leapfrog parent ever reached this level of effort.
   5. Our data show that it is not correct to equate parental effort to the number of chicks raised, as territories of different quality require different levels of effort for successful reproduction.

TI INTERSPECIFIC COMPETITION FOR TREE HOLES - CONSEQUENCES FOR MATING
   SYSTEMS AND COEXISTENCE IN NEOTROPICAL DAMSELFLIES
SO AMERICAN NATURALIST
LA English
DT Article
ID DENSITY
AB Male mating strategies of pseudostigmatid damselflies that breed in tree holes vary from resource defense to nonlocalized mate searching. Because females were most predictably found in forest light gaps and oviposited randomly with respect to tree-hole volume, morphology, and tree condition, the spatial distribution of neither females nor oviposition sites sufficiently accounted for differences in male mating strategies. Tree holes over 1 L in volume were the best larval habitats because they supported multiple cohorts per season. The two largest species emerged from larger tree holes than did the two smaller guild members. A laboratory experiment demonstrated that in large holes, small individuals of Megaloprepus eventually killed larger individuals of the two smaller Mecistogaster species, whereas Mecistogaster survived to emergence in small holes if they were the first to hatch there. A field experiment demonstrated that Mecistogaster colonized tree holes earlier in the wet season than did the two larger guild members, thereby gaining the head start in growth critical to its survival. The inferior competitive ability of its larvae countered any advantage that Mecistogaster adult males might otherwise derive from defending tree holes and resulted in seasonal clumping of emerging adults. In contrast, by defending large tree holes, male Megaloprepus coerulatus increased their chances of producing multiple offspring and sons of high quality.

AB 1.  We studied age-related reproductive success in a recently established breeding colony of barnacle goose Branta leucopsis on the island of Gotland, Sweden.
   2.  Associations of age and breeding experience with several reproductive parameters were investigated by comparing the success of individuals of 2, 3, 4 and greater-than-or-equal-to 5 years of age.  Also, we measured the within-individual changes in reproductive parameters as the individuals grew older.
   3.  Associations between survival and reproductive success were investigated by comparing the reproductive success of 2, 3 and 4-year-old birds that returned or did not return, respectively, in the subsequent breeding season.
   4.  The reproductive success increased up to an age of 4-5 years.  Thus, clutch size, number of hatched young and number of fledged young increased, and hatching date was advanced with increasing age.  This was due to the fact that individuals increased in reproductive success as they grew older.
   5.  A possibly higher probability of survival among individuals that perform well in reproduction could not explain the higher reproductive success in older age-classes as compared to young age-classes of geese, because there were no associations between survival and reproductive success, and very few individuals did actually disappear between any two breeding seasons.
   6.  Path analysis suggested age effects only at earlier stages of reproduction, i.e. timing of breeding and clutch size.  These characters, in turn, were associated with number of fledged young.  These findings were further supported by measurements of hatching success and rearing success, which did not seem to increase with age.
   7.  Increased breeding experience was associated with early hatching date and larger clutch size in males, and with larger clutch size in females.  This was concluded from path analysis and from comparisons of individuals of the same age but with different breeding experience.
   8.  The increase in reproductive success with age in the barnacle goose is probably a result of age-related skills in individuals and the direct effects of these skills on reproductive success, but possibly also because of increased reproductive effort with age owing to these age-related skills.

TI PATTERNS OF FOREST DAMAGE RESULTING FROM CATASTROPHIC WIND IN CENTRAL

   WIND DAMAGE
ID NEW-HAMPSHIRE; ORGANIZATION; DYNAMICS; HISTORY
AB 1. The effect of catastrophic winds on a forested landscape in central Massachusetts was examined to investigate the factors controlling the geographic pattern of damage. The study area, Tom Swamp Tract, Harvard Forest, comprises a valley and adjoining hillslopes supporting second-growth hardwood and conifer stands. Much of the study used records and maps that were analysed cartographically with a geographic information system (GIS).
   2. Areally, forest damage was distributed fairly evenly among different damage classes ranging from no damage to more than 75% of stems broken or uprooted. However, there was a negative exponential size distribution of contiguous areas of the same damage intensity, with a preponderance less than 2 ha: These areas ranged from less than 0.04 ha to more than 35 ha; hurricane damage exhibited a continuum ranging from minor damage of individual trees to extensive blow-down of broad areas of forest.
   3. The spatial pattern of wind damage was controlled by vegetation height and composition and by site exposure, which is predominantly determined by slope orientation and angle. Approximately 3% of the stands in the study site occupied protected sites, 31% intermediate sites, and 66% exposed sites.
   4. Forest type susceptibility followed the ranking: Pinus strobus > conifer plantations > Pinus strobus-hardwood = Tsuga canadensis-hardwood-Pinus strobus > hardwood-Pinus strobus > hardwood. Damage increased with increasing site exposure to wind and increased approximately linearly with stand height.
   5. An empirical GIS model of landscape-level response to wind was constructed based on other stands in the same township (not including the Tom Swamp Tract). Hurricane damage in these stands was analysed as a function of site factors (exposure) and vegetational factors (height and composition). Model predictions for the study area agreed well with observed effects, suggesting that a relatively small number of variables can be used to explain the damage in this topographically simple area. Significant variation in the predicted damage under different vegetational scenarios suggests that the landscape-level response to catastrophic wind may be highly sensitive to historical changes in vegetation.

TI LAND-USE HISTORY (1730-1990) AND VEGETATION DYNAMICS IN CENTRAL
   NEW-ENGLAND, USA
SO JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE AGRICULTURAL HISTORY; CANONICAL CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS; DEFORESTATION;
   FOREST DYNAMICS; HUMAN DISTURBANCE
AB 1. Histories of changing land use and vegetation of a 380-ha forested area in central Massachusetts (Prospect Hill tract of the Harvard Forest) were reconstructed to investigate (i) the environmental controls over land ownership patterns, agricultural practice and logging activity, and (ii) the vegetation response to these land-use factors.
   2. Forest clearance and agricultural expansion parallel trends for central New England: increasing rates of deforestation through the late eighteenth century led to a peak in 1820-80 when more than 80% of the land was open. Reforestation on abandoned fields commenced in 1850 and increased progressively through the early twentieth century.
   3. Ownership patterns varied temporally in turnover rate and size of individual holdings. Twenty-five lots comprising the study area were sold an average of 13 times in the period 1730-1910. Land sales were greatest in the period of speculation and low-intensity agriculture (1730-90), lowest during the transition to commercial agriculture and small-scale industry (1790-1840), and high during the period of agricultural decline in the mid to late 1800s.
   4. Land use in the mid 1800s, including woodlot (13% of the study area), tilled fields (16%), pasture (70%) and marsh (1%), formed an intricate pattern best explained by soil drainage and proximity to farmhouses and town roads. This land-use pattern controlled the reforestation process: field abandonment and reforestation proceeded outward from poorly drained pasture adjacent to the continuous woodlots and eventually included productive tilled land.
   5. The consequences of 250 years of land-use activity vary at different scales. Regionally, the distribution of modern and pre-settlement forest types match well despite structural changes and the loss of some tree species. At a landscape scale, modern forest characteristics are strongly controlled by land use. Canonical correspondence analysis indicates that community variation is best explained by historical factors (distinction between primary and secondary woodlands, forest age, cutting history and timing of site abandonment) and site factors (slope position and soil drainage). Picea rubens and Tsuga canadensis forests are restricted to primary woodlands, Pinus strobus and sprouts of Castanea dentata are largely confined to old pastures, and Betula populifolia, Populus spp. and Acer rubrum are most abundant in cut-over old-field Pinus stands.
   6. Long-term forest trends in the twentieth century include a decrease in the importance of Pinus strobus due to logging and the 1938 hurricane, a gradual decline in early successional hardwoods (Betula populifolia, Populus spp.. Acer rubrum), and increase in later successional species (Quercus rubra, Q. velutina. Acer saccharum). Tsuga and northern-hardwood species (Acer saccharum. Fagus grandifolia) declined dramatically throughout the settlement period; however, the major forest trend over the past 100 years has been a continual increase in Tsuga.

AB 1. The landscape transformation of central New England resulting from deforestation (1750-1860), broad-scale agriculture (1790-1860), and extensive reforestation (1860-present) has exerted a major effect on the structure. function and pattern of the modern forests. However, relatively little is known of the specific nature and extent of these vegetational transformations.
   2. Palaeoecological, dendrochronological and historical studies of a pnmary woodland were undertaken to document the characteristics of the pre-settlement forest, the sequence and type of human activities, and the pattern of subsequent vegetation change. The woodland remained forested throughout the settlement period but was used as a woodlot source of fuelwood, tanbark and building materials. At present the old-age structure of the forest and dominance by shade-tolerant Tsuga canadensis (hemlock) gives the appearance of a mature and stable community.
   3. The woodlot has changed profoundly in structure and composition during the past 300 years as a result of human activity, natural disturbance and forest development. Ownership history is complex, involving at least 18 different owners from 1740 to 1907. Human land-use includes forest clearance and agriculture in the surrounding area, and repeated cutting of the woodlot. Wind damage, ice breakage and the loss of chestnut to blight are the major natural disturbances.
   4. The pre-settlement forest was comprised of old-growth northern hardwoods, hemlock and Pinus strobus (white pine). Frequent cutting resulted in the development of a sprout chestnut forest that persisted until a decrease in cutting and the onset of the chestnut blight allowed the emergence of hemlock as the dominant species.
   5. The modern forest, although seemingly mature and stable, is unlike any preceeding vegetation and is a poor analogue for the pre-settlement forest. Many of the species that were common before European settlement are rare on the site today and uncommon in the landscape.
   6. The forest landscape of central New England effectively conceals the extent of the historical changes that have occurred. An interdisciplinary approach is necessary to evaluate the forces underlying these changes, the nature of the vegetation transformations, and their consequences in the modern landscape.

AB 1. The decline phase in the population dynamics of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar L. (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae) is associated both with nuclear polyhedrosis virus epizootics and greater phenolics levels in preferred hosts such as red oak. Recent studies have shown that hydrolysable tannins in red oak reduce both gypsy moth (GM) fecundity and virus susceptibility.
   2. We modified the Anderson & May (1981) analytical model of invertebrate-pathogen dynamics to explore this complex interaction over a range of tannin levels, gypsy moth mortality from non-virus causes, and virus life span held constant for 100 gypsy moth generations.
   3. The most realistic gypsy moth dynamics required moderate to high levels of tannin (30-45%), low non-virus mortality (3-0 per GM per year), and long-lived virus (1 year). For simulations with low non-virus mortality and long-lived virus, the ratio of highest to lowest population density increased from 10-fold at 10% tannin to over 1000-fold at 40% tannin, then stabilized with little or no fluctuation at 50% tannin.
   4. The shift to stability at 50% tannin results from the lower sensitivity of fecundity than virus to hydrolysable tannins and a consequent decrease in the difference between virus pathogenicity and the gypsy moth's intrinsic rate of increase at high tannin levels.
   5. The dynamics generated agree well with predictions of the original Anderson & May (1981) model that stable limit cycles are promoted by: (a) longer-lived virus and (b) high pathogenicity relative to the intrinsic rate of increase. Overall, our simulations suggest that the net effect of moderate constant tannin levels over multiple generations will be destabilizing compared with low and high tannin levels.

AB 1. It is well-known that the Cormack-Seber model (Cormack 1970; Seber 1971) for ring-recovery data from birds ringed as nestlings does not provide unique maximum-likelihood estimates of the parameters without the addition of a constraint. Lakhani & Newton (1983) pointed out that the use of a constraint might yield misleading estimates. Unique estimates do result from the addition of separate information on one of the parameters; Lakhani (1987) suggested the possibility of the survival of first-year birds being based on observed deaths of radio-marked birds.
   2. We show here that the estimate of the survival probability for first-year birds, obtained from radio-marked birds alone, may not correspond to the overall maximum-likelihood estimate of this probability.
   3. We explain how such a discrepancy may arise, and show that, in this case, one of the other parameters in the model is estimated on a boundary to the parameter space, i.e. is either 0 or 1.
   4. A small simulation study is carried out to explore the implications of this finding for the bias of the parameter estimators. We see that if the radio-marking does not affect first-year survival, then the most serious bias is for the survival probability phi(k), where k is the number of years' duration of the ringing study. For other parameters, bias will be lower, and possibly of the order of 10%, though this depends on the size of the radio-tracking study. This bias might well be less than the possibly unknown bias in the absence of any augmentation, as claimed by Lakhani (1987).
   5. If radio-marked birds experience a reduced probability of survival then more serious bias may extend to all parameters. In this situation, bias increases as the size of the radio-tracking study increases.
   6. When a discrepancy of the kind described in (2) above arises, repeating the radio-tracking experiment is advisable only if survival is not expected to be impaired by radio-marking, and if a large radio-marking experiment may be carried out.
   7. Lakhani (1987, 1990) has suggested further improvements to the simple radio-tracking scheme examined here. Morgan & Freeman (1989) have discussed a model with first-year variation in survival rates which allows the estimation of model parameters, without the need of any constraints. The possibility of combining this modelling development with further field information is discussed.

AB 1. A growth analysis was conducted on seven annual/perennial pairs of grasses (six congeneric and one pair taken at random) grown in a hydroponic culture system under constant, productive conditions, in order to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the higher relative growth rate (RGR) of annuals as compared to perennials.
   2. All the production parameters (RGR, relative leaf production rate, unit leaf rates), were higher in annuals than in perennials. There were very few differences between the two life forms in biomass allocation to the different organs (except a higher allocation to sheaths in perennials). The specific leaf areas and the leaf area ratios were higher in annuals, whereas the dry-weight:fresh-weight ratios of all the organs were higher in perennials. These differences between annuals and perennials were almost systematic when the comparisons were made within a given genus, but not when they were made between annuals and perennials in different genera.
   3. The wide range of RGR obained for the 14 species also permitted general relationships between RGR and the various components of growth to be discussed. RGR was significantly correlated with: (i) unit leaf rate, (ii) specific leaf area, (iii) leaf area ratio, (iv) dry-weight:fresh-weight ratio of the whole plant, and (v) dry-weight:fresh-weight ratio of roots. Surprisingly, RGR was not correlated with any of the biomass allocation parameters. The single factor that best explained the differences in RGR was the specific leaf area.
   4. If, as has been hypothesized elsewhere, the annual life form is derived from the perennial one, the results presented here suggest that the same morphological changes have occured repeatedly in different genera. It is argued that these changes, which are probably correlated with differences in anatomical features, mainly affect the specific (i.e. per unit weight or area) uptake capacities of the plant organs, leading to the higher seedling growth rate observed in annuals.

AB 1. The demography of four clones of Eichhomia crassipes, each grown in isolation, was studied to determine: (i) if clones derived from four locations varied genetically in the growth of leaf and ramet populations, in leaf morphology and in biomass; (ii) how developmental processes accounted for clonal variation in demography; and (iii) how clones differed in their response to increasing ramet population density. 2. Plants from each clone were grown outdoors, and the births of all leaves, ramets and inflorescences were recorded. Clones differed in the growth of leaf and ramet populations, because of differences in rates of leaf production and flowering rather than in rates of ramet production per leaf axillary bud. Leaves and inflorescences arise from apical meristems while ramets are the products of leaf axillary buds. Thus developmental processes involving apical meristems rather than axillary buds accounted for demographic variation between clones. 3. Clones with the higher rates of leaf production had larger populations of leaves and ramets. However, because flowering consumes the apical meristem and temporarily slows leaf and ramet production, flowering intensity was negatively correlated with vegetative growth among clones. 4. Total biomass and the components of biomass varied between clones harvested after 25 and 40 days of growth. Leaf or ramet population sizes were not correlated with clone biomass, because clones with few leaves and ramets tended to have large leaves and ramets, and vice versa. 5. Eichhornia is heterophyllic, producing float leaves with small blades and expanded petioles or canopy leaves with large blades and long petioles. Clones differed in their propensity to produce float or canopy leaves. 6. In response to increasing ramet density, all clones shifted leaf morphology, reduced ramet production, and increased flowering, but they differed in the magnitude of their responses.

AB 1. The Blanford's fox, Vulpes cana (Blanford 1877) is a small canid mean body mass = 956 g) that inhabits rocky mountains and canyons in the deserts of Israel, where it feeds mainly on invertebrates and fruits.
   2. We hypothesized that the energy expenditure of Blanford's foxes would be higher than that of a small canid that inhabits flat terrain, all else being equal. To test this hypothesis, we measured daily energy expenditure and water intake of free-living Blanford's foxes and compared the results with those of the kit fox, Vulpes macrotis (Say 1823). We also estimated dietary intake and seasonal activity periods.
   3. Blanford's foxes maintained water and energy balances on a diet of invertebrates and fruits without the need to drink. Metabolism during activity was 8.4 times higher than at rest, and daily energy expenditure of Blanford's foxes was, on average, 30.1% higher than that of the kit fox. This result was compatible with our prediction that activity is more energetically expensive for Blanford's foxes in their mountainous habitat than in another desert fox species that inhabits flat terrains.

AB 1. Territorial, courtship and oviposition behaviour of Calopteryx splendens xanthostoma (Charpentier) and C. haemorrhoidalis (Vander Linden) were studied in two freshwater streams in southern France.
   2. Females of both species preferred to oviposit in aquatic vegetation found in fast-flowing water. This was not due to preference for a particular species of vegetation; most ovipositions by C. s. xanthostoma occurred in a single species, and female C. haemorrhoidalis ceased ovipositing in an area of fast water after the flow was experimentally slowed.
   3. Males of both species defended areas of oviposition vegetation as territories. Territorial disputes were common in fast-flowing parts of the streams while slow-flowing areas were often undefended. Male C. haemorrhoidalis deserted previously defended areas after an experimental decrease in flow rate.
   4. The mating success of male C. s. xanthostoma increased with the rate of flow of water through their territory, but only up to a rate of 0.15 ms-1. Above this, males spent so much time in territorial defence that they probably missed mating opportunities.
   5. Males of both species sometimes courted females by falling onto the water surface and floating with the current. Males that performed this display had a higher mating success than those that did not. We suggest this display has evolved to indicate territory quality to females.

AB 1. The vascular flora of 65 raised bogs was determined across climatic gradients in eastern North America. The major geographic patterns in species richness and floristic composition were analysed using linear regression, detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA).
   2. The vascular bog flora consists of 81 species in this region. Four major floristic regions distinguished by DCA correspond to the geographic zonation of bog land-forms. Each of these floristic regions is characterized by a different mean value for species richness.
   3. Raised bogs in the southern-continental floristic region (I) contain fewer than 20 species and have the most impoverished vascular floras in eastern North America. In the transitional-continental (II) and northern-continental (III) regions, the bog flora is slightly larger, although the mean number of species remains below 26.
   4. The richest bog floras are found in the maritime region (IV), where species richness declines along a latitudinal gradient from 50 species in the south (subregion IV.1) to 32 in the north (subregion IV.2).
   5. The relationship of species richness to various environmental factors was analysed using linear regression. The most important factors are mean annual precipitation (MAP) and annual freezing degree-days (FDD) with a base temperature of 0-degrees-C. Factors that are also significantly related to species richness are mean annual temperature (MA T), the number of wet-to-dry habitats, and the concentration of magnesium and sodium in the surface water. No significant relationship was found for growing degree-days (base temperature = 5-degrees-C.), mean annual snow depth, or spatial dimensions of bogs.
   6. The regressions indicate that a climatic threshold of 1000 mm of annual precipitation and 1000 freezing degree-days separates the floristically rich maritime bogs from the floristically impoverished bogs of northern and continental regions.
   7. The relative importance of these environmental factors is supported by CCA. In addition, the CCA ordination identifies two groups of species on the basis of their response to these environmental factors. Species that are generally restricted to the maritime region (IV) have weighted averages that are above average for MAP and MA T, but below average for FDD. Species that are common to all bogs or that are more continental in their distribution have the reverse relationship.
   8. The tolerance of the regional bog flora to the acidic, anoxic rooting zone changes across this climatic gradient. One third of the species that grow on bogs in the southern maritime region are restricted to fens or mineral uplands in continental or northern regions. This shift in ecological tolerance may be related to (i) slower rates of peat accumulation on the maritime bogs, (ii) longer time available for the evolution of local tolerant populations on maritime bogs, or (iii) a physiological adaptation to the maritime climate.

TI CORRELATES OF THE DENSITY OF FORAGING OYSTERCATCHERS

AB 1. The distribution of a population of oystercatchers Haematopus ostralegus L., that varied temporally in size, over beds of mussels Mytilus edulis L., that varied spatially in quality, was investigated. It was expected that, as bird numbers on the estuary increased causing competition for preferred beds to intensify and the birds to spread out over their food gradient, the characteristics of the mussel beds with which bird densities were correlated would change.
   2. Bird numbers on each bed, and thus their densities, were censused approximately monthly. The mussel bed characteristics considered likely to correlate with bird density were: mussels (densities of several length-classes and shell thickness on the dorsal and ventral sides) and beds (area, flatness, exposure time, proportion covered by algae, softness of the substrate and distance from the birds' high water roost).
   3. An initial multiple regression analysis relating bird density to these bed characteristics, using data collected from 21-23 beds during the first 3 years, enabled three variables to be eliminated from further consideration: exposure time, algal cover and flatness. A subsequent similar analysis of data from the 12 'priority' beds, studied over 8 years, allowed more variables to be eliminated: the densities of small and large mussels, shell thickness on the ventral side, and bed size. The four remaining variables - substrate softness, distance to roost, density of mussels 40-50 mm long and shell thickness on the dorsal side - together accounted for most of the explainable variation in bird density between the 12 priority beds.
   4. Multiple regressions of the logarithms of bird density against these four variables were then calculated separately for each of the 83 censuses. The standardized partial regression coefficients were plotted against total population size. In the presence of the other three variables, the effect of the density of 40-50 mm mussels was small at low population sizes but increased as bird numbers rose; at high population sizes, bird densities were higher where mussels were dense. At low population sizes, bird densities increased with shell thickness whereas, at high population sizes, they decreased with shell thickness. Bird densities were generally higher on beds far from the roost, particularly at the higher population sizes. The effect of substrate softness remained consistently large at all population sizes, and may even have increased; bird densities were markedly higher on beds with firm substrates on all except a few low population censuses.
   5. The causal basis of these changes are discussed in relation to ideal free distribution models that assume that predators feed where their energy intake rate is maximized. Although the variables that defined the food gradient in this field study were largely different to those used in such models, the conceptual framework these models provide is nonetheless a useful way of viewing how the distribution of oystercathers over their food gradient changes with population size.

AB 1. This paper examines the interaction between the wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus L., and the intestinal nematode, Heligmosomoides polygyrus Dujardin, using data collected at Tollymore Park Forest, Co. Down, Northern Ireland, between November 1978 and July 1981.
   2. A total of 1395 mice were collected, comprising 809 (58%) male and 582 (42%) female wood mice (four individuals were not sexed); 86% of mice were infected by H. polygyrus. Mean worm burden was around 12 worms per mouse. Worm burdens did not differ with sex. Parasites were highly overdispersed within the host population.
   3. A reference curve (based upon a sample of 227 captive bred wood mice) relating dried eye lens weight to known wood mouse age was used to estimate the age of wild mice.
   4. Worm burdens increased in the youngest mouse age-classes, reaching the highest value in mice around 8 months old and then declined in older age groups. The 'convex' shape of age - intensity curves was similar in male and female wood mice.
   5. There was strong seasonality in the population dynamics of host and parasite. Parasite prevalence was highest around April and intensity around May. The mouse population was at its 'youngest' from late summer into winter and 'oldest' in the late spring.
   6. We outline various mechanisms which might generate epidemiological patterns within these data and comparison is made with previous studies of H. polygyrus in A. sylvaticus and the laboratory mouse. Indirect evidence suggests that convexity may be created by acquired immunity and/or by parasite-induced host mortality.

AB 1. The relation between abundance and body size has been modelled as a power function: some authors have reported exponents of -0.75 while others have reported values not significantly different from 0. The former value implies that populations use equivalent amounts of energy regardless of their size, while the latter implies energetic dominance by large species.
   2. Much of the disagreement results from the use of inappropriate methods to estimate the exponent. Date are re-analysed using structural regression and reduced major axis (RMA) methods.
   3. Most RMA estimates of the exponent are close to -1, consistent with greater energy consumption by small organisms than large in communities.

AB 1. Nodule production and rates of acetylene reduction by the understorey legume Bossiaea laidlawiana were estimated in Eucalyptus diversicolor (karri) forest stands in south-western Australia in relation to plant age, time of day and season, and phosphorus supply. 2. Highest numbers and masses of nodules, and highest rates of acetylene reduction were observed in the spring and early summer months when soil temperature was rising and soil moisture was adequate for functioning of fine roots. Cessation of activity in late summer was associated with low levels of soil moisture and was followed by a gradual increase in both mass of nodules and nitrogenase activity during the cool wet winter months. 3. Diurnal variation in rates of acetylene reduction was greater at a young regrowth site than in mature forest. Variation in surface soil temperatures can explain much of the variation in acetylene reduction at the regrowth site. 4. Rates of nitrogen fixation, estimated from measurements of acetylene reduction in an age-series of stands, ranged from 1 kg N ha-1 year-1 in a 1-year-old regrowth stand to 14 kg N ha-1 year-1 in a mature forest stand with an 11-year-old understorey. These rates represented 52-84% of estimated rates of nitrogen accumulation, but only 20-38% of nitrogen taken up by above-ground components of B. laidlawiana. Rates of nitrogen fixation, however, were probably underestimated because recovery of nodules from the soil may have been as low as 60%. 5. Differences among stands in rates of nitrogen fixation are largely explained by differences in the proportion of B. laidlawiana in the understorey stratum. Thus there does not appear to be any distinct trend in rates of nitrogen fixation with increasing age of this legume. 6. High but transient levels of extractable phosphorus found in soils following slash burns may have facilitated growth, nodule production and acetylene reduction rates in 1-year-old legume seedlings. Application of 200 kg Pha-1 to understorey that was regenerating after a prescribed fire in mature forest trebled above-ground biomass and doubled rates of acetylene reduction.

AB 1. We measured prey selection and habitat profitability of common eiders Somateria mollissima L. wintering in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Quebec, Canada. Prey selection was evaluated by comparing the frequency of prey in stomachs of shot eiders with their frequency in the sublittoral zone. Habitat profitability was estimated using information on time spent feeding, foraging success, diving durations and energy content of the prey.
   2. In this region, eiders forage on a variety of prey types from several distinct habitats, kelp beds, urchin barrens and beds of the phaeophyte Agarum cribrosum (Mert.). In kelp beds eiders feed mostly on small blue mussels Mytilus edulis L. Over barrens they capture green sea urchins Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis (Muller), and over Agarum beds they feed on both spider crabs Hyas araneus (L.) and urchins.
   3. Flock size also varies with habitat type: all sizes of flocks feed in the kelp beds, whereas mostly small flocks feed in the barrens and Agarum beds. Small-flock individuals strongly select mussels and crabs whereas urchins are non-preferred prey.
   4. Dive and foraging cycles differ significantly according to the above three habitats. Although, the size, density and energy content of prey differ markedly between kelp and Agarum beds, these two habitats offer an even energy return. However, the variance in energy return in these two habitats differs strikingly, being greater in the latter. We hypothesized, in the context of risk foraging theory, that this was related to flock sizes and body condition. As predicted, individuals feeding in small flocks were in bad condition compared to individuals feeding in large flocks. This suggests that small-flock individuals are seeking the habitat offering a variable intake to improve their survival probability.

AB 1. Patterns of spatial density dependence in mortality factors affecting the sexual generation of Andricus quercuscalicis (Burgsdorf 1783) on Quercus cerris (L.) were investigated as part of a long-term study of the population dynamics of the gall wasp. Experimental enhancement of gall density was used to increase the range of densities observed in the field.
   2. We present a new application of logistic regression for detecting spatial density dependence in single-sample collections of galls or leaf-mines. The test, first described by Cox (1970) uses GLIM with binomial errors. The performance of the test and the frequency of Type I and Type II errors were assessed by computer simulation of a variety of different ecological circumstances including density independence, mild and severe, direct and inverse density dependence, and proved satisfactory in most respects.
   3. In our field data, statistically significant spatial density dependence was detected in about 15% of cases. Out of 62 cases of significant density dependence, 66% were of inverse density dependence. In particular, the gall wasp data demonstrate a preponderance of inverse density dependence in rates of parasitism. Only predation of galls by birds exhibited a consistent pattern of direct density dependence. There was marked variation in the intensity of all mortality factors from tree to tree.
   4. As spatial scale is increased from catkins, through buds, shoots and twigs, so the sample size declines and the range of densities increases. Since reducing the sample size reduces the probability of detecting significant density dependence, but increasing the range of densities increases the likelihood of detecting density dependence, the overall effect of changing spatial scale on the probability of detecting density dependence is difficult to predict. Even when density dependence was detected at the smallest scale, the frequency of detection at higher scales declined, and this may be due in part to spatial heterogeneity in the action of density dependence. Thus, it is not obvious whether changes in the rate of detection of density dependence at different spatial scales are statistical artefacts or reflect real changes in the ecology of the organisms involved.
   5. There are two potential problems in applying logistic regression to such data sets. First, overdispersion may occur if p (the probability of mortality) varies significantly within the sample. One way of dealing with this is to rescale the model, according to the degree of aggregation. Second, apparent underdispersion may occur if both p and n are low because, with small sample sizes, variation in p may be undetectable. The most obvious solution in this case is to increase the sample size n, though this may be difficult at larger spatial scales.
   6. Enhancing gall densities by caging agamic females directly onto the branches of the host tree led to an increase in mean gall density and in the range of gall densities. This, in turn, led to an increase in the detection of inverse density dependence (mainly through parasitoid attack) but had no significant impact on the detection of direct density dependence. The use of experimentally enhanced gall densities appears to hold considerable potential for demonstrating the importance of spatial density dependence, so long as care is taken to ensure that the highest densities are not unrealistic.
   7. The data are consistent with the hypothesis of an environment which is patchy with respect to the nature of population regulation; there may be a small number of regulated subpopulations, linked by dispersal to a much larger number of unregulated subpopulations.

AB 1. The reproductive behaviour of a small, gregarious, ectoparasitoid wasp (Goniozus nephantidis (Muesebeck)) in the family Bethylidae was studied in the laboratory. The wasp lays a clutch of up to 20 eggs, with a very female-biased sex ratio, on the caterpillars of microlepidopterans.
   2. Clutch size was strongly influenced by host size.
   3. Clutches of different size were artificially created on hosts of approximately the same weight. The manipulations had little effect on juvenile survival, but adult female size decreased strongly with clutch size. Male size was also affected, although to a lesser extent.
   4. In the laboratory, larger females lived longer and laid more eggs when provided with hosts. When deprived of hosts, smaller females lived slightly longer.
   5. The possibility of using laboratory experiments to test clutch size models is discussed.

TI THE ECOLOGY OF THE HEN FLEA CERATOPHYLLUS-GALLINAE AND THE MOORHEN FLEA
   DASYPSYLLUS-GALLINULAE IN NESTBOXES
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE COLONIZATION; DISPERSAL; GENERATIONS; NEST-BUILDING; POPULATION
AB 1. Populations of fleas from nests of seven species of bird have been measured over a 10-year period.
   2. The hen flea is more abundant in nests of tits than of pied flycatcher and redstart. The moorhen flea is more abundant in marsh tit, coal tit, and redstart nests than in pied flycatcher and other tit nests. There is no evidence of competition between the two fleas.
   3. The date the birds start nest-building, and/or the length of time the nest is maintained above air temperature, is important in determining population size in the hen flea, but not in the moorhen flea.
   4. Hen fleas disperse from overwintering sites in nestboxes early in the birds' breeding season and find hosts mostly among blue tits. The population of hen fleas in pied flycatcher nests is closely related to the number of blue tits breeding, suggesting that the numbers of fleas arriving in the nest is a significant factor in pied flycatchers.
   5. There is evidence that another important determinant of population size in both flea species is the number of generations produced in the season, though other factors seem to be limiting at high population densities in the nest. Two generations are the norm in blue tit and great tit nests, but are less frequent in pied flycatcher nests.
   6. Factors controlling populations of moorhen fleas remain obscure, though appear to be significantly different from those controlling the hen flea. One-fifth of nests probably do not receive any fertilized females of this species at all, whereas virtually all nests are colonized by the hen flea.

TI BETA-DIVERSITY ON GEOGRAPHIC GRADIENTS IN BRITAIN
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE ALPHA-DIVERSITY; BETA-DIVERSITY; SPECIES TURNOVER; DISPERSAL; CLIMATE
ID SPECIES RICHNESS; PATTERNS
AB 1.  We measured beta diversity, or turnover in species composition, in each of 15 taxa (including plants, vertebrates and invertebrates), along two common transects:  N-S and W-E arrays of 50 x 50 km squares across Britain.  Comparing taxa, we asked whether high beta diversity is associated with poor powers of dispersal.  Within taxa, we asked whether turnover increases consistently with geographic distance.
   2.  Beta diversity on this scale was found to be low in all groups.  Total (transect) species richness increased by only 3-13% per 50 x 50 km square, relative to the average value of local (within-square) richness; or by 0.6-6% per square, relative to the maximum value of local richness.  Among taxa, beta diversity showed no tendency to be higher in poorer dispersers.
   3.  In nearly all taxa, beta diversity as defined by Whittaker (1960) increased linearly with distance on the N-S transect.  However, this was shown to be largely the effect of gradients in alpha (local, within-square) diversity.  Moreover, distance is highly correlated with environmental (climatic) dissimilarity, providing an alternative explanation for distance effects.
   4.  We conclude that in the British biota, turnover at this scale is more the product of range and habitat restriction than of dispersal limitation; and that turnover is a relatively minor component of regional diversity, because of the predominance of strong gradients in alpha diversity.

TI HOST-PLANT MANIPULATION BY GALL-INSECTS - A TEST OF THE NUTRITION
   HYPOTHESIS

AB 1.  Nitrogen is generally regarded as a crucial, limiting nutrient for phytophagous insects.  Nitrogen levels in two species of cynipid galls (Neuroterus quercus-baccarum L. and Andricus lignicola Hartig) on oak (Quercus robur L.) were monitored after experimental enhancement of host-plant nitrogen levels over 2 years.
   2.  The nitrogen content of gall-tissue was unaffected by fertilization of the host-plant, although the nitrogen content of leaf-tissue was elevated.  Furthermore, fertilization did not improve gall-insect performance.  These results superficially run counter to the predictions of the nutrition theory for the adaptive nature of plant galls.
   3.  However, in one of the two species (Neuroterus) survivorship was highly variable across individual oak trees, and was negatively correlated with gall nitrogen content.  Between-tree differences persisted across years, irrespective of fertilization treatment.
   4.  Consistent with these results, experimental reduction in number of Neuroterus galls per leaf did not lead to an increase in nitrogen levels in the remaining galls, or to an improvement in insect performance.  Thus, there was no relationship between gall density and gall nitrogen content, nor between density and insect performance.
   5.  We conclude that cynipid gall-formers may be able to manipulate host nitrogen levels to their own advantage, by preventing an increase in gall nitrogen levels on fertilized trees; such an increase would reduce insect survival rates.  Our results are therefore consistent with the nutrition hypothesis to explain the evolution of insect galls.

AB We classified the parasitoids attacking 628 species of North American herbivorous insects as idiobionts (those that permanently disable their hosts during attack) or koinobionts (those that permit continued host development following parasitization).  Using these physiological attributes of parasitoids as estimators of host range, we tested three hypotheses that might explain why average parasitoid assemblage size decreases toward the tropics in complexes associated with exophytically feeding herbivores, whereas it does not in complexes associated with endophytic hosts.  We found that the geographical patterns for generalist (i.e., idiobiont) and specialist (i.e., koinobiont) hymenopterous parasitoids and Diptera do not support a host-predation hypothesis or a parasitoid-predation hypothesis and are only partly in accord with the resource-fragmentation hypothesis.  We conclude that a modified expression of the resource-fragmentation hypothesis can account for some of the geographical patterns of parasitoid assemblage size, but other forces, as yet unidentified, are also operating.

AB 1. We examined species richness patterns for the wasps associated with southern and central African figs (Ficus) to determine if fig wasp communities are saturated with species and if the degree of saturation (or undersaturation) differs in temperate and tropical communities.
   2. Saturation was tested by regressing local wasp-community richness (alpha diversity) against the regional wasp species richness (gamma diversity) of each fig species, and latitudinal variation in saturation was tested by regressing local community species richness against latitude. Separate analyses were conducted on the phytophagous, gall-forming wasps and their parasitoids.
   3. We found no evidence that either galler or parasitoid communities are saturated with species. This conclusion was supported by high levels of variability in species richness found in individual trees and fruits and by generally low levels of resource utilization by gallers.
   4. Local galler assemblage species richness was similar across a latitudinal gradient extending from 6-degrees-N to 34-degrees-S, suggesting that tropical and temperate communities are equally unsaturated. Local parasitoid community richness, on the other hand, dropped slightly towards the tropics, suggesting that tropical fig wasp parasitoid communities are even more unsaturated than temperate ones.
   5. The lack of saturation in fig wasp communities is judged to be largely due to a combination of strong phylogenetic constraints on wasp species, some of which have probably co-speciated with their hosts (which limits regional species richness) and the ability of wasps to colonize ephemeral and unpredictable host resources (which limits local species richness). The patterns are those expected for communities of specialists.

TI THE EFFECT OF WOLF PREDATION AND SNOW COVER ON MUSK-OX GROUP-SIZE
SO AMERICAN NATURALIST

   MACAQUES; ECOLOGY; NWT
AB I examined the pattern of seasonal and regional differences in musk-ox group size with respect to the costs and benefits of avoiding predation and acquiring food. In winter, group sizes were about 1.7 times larger than in summer. Variation in group size among areas was related to wolf densities in both seasons. Seasonal differences in group sizes were related to winter snow cover probably because snow renders feeding sites less abundant, increasingly patchy, and more ephemeral. Group size appears to be a trade-off between increasing per capita benefits of decreased predation risks in larger groups at higher wolf densities, lower per capita benefits of group foraging in summer than in winter, and higher per capita crowding costs as group size increases. The musk-ox breeding system does not influence group size but simply makes do with group sizes determined by ecological factors.

AB 1. The response of different salt-marsh plant communities to grazing by lesser snow geese and isostatic uplift was examined at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba on the Hudson Bay coast. Results are based on direct experimental manipulation of swards and previously published floristic and biomass data.
   2. At the seaward end of the salt-marsh the vegetation is composed of Puccinellia phryganodes and Carex subspathacea. This assemblage of species is also present in the upper marsh, but only as a consequence of intense grazing by geese. Grazed swards of these species persist over a period of at least 10 years.
   3. When swards are protected from grazing in the upper marsh, rapid changes in floristic composition of vegetation occur. There is a substantial increase in above-ground biomass and the vegetation is dominated by Calamagrostis deschampsiodes, Festuca rubra and dicotyledonous plants. When these swards are grazed the species composition does not revert to the Puccinellia-Carex assemblage.
   4. In the presence of grazing this change from the Puccinellia-Carex assemblage to the Calamagrostis-Festuca assemblage occurs gradually as a consequence of changes in edaphic conditions associated with isostatic uplift. The geese delay the rate of vegetational development associated with the effects of isostatic uplift but they cannot arrest it.
   5. Both types of plant assemblage may become extinct locally as a result of grubbing by the geese for roots and rhizomes of graminoid species. Habitat conditions are sufficiently altered following grubbing that the process of succession recommences from bare sediment.
   6. The results of changes in floristic composition, above-ground biomass and replacement rates of vegetation are examined in relation to predictions of multiple-state models which emphasize the directional asymmetry in the development of plant communities.

TI LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF EXCLUDING SHEEP FROM HILL PASTURES IN NORTH WALES

AB 1. From 1957 to 1968 a series of nine experiments was established to determine the effects of excluding sheep from hill pasture in Snowdonia. Each experiment consisted of three ungrazed plots and six grazed control plots. Species abundance was recorded non-destructively by cover pins during 1958-81. In autumn 1982, two of the experiments were completely fenced; vegetation changes in the formerly grazed plots were recorded by herbage sampling from 1981 to 1990.
   2. Successional changes depended strongly on the soil and initial vegetation of the site. Compositional change in grasslands initially dominated by Agrostis capillaris and Festuca ovina was smaller than in vegetation initially dominated by Nardus stricta and Festuca ovina, and was less obviously driven by coarser plants overtopping short ones.
   3. There was almost no invasion of new plant species, the only exceptions being Sorbus aucuparia, which was associated with bird perches on fences, Dryopteris dilatata, which emerged in tussocky grassland, and Solidago virgaurea, which may have spread to one site from nearby cliffs. The invaders played no important part in the succession.
   4. Early changes were relatively rapid, with the character of the vegetation altering markedly over about 7 years. Low-growing plants such as Danthonia decumbens, Juncus squarrosus, Trifolium repens and Polytrichum commune declined consistently, as did the biennial Cirsium palustre.
   5. Longer-term changes in the herbaceous vegetation were few. Suppressed shrubs of Calluna vulgaris and Erica cinerea grew into full-sized bushes, which at one site flourished for 20 and 12 years, respectively, before degenerating, but at other sites coalesced to achieve local dominance.
   6. In the absence of sheep, voles became the dominant herbivore and caused large year-to-year variation in herbage biomass. Agrostis vinealis and Holcus mollis were less damaged by voles than A. capillaris. Established tussocks of Molinia caerulea were also little affected. In years of high vole abundance the pleurocarpous mosses Hylocomium splendens and Pleurozium schreberi increased greatly among mats of dead grass.

AB 1. The five European species of Maculinea butterflies are among the most endangered invertebrates in the world. To attain a better understanding of the mechanisms which are most influential to their population dynamics, we develop a mathematical population model for one of these species, Maculinea rebeli, based on its dependence on two sequential resources, the cross-leaved gentian, Gentiana cruciata, and a red ant, Myrmica schencki. One of the main objects of this modelling study is to raise questions about the ecology and conservation of this rare and fascinating butterfly.
   2. The model has two main biological components: (i) recruitment and competition on the plant for the first few weeks of butterfly life, and (ii) recruitment by and competition within nests of the red ant for the remainder of the butterfly life-cycle.
   3. We estimate all of the parameters for the model based in part on data collected at a 4-ha study site in the Spanish Pyrenees, one of the largest known populations of Maculinea in the world.
   4. The model is used to evaluate how different ecological processes and densities of the plant and ant resources may affect the butterfly population, including its density, resilience from perturbation. and persistence.
   5. The model clearly indicates that, for the Spanish study site, the survival of the butterfly in ant nests is disproportionately more important to its population than is competition on the plant. Changes in the observed population of the plant have virtually no impact on the butterfly population.
   6. Future studies should take account for instance of changes in the density of ant nests and the population of a specialist ichneumonid parasitoid.

AB 1. During a 2-year study, the spatial and temporal dynamics of clonal growth, flower and fruit production, and production and survivorship of seedlings were compared in two species of Lathyrus in south-western France. Both are perennials that have a 'phalanx' growth form, with a high density of closely packed ramets.
   2. Transects of contiguous quadrats were established in one population of L. latifolius (at an altitude of 150 m a.s.l.) and in two populations of L. sylvestris (520 m and 750 m a.s.l.). In each transect the number, distribution and survivorship of ramets were measured at monthly intervals, together with their flowering and fruiting activity; the number and distribution of seedlings and seedling survivorship were also measured.
   3. Temporal dynamics of ramets in all sites followed the same general pattern. In late autumn and winter, following the summer flowering season, plants produced a new cohort of ramets. This was followed by a very large cohort of new ramets produced in late winter and spring. These ramets grew only vegetatively and flowered very rarely. Flowering and fruiting were largely restricted to smaller cohorts of ramets, produced in late spring and beginning of summer. Mean life expectancy of these cohorts was significantly lower than that of all other cohorts.
   4. Temporal dynamics of seedlings were similar to those of ramets, except in the high-altitude site for L. sylvestris, where the maximum number of seedlings appeared near the end of May, about 1 month before the peak in ramet production. Most seedlings survived no longer than 3 months; no surviving seedling in the transects had produced flowers by the end of the study.
   5. New ramets showed a clumped distribution at all scales. Most new ramets arose in tufts of other ramets from a single tap-root, or from daughter ramets very close to younger parts of the plant. The distribution of seedlings within transects was similar to that of ramets. In fact, seedlings only appeared in quadrats with tufts of ramets, or in adjacent quadrats.
   6. Except in the highest-altitude site, temporal patterns of vegetative growth in both species allowed the opportunistic growth of ramets throughout the year, even in midwinter during bouts of warm weather. Ramets initiated in winter did not flower. Winter ramets had longer life expectancies at birth than cohorts produced at other times of the year.
   7. Demographic traits of Lathyrus are discussed in relation to their consequences for genetic structuring observed in populations of these species.

AB 1. The relationship between seed and seedling spatial patterns of abundance was examined for five tree species in a deciduous forest of north-eastern North America. In this low-diversity forest, seed shadows (from different individuals of a given tree species) may overlap to a significant extent. The selective advantages of greater seed dispersal ability in order to avoid high predation and pathogen attack and intraspecific competition at proximity to the parent tree is unclear in this context.
   2. On the study site, there were no strong and consistent relationships between seed and seedling spatial patterns of abundance for any of the tree species studied. Dispersion patterns of seeds or seedlings varied between quadrats and did not necessarily correspond within any one quadrat: e.g. clumped seeds and randomly dispersed seedlings. Seeds of Betula alleghaniensis were positively associated, but its seedlings were negatively associated, with those of the other tree species. Good seed dispersal ability and highly specific germination microsites may partly explain these latter observations.
   3. Seed or seedling mortality for Acer saccharum was not strongly related to seed or seedling abundance, leading to rejection of the hypothesis that seed and seedling mortality was density dependent for this species on the study site. Moreover, seed mortality was spatially uncoupled from seedling mortality. Spatial and temporal variation in the relative importance of mortality factors (e.g. predation, pathogen attack and competition) on seeds and seedlings may account for these results. Because many factors seem to control seed and seedling spatial patterns of abundance and mortality on any one site. and because the significance of these factors appears to vary over time, the relationship between seed and seedling spatial patterns in old-growth forests may often be obscure.

AB 1. The contribution of seed rain to the seed bank and to the seedling cohort was evaluated for three species, Abies balsamea, Acer saccharum and Betula alleghaniensis, in a deciduous forest near Quebec, Canada. Through experimental manipulations, seed-bank turnover time and rate of seed incorporation into the soil were estimated for these tree species. The forest floor was also modified in small quadrats to simulate various natural microsites; seedling emergence and early survival, and microsite characteristics were then monitored.
   2. All Abies and Acer seedlings, and most Betula seedlings, originated from the previous year's seed rain. Abies and Acer were characterized by a winter-transient seed bank, but Betula maintained a persistent reserve of seeds in the soil. Turnover time of the Betula seed bank was c. 2 years in humus, but < 1 year in litter. Viability of Betula seeds placed under the litter on the forest floor declined from an initial value of 67% to 42% after 8 months, 3% after 20 months and 0% after 32 months. Acer seeds did not loose any viability during winter storage under natural conditions and they all germinated within a year, even when placed under the leaf litter.
   3. Betula seedlings established preferentially on litter-free surfaces such as experimentally created mounds and pits, and this independently of the position of these microsites either in gaps (<200 m2)  or under the intact canopy. First-season survival was slightly higher on mounds than in pits, and this was related to higher soil moisture, organic matter and temperature, conditions which favour seedling root development.

AB 1. The effect of male tree density on pollen flow and fruit set in females was examined for three species of dioecious tree (Neolitsea dealbata, Litsea leefeana and Diospyros pentamera) in complex notophyll rain forest in tropical, northeastern Australia.
   2. The spatial distribution for all reproductive individuals combined was significantly clumped in Diospyros but not in either Litsea or Neolitsea. Separate male and female groups were significantly clumped in all species. More than 80% of nearest male neighbours occurred within 10 m of Neolitsea females and within 20 m of Litsea and Diopsyros females. The ratio of males to females was 1-6:1 (Neolitsea), 1.5:1 (Diopsyros) and 1.3:1 (Litsea).
   3. No species produced fruit asexually when flowers were isolated in mesh bags. All species populations flowered synchronously but Diopsyros flowered for a longer period (15 weeks), than either Neolitsea (3-4 weeks) or Litsea (4-5 weeks). All species had small, unspecialized flowers and were pollinated by small, generalist insects. Male trees produced more flowers per reproductive shoot than females and flower production was positively correlated with tree size in males but not in females. Fruit set was not correlated with tree size in female trees.
   4. The ratio of fruit set to flowers in females was negatively related to two measurements of male to female distance (distance to the nearest male tree (all species) and mean distance to the nearest 10 (Neolitsea and Diospyros) or three (Litsea) males, termed 'local male distance'). The rate of reduction in fruit set with increasing nearest male distance was the same for all species, although Diospyros produced a higher proportion of fruit relative to flowers. The ranges of fruit set for Neolitsea, Litsea and Diospyros were 1-30%, 2-20% and 20-40%, respectively. Fruit set in Neolitsea females was similar in two successive seasons, indicating a consistent effect of local male distance on fruit set.
   5. The amount of pollen trapped at female trees over the whole flowering season was unrelated to fruit set or to local male distance in all species. Amounts of pollen trapped at females after the first 6 (Neolitsea) and 15 (Diospyros) days of flowering were negatively correlated with local male distance. In Neolitsea females, the amount of pollen trapped at females after 6 days of flowering was positively related to fruit set, indicating that effective fertilzations occur early in the flowering period.
   6. Although the mechanism for density-dependent pollen movement is the same for all three species, the longer flowering period and more gradual production of flowers found in Diospyros allowed more time for pollen to move through the population. It is concluded that rain-forest trees which have obligate outcrossing breeding systems, brief, synchronous flowering periods and are pollinated by a non-specialized fauna risk reduced rates of fruit set when relatively isolated from conspecifics.

AB 1. Intensive population studies were conducted for 10 years on red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) and the parasitic nematode, Trichostrongylus tenuis, in northern England. Winter loss was the key factor determining changes in grouse numbers, although breeding losses were also important.
   2. T. tenuis had an aggregated distribution within the adult grouse population, even though the degree of aggregation was relatively low compared with other parasite systems. Recruitment of parasites into the adult worm population was dependent on grouse density.
   3. Both winter loss and breeding losses were correlated with the intensity of parasite infection.
   4. Experimental reduction in parasite burdens consistently increased breeding production and winter survival of grouse thus demonstrating that parasites cause increased winter and breeding losses.
   5. The red grouse-T. tenuis system exhibits three conditions that will generate population cycles: (i) parasite-induced reduction in grouse breeding production, (ii) a low degree of parasite aggregation within the grouse population, and (iii) time delays in parasite recruitment.

AB 1. An extensive post-mortem survey of grouse revealed that birds killed by predators in spring and summer had significantly greater burdens of the caecal nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis than grouse shot during the autumn. Furthermore, grouse that appeared to have died through the effects of parasites carried greater worm burdens than grouse killed by predators.
   2. The proportion of grouse with high levels of parasite infection increased with the intensity of predator control as measured indirectly through keeper density. These two empirical observations suggest that predators selectively prey on heavily infected grouse.
   3. The interactions between parasites and predators were examined experimentally by reducing the worm burdens of female grouse with an oral anthelmintic. Nests of treated and untreated females were subsequently located either by research workers flushing the incubating female or by dogs trained to locate birds by scent. The dogs found significantly fewer of the treated than control birds, suggesting that female grouse with large parasite burdens emit more scent and are more vulnerable to mammalian predation.
   4. A modified mathematical model of the grouse-nematode system is described which incorporates the effects of both random and selective predation of heavily parasitized grouse. An analysis of the model illustrates the importance of interactions between grouse, parasites and predators in determining the relative densities of each. In particular, when predators selectively remove heavily parasitized individuals, then low levels of predation can lead to increases in the size of the host (or prey) population.

AB 1. Several hypotheses for the adaptive basis of sex assume that genotypic fitness varies according to location in a spatially or temporally heterogeneous environment. This study aimed to measure genotype-environment interactions in fitness-related traits, and to compare locality and time as sources of interaction.
   2. Clones of the bryozoan Celleporella hyalina were artificially propagated to give cohorts of genetically identical colonies which were reared in the field under three different water flow treatments, and over two seasonal periods.
   3. The total number of zooids per colony, and the number of gonozooids alone, were both used as indices of clonal performance, measured at the end of each seasonal experiment.
   4. By both zooid scores, clones varied greatly in mean performance, and thus in fitness. Correlations between fitness ranking in different environments were mostly positive, but many clones did show large shifts in rank order between environments. In autumn-winter some clones were of consistently high or low fitness in all three flow treatments, despite large treatment differences in mean zooid productivity.
   5. Seasonal differences had a greater effect on fitness ranking than flow regime. This pattern was more pronounced when gonozooid number was used as the index of performance.
   6. Disparities in clonal performance were reduced in the least productive environments. These conditions caused a greater reduction in performance in genotypes of high average fitness.
   7. The performance of an individual clone within an environment was not always constant. In spring-summer, replicate colonies often differed considerably in growth rate, even when growing closely adjacent to each other.
   8. The results illustrate the need for precise definitions of fitness, and for further experimental work to determine the niche breadth of individual clones and thus the relative intensity of competition within and between genotypes.

TI DISCRIMINATION AND PATCH CHOICE BY SHEEP GRAZING GRASS-CLOVER SWARDS
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE FORAGING BEHAVIOR; HERBIVORY; PATCH; PREFERENCE; GRAZING
ID DIET SELECTION; HERBAGE INTAKE; WHITE CLOVER; HEIGHT
AB 1. The proposition that large herbivores make foraging choices which maximize intake rate was examined in two experiments on discrimination by sheep grazing pairs of swards (patches) varying in composition of two botanical components, grass and clover, and varying in sward surface height.
   2. Patch selection was influenced by sward height and by clover content, and their effects were additive. Tall patches were preferred, and intermediate contents of clover were selected in preference to low or high contents. This would reinforce the patchy distribution of the grass and clover components of mixed swards. Sheep did not exploit local variation in clover content within patches.
   3. There was no evidence that patch choice was influenced by differences in the intake rate obtained from the two alternatives at hand, although on average the highest intake rates were obtained on tall patches with intermediate clover contents, coincident with the pattern of preference.
   4. During frequent switching between patches, components of the functional response such as bite depth, bite weight and intake rate were modified by patch composition and also by the composition of the alternate patch. This short-term carry-over effect must increase the discrimination difficulties on heterogeneous vegetation.
   5. It is argued that pre-consumption cues signalling patch quality are of less use to sheep than the information gained about a patch during grazing, but that this is initially distorted by recent experience; and that information constraints on the maximization of long-term intake rate will occur during frequent switching within heterogeneous vegetation.

   SEEDS
ID DISPERSAL; MORPHOLOGY; EFFICACY; SOIL
AB 1. A dispersed seed must remain in a microsite long enough to imbibe water and germinate. Here the post-dispersal movement caused by wind of four asymmetric samaras of Picea engelmannii, P. abies, Pinus contorta var. latifolia and P. strobus was studied on four surface roughnesses (a smooth board, c. 250 mum, c. 750 mum and 2.0 mm). A mechanistic approach is taken to determine the chance that a seed will remain on a surface long enough to germinate.
   2. The threshold or lift-off velocities for all combinations of four samaras and four surface roughnesses were determined in a wind tunnel. These measured threshold velocities were incorporated with seed mass and wing area to define the non-dimensional resistance to seed movement (B). The resistance to movement is the ratio of the force due to gravity to that developed by the wind on a given reference area.
   3. The resistance to movement was used in a logistic regression to predict the percentage of seeds unmoved (remaining) on a surface with increasing wind velocity. All regressions explained a significant proportion (P < 0.05) of the variation, with r2 greater-than-or-equal-to 0.64. Regressions had steeper slopes the greater the resistance to seed movement. The resistance equation should be species-independent, assuming a geometrically similar shape, and was so for the smoothest surface but not always so on the remaining surfaces.
   4. The percentage of seeds that will be unmoved on different surfaces for different time intervals was estimated by determining the return time in a natural environment of the threshold velocities in the resistance to movement (B). Wind velocities in nature have empirically estimatable return times, i.e. lower velocities occur more frequently than higher velocities. These return times were calculated for Calgary, Alberta. Heavy seeds were found to move less frequently than smaller seeds, as would be expected. On rougher surfaces, seeds remained stationary longer because the threshold velocity is larger and also the return time of that velocity is longer.
   5. Finally, the timing of seed movement determined above was compared to germination times (under ideal conditions) to determine if seeds, on surfaces of different roughness, were generally stationary long enough to imbibe water and germinate. On smooth surfaces (particle sizes up to c. 750 mum), all seeds moved before adequate time had elapsed for germination. On rougher surfaces (particle sizes up to 2 mm) the distribution of the percentage of seeds remaining was positively skewed and the tail of the distribution declined more slowly. This tail defines seeds which are caught in microsites that have the highest probability of germinating.

AB 1. It has been reported that species from environments where seedlings are prone to drought during establishment tend to have larger seeds. One proposed reason for this is that larger-seeded species might be able to allocate a larger proportion of mass to roots rather than shoots during early growth.
   2. Seedlings of 32 species from arid central Australia were grown in coarse sand under standard conditions in a glasshouse, and harvested 10 days after germination. Seedlings from heavier-seeded species did not allocate relatively more resources to roots than lighter-seeded species. Complementary experiments confirmed this result for plants grown oil sandy loam, in drying as compared to well-watered soil. and under shaded conditions.
   3. Seedlings of heavier-seeded species tended to survive longer than seedlings from lighter-seeded species when grown in the absence of any mineral nutrients other than those in the seed.
   4. Seedlings of heavier-seeded species tended to be able to emerge from greater depths in the soil than lighter-seeded species.
   5. Seedlings from heavier-seeded species had a slower relative growth rate than lighter-seeded species during the first 10 days after germination. Nevertheless, among these species, seed size was more important than relative growth rate or germination speed in determining seedling size 10 days after seeds were wetted.

AB 1. I examined the lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of male Tengmalm's owls in western Finland where vole abundance fluctuates cyclically among years. Males were site-tenacious after their first breeding attempt.
   2. The productivity of 141 males, all of which started to breed during 1979-87, was studied up to 1990. They spent 1-7 years (mean 1.5 years) as breeders and raised 0-26 fledglings (mean 5.4) during their lifetime. The lifetime number of fledglings produced by males was highly significantly correlated with their lifetime contribution of known recruits to the breeding population.
   3. Most male fledglings (78%) died before the first breeding attempt. Of the young fledged in one year, 5% produced 50% of fledglings in the next generation, and 21% of males reared 50% of all fledglings produced by the population.
   4. Offspring survival from egg to fledgling was the most important component of LRS, followed by the life span and clutch size. The age of first breeding did not affect LRS, but polygynous males produced twice as many fledglings as monogamous ones.
   5. Among environmental factors, vole abundance was the most important determinant of LRS: males entering the breeding population in the low and increase phases of the vole cycle gained larger LRS than males recruiting in the peak and decrease phases.
   6. As the breeding life span of polygynous males was longer than that of monogamous ones and as there was no negative relationship between the brood size and the duration of breeding life, no evidence of reproductive costs could be obtained. Superior males may easily compensate for the large parental investment by increasing their food intake without risking their future survival.

TI THE ECOLOGY OF SEVERE MOORLAND FIRE ON THE NORTH YORK MOORS - SEED
   DISTRIBUTION AND SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENT OF CALLUNA-VULGARIS

AB 1. Regeneration of Calluna vulgaris following normal heath fires is from surviving stem bases or, where survival is poor, from a seed bank. Severe fires causing ignition of surface organic horizons kill stem bases and cause a serious depletion of the seed bank, most of which (up to 10(6) seeds m-2) lies in the litter and upper 2-3 cm of soil or organic material. Germinable seeds were detected in appreciable numbers down to 6 cm beneath the boundary of the F/O soil horizons in soil cores from mature heath vegetation on a blanket peat and peaty stagnopodzol. However, severe fires in which more than 10 cm of peat is ignited will destroy all of the viable seed bank.
   2. At the site studied, the seed-rain density for Calluna was approximately inversely proportional to the dispersal distance; regression equations predicted an annual seed rain of only c. 25 seeds m-2 at 10 m from source plants. Small numbers of wind-dispersed flowers retaining some seeds may be important in long-distance dispersal.
   3. The crustose lichens Lecidea granulosa and L. uliginosa and several species of algae form a near-ubiquitous film over the surface of exposed organic soil following severe moorland fires. This creates a crust overlying unconsolidated sub-surface peat. The lichen-alga film significantly reduced germination of Calluna seeds by about 40%.
   4. No evidence was found to link poor germination or growth to low pH, low nutrient levels or soil toxicity. Fertilizer experiments show that addition of potassium increases the root:shoot ratio of Calluna seedlings while nitrogen increases shoot growth at the expense of root development. It is suggested that the seedling root:shoot ratio may be important in establishment and in surviving the effects of needle ice formation, surface instability and desiccation.
   5. Transplant experiments and observations on naturally occurring seedlings show that summer desiccation of seedlings, winter browning, surface instability due to needle ice formation, and trampling by sheep are all major factors preventing seedling establishment. The relative importance of these factors varies from site to site.

DE CLIMATE CHANGE; FUNCTIONAL TYPES; GROWTH FORM; SEED BIOLOGY
AB 1. A multivariate analysis of 43 traits of 300 species from semi-arid woodlands in western New South Wales. Australia is described. The 43 traits encompass vegetative, life-history, phenological and seed-biology characters.
   2. Five main groups of species were produced which corresponded largely to growth form. These groups were (i) perennial forbs and C3 grasses, (ii) subshrubs of the family Chenopodiaceae, (iii) perennial C4 grasses, (iv) trees and shrubs and (v) annual forbs and grasses. The traits associated with these groups were vegetative, life-history and phenological. Seed-biology traits were poorly associated with the groups.
   3. There were higher percentages of associations within and between vegetative, life-history and phenological traits, than within seed-biology traits. This has important consequences for models of vegetation dynamics in the context of species migrations under global climate change, as these models group species largely on the basis of their vegetative and life-history attributes.

AB 1. We conducted a 2-year study of Anolis nebulosus Weigman with the aim of understanding the effects of seasonality and predation on the behaviour of this tropical, mainland anole. The study was carried out in a deciduous forest at the Estacion de Biologia Chamela on the Pacific coast of Mexico. This area has a severe 6-7 month dry season and the largest seasonal fluctuations in arthropod numbers and biomass yet recorded for a tropical habitat. As is characteristic of mainland anoles, the A. nebulosus population in the Chamela forest experiences high predation rates and low annual survivorship.
   2. Our results indicate that seasonality and predation are major forces shaping the foraging strategies, activity levels, and social behaviour of A. nebulosus. In response to the wet season flush of insects, males and females shift from ground to arboreal foraging and increase feeding rates 5-10-fold. Males also travel further to capture prey and change their foraging mode, switching from trunk-ground, sit-and-wait foraging in the dry season to trunk-crown, mobile foraging in the wet season.
   3. During the dry season, male and female A. nebulosus are the most sedentary lizards known, moving only once or twice per hour, and travelling a maximum of 8-9 m day- 1. During the wet season females are 2-3 times and males 5-10 times more active. Following the brief breeding period, however, both males and females retreat into unexposed hiding places and are emergent and active for only 1 or 2 days week-1. This reclusive behaviour and the exceptional levels of inactivity found in this species are most likely adaptations that reduce the risk of predation.
   4. During the wet season breeding period, male A. nebulosus increase display rates 15-30-fold and expand their home ranges 10-15-fold. Compared to insular populations of A. nebulosus, however, the Chamela males invest significantly less time courting females (49% vs. 95%) and more time hiding and resting (44% vs. 1%). Such differences suggest that mainland males are trading off the probability of encountering and mating with females for enhanced safety.
   5. Time budget analysis reveals that females devote more time to foraging than males during both wet and dry seasons. This strategy may enhance female fitness by increasing growth rate, fat reserves, and egg production. Males divide their time equally between resting/hiding and foraging and allocate only a small proportion of their day to social activities, except during the breeding period when the majority of their time and energy is invested in reproductive behaviour.

TI LEAF GROWTH DYNAMICS AND HERBIVORY IN 5 SPECIES OF AUSTRALIAN
   RAIN-FOREST CANOPY TREES

AB 1. The leaf growth dynamics of five species of rain-forest tree in New South Wales, Australia, were studied over the lifespan of several cohorts of leaves (ranging in longevity from 6 months to over 10 years), to determine the patterns of emergence, growth, mortality and herbivory in the canopy. Leaf population dynamics were examined for variability within and between several spatial scales: canopy heights, individual trees, species, and rain-forest formations.
   2. Representative species were selected within each of the three major rain-forest formations of New South Wales: Nothofagus moorei and Doryphora sassafras in cool-temperate or montane or mossy microphyll forest, D. sassafras and Ceratopetalum apetalum in warm-temperate or simple notophyll vine forest, and Dendrocnide excelsa, D. sassafras and Toona australis in subtropical or complex notophyll vine forest. Technical climbing apparatus was used to gain access to the canopy, where leaves were permanently marked and monitored on a monthly basis for up to 12 years.
   3. Three main leafing patterns were observed: seasonal growth - leaves flushed synchronously (e.g. N. moorei, T. australis); intermittent growth - leaves flushed over several months (e.g. D. sassafras, C. apetalum); and continuous growth - leaves flushed throughout the year (e.g. D. excelsa).
   4. Leaf lifespans were variable, ranging from short-lived leaves (D. excelsa, approximately 6 months), to annual leaves (T. australis), and longer-lived leaves (e.g. D. sassafras, ranging from 2 to 12 or more years). Shaded leaves lived longer than sun-exposed leaves, and those on trees at montane sites generally lived longer than leaves on individuals of the same species at lower altitudes.
   5. Significantly different proportions of leaf area were lost throughout the lifespan of a leaf in various species: T. australis (4.5%); D. sassafras (16.6%); C. apetalum (22%); N. moorei (31%); and D. excelsa (32.5%). Shade leaves and young leaves were more extensively grazed than sun leaves and old leaves, respectively. Leaves located nearer to ground level suffered greater herbivory, although this may be in part an interaction with light regime.
   6. The measurements on herbivory, senescence, and longevity were used to calculated annual turnover of canopy material to either primary decomposers (through leaf fall), or primary consumers (through herbivory) in the three rain-forest formations. In a hectare of the subtropical forest, approximately 1.76t (14%) and 5.59 t (46%) were allocated each year to herbivores and decomposers, respectively, from a total canopy of 12.26 t. In the warm-temperate forest, 2.5 t (22%) and 4.05 t (35%) were allocated annually to herbivores and decomposers, respectively, from a canopy of 11.41 t. In the cool-temperate forest, an estimated 2.63 t (27%) and 3.53 t (37%) went to herbivores and decomposers, respectively, from a total canopy of 9.69t.

AB 1. Regeneration patterns of three emergent conifers (Dacrydium cupressinum, Prumnopitys ferruginea and P. taxifolia) and three broadleaved canopy species (Elaeocarpus dentatus, Nestegis cunninghamii and Weinmannia racemosa) were inferred from population age structures and spatial patterns in podocarp-broadleaf forest in Tongariro National Park, North Island, New Zealand, Age data were obtained from three clear-felled plots.
   2. All three podocarp species had highly discontinuous age-distributions, with different age ranges reflecting differing light requirements and longevities of the three species. Dating of scars and releases on stem cross-sections suggested that the main podocarp age classes established during a period of progressive overstorey mortality rather than as a result of a single massive exogenous disturbance.
   3. Elaeocarpus dentatus regenerates mainly by rapid growth in small canopy gaps. Both Nestegis cunninghamii and Weinmannia racemosa had all-aged populations. Nestegis cunninghamii appears to regenerate continuously beneath the canopy. Regeneration mechanisms of Weinmannia racemosa were unclear, but seedlings of this species depend mainly on elevated surfaces, and vegetative reproduction also occurs.
   4. Continuous occupancy of the study area by high-density podocarp stands of restricted age-range is likely. Wind disturbances and cohort senescence are envisaged as dominant factors in the dynamics of these podocarp stands. A variable cycle is postulated which involves episodic widespread overstorey mortality effected mainly by wind disturbances. This mortality may be progressive or catastrophic - both these circumstances apparently producing podocarp regeneration.

AB 1. Modules are important to plant growth because they have the meristems needed to produce daughter units. The module dynamics of single plants are examined in a model developed to evaluate the relative importance of seasonality and reproductive effort. The model is a logistic system in which K is the maximum number of modules per plant and r(t), the instant growth rate, is the capacity of modules to multiply under optimal conditions minus the costs of seasonality and flowering.
   2. Simulations included adverse seasons varying in severity and frequency, different timings of births and deaths of modules, different flowering times and reproductive efforts, different performances under optimal conditions, and different maximum plant sizes.
   3. Of all the parameters in the model, only the capacity to multiply and the combined costs of flowering and climatic severity had a substantial impact on early plant size. The rate of module accumulation slowed when plants got close to maximum size. Mathematically complex frequencies, timing and delays in mortality, growth and flowering can be disregarded.
   4. The capacity to multiply vegetatively (r(v)) should be measured in newly emerged seedlings growing under optimal conditions, before the onset of negative size-dependent factors. Producing daughter modules early in the life of modules should be favoured when rapid growth is crucial. The value of r(v) limits the amount of reproductive effort, PHI, and seasonal severity, sigma, that a plant can sustain. Plants should show increased reproductive effort at the climatically benign end of their range.

AB 1. Several census variables are available to plant demographers, from simple units such as leaves and internodes to compound elements known as metamers, modules and architectural models. Ideally, the census variable has the following characteristics: (i) it is demographically competent, i.e. comes in denumerable units subject to mortality and preferably capable of producing daughter units; (ii) it is well correlated with and preferably contributes directly to the process which is the primary object of the research; (iii) its dynamics are sensitive to experimental treatments; and (iv) the data are simple to record. 2. The merits of leaves, modules (rosettes) and module assemblages (stolons) as reiteration variables were examined using Potentilla anserina rosettes exposed to varying levels of light and nutrients. The usefulness of each variables as a predictor or direct contributor was evaluated in relation to total biomass and number of flowers per plant. 3. Each reiterated element came in denumerable units capable of mortality but only the modules and stolons carried the meristems necessary to produce daughter units. 4. The best predictor of the number of flowers per plant was the number of modules because single flowers occurred terminally on each module. The best predictor of biomass was the number of leaves alive at harvest because the comprised 72-3% of the above-ground biomass. 5. The dynamics of the smallest units, the leaves, were more sensitive to treatments than modules and stolons. Compound elements (modules and stolons) were demographically buffered by and less immediately responsive than their constituent elements (leaves). This is a demographic consequence of the hierarchy of reiteration.

AB 1. The diets of four Arctic charr morphs (Salvelinus alpinus (L.)); small benthic (SB), large benthic (LB), small limnetic (SL) and large limnetic (LL), were analysed on a seasonal and diel basis in different habitats in lake Thingvallavatn, Iceland. All morphs used the littoral habitat (littoral stony zone, 0-10 m depth, and littoral Nitella zone, 10-20 m depth), but limnetics also used the pelagic habitat (0-70 m depth).
   2. The morphs exhibited dietary specializations, strongly correlated with distinct differences in trophic morphology. Benthic morphs foraged on zoobenthos, especially the mollusc Lymnaea peregra. Small limnetics fed extensively on open water foods, particularly zooplankton, whereas large limnetics preyed mainly upon threespined stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus, less on Arctic charr. Diet of limnetics differed slightly between habitats.
   3. Seasonal and diel changes in diet composition were slight, and benthics and limnetics did not overlap in each others specific diet. However, all morphs converged in spring upon insect pupae that are then superabundant. The food segregation between benthics and limnetics was established from age 1 (fork length c. 7 cm) and onwards.
   4. The size of snails eaten increased with increasing size of benthic charr, and the size of charr eaten increased with increasing size of LL charr. This is explained in terms of ontogenetic gape limitations. Larger snails eaten by SB charr relative to those eaten by similarly sized LB charr may be the result of the larger head and more subterminal mouth of SB charr, endowing them with greater ability to engulf larger snails. It is suggested that LL charr are ecomorphs of SL charr which, through ontogenetic shifts, switch from planktivory to piscivory at the size of 22 cm.
   5. All morphs, except LL charr, showed peaks in stomach filling and fish caught in gill-nets around twilight in autumn. Depending on the morph, this may be linked with diel variation in availability of food organisms, and risk of predation by LL charr.
   6. Strong correlations between ecology and morphology suggest that the benthic and limnetic morphs are adapted to the littoral benthic and pelagic niches respectively of Thingvallavatn. Low fish species diversity, discreteness, and stability of alternate niches in the lake may be important factors in reducing competitive interactions, and thus promoting coexistence by phenotype-specific preferences for resources.

AB 1. The equilibrium theory of island biogeography proposes species on an island is the result of a dynamic equilibrium between immigration and extinction.
   2. Annual surveys of an island's fauna are the most direct evidence bearing on the theory, which predicts that while species number will remain nearly constant, species composition will change.
   3. We surveyed the land birds of Guana Island, British Virgin Islands, a small tropical island (299 ha; 64-degrees-30'W 18-degrees-28'N), each year from 1984 through 1990. Earlier surveys of the island's birds were made in 1954 and 1976.
   4. During this time, no species of bird became established on the island. One established species, Dendroica petechia, became extinct. This extinction is attributable to habitat destruction. There were no instances of equilibrium turnover.
   5. The absence of turnover contrasts with most other studies of insular avifaunas, but is in agreement with at least some studies of other tropical islands.
   6. Tropical birds may have lower turnover rates because they are more sedentary, have lower adult mortality, and are more often resident, rather than migratory. Alternatively, the position of Guana Island within an archipelago of numerous small islands may lead to a metapopulation structure which greatly reduces the probability of local extinction.

AB 1. Growth responses to hurricane disturbance were assessed for the dominant species in two sites in a northern-hardwood forest at Hubbard Brook, New Hampshire, USA. The species comprised two shade-tolerant trees, A cer saccharum (sugar maple) and Fagus grandifolia (American beech), one relatively shade-intolerant tree, Fraxinus americana (white ash) and one tree of intermediate tolerance, Betula alleghaniensis (yellow birch). The two sites, 0.6 km apart, were similar except for contrasting disturbance histories. The hurricane-damaged site was devastated by a hurricane in 1938, whilst the control site was only lightly damaged by the hurricane. Radial growth was compared between species, size classes, time periods and sites.
   2. Radial growth of all species increased dramatically immediately following the hurricane in the damaged site; proportional growth increased more than sevenfold, on average. Radial growth remained high in the hurricane-damaged stand 49 years later. There was no change in radial growth in the control stand following the hurricane.
   3. F. americana (the least shade-tolerant species) showed the greatest proportional increase in growth after the hurricane and maintained the highest growth rates several decades after disturbance. B. alleghaniensis, A. saccharum and F. grandifolia had very similar growth responses. Smaller trees had a greater proportional increase in growth than larger trees following the hurricane, especially for F. americana.
   4. Stem density remained higher and mean tree basal area remained lower in the hurricane-damaged site than in the control site 49 years after the hurricane.
   5. The pioneer species Prunus pensylvanica (pin cherry) invaded after the hurricane in the damaged site, but 49 years later was present only as dead stems, having been replaced by the later successional species B. alleghaniensis, A. saccharum, F. grandifolia and F. americana. This is the same successional sequence that follows clearcutting in northern-hardwood forests.

AB 1.  Juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) that do not migrate to sea within the next year spend the winter under stones in the stream bed.  In a laboratory study, we show that this coincides with a loss of appetite even in the presence of excess food:  an index of appetite dropped by an average of 96% between early September and late December.
   2.  This period of anorexia leads to the virtual cessation of growth under environmental conditions that would otherwise allow growth to occur.
   3.  Juvenile salmon normally exhibit a gradual loss of fat reserves during the winter.  This depletion was experimentally accelerated by depriving fish of food for 3 weeks.  The fish responded by increasing their appetite; appetite was negatively correlated with the estimated energy reserves of individual fish.
   4.  Those fish previously deprived of food regained their appetite and made up their lost fat within 4 weeks of resuming feeding; their appetite then decreased to the level of control fish.
   5.  The parallel changes in habitat choice and appetite in autumn may be a consequence of the decreased profitability and increased predation risk when feeding in winter.  The degree and duration of anorexia in overwintering salmon is not pre-programmed but is regulated by energy reserves, the salmon effectively having a 'defended energy level' below which appetite is increased until lost energy reserves have been restored.

AB 1. Sibling Atlantic salmon fry show variation in early growth rates, despite being of a similar size initially and being in the same environment with excess food. This variation in early growth has a critical impact on their subsequent life-history strategies. We examined the relationships between social status, otolith size at first feeding and early growth rates. Fish were assessed for social status soon after first feeding, and their growth measured over the first 3 months. They were then killed to obtain the otoliths.
   2. Surprisingly, otolith size was not related to fish size at first feeding, but was related to dominance status, dominant fish having larger otoliths. Both otolith size and dominance status at first feeding were good predictors of fish size 3 months later (which, in tum, is a good predictor of age at smolt migration).
   3. It is suggested that variation in metabolic rate may influence both otolith size at first feeding and dominance; dominant individuals would have a greater potential for growth, so producing a correlation between initial otolith size and subsequent growth rates. This would result in a connection between metabolic rate and age at migration.

AB 1. Penstemon palmeri is a short-lived perennial herb that occupies early-successional habitats at mid altitude in the semi-arid south-western United States. Laboratory germination experiments with seeds from nine populations showed that most seeds were non-dormant at autumn temperatures (15-degrees-C), but a majority required light for germination. Moist chilling at winter temperatures (1-degrees-C) for 4 weeks induced secondary dormancy in about half the seeds, whilst moist incubation at superoptimal summer temperatures (30-degrees-C) for 2 weeks removed most primary and chilling-induced secondary dormancy, prevented the induction of dormancy by chilling, and reduced the proportion of light-requiring seeds. The effect of 1-degrees-C and 30-degrees-C treatments persisted or were increased through drying.
   2. A 2-year field retrieval experiment with seeds from three populations showed that dormancy induction during winter and release from dormancy during summer functioned as predicted from laboratory experiments to confine germination to periods during autumn or early spring and to permit year-to-year persistence of the seed bank.
   3. Cyclic dormancy patterns demonstrated for Penstemon palmeri are similar to those described for facultative winter annual weeds. However, because chilling causes the seed population to diverge into Spring-germinable and spring-dormant fractions, its seed bank can persist from year to year without burial.
   4. There were no clear habitat-correlated differences in germination patterns among populations, and populations from contrasting habitats showed similar and appropriate field responses. This suggests that Penstemon palmeri is a generalist in terms of germination pattern

AB 1. The role of lion Panthera leo predation in the dynamics of blue wildebeest Connochaetes taurinus and zebra Equus burchelli populations was investigated through simulation models. The data used in the models were from intensive observations over 4 years in the south-east of the Kruger National Park.
   2. Population estimates of wildebeest and zebra were made from aerial surveys, sex and age ratios from ground counts. Lion numbers were determined from observations of marked and radio-collared animals. Predation was studied by following lions for continuous periods of up to 336 h.
   3. Two models were constructed. Model 1 ascertained the number of killing lions (adult females) that could be supported by each prey population while remaining stable. A single model was constructed for the sedentary wildebeest population. A summer and winter model was constructed for the semi-migratory zebra population. The sensitivity of the parameters in the model was tested by changing their value by 10%. In model 2, the kill age structure for each species was changed to determine the number of killing lions the altered prey selection parameters could support. 4. There was no difference in the vulnerability of either species to predation. Zebra foals (<1 year) were killed more frequently than expected. No selection for sex or by season could be found for either species.
   5. Model 1 predicted that the wildebeest population stabilizes with 7.7 killing lions, close to the number in the study area. The winter zebra population stabilizes with 6.8 killing lions and the summer zebra population with 19.4. Manipulation of kill rate followed by adult fecundity rate had the greatest effect on population size of both species. In model 2, wildebeest predation was made selective towards calves and zebra predation was made non-selective for sex and age. With these parameters the wildebeest population stabilizes with 10.7 killing lions and the zebra population with 5.4 in winter and 15.1 in summer.
   6. The models suggest that lion predation affected wildebeest more severely than zebra during the study. This was through the way in which lions selected their prey, and because of the sedentary behaviour of the wildebeest, as opposed to the semi-migratory behaviour of the zebra.

AB Fragmented landscapes alter ecological interactions by modifying the flux of organisms, material, and energy. Fragmented distributions of hypothetical resources and species were represented by several fractal models of landscape patterns at scales ranging from 90 to 2,400 m. Maps of resource aggregations at three scales resulted in multiple-scale notions of "patch," "gap," "edge," "corridor," "source," and "sink." A neutral model of species co-occurrence was developed for analyses conducted at several scales. The neutral model has implications for sampling mutualistic species and for detecting species' responses to changes in environmental conditions. An ecologically meaningful view of landscape pattern depends on the home range size, dispersal ability, or speed with which organisms use resources rather than on the cartographic depiction of the landscape used by humans.

AB 1. Most populations undergo multiple-factor limitation. This raises the question of whether the different factors combine additively or interactively.
   2. While the prevailing view favours interactive limitation, there is little experimental evidence to back this up.
   3. Results of two factorial experiments involving Drosophila melanogaster are presented. The first is based on a series of resource variables, while the second includes presence/absence of a natural enemy.
   4. The results of the first experiment show widespread interactive effects, while in the second there is a general lack of interaction.
   5. Possible reasons for this unexpected contrast are discussed, and the need for a greater use of factorial experiments is emphasized.

AB 1. Manipulative field experiments were used to investigate the reproductive system of individuals and populations of Saxifraga cespitosa, S. tenuis and S. cernua in the Abisko area of northern Sweden.
   2. Populations of S. cespitosa were gynodioecious. Hermaphrodite individuals showed a high selfing efficiency and low pollen:ovule ratios - consistent with a low outbreeding rate.
   3. Saxifraga tenuis was hermaphrodite with some indication of sexual asymmetry. Pollen:ovule ratios were low, as in S. cespitosa, but the ability to set seed by autodeposition was lower in S. tenuis than in S. cespitosa.
   4. Saxifraga cernua was androdioecious in the study area, with some populations that contained only female-sterile individuals and other populations with both female-sterile and hermaphrodite individuals. The higher production of bulbils by female-sterile individuals, coupled with self-incompatibility in hermaphrodites, suggests a means by which androdioecy may be maintained in S. cernua, in the absence of differences in male reproductive success between gender classes.
   5. Population structure and the hierarchical partitioning of morphometric diversity within and between populations and individuals in the three species were investigated using image analysis of leaf shape. Although all three species showed significant inter-population differentiation, the morphometric distances between populations were not related to the geographic distances between populations. The majority of the total diversity in leaf shape was accounted for by inter-population differentiation in all three species, with <1% of the diversity due to variation within individuals.
   6. The mosaic pattern of variation in the three saxifrages is consistent with a scenario of localized founder effect and may still reflect patterns of recruitment after the deglaciation of the study area c. 8200 BP.

ID VEGETATION
AB 1. Two-phase mosaics (densely vegetated patches regularly alternating with almost bare areas) occur on smooth slopes of many arid lands of the world as a result of rainwater redistribution through sheet-flow run off. This paper reports the vegetation dynamics (through synchronic and diachronic approaches) of both the upslope and downslope fringes of vegetated patches (vegetation arcs) located in the Chihuahuan Desert, Mexico. 2. Ten vegetation arcs were used in a synchronic study and one of them in an 8-year diachronic study (1982-90). Data gathered in 2-m-wide, 8-15-m-long grids of 25-cm x 25-cm contiguous quadrats were used to study the variation of species richness, life-form dominance, dominance-diversity relationships and species composition across the fringes. 3. A colonization process developed in the upslope fringes; (i) species richness increased gradually to a peak and then decreased, as would be expected in an ecotone; (ii) this peak coincided spatially with a change in life form and floristic dominance; and (iii) communities with geometric-like distributions of abundance were replaced by communities with log-normal-like distributions of abundance, which are common in successional processes. 4. The diachronic study showed that the peak of species richness had moved upslope with a concomitant colonization of new space in that direction. The displacement of that peak, coupled with changes over time in the dominance of life forms and in the dominance-diversity relationships, provided additional evidence that a successional process of colonization develops. Likewise, long-term variations in floristic composition of the upslope quadrats were explained by time, position along the grid and rainfall, in order of decreasing importance. 5. There was a determinism both in the life form and in the floristic replacement processes observed upslope, suggesting a general scheme of obligatory succession. The bare area was colonized by short-lived perennials and/or facultative therophytes that almost never appear in the main body of the arcs. These species are gradually replaced by tussock grasses and seedlings of woody species which are the dominants in the main body of the arcs. 6. A different process can be inferred from the structural variability in space observed in the downslope fringes. A spatially non-contagious variation in species richness, a spatially non-patterned variation in life-form dominance, and a constancy in geometric-like dominance-diversity relationships suggested that colonization processes were not developing. A long-term decrease in species richness as well as in life-form diversity and a reduction in the abundance of tussock grasses suggested that a process of senescence without new recruitments was occurring. Analysis of the variation of floristic data through time showed the floristic impoverishment of a grassland community dominated by Hilaria mutica coupled with a reduction in the abundance of that species. 7. The dynamics of colonization of bare areas in two-phase mosaics offers an example of succession in arid lands that is probably present in all the world areas where these two-phase mosaics have been reported (the Middle East, Africa, Australia and North America).

AB 1. Soil nitrogen mineralization rate and nitrification rates were determined in situ and in the laboratory for a number of sites along two altitudinal transects in the Scottish Highlands for four periods during the growing season. Available nitrogen, total nitrogen, ignition loss, water content and pH were determined on the same soil samples.
   2. Mineralization rates in both field and laboratory either did not change with altitude or were highest in samples from high altitudes, despite the altitudinal decline in temperature. Mineralization and nitrification rates were highest at the beginning and end of the growing season.
   3. It is suggested that the mineralization rate is influenced by the concentration of readily decomposed nitrogenous compounds and that at high altitude these are not broken down over winter as much as at low altitudes, because of the incidence of freezing temperatures. Thus, during the growing season there is an altitudinal gradient in the availability of substrates for mineralization.

AB 1. Utilizing population censuses, field experiments, and population models, we evaluated the causes of spatial aggregation and its consequences for intraspecific competition in an insect herbivore.
   2. Eggs, larvae and adults of the flea beetle Altica tombacina were consistently aggregated among stems of fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium) in a 3-year census of a field population.
   3. Aggregation was due in part to the fact that flea beetle eggs are laid in clutches. Furthermore, adult beetles remained longer on fireweed clones they shared with conspecifics, suggesting that aggregation is enhanced by deliberate congregation of adults. Aggregation apparently does not result from any ovipositional preference for high quality stems, nor from any tendency for adults to alter their movement or oviposition behaviour in response to local host density.
   4. Repeated manipulation of flea beetle density in field cages demonstrated that, in two years, larval survival declined as density increased, as did the mean dry weight of surviving adults in one year.
   5. Using our data on the effect of density on larval survival, we estimated that overall larval survival in the aggregated field population was only 10.5% lower in 1988 and 5.2% lower in 1989 than it would have been were larvae randomly distributed among stems. In contrast, mean survival was 36% lower in 1988, when mean density was high, than it was in 1989.
   6. Aggregation did not strongly alter the average intensity of intraspecific competition within years because the recruitment curve relating adult emergence to larval density lacked strong non-linearities over the range of densities observed in the field.

AB 1. Hymenopterous parasitoids frequently exhibit (a) size-selective sex-allocation, laying predominantly male eggs in smaller host individuals and female eggs in larger hosts, and (b) size-selective host-feeding, i.e. feeding on and killing, but not parasitizing, smaller host individuals. We abbreviate size-selective sex-allocation and host-feeding by SSH. We analyse a parasitoid-host model incorporating SSH that recognizes the following: overlapping generations, an invulnerable adult host stage, a young immature stage, an old immature host stage, and only the female parasitoid. We assume that young immature hosts are attacked by the parasitoids, die as a consequence, but do not contribute to the juvenile female parasitoid population; each attack on an old immature host produces a juvenile female parasitoid.
   2. SSH leads to delayed pseudo-density-dependence in recruitment to the parasitoid population because the current attack rate on young immatures, which is a function of parasitoid density, influences the future number of old immatures and hence the future per head rate of recruitment of searching parasitoids. SSH has two effects on the model's stability properties. (a) It is potentially stabilizing because it tends to suppress the inherent long-period host-parasitoid cycles. This stabilizing propensity is enhanced when the adult host stage lasts about as long as or longer than the entire immature stage, the immature parasitoid stage is short-lived, and the young immature host stage is not too long-lived or the attack rate on it is not too high. (b) SSH can also destabilize the model by creating a region of instability in which cycles occur with a period related to the total length of the host immature stages. These shorter-period cycles are promoted by the same features that tend to suppress the underlying parasitoid-host cycles.
   3. Small perturbations from equilibrium in the locally stable region of parameter space are followed by damped oscillations. However, because of the presence of a multiple attractor, in much of the locally stable region large perturbations may be followed by limit cycles, commonly of the type seen in the new unstable region.

AB 1. The pattern of significant associations between plants was examined in ten old fields during 31 years of succession by calculating rank correlations for species pairs in each old field during each sample year. Three hypotheses were tested concerning the dynamics of species interactions through succession, and correspondence was explored between the pattern of association and published results from field and glasshouse experiments. 2. The proportion, number and level of significance of associations between plants all declined with time. Annuals and biennials had a higher portion of significant associations and more positive associations than perennial species. Plant species involved in many significant associations and implicated as actively interacting with other species were generally neither native nor the most abundant. 3. Seventy per cent of the species analysed in the present study that had also been used in field and glasshouse experiments demonstrating competition reported in the literature, were involved in significant and repeated negative pairwise associations. However, only 33% of species used in field and glasshouse experiments demonstrating allelopathy showed such correspondence. Grasses may be major inhibitory species because they were involved in many significant negative plant associations although they did not achieve high abundance in these old fields. 4. Lonicera japonica and Rosa multiflora were woody species involved in many negative associations and may play major roles by inhibiting later successional species. 5. Investigations into the role of species interactions during succession may focus productively on those relatively few species that are strongly associated. The timing and the consequences of these associations may illumunate how interaction mechanisms' such as competition and alleopathy structure successions.

   COEXISTENCE
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY

DE COMPETITION; CONSERVATION BIOLOGY; HABITAT LOSS; METAPOPULATIONS
ID PATCHY ENVIRONMENT; REGIONAL COEXISTENCE; MODELS
AB 1.  We take a previously studied model for two species - one of which is competitively inferior - coexisting in a patchy environment, and examine the effects of removing patches (that is, of decreasing the amount of available habitat).
   2.  Habitat destruction or patch removal reduces the number (and proportion) of patches occupied by the superior competitor, but can result in an increase in the total number of patches occupied by the inferior competitor (even though there are fewer patches in total).
   3.  It has long been appreciated that disturbance and destruction of habitat can create edge effects and other ecological changes favouring 'weedy' species.  The present study suggests that patch removal can by itself favour such species, even in the absence of other, concomitant changes.
   4.  An implication relevant to conservation biology is that habitat loss can bring about changes in community composition in remaining patches, even if such patches themselves undergo no intrinsic changes whatsoever.

TI EFFECTS OF SUPPLEMENTAL FOOD ON SNOWSHOE HARE REPRODUCTION AND JUVENILE
   GROWTH AT A CYCLIC POPULATION PEAK
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE SNOWSHOE HARE; FOOD ADDITION; REPRODUCTION; GROWTH AND POPULATION CYCLE
ID HABITAT SELECTION; LIMITATION; BIOLOGY; TOWNSENDII; VOLE
AB 1. Snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus (Erxleben)) populations were provided with supplemental food on two study grids in the south-west Yukon to examine the effects of food on reproduction and juvenile growth.
   2. Timing of parturition, pregnancy rates, litter sizes, male breeding condition, and juvenile growth rates were measured on two food grids and on two control grids during two summers at a cyclic peak in hare numbers.
   3. Most female hares gave birth to three litters per summer, and parturition was in approximate synchrony, such that there were three distinct litter groups per season. 4. The main effects of food addition were to increase hare densities 2.1- to 2.7-fold, advance the timing of breeding by about 1 week in 1 year, and increase pregnancy rates by 5% relative to the controls.
   5. There were no significant differences in litter sizes, lengths of male breeding seasons, juvenile growth rates, or total female reproductive output between hares on the food and control grids.
   6. Third litter stillborn rates were higher, and third litter juvenile growth rates slightly lower on food grids relative to those on controls, possibly reflecting an effect of higher densities.
   7. This study suggests that food is not a proximate factor limiting hare reproduction and early juvenile growth at the observed peak hare densities.

AB 1. The phytoplankton of the large shallow Lake Balaton was studied quantitatively on 211 consecutive days between April and November 1980. In total 417 taxa were found during the period of sampling. The number of planktonic species was c. 300. Compared with the few dominants, most of the species were extremely rare. 2. Relative frequencies (RF) within the total number of enumerated specimens (c. 100000) were used to analyse the quantities of both frequent and rare species on a common quantitative base. Approximately two-thirds of the 300 planktonic species were evenly distributed in time, the others exhibited temporal peaks. Based on population dynamics, 100 species (RF > 2000(-1), i.e. a relative frequency greater than 500 out of 100000 specimens) are considered to characterize the community responses to changes in both major and minor resources set by the given pattern of environmental background. Approximately 15 of these 100 species might have had an allochthonous origin. 3. Approximately half of the 200 rare species are velocity specialists, able to grow rapidly in spatially and temporally randomly distributed, nutrient-rich micro-environments; the other 100 are termed the 'ecological memory' of the phytoplankton community. Memory is considered here to be the capacity of past states or experiences to influence present or future responses of the community. 4. The memory of the community comprises all the potential recruit-species which are not completely excluded because of spatial and temporal disturbances (heterogeneity). These species may out-compete the regular dominants of the most probable seasonal successional pattern if the competitive arena changes. 5. Several cases (years with exceptional meteorological conditions, limnocorral experiments) in the history of planktonic events in Lake Balaton and in other lakes support the hypothesis.

AB 1.  Laying date in coots advanced with the age of both the male and the female.
   2.  Individual females had different but rather constant laying dates.  After controlling for these differences, the effect of female age on laying date remained, but that of male age disappeared.  This implies that both early and late females advanced their laying date when becoming older.  It also implies that male age has no direct effect on laying date, but that older males are better able to compete for early-laying females.
   3.  Selective loss of late-breeding females from a cohort is a potential additional cause for a correlation between age and laying date.  However, female survival rate was independent of laying date, thus refuting the selection hypothesis.
   4.  The data supported neither increased reproductive effort with age (residual reproductive value hypothesis), nor differential delay of reproduction between early and late females (delayed reproduction hypothesis) as additional explanations for the advancement of laying date with age.  This advancement in the individual female is therefore considered to be due to increasing quality (maturation hypothesis).
   5.  The repeatability of laying date in females was 0.32, but the heritability, estimated with daughter-mother regression, was only 0.02.  This indicates that the variation in laying date between individuals is predominantly environmental.

AB 1. The stoloniferous clonal herb Glechoma hederacea (Labiatae) has a decussate phyllotaxy. Each node bears two leaves which emerge from the opposite faces of a quadrangular stolon. Anatomical studies showed that the vascular tissue of the stolon is concentrated into four major bundles, and leaf traces connect each leaf of a ramet to the proximal pair of vascular bundles. These two vascular bundles also provide the vascularization for the secondary stolon developing from the axil of that leaf.
   2. Transport of resources in the vascular system was analysed using acid fuchsin dye and C-14-labelled photoassimilate. All transport of dye in the xylem was acropetal. Leaves and unrooted secondary stolons distal to, and in the same orthostichy as, a leaf injected with dye became fully infused with dye. They were thus entirely integrated for transport of xylem-based resources. Leaves and secondary stolons in the opposite orthostichy to the injected leaf did not receive dye, and were therefore entirely independent. Leaves and secondary stolons distal to, and in the adjacent orthostichies to, the injected leaf were half impregnated with dye, and were therefore partially integrated with the injected leaf.
   3. The patterns of movement of labelled photoassimilate in the phloem were qualitatively similar to the movement of acid fuchsin in the xylem, but less sectorially restricted. Although there was some basipetal movement, assimilate was predominantly translocated towards the apex. Newly developing ramets were supplied with assimilates by older ramets, but with time they became virtually independent of such support.
   4. Although there is widespread physiological integration between connected ramets of G. hederacea clones, distribution is influenced by vascular constraints, relative sink strength and proximity of different parts of the clone. In addition, however, the vascular anatomy and decussate phyllotaxy of the species has a very marked effect on the patterns of resource movement which occur within and between stolons. As clones grow and acquire greater structural complexity, they change from having complete integration, to become a number of semi-autonomous integrated physiological units (IPUs). Different stolon branches are in different IPUs. Such a structure may be superior to a system of integrated branches for exploring a heterogeneous habitat.
   5. Defoliation experiments showed that although vascular anatomy limits translocation from sources to sinks in different orthostichies, the balance of such translocation can probably be modified, and source-sink relationships changed, when severe conditions are imposed upon a part of a clone. Under such conditions there appears to be an increase in translocation between orthostichies.
   6. The information obtained in these investigations highlights the value of using complementary anatomical and physiological methods to analyse the relationships between form and function in plants. In clonal species such as Glechoma hederacea, the rate at which different branches grow, and therefore the rate of gain and loss of ramets, depends on source-sink relationships between ramets. Thus, unless the physiological relationships between ramets are understood, little progress can be made in understanding ramet population dynamics.

AB 1. Defoliation of ramets in a clonal species affects the subsequent growth of newly developing parts by preventing translocation of photoassimilates. In this paper, the hypothesis is tested that the structural level at which a clone responds to such interference, and the response it displays, will be determined by the ramets which are defoliated, and by the patterns of physiological integration between its connected ramets.
   2. An experiment was carried out in which clones of Glechoma hederacea were subjected to either 0% (control), 50% or 100% leaf removal. Fifty per cent defoliation was applied in three different patterns to determine if these had different effects upon subsequent growth.
   3. All defoliation treatments resulted in significantly lower total biomass production than in the control clones. Both the percentage of leaves removed and the pattern of leaf removal affected clone dry weight. In the three 50%-defoliation treatments, clones in which leaves from all orthostichies acted as sources of photoassimilates (treatment 5) achieved significantly higher weights than clones in which all of the leaves of some orthostichies were defoliated.
   4. There was no significant difference between the weights of primary structures in the control clones and clones in treatment 5. The biomass of primary structures of clones in treatment 5 was significantly greater than that of clones in other treatments imposing 50% defoliation. In contrast, control clones had greater secondary biomass than clones in any of the defoliation treatments. Results for ramet accumulation and stolon production closely resembled those for biomass.
   5. In a 50%-defoliation treatment involving complete defoliation of ramets on one primary stolon and no defoliation on the other, the stolon branch was shown to be an important structural level of response; the two primary stolons of clones in this treatment were significantly different in all measured characteristics, implying that their development is independent, The results from the 50%-defoliation treatment in which one of the two leaves of all ramets were removed, show that there is little integration between leaves across ramets. The results from treatment 5 (adjacent pairs of ramets either defoliated or left intact) provide evidence of extensive integration between ramets along stolons. These results are all in accordance with expectation from a knowledge of resource transport patterns, and of patterns of ramet integration and independence in G. hederacea.
   6. It appears that for the support of linear growth in G. hederacea about half of the primary ramets are supernumerary; the extra primary ramets enable the intact clone to expand in a second dimension.

AB 1. Chemical analyses are presented of major ions (H+, Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, Na+, Cl-, SO42-) in water samples from 39 ombrogenous bog sites and 10 basin and valley mires in Britain and Ireland.
   2. The first axis in principal component analyses of the data is most strongly correlated with Na+, Mg2+ and Cl-, reflecting total ionic concentration dominated by sea-spray components; subsequent axes correlate particularly with Ca2+, H+ and SO42- and largely reflect terrestrial and pollution inputs.
   3. The quotient of total to marine-derived Ca2+ shows a broad regional trend from values below 2 on the Atlantic coast of Ireland to 5 or more inland in Britain, with considerable local variation. Locally very high values may relate to, for example, nearby agriculture (liming) or quarrying.
   4. Measured concentrations of K+ in ombrogenous sites range from 0.25 to 4.04 times the expected value from marine input; they vary sporadically with little sign of regional trends. Some of the variation reflects uptake and release by vegetation, but some must be due to local inputs of terrestrial origin.
   5. The proportion of SO42- to Cl- on the Atlantic coasts of Ireland and Scotland is near that in seawater (0.103). Higher average SO42- concentrations farther east are broadly in line with expectation from published atmospheric SO42- deposition data. Concentrations of hydrogen ions and some heavy metals show comparable trends.
   6. The average proportions of most major ions in ombrogenous mire waters are similar to those in rainfall in the same areas. Ionic concentrations in ombrogenous bog waters are higher than the mean values in rainwater by a factor of 1.25-2.50 or more. There is evidence that some ombrogenous bog surfaces receive substantial dry deposition of Ca.
   7. Basin and valley mires are not sharply delimited from ombrogenous mires in their water chemistry, but they commonly show (i) rather higher concentration ratios of ions relative to rainwater, and (ii) proportions of ions differing markedly from those expected from precipitation inputs.
   8. The data show broad correlations between variation in ombrogenous bog vegetation, species limits, and the major-ion composition of the mire waters. These probably arise at least in part from parallel responses to topographical and climatic factors. Many ombrogenous bog species and vegetation types show wide amplitude in relation to major ions within the field of variation examined here: the factors limiting the more restricted species require more critical study.

AB 1. The monoculture self-thining concept was expanded to polycultures by describing a self-thinning surface in a mixed-species size-density space. The size-density relationships of pure and mixed populations of Alnus rubra and Pseudotsuga menziesii in the Pacific Northwest, USA were investigated.
   2. For polycultures of A. rubra and P. menziesii, the average size-density surface showed a near-planar region for stands consisting principally of A. rubra. Thus, A. rubra dominates stand dynamics in this region. At high proportions of P. menziesii, the surface showed a curvilinear increase towards the relative density level of pure P. menziesii stands. The curvilinear shape of the self-thinning surface cautions against using a single self-thinning line for mixed stands where the species proportion changes over time.
   3. The complexity of the size-density relationship indicates the need for a more thorough exploration of the underlying population dynamics. The growth model allowed investigation of mixed-stand development by identifying stand density, relative dominance of one species, and species proportions as important factors driving stand development along the self-thinning surface.
   4. Simulations of the growth model showed the need to investigate the development ot younger populations, the spatial pattern of mixtures, and the effects of dominance of one species on population development.

AB 1. The population dynamics of the gastrointestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus Dujardin were studied in a mixed-sex enclosed population of wood mice Apodemus sylvaticus L. Worm burdens were measured using anthelmintic expulsion 15 months after the start of the experiment (December 1988), and again after 6 months reinfection (June 1989). After the second treatment all mice were given a challenge infection and resistance to reinfection was assessed.
   2. The prevalence of infection was 100% in both December 1988 and June 1989, and the geometric mean worm burden was 40 and 74 worms per host respectively. The age-intensity profile of infection was monotonic at both times.
   3. Significant resistance to reinfection was found in adult mice, but not young mice, in June 1989. There was a significant negative correlation in adult mice between worm burden in June and resistance to reinfection.
   4. Per capita worm fecundity decreased sharply with host age and resistance to reinfection, but was positively correlated with worm density, especially in older mice. Worm sex ratio also varied with host age and resistance, becoming more male-biased in older, resistant hosts.
   5. The frequency distributions of worm burdens were overdispersed in December, in June and after challenge, and could be described by negative binomial distributions with aggregation parameters, k, of 2.11, 1.26 and 1.24 respectively. The degree of aggregation increased with host age. The relative contributions of variation in acquired resistance and exposure in generating overdispersion in this system are discussed.

AB 1. The proposition that strong functional predator-prey links are associated wit compartments in food webs (Paine 1980) is examined for a large, well-documented web, the Ythan estuary.
   2. A simple method for the detection and description of infrastructure within binary food webs is described and this is applied to 12 webs previously analysed by Pimm & Lawton (1980) and to the Ythan web.
   3. There was evidence for significant compartmentation in several real webs, all of which are reasonably well documented, aquatic and benthic. However, there was no evidence of compartments in the Ythan web.
   4. Manipulative field experiments on a range of avian, fish and invertebrate predators provided no evidence for strong functional interactions in the Ythan web.
   5. It is concluded that the lack of both compartments and strong linkage is consistent with Paine's hypothesis, but that the proposition needs further testing for other well-described systems.

AB 1. Climbing aroids grow through the forest, and demonstrate changes in their shoot developmental patterns associated with the changes in microhabitat resulting from displacement of the apex. Through allometric development or metamorphosis, shoots are able to shift growth forms: by altering their mobility, meristems of climbing species may disperse from their site of germination on the ground to their site of maturation on tree trunks, and then become sessile. Some species have the ability to become mobile again should environmental conditions change. 2. Shoot developmental patterns in Araceae lie along a continuum from sessile to mobile, within which four broad classes of growth form can be recognized, based on the shape of the internodes: acaulescent, in which internodes are ten or more times as wide as long; caulescent, in which internodes are about as wide as long; climbing or creeping, in which internodes are about ten times as long as wide, and flagellar, in which internodes are thirty or more times as long as wide. 3. The relationship between shoot development and foraging behaviour is two-fold. The set of shoot developmental pathways allowed by the genetic system of a species determines its overall foraging pattern. Environmentally mediated switching between pathways or alterations of rates or directions of progress within pathways allow adjustments to the foraging pattern. 4. Foraging behaviour is illustrated for five species of climbing Araceae: Anthurium subsignatum, Monstera skutchii, Philodendron fragrantissimum, Philodendron scandens and Syngonium triphyllum. For comparison, data are presented on one terrestrial species, Dieffenbachia seguine. Data are based on measures of lengths and diameters of successive internodes along shoots. Shoot development is represented graphically by plotting the trajectories traced by successive shoot segments through an internode size-shape space.

AB 1. The combined effects of different types of invertebrate herbivory and competition on plant performance were studied with a manipulative field experiment involving chemical exclusion and hand weeding, using four species of annual crucifer. Two of the species, Raphanus raphanistrum and Capsella bursa-pastoris, were locally abundant at the study site, whereas the other species, Sinapis arvensis and Sisymbrium officinalis, were uncommon. 2. Plant masses were log-normally distributed at harvest. There was a non-linear relationship between plant mass and siliqua production in all four species. 3. Weeding resulted in a threefold increase in plant size and a 2.6-fold increase in siliqua production. 4. Molluscicide application resulted in a 37% increase in plant size and siliqua production. 5. The effects of competition and mollusc herbivory on plant mass and siliqua production were independent of plant species (i.e. the species-competition and species-molluscicide interactions were not significant). 6. The effect of mollusc herbivory was independent of the weeding regime, indicating that there was no synergism between herbivory and competition. 7. The application of above-ground and below-ground insecticide resulted in a decrease in the proportion of leaves damaged, although neither affected plant size or siliqua production.

AB 1. I investigated the variation in lifetime reproductive success (LRS) between males and females in the monogamous rodent Peromyscus californicus at the Hastings Natural History Reservation in central coastal California. Genealogical relationships of newly emerged juveniles were determined using a combination of fluorescent pigment transfer and DNA fingerprinting for 123 juveniles from June 1987 to April 1990.
   2. Neither litter size nor interbirth interval changed in relation to parity (litter sequence), suggesting that reproductive success did not change with age. Interbirth intervals were significantly longer for individuals that re-mated compared to continuously mated individuals.
   3. Lifetime reproductive success data were collected for 16 females and 20 males. As expected for a monogamous species, the mean and variance in lifetime reproductive success were statistically similar between males and females.
   4. Maximum weight (g) and timing of first reproduction were significantly correlated with LRS in both males and females. None of the environmental features examined was significantly correlated with LRS in males or females.
   5. Across all individuals, significant selection gradients were observed on timing of first reproduction in males, and maximum weight in females. Males that began breeding early produced more offspring than those breeding later due to increases in both survival and the number of litters produced. Heavy females produced more offspring than light females primarily due to their greater longevity (survival).
   6. Across individuals with only one mate during their lifetime, significant phenotypic selection was observed only on timing of first reproduction in both males and females.
   7. The mating system (monogamy) and reproductive patterns of P. californicus are distinct from most temperate Peromyscus. Monogamy in P. californicus does not appear to be a facultative response to the dispersion of females, but is due to increased reproductive success in males and females that invest in their pair bond rather than securing additional matings.

TI SPRING BODY CONDITION, FECUNDITY AND SURVIVAL IN FEMALE WILLOW PTARMIGAN

AB 1. We examined variation in spring body mass (adjusted for structural size and number of days before clutch initiation) and its relationship with measures of fecundity and survival for populations of female willow ptarmigan at La Perouse Bay, Manitoba (Lagopus lagopus albus Gmelin) and Chilkat Pass, British Columbia (Lagopus lagopus alexandrae Grinnell) in northern Canada.
   2. Adult and yearling hen ptarmigan showed an increase in body mass during spring at both La Perouse Bay (LPB) and Chilkat Pass (CP). Although hens at LPB had greater body mass than hens at CP there were no differences in patterns of body mass gain attributable to either years, age-classes, or sites.
   3. No differences were found in measures of fecundity or survival between yearlings (1 year of age) in good and poor condition at both sites. At CP, adult (2+ years of age) hens in good condition produced heavy chicks, were more likely to be monogamous, and were more likely to return to the study area in subsequent years than hens in poor condition. Hens in good condition at LPB had higher return rates the following year than those in poor condition but showed no differences in fecundity.
   4. As measures of fecundity were not related to a hen's spring body condition, hens in poor condition probably invest relatively more in reproduction than those in good condition. Return of yearling hens was not related to their body condition in spring; however, we did observe low return rates of adult hens in poor condition. Thus, we suggest that the 'cost' of reproduction may be cumulative over years for female willow ptarmigan.

TI A GENETIC-POLYMORPHISM IN THE SWORDTAIL XIPHOPHORUS-NIGRENSIS - TESTING

AB When a genetically determined polymorphism is selectively maintained in a population, the different morphs should have equal fitnesses at equilibrium. We empirically examined this prediction for the size polymorphism of the swordtail Xiphophorus nigrensis, in which a single locus on the Y chromosome controls male size. Small males mature earlier and chase females, whereas large males mature later and court females. We analyze our data with a model that uses the differential mating success and the ages at sexual maturity of the two morphs to calculate the per capita death rate necessary for them to have equal fitness. We demonstrate how female fecundity data can be used to determine whether the estimated death rate is biologically realistic. Our data support the hypothesis that morph fitnesses are equal, and the model is fairly robust to changes in population growth rate and differential death rates of morphs. However, the confidence intervals for our estimates are large, which suggests that the null hypothesis only be accepted with caution. We show that in many circumstances very large sample sizes will be needed to distinguish between alternative hypotheses concerning the relative fitnesses of the two morphs. We emphasize that despite the popularity of alternative mating behaviors, specifically, and mixed evolutionarily stable strategies, in general, there is almost no empirical evidence that alternative behavioral morphs have equal fitnesses. Also, the conclusion that morph fitnesses are equal does not address the hypothesis that frequency-dependent mating success is the mechanism maintaining the equilibrium of fitnesses. This requires additional evidence directly demonstrating the fitness effect of changes in morph frequency.

AB We analyzed a system with solitary, stationary, and randomly distributed females, no paternal care, and no female choice. On the basis of the assumption of two male mating tactics, staying and roaming, we developed an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) model that gives quantitative predictions about mating systems. The variables included were male mate-searching efficiency (E), maximal number of females a stayer can include within his range (F(max)), length of mating season (D), length of the individual female's estrous period (O), population sex ratio (K), and the probability that a stayer defeats an intruder (V). The effects of these variables on the resulting mating system were analyzed. All variables except length of mating season influenced the system, where low E, high F(max), high K, short O, and high V promoted the staying tactic, thereby promoting either monogamy, female-defense polygyny, or resource-defense polygyny. By contrast, the opposite favored the roaming tactic, thereby promoting scramble-competition polygyny. The application of the model to two field studies showed that all variables can be measured in the field and that the quantitative predictions are thereby open to direct tests. The resulting mating system cannot be predicted from any single factor alone; the result of any one factor can be influenced by other factors. Thus, the explanatation and prediction of animal mating systems must rely on multifactorial models.

AB Field experiments have shown that predators can either increase or decrease the patchiness of prey populations inhabiting hard substrates.  In theory, removal that is correlated with initial density (thinning) reduces spatial variance; removal that is correlated with itself (clearing) increases spatial variance.  Simulations showed that the relative importance of thinning and clearing depends on the pattern of removal and on the number of unoccupied sites.  The observed change in spatial variance of the tubiculous polychaete (Clymenella torquata) matched the change calculated from the foraging dispersion of an avian predator, the short-billed dowitcher (Limnodromus griseus), at the spatial scale of 0.2-3 km2 flats but not at the scale of 1-ha plots within flats.

TI ECOLOGICAL-STUDIES ON A LOWLAND EVERGREEN RAIN-FOREST ON MARACA ISLAND,
   RORAIMA, BRAZIL .2. LITTER AND NUTRIENT CYCLING
SO JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID TERRA-FIRME FOREST; STANDING CROP; DECOMPOSITION; RAINFORESTS; AMAZONIA
AB 1. The Maraca rain forest occurs on sandy soils which have very low concentrations of nutrients, but it has none of the structural features which are often held to be associated with forests on nutrient-poor soils.
   2. The present paper reports tests of three hypotheses which were proposed to account for these unexpected features of the Maraca forest: (a) that the forest is unproductive and has a low nutrient demand; (b) that the trees are particularly efficient at withdrawing foliar nutrients before leaf abscission; and (c) that decomposition is rapid and the nutrients are quickly recycled.
   3. Small litterfall (leaves, wood less-than-or-equal-to 2 cm in diameter, reproductive parts, and trash) was measured for 12 months in three replicate 0.25-ha plots for quantity, seasonal distribution and concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium.
   4. The mean total small litterfall was relatively high with a mean value for the three plots of 9.28 t ha-1 year-1 (range 8.85-9.52).
   5. The nitrogen concentrations in the MaracA small litterfall were at the lower end of the range reported for other tropical forests whilst the concentrations of phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium were relatively high.
   6. Small-litter layer mass was measured in the plots on four occasions over a year. It showed changes with season and the mean values for total small-litter for the three plots were least (4.00 t ha-1) in the wet season and highest (5.14 t ha-1) in the dry season.
   7. The concentrations of nitrogen, magnesium and potassium were lower in the small-litter layer than those of the litterfall, whilst phosphorus and calcium concentrations were similar.
   8. Mean large-wood (greater-than-or-equal-to 2cm in diameter) litter (including standing dead trees) had a mean value of 5.80 t ha-1 (range 3.54-7.37) for the three plots.
   9. Decomposition quotient (k(L)) values were relatively high with mean value of 2.94 for the leaf fraction and 2.01 for total small litterfall.
   10. The quotients of litterfall content/litter layer content ranged from 1.99 for calcium to 5.91 for potassium and are indicative of the rapid cycling and an important source of nutrients to the trees.
   11. A comparison of nutrients in fresh leaves of six species with those in their litterfall showed retranslocations (on a unit-calcium basis) ranging from 17% to 73% for nitrogen and from 41% to 82% for phosphorus. This wide range of values, suggests no strong selection for nutrient retranslocation and that neither nitrogen nor phosphorus are limiting growth in this forest.
   12. It is concluded that the Maraca forest shows no indications of nutrient limitation in spite of its occurrence on sandy soils with low concentrations of nutrients and contradicts several generalizations about rain-forest nutrition.

AB 1. Reciprocal-removal experiments were conducted to test for the occurrence and consequences of interspecific competition between the rodents Mus musculus and Peromyscus leucopus on a large Virginia barrier island (USA). Habitat use and population density of each species were monitored during pre- and post-removal periods.
   2. The species exhibited conspicuous differences in pre-removal habitat use, with Mus occupying grassland and Peromyscus occupying adjacent shrub thickets.
   3. Neither species exhibited a significant habitat shift or numerical increase following the removal of its putative competitor. Several possible explanations for the apparent absence of competitive release are discussed.
   4. Either competition did not occur during the experimental period, or it occurred but not on a level detectable with our experimental design. The absence of habitat shifts, which should be detectable even on the level of the individual, argue for the former.
   5. The fact that Mus and Peromyscus could have coexisted at this location for only 300 years or so argues against the reduction of competition by 'competitive coevolution.' These results thus suggest that habitat selection and intraspecific interactions are much more important determinants of habitat use by these species than are interspecific interactions.

AB 1. We examined the anti-predator behaviour of two closely related species of tadpoles (Rana lessonae and Rana esculenta). Eggs were hatched in the laboratory and tadpoles were conditioned for 30 days to fish, newts, odonates and Bufo tadpoles before testing tadpole responses to predator and control stimuli.
   2. Rana esculenta tadpoles spent more time swimming than did R. lessonae tadpoles, but species did not differ in refuge use.
   3. Conditioning treatment affected both the percentage of time spent swimming and use of refuge. Time spent swimming was highest in tadpoles conditioned to Bufo tadpoles and lowest in those conditioned to the three predators. Time spent in the refuge was highest in tadpoles conditioned to fish, newts, and odonates and lowest in those conditioned to tadpoles. Species of tadpoles differed in their responses to conditioning, R. esculenta spent more time swimming when conditioned to tadpoles whereas R. lessonae spent less time swimming when conditioned to odonates than the other species.
   4. In predator treatments, tadpoles exposed to fish predators increased time spent in the refuge compared to odonates, newts, and the tadpole and water controls. Exposure to fish, newts, and odonates decreased the percentage of time spent swimming. In addition, there was a significant conditioning x predator interaction on swimming and open-water use.
   5. Our results show that R. lessonae and R. esculenta tadpoles possess inherited differences in anti-predator behaviour which may be interpreted as general adaptations to aquatic environments, but that conditioning to predators can modify or 'fine-tune' their response to specific environments.

AB 1. The wetlands of the Atchafalaya Delta, Louisiana are characterized by a warm climate, highly fertile sediments, and an absence of moisture limitations. Consequently, vegetation succession (on islands that emerged in 1973) was expected to occur relatively rapidly.
   2. From 1980 until 1986, annual surveys of vegetation cover and substrate elevation were conducted on 110 permanent plots along six transect lines crossing four islands. In addition, to evaluate the effect of herbivory (predominantly by Myocastor coypus, nutria or coypu), four 50-m x 40-m exclosures and four control plots were constructed on two of the islands.
   3. Community structure changed dramatically through time along the permanent transects. Because several species shifted in elevational range, ordination (using detrended correspondence analysis) only generally separated plant communities into different elevational zones.
   4. The 20 most dominant species, representing 95% of the total cover, were classified into three distinct groups according to cover pattern: (i) species that increased in abundance through time and stabilized within particular elevational zones (e.g. Colocasia esculenta, Justicia ovata, Leersia oryzoides, Polygonum punctatum, Scirpus americanus, Vigna luteola), (ii) species with relatively stable cover over time (e.g. Aeschynomene indica, Eleocharis spp., Panicum sp., Sagittaria lancifolia, Salix nigra, Scirpus validus, Typha domingensis), and (iii) species that occurred over a wide range initially, but eventually disappeared at low elevations (e.g. Ammannia coccinea, Cyperus difformis, Hydrocotyle sp., Mikania scandens, Sagittaria latifolia, Sagittaria platyphylla, Sphenoclea zeylandica).
   5. Two general trends across all islands through time involved a decrease in vegetated area and a marked increase in species diversity. The decrease in vegetated area is attributable to increased grazing damage by nutria combined with the negative effect of prolonged flooding. These two factors at least partially counterbalanced the forces that were expected to promote rapid succession.
   6. Because of the strong abiotic (fluvial and marine) forces and because the most influential herbivore is an exotic species, the Atchafalaya Delta appears to lie at the allogenic extreme of the autogenic-allogenic continuum of successional types.

AB 1. Species in plant communities generally shown an aggregated distribution at one of more spatial scales. This, and the fact that competition between sessile organisms occurs chiefly between neighbours, suggests that the spatial configuration of plants should affect the process and outcome of interspecific competition.
   2. Cellular automaton models were constructed to simulate the competitive interaction of five grass species, Agrostis stolonifera, Holcus lanatus, Cynosurus cristatus, Poa trivialis and Lolium perenne, based on experimentally determined rates of invasion.
   3. A model with a random initial starting arrangement showed a very rapid loss of species compared to initial arrangements in which species occurred in monospecific bands.
   4. Different arrangements of monospecific bands produced quite different results from each other, depending only upon the initial juxtaposition of species in the model community. Non-linear dynamics, with transitory increases followed by decreases in species' abundance, were observed with some starting arrangements. Community change followed trajectories that could not be deduced in any simple manner from a knowledge of pairwise interactions alone. These results suggest that the spatial pattern and configuration of competing species may be just as important as the density and frequency of competitors in determining the outcome.

AB We estimated associations among host preferences in a set of four butterfly populations, two of which had switched to a novel host species within the past 20 generations and one of which represented the putative ancestral condition of the changed populations.  Preference trials were performed on insects taken from one of the populations feeding on the novel host.  In replicated samples from this site, insects that discriminated among individuals of their ancestral host species tended to reject the novel host.  This association among preferences was not found in replicated samples from the ancestral condition.  We conclude that the association itself had evolved recently at the site where we found it.  We tested the hypothesis that an evolutionary trade-off existed between two traits:  (1) diet breadth in terms of number of species used and (2) the ability to discriminate within each species.  The hypothesis was rejected.  In populations that had switched to the novel host, acceptance of this host had increased substantially, but no change had occurred in discrimination within the ancestral host.  Thus, associations among preferences within and among host species were evolutionarily labile and had failed to act as constraints on diet evolution in the populations we studied.

AB 1. Many hole-nesting birds lay smaller clutches in small than in large nestboxes. Breeding success may be limited by cavity space in small boxes, but by food availability in large boxes. If so, birds nesting in small boxes may adopt a 'brood survival strategy' (synchronous hatching and large final eggs), whereas those nesting in large boxes may adopt a 'brood reduction strategy' (asynchronous hatching and small final eggs).
   2. We studied initial (n = 203) and repeat nestings (n = 91) of great tits (Parus major L.) in nestboxes with small (70 cm2) and large (180 cm2) basal areas, in two study plots in Norway during 1984-89. Renesting was induced by clutch removal. In 1986, birds laying their first clutches in small boxes were experimentally made to renest in large boxes, and vice versa.
   3. A clutch size adjustment to nestbox size was verified, with a difference between small and large boxes of one to two eggs. However, contrary to expectation, no significant differences were found in either hatching spread, or in the relative size of the final egg laid.
   4. Alternative explanations for variation in hatching spread and egg size are discussed. Limitation, by energetic constraints, on the start of incubation and on egg formation may be of great importance.
   5. From assumptions made about the costs of rearing male and female offspring, and about the fitness distribution of the young in relation to their body weight, we expected that the sex ratio found for hatchlings would be higher in favour of males in small than in large nestboxes. An insignificant tendency in this direction was found.

AB 1. The impact of waders Charadrii on mud-dwelling invertebrates in central Europe was studied by comparing the rates of prey change over 13 days in 10 exclosures and control sites.
   2. The most common invertebrates in the mud were chironomid larvae, which accounted for 90.5% of all invertebrates. Chironomid larval density in the exclosures averaging 11075 individuals m-2, which is comparable to the high densities of Corophium volutator Pallas (9687 ind. m-2) found in a British estuary (Goss-Custard 1977a).
   3.  Ten species of waders, black-headed gulls Larus ridibundus L. and mallards Anas platyrhynchos L. either fed or roosted in the study sites during the experiment. However, the most numerous birds were black-tailed godwits Limosa limosa L. spotted redshanks Tringa erythropus Pallas and ruffs Philomachus pugnax L., which comprised 39.5%, 33.6%, 25.1% of the total counted, respectively.
   4. At the end of the experiment, the invertebrate density was significantly lower in the control sites (1594 ind. m-2) compared with exclosures (11938 ind. m-2) . Thus birds, particularly black-tailed godwits, spotted redshanks and ruffs, removed 86.6% of the prey stock. Prey biomass was also significantly lower in the control (1.3 g m-2) than in the exclosures (9.5 g m-2). However, the mean length of the chironomid larvae was not significantly different between the control (7.87 mm) and exclosures (9.95 mm).
   5. The impact of waders on the density of prey was also estimated from observations of the birds' feeding rates. The number of prey estimated to be taken daily by black-tailed godwit was 5765 prey m-2 for 13 days of the experiment while the estimates for spotted redshank and ruff were 1258 and 575 prey m-2 respectively. The total removed by black-tailed godwits, spotted redshanks and ruffs was therefore 7598 prey m-2. This compares with the 10344 ind. m-2 estimated to be removed by birds in the exclosure sites. The difference between the two methods is probably due to predation by other birds, such as other waders or ducks, and to the high variances of both estimates.
   6. More small snails - Gyraulus sp. - were found in the control sites than in the exclosures, possibly because they were avoided by waders.
   7. The total numbers of feeding birds, and the number of feeding black-tailed godwits, spotted redshanks and of ruffs declined during the experiment. The rate of food intake of black-tailed godwits, spotted redshanks and of ruffs also declined as the food stock was depleted. However, the number of roosting birds increased, although non-significantly, during the experiment.

AB 1. Some workers (e.g. Morrison & Barbosa 1987) have suggested that the conclusions from standard deterministic population dynamics models do not hold for stochastic versions of the same models.
   2. Stochastic versions of two standard models - Hassell's (1975) single-species model and May's (1978) host-parasitoid model - were simulated, for a range of parameter values giving different deterministic dynamics.
   3. In several cases there was a qualitative difference in stochastic dynamics between systems which were deterministically stable and unstable: for the host-parasitoid model and the single-species model with weak regulation, the variability in densities was much greater for unstable systems than stable ones 4. In all cases the stability eigenvalue-lambda obtained from deterministic analysis was clearly related to the variability of the stochastic simulations: populations varied less when \lambda\ was small.
   5. Increasing the magnitude of the external stochastic variability produced greater variability in densities.

AB 1. Nine metapopulations of the butterfly Plebejus argus were mapped in North Wales in 1983 and 1990. The metapopulations occurred in three biotopes; five were in heathland, one in mossland and three in limestone grassland.
   2. Within metapopulations, local distributions of the butterfly corresponded to the spatial distributions of suitable habitat: P. argus was able to colonize virtually all suitable habitat patches that were less than 1 km from existing, populated patches.
   3. In contrast, the regional distribution was constrained by the inability of the butterfly to colonize suitable habitat that was further than a few kilometres from existing metapopulations; some of these sites are now populated by P. argus following successful introductions.
   4. Turnover (extinctions and colonizations) of patches within metapopulations was relatively high in small patches. Turnover was also greater in heathland than in limestone: the principal reason for this was that patches of habitat were usually smaller in heathland, and small patches had high turnover in both biotopes.
   5. Some patches changed in shape and size. Turnover of area was greater in heathland, where the butterfly occupies relatively transient successional habitats, than in limestone grassland where the habitat can be maintained in a suitable condition for longer periods.
   6. The persistence of this spatially dynamic species depends on some suitable habitat being continuously available within relatively large areas of biotope. If the continuity is broken and a whole metapopulation becomes extinct, natural recolonization is unlikely to occur if the nearest P. argus source is more than a few kilometres away.

AB 1. Maraca, Brazil, is a large riverine island which is at the boundary between lowland evergreen rain forest and savanna. The island is now uninhabited but there is evidence that much of its forest (including the plots described in this paper) is secondary, dating from before 1880.
   2. The mean annual rainfall is about 2300mm and there is a dry season from October to March.
   3. Six replicate plots of 0.25 ha each were set up in the rain forest. Three of these were later felled, as part of a long-term study on forest regeneration, and three left undisturbed.
   4. Soils were described from a profile pit and for surface samples (0-10 cm) in the three undisturbed plots. The soils were a Grossarenic Plinthic Paleudult (USDA). They were acid, had exceptionally low concentrations of total phosphorus, low concentrations of exchangeable cations but a fairly high base saturation, and a sandy texture. There was no surface root mat, no surface accumulation of organic matter, and no sign of podzolization.
   5. All trees and lianas greater-than-or-equal-to 10 cm d.b.h. in the forest plots were enumerated, and structural features of the trees (including fine-root biomass) and smaller plants were quantified. The plots had a mean tree basal area of 23.8 m2 and the emergents were up to 40 m tall.
   6. The mean tree species richness for the plots was forty per 0.25 ha and overall the Moraceae were the most important family in terms of basal area.
   7. Analyses of leaves of 38 tree species showed wide interspecific variations but, in general, leaf nutrient concentrations were moderate or high.
   8. It is concluded that although the Maraca forest occurs on very nutrient-poor soils it shows neither physiognomic nor foliar chemical features which are held to be characteristic of rain forests on such soils. Moreover, even though the soils are dry and sandy, the Maraca forest shows no features of heath forests.

AB We have extended the analyses of Pimm et al, on the risks of extinction to include attributes of the environment, as well as species characteristics, as potential determinants of the risk of extinction. We find their earlier conclusion that large-bodied species are at greater risk of extinction at high population sizes is not supported by the data, nor is the contention that more variable populations are at greater risk of extinction. Our analyses suggest that small populations of small-bodied birds on oceanic islands are more vulnerable to extinction than are large populations of large-bodied birds on more protected islands. Moreover, a significant interaction of body size with type of island (channel vs. oceanic island) indicates that body size influences time to extinction differently depending on the type of island. The potentially complex interactions among determinants of extinction suggested by these data and analyses indicate that conservation policies will need to consider the intricate interactions among characteristics of both the species and the environment. Furthermore, our analysis illustrates the inability of current models to account for any more than about 45% of the variance in extinctions of populations from an extensive data set on bird populations from small islands surrounding Britain. Thus, the ability of models to predict the risk of extinction of particular species on particular islands is still very limited. Policy concerning the management of reintroduced species, therefore, should include data from the species and environments in question as well as model predictions of the risk of extinction.

AB 1.  Data from parasitoids attacking galls of Giraudiella inclusa Fr. (Diptera:  Cecidomyiidae) from Phragmites australis Trin. were used to assess the factors dictating species richness and coexistence in a community.
   2.  Species richness of the 14 parasitoids could be related to the high frequency and apparency of both the galls and the Phragmites monocultures.  Four non-galling species of Cecidomyiidae attacking P. australis had only 2-3 parasitoid species, presumably due to the less visible and less heterogeneous microhabitat offered to the parasitoids.
   3.  Distribution of midge galls was due to several plant characteristics with percentage parasitism and parasitoid coexistence determined by the site of gall induction.  The stem-boring moth Archanara geminipuncta Haw.  (Lepidoptera:  Noctuidae) was a key factor for the heterogeneous gall distribution and thereby favoured coexistence of the galls' parasitoid species:  Giraudiella-galls induced on side shoots, grown from Archanara-damaged shoots, increased percentage parasitism of two parasitoid species and reduced parasitism of one species.
   4.  Parasitoid foraging was concentrated on temporally and spatially separated subpopulations with the microscale of host density (gall cluster size per reed internode) influencing percentage parasitism only in two out of eight species, and with the macroscale (gall abundance per habitat) having no effect at all.  These findings do not meet expectations for density-dependent host regulation, but support a resource heterogeneity hypothesis.  Both midge and parasitoid populations appeared to be 'limited from below' rather than 'controlled from above'.
   5.  The prediction that host density is negatively correlated with parasitoid diversity was not supported.

AB 1. Foraging data for great crested grebes (Podiceps cristatus L.) feeding in shallow fish-ponds (0.8-1 m deep) were used to test whether pond characteristics, fish density, mean wet weight of the fish or fish species influenced foraging behaviour and success in this fish-eating grebe.
   2. When fishing for roach/rudd (Rutilus rutilus L./Scardinius erythropthalmus L.), the number of prey eaten per unit time foraging was positively influenced by the proportion of successful dives, and negatively by the mean diving time. The proportion of successful dives increased as fish weight decreased. Mean diving time, however, was not related to any component of the food supply, nor to pond characteristics.
   3. The overall mean diving time was low in comparison with other studies, probably because the study ponds were so shallow. Since the water depth was equal in each pond, mean diving time is not an accurate measure of fish densities in shallow waters.
   4. When roach/rudd were the prey, handling time above the water did not constrain the number of prey eaten per unit time foraging at any fish density. With roach/rudd and carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) as prey, the above-water handling time increased with the size of the fish consumed. The total handling time under and above the water surface together constituted on average 4.7% of the time required to consume one fish.
   5. When fishing for roach/rudd, successful dives lasted significantly longer than unsuccessful ones. As the mean duration of successful dives increased with fish weight, we suggest that this can be explained by handling prey under water. For carp, however, this could not be shown. Furthermore, unsuccessful dives lasted significantly longer when fishing for carp than for roach/rudd. This is probably related to behavioural differences between the fish species. In roach/rudd ponds, it seemed that grebes took on average the smaller fish.

TI SELECTION FOR OVERCOMPENSATORY PLANT-RESPONSES TO HERBIVORY - A
   MECHANISM FOR THE EVOLUTION OF PLANT-HERBIVORE MUTUALISM
SO AMERICAN NATURALIST
LA English
DT Article
ID BENEFIT
AB A mathematical model demonstrates that size-selective herbivory can drive the evolution of a mutualistic relationship between plants and herbivores.  The fact that some monocarpic plants (e.g., Ipomopsis aggregata) can replace inflorescences lost to herbivory presents the opportunity for "bet hedging" within a single flowering season.  When herbivory is sufficiently strong and size selective, the optimal plant strategy is to withhold a large proportion of its reproductive resources against the possibility that an initial investment will be consumed.  Under these conditions, plant fitness is enhanced by herbivory, and selection should favor plant traits that increase the probability of being eaten.

AB 1. The adaptive value of superparasitism (oviposition in a previously parasitized host) when solitary parasitoids deplete a patch simultaneously is investigated, using a deterministic game theoretical model in which encounter rates with host types, which differ in the number of parasitoid eggs they contain, change over time due to depletion.
   2. Parasitoids should never superparasitize when they search a patch alone.
   3. When parasitoids search in the presence of conspecifics, the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is to reject parasitized hosts at first but later, after a threshold has been reached, to accept them. Different thresholds exist for hosts containing different numbers of eggs.
   4. The thresholds are expressed in gross rate of offspring gain.
   5. With an increasing number of parasitoids per patch, females should begin to superparasitize at higher rates of gain.
   6. The gross rate of gain at which a parasitoid leaves the patch (the leaving threshold) influences the threshold rate at which they should begin to superparasitize. Patch time allocation and host acceptance decisions are interdependent.
   7. Both the handling time and the pay-off from an egg laid in a parasitized host strongly influence the threshold rate at which parasitoids should begin to superparasitize. This threshold is only weakly influenced by the number of hosts in the patch.
   8. The model predicts that patch time per female and degree of superparasitism are influenced by the number of females in a patch.
   9. The total number of offspring gained per unit time in the patch decreases with the number of females, even when the patch area per female and the number of hosts per female are kept constant; thus, superparasitism leads to interference.
   10. Experimental evidence is in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the model.

AB 1. The influence of ant-attendance on patterns of parasitism was studied for two parasitoid species attacking the black bean aphid Aphis fabae (Scop.), Trioxys angelicae (Haliday) and Lysiphlebus cardui (Marshall) on the host-plants Evonymus europaeus (L.) and Cirsium arvense (L.).
   2. Foraging Trioxys angelicae females were heavily attacked by honeydew-collecting ants. However, ants did not treat Lysiphlebus cardui females in an aggressive way.
   3. Ant-attendance provided a considerable protection for Aphis fabae against Trioxys angelicae, but did not prevent a high parasitization success of Lysiphlebus cardui.
   4. Trioxys angelicae, which was restricted to unattended aphids, suffered from a high rate of hyperparasitization. In contrast, ant-attendance of parasitized aphids reduced the hyperparasitization of Lysiphlebus cardui significantly.
   5. The increased honeydew-production of parasitized Aphis fabae led to an increase in the number of honeydew-collecting ants and additionally intensified the protection of the preimaginal stages of Lysiphlebus cardui.
   6. Ant-attendance provided an 'enemy-free space' for the primary parasitoid Lysiphlebus cardui against its hyperparasitoids, which is a new aspect in parasitoid reproductive strategies.

AB 1.  The objectives were to compare age and length at metamorphosis of maturing European eel, Anguilla anguilla (L.), from a number of geographic locations in Europe and North Africa, and to test whether the geographic variation in life-history was due to developmental plasticity or to the expression of fixed developmental patterns under various environmental conditions.
   2.  Both mean age and mean length at metamorphosis were significantly different (P < 0.001) between sexes:  5.99 years for males and 8.73 years for females; 405.6 mm for males and 623.2 mm for females.  The variation in mean age at metamorphosis was much larger than the variation in mean length at metamorphosis (both sexes).
   3.  There was a close correlation between male and female age at metamorphosis (r = 0.57), and male and female length at metamorphosis (r = 0.98).  As there was no correlation between mean length and mean age at metamorphosis for either sex, the phenotypic variability in eel age and length at metamorphosis is probably due to the expression of a fixed set of developmental pathways under different environmental conditions.  This variation is not necessarily adaptive.
   4.  Mean age at metamorphosis was strongly affected by variation in growth rate (r2 = 0.943 and 0.963 for females and males, respectively) and, chiefly for this reason, was also correlated with latitude and longitude.  Mean length at metamorphosis was not affected by variation in growth rate (r2 from 0.003 to 0.0315), but was correlated with both longitude and distance to the spawning area, but not with latitude.
   5.  The present study shows that there is a large geographic variation in mean age and length at metamorphosis of both male and female European eels, but rejects the hypothesis that the development rate is flexible and therefore cannot demonstrate if the phenotypic plasticity is adaptive or not.

AB 1. Sites on 12 lawns were sampled by a grid of contiguous quadrats, each 160 mm2 or 360 mm2. Six lawns were examined in Fiji and six in New Zealand, the latter including one natural 'lawn'. The results were examined for indication of niche limitation, i.e. a lower variance in the number of species per quadrat than that expected from the assumption of random species distribution.
   2. A previous method, based on species frequencies over the whole site (designated 'site model'), indicated significant niche limitation at the smallest block size in all sites. It is suggested that this result could arise from micro-habitat differentiation if the pools of species occurring in different micro-habitats were similar in size - these can be termed 'limited species pools'.
   3. A new method of testing for niche limitation is described - the 'patch model' - which overcomes the problem of limited species pools by using a null model that predicts the species richness of each quadrat from the local frequency of each species in a three-by-three cluster of quadrats centred on that quadrat. Using this method, some sites, but not all, no longer exhibited significant niche limitation.
   4. Examination of the frequency distribution of quadrat richnesses reveals that the departure from the null model comprises a greater-than-expected frequency at or near the mode, with a deficit of both species-poor and species-rich quadrats, all features being significant for most sites examined, with no indication of skewing.
   5. Species richness was significantly greater in New Zealand than in Fiji, both at the whole-site and at the individual-quadrat level. There was no indication of a difference in the degree of niche limitation between the countries.

ID AQUILA-CHRYSAETOS
AB 1. Nesting density and breeding success of golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos were measured in six areas across Scotland in 1982-85 and in three additional test areas in 1985.
   2. An index of food abundance was obtained from prey recorded on line transects in all study areas in most years.
   3. In the original six areas, nesting density ranged from 14.7 to 26.1 pairs per 1000 km2 and breeding success from 0.19 to 1.00 chicks fledged per pair per year.
   4. Nesting density was positively correlated with the amount of carrion (dead sheep and deer) detected on line transects, and breeding success was positively correlated with the amount of live prey (grouse, hares and rabbits).
   5. Three test areas examined in 1985 conformed to these patterns.
   6. In the light of these relationships, the implications of land-use changes for golden eagle nesting ecology are discussed.

AB 1. Growth pattern, disease incidence and disease spread were studied for the interaction between the clonal host plant Lactuca sibirica, which produces long slender rhizomes, and the perennial systemic rust fungus Puccinia minussensis under different nutrient levels in a glasshouse experiment.
   2. L. sibirica produced significantly more shoots under uniformly high vs. uniformly low nutrient conditions. In treatments where high- and low-nutrient patches were alternated, L. sibirica showed a marked plasticity in growth, and produced significantly more shoots in the high-nutrient patches. Compared to plants experiencing uniformly high or low-nutrient conditions, the number of shoots decreased in high- and increased in low-nutrient patches, respectively.
   3. L. sibirica shoots producing aecidiospores did not flower, while the presence of uredo- and teleutospores only did not affect flowering.
   4. There was a significantly higher probability of disease for ramets in high-nutrient patches compared to those in low-nutrient patches. However, plant growth in high-nutrient patches was so enhanced that the absolute number of healthy shoots was also greater in these patches.
   5. Disease spread in the rhizome was incomplete, and the risk of aecidial-stage infection decreased with increasing distance from the parent. Disease escape was complete for ramets (still connected to the parent) further than 45 cm from the parent.
   6. It is suggested that in clonal plants having ramets physiologically integrated for a long time, selection will favour rapid growth to enable the host to keep ramets ahead of perennial systemic pathogens.

DE COSTA-RICA; DIOECY; SEX EXPRESSION; SEX CHANGE
ID PLANTS; SEGREGATION
AB 1. Ocotea tenera (Lauraceae) is a dioecious understorey tree which occurs in the lower montane forests of Monteverde, Costa Rica. In a natural population of O. tenera trees whose ages were estimated to range from 14 to 30 years old, staminate trees slightly outnumbered pistillate trees but the sex ratio was not significantly different from 1:1. Staminate and pistillate trees were non-randomly distributed with respect to each other. The probability that a tree's nearest neighbour was of the opposite sex was much higher than expected by chance.
   2. Males were also more common in two experimental plots, one established in 1981 and the other in 1984, although only one of the plots showed a significantly male-biased sex ratio. Spatial distributions of staminate and pistillate trees in both experimental plots were indistinguishable from random.
   3. Individual trees in both the natural population and experimental plots monitored over a 10-year period occasionally switched in different years from producing almost exclusively staminate to almost exclusively pistillate flowers, and vice versa. Sex ratios within plots changed over time because of variable sexual expression between years rather than differential mortality. Once trees were established, mortality was low.
   4. It is suggested that non-random spatial distributions in older 0. tenera trees in the natural population may be caused by labile sexual expression modified by the presence of neighbouring trees.

AB 1. The patterns of recolonization   of bare-ground gaps within subalpine grassland, open grassy heath and closed heath are described for the Bogong High Plains in south-eastern Australia. 2. Bare-ground gaps within grassland and open grassy heath ranged from 5 to 40 cm in diameter, and occurred between tussocks of the dominant Poa hiemata. In comparison, bare-ground gaps within closed heath ranged from 0-5 to 2cm in diameter. 3. Colonists of gaps included shrubs, forbs and graminoids. Establishment was by both vegetative means and seedlings, with the latter most common in shrubs. The diversity of forbs was greatest in gaps within grassland and open heath. Seedling shrubs were the predominant colonists of gaps in closed heath. 4. Gap size affected both species richness and the nature of the seedling populations within both grassland and open heath. Species richness increased with increasing gap area. Shrub seedlings were more common in gaps > 30 cm in diameter, whereas Poa hiemata seedlings were more common in gaps < 15 cm in diameter. In closed heath there was no clear relationship between gap area, species richness or seedling composition. 5. The density of shrub seedlings in gaps within grassland varied considerably from site to site, and may have been related to dispersal of seeds and the trampling and browsing effects of domestic cattle.

AB 1. The incidence of density dependence was examined in 5715 time-series of annual abundances of 447 species of moths and aphids in the UK using three techniques (Ricker equation, Bulmer's test and Pollard et al.'s test).
   2. Delayed density dependence (lag 2 years) was not found more frequently than expected by chance. In the moth family Noctuidae, delayed density dependence was slightly but significantly more frequent in woodland populations than in non-woodland populations, consistent with a higher frequency of outbreak species among forest Lepidoptera.
   3. The incidence of significant density dependence increased with the length of the time-series (from 10 to 24 years), and density dependence was detected more frequently in species which did not show a significant trend in abundance over time.
   4. The incidence of density dependence was 79% and 88% in moth and aphid time-series which were longer than 20 years (Bulmer's test).
   5. There were only slight differences between localities in the average degree of density dependence when the effects of time-series length and trend were removed.
   6. Significant differences were found between species in the average degree of density dependence, especially in noctuid moths and aphids. In noctuids, the average degree of density dependence increased with body size.

SO JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY

DT Article
DE COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; STAND DYNAMICS; TROPICAL VEGETATION
ID LOBELIA-KENIENSIS; DIEBACK
AB 1. Quantitative patterns of alpine plant community structure throughout the upper Teleki Valley on Mount Kenya are described. Data on the frequency of all (61) vascular plant species found in 45 transects were analysed using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and an agglomerative cluster analysis. Data on the density and size of giant senecios at these transects were also analysed.
   2. Senecio keniodendron (high) and S. keniensis (low) separate along an altitudinal gradient, with a distinct hybrid zone in areas of sympatry. Senecio keniodendron occurs in stands of even-sized trees, which may be even-aged.
   3. Vegetation analyses revealed a continuum of plant community composition. Mid- and lower-altitude ridges were floristically more similar to wet valley bottoms than to dry slopes, a finding with conservation and management implications.
   4. Eleven environmental factors were measured at each transect and included in the canonical correspondence analysis. Included among these measurements was the average tree height of even-sized stands of Senecio keniodendron. The first three axes identified by CCA were associated with percentage vegetation cover (soil moisture), altitude, and mean S. keniodendron stand height, respectively.
   5. An analysis of mid-altitude slope transects revealed that the mean height of S. keniodendron trees was the dominant environmental determinant of community composition in these sites. There appears to be considerable variation in plant community composition associated with a natural cycle of establishment, growth and senescence of even-sized S. keniodendron stands.

TI A DIFFUSION-MODEL FOR DISPERSAL OF OPUNTIA-IMBRICATA (CHOLLA) ON
   RANGELAND
SO JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID FOCUS EXPANSION; PLANT-DISEASE; BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
AB (1) The dispersal of Opuntia imbricata (cholla) on rangeland may be directly or indirectly affected by the presence of livestock and wildlife. Overgrazing creates gaps or open spaces for seeds or stems that fall to the ground to become established (passive dispersal). In addition., livestock or wildlife may cause stems and fruits to fall to the ground (active dispersal). (2) A theoretical model is formulated for the dispersal of plants based on the diffusion equation which assumes one or more mechanisms of dispersal (e.g. passive and active dispersal). The CHI-2 goodness-of-fit test is used to determine whether the data may be explained by one or by two mechanisms of dispersal. Methods for estimating the model parameters are presented based on the CHI-2 method and the method of moments. (3) The model and analytical techniques are applied to field data on the spatial distribution of Opuntia imbricata in four different pastures. (4) The results indicate that dispersal of cholla can be attributed to two dispersal mechanisms. Passive dispersal alone cannot account for the current spread of cholla on some of the pastures.

AB (1) A procedure and experimental apparatus are described that permit determination of oxygen and carbon-dioxide generation in nutrient cultures bathing roots of mature wetland plants. Roots ot five different species were isolated from the atmosphere so that the only significant route of gaseous transfer was through the plant itself. (2) At the level of the whole plant, and on a time scale of weeks, the net effect of wetland plants on the root environment was generally not to oxygenate it. Although plants transported large amounts of oxygen between shoots and roots, most of that oxygen was consumed before it reached the bulk solution. Oxygen content of solutions bathing the root systems typically remained at or below 31-mu-mol l-1. However. solutions were greatly enriched in carbon dioxide, containing c. 1-5 mmol l-1. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the plants transported large amounts of O2 to the roots but that most of the O2 was consumed by respiration within the plant or by microbes supported by carbon compounds derived from the plant. (3) Rates of oxygen generation within root zone solutions generally were well below 35-mu-mol O2 plant-1 day-1 for most experimental plants. Only Scirpus acutus generated oxygen in solution at rates as high as 58-mu-mol O2 plant-1 day-1 (4) Microscopic analysis of roots revealed a high proportion of cortical aerenchyma (40-48%) in 86-99% of the sampled lengths of primary roots.

AB The ground crickets Allonemobius fasciatus and A. socius meet in a mosaic zone of overlap and hybridization stretching from the East Coast to at least Illinois. To test whether male calling song differences were enhanced in sympatry, we analyzed the songs of crickets from inside and outside the zone of overlap along two transects. No evidence of calling song displacement was found in A. socius males from populations within the zone of overlap. On the other hand, A. fasciatus displayed calling song displacement in three populations. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the selective pressure exerted by the challenge from a related species is frequency dependent. While not a conclusive demonstration, the observed shifts in calling song are strongly suggestive of reproductive character displacement.

AB In order to characterize the fire regime of the southern boreal forest and to understand the way in which landscape and fire regime interact, a detailed study of fire history was undertaken in two adjacent contrasting landscapes in northwestern Quebec. The fire history for the islands of Lake Duparquet was reconstructed and compared to that of the surrounding lakeshore. Fire occurrence was determined by archival search and by collection of information from fire scars. Dendroecological techniques were used to determine years of stand initiation on the lakeshore and for a subsample of the islands. Stand initiation data were used to estimate fire frequency, fire cycle, and fire intensity (lethal and non-lethal fires). Tree composition and surficial deposits were sampled in order to assess the possible effect of topography and forest cover on fire frequency.
   Dated fire scars (n = 273) revealed 82 fire years, with the earliest dated to 1593. Islands experienced more fire years (56) than the lakeshore (37), and fire years were uncorrelated. Most (72%) of the lakeshore stands were initiated by a few large fires (eight), whereas the fire size on islands was variable, ranging from < 10% to 100% of the total surface of the island. Despite these differences in fire regime, fire occurrence and fire frequency decreased concurrently on the islands and the lakeshore starting almost-equal-to 120 yr ago. The lakeshore fire cycle was 63 yr before 1870 and 99 yr since 1870, whereas the fire cycle on the islands was slightly longer (74 yr and 112 yr) during the same intervals. The long-term decrease in fire frequency of both the lakeshore and the islands was possibly driven by climatic change.
   Fire frequency was generally similar for all surficial deposits and fuel types on the lakeshore, whereas fires were more abundant in pine woodland growing on bedrock on the islands. Lakeshore fires were generally of lethal intensity, whereas both a long cycle of lethal fires and a shorter cycle of non-lethal fires were observed on 50% of the islands. The morphology and location of islands with both types of fires suggest that a higher frequency of lightning strikes resulted in a regime characterized by more frequent fires and fires of variable intensity. The specific fire regime observed in the island landscape may be the cause of the abundance of pines, whose presence may contribute, in turn, to the continuation of this regime of less intense and more frequent fires.
   We suggest that fire regime in the boreal forest is controlled by long-term climate change at the regional scale, and by a strong interaction with landscape at the local scale, both components having a great impact on the distribution and the dynamics of boreal vegetation.

AB We describe the nonrandom assembly of the North American terrestrial mammalian fauna based on body size and spatial scale. The frequency distribution of body masses among species for the entire continental fauna was highly modal and right skewed, even on a logarithmic scale; the median size of the 465 species was approximately 45 g. In contrast, comparable frequency distributions for 24 small patches of relatively homogeneous habitat were essentially uniform, with approximately equal numbers of species in each logarithmic size class; the median sizes of the 19-37 species ranged from approximately 100 to 2,500 g. Frequency distributions for 21 biomes (large regions of relatively similar vegetation) were intermediate between the continental and local assemblages. This pattern of assembly indicates that species of modal size (20-250 g) tend not to coexist in local habitat patches and they replace each other more frequently from habitat to habitat across the landscape than species of relatively large or small size. We hypothesize that three mechanisms are necessary and possibly sufficient to produce this result: competitive exclusion of species of similar size within local habitats, differential extinction of species of large size with small geographic ranges, and greater specialization of modal-sized species owing to energetic and dietary constraints.

AB Movement behaviors are of central importance to the biology of many organisms, and there are many studies that examine the effects of experimental treatments on such movement parameters as the average direction and distance moved. However, there are few studies that address explicitly the long-term consequences of treatment differences in movement parameters. Instead, it is often assumed that treatment differences in movement parameters will extend, over long periods of time, into treatment differences in long-term, net displacements from a point of origin. I use diffusion models to show that this assumption is not necessarily correct, thus indicating that treatment differences in movement behaviors should be interpreted with caution. In addition, for organisms whose long-term movements can be represented by simple diffusion, I provide formulae that allow calculation of whether treatment effects on movement parameters would be likely to produce treatment differences in long-term displacements. I illustrate these analyses with computer simulations and with data concerning the spread of clonal plants, and I use published values of the diffusion coefficient to help place my results in an ecological context.

ID NURSE PLANTS; GROWTH
AB (1) The hypothesis that positive plant interactions, arising from species aggregations, are important in harsh environments was tested on the sedge Carex bigelowii in the alpine/subarctic tundra of Swedish Lapland. (2) Association analyses showed that, in contrast to records for the High Arctic, aggregations of the low-growing species (< 15 cm tall) were not well developed at the study site. However, when C. bigelowii was growing in close proximity to Cassiope tetragona or Empetrum hermaphroditum, two evergreen dwarf shrubs, or in mats of the moss Racomitrium lanuginosum, increased leaf lengths and culm heights were recorded, compared with plants growing > 2 cm away from the dwarf shrubs or outside the moss mat. (3) The effect of the dwarf shrubs was interpreted as a result of above-ground shelter because shoot height, as well as number of shoots, also increased when plywood shelters were erected on the windward side of C. bigelowii. The effects of this above-ground shelter on shoot growth could result from increased snow cover, protection against strong desiccating winds early in the growing season, and a warmer micro-climate. (4) An alternative explanation for the increased growth of C. bigelowii growing near other species is that their patchy distributions, particularly those of the dwarf shrubs, may be related to localized increased soil nutrient status. When fertilizer was added to C. bigelowii, there were significant increases in shoot height and number. The benefits to the growth of C. bigelowii when growing close to other species may be a combination of shelter effects and a patchy distribution of nutrients.

AB (1) The responses of Geonoma congesta, a clonal understorey palm, to leaf and ramet removal were examined in sixty clones under natural field conditions in a Costa Rican rain forest. Fifteen clones, each with eight or fewer stems, were assigned to each of four treatments: (a) control (no manipulation), (b) removal of all but one ramet, (c) removal of 50% of the leaves from one ramet, and (d) removal of all but one ramet plus removal of 50% of the leaves. Ramet growth, new ramet production and reproductive activity were monitored annually for 3 years. (2) Ramet and leaf removal alone did not significantly increase mortality over controls, but mortality was significantly increased when both ramets and leaves were removed. Leaf and ramet removal had no significant effect on height-growth and stem-growth increments. Leaf size and stem diameter after 3 years were not influenced by leaf removal or ramet removal. Defoliated ramets had a significantly higher annual rate of leaf production per initial number of leaves than non-defoliated ramets, whereas ramet removal showed no significant effect on leaf production of the remaining ramet. (3) The number of clones producing at least one new sprout during the 3-year period did not vary significantly among treatments, nor was a significant difference observed in the total number of new sprouts produced per treatment. Ramet removal resulted in a significant decrease in the number of clones producing reproductive ramets, whereas leaf removal had no significant influence on the probability of reproduction within clones. On a ramet basis, the cumulative number of reproductive structures produced over 3 years was not significantly affected by either ramet or leaf removal treatments, nor was an interaction between treatments observed. (4) Clones of G. congesta are remarkably resistant to repeated defoliation and ramet removal. These results suggest that stored reserves are mobilized to maintain normal patterns of growth and ramet production following defoliation. Clonal growth in this species appears to buffer individual ramets against traumatic effects of ramet and leaf removal on growth, survival and reproduction.

TI COMMUNITY AREA AND FOOD-CHAIN LENGTH - THEORETICAL PREDICTIONS
SO AMERICAN NATURALIST
LA English
DT Article
ID STOCHASTIC-THEORY; WEBS
AB In combination with the simplest forms of the species-area curve (a power function or a simple proportionality between species and area), the cascade model predicts that the maximal chain length of a community food web (the height) should increase more slowly than linearly as a function of the logarithm of area and asymptotically in islands with extremely large area and extremely large numbers of species.  The average chain length, according to the cascade model, should exceed 3.5 as soon as islands are large enough to have thirty or more species and should approach a finite limit, approximately 4.0, in webs from arbitrarily large islands.  Thus the ratio of the height to the average chain length in the cascade model asymptotically increases without limit in webs from very large islands with very large numbers of species.  According to the superlinear homogeneous model, both the height and the average chain length increase as a power, less than one, of the number of species, and therefore as a power, less than one, of area.  The ratio of maximal to average chain length in the superlinear homogeneous model asymptotically approaches the limit e in webs from very large islands with very large numbers of species.  The quantitative predicted length-area curves derived here are best tested by average food-chain lengths computed from observed complete food webs on islands of widely varying sizes, from small to large, in which other environmental factors such as productivity, environmental variability, and distance from a source of colonization do not vary notably.  If the predicted area-height curves are to be tested with data from islands of small to moderate sizes, tailored simulations are recommended for obtaining the predicted distribution of height.

AB Current ecological theory hypothesizes that boundaries between adjacent ecosystem units are important in determining ecosystem structure and function across heterogeneous landscapes, and that such boundaries are potentially important sites for early detection of global climate change effects. Hence, there is an increasing research effort to elucidate the structure and function of ecological boundaries. Yet traditional data analysis methods focus primarily on homogeneous units rather than on the boundaries between them; thus, new methods are being developed for detecting, characterizing and classifying boundaries, e.g., split moving-window boundary analysis (SMW). SMW is a simple yet sensitive method for locating discontinuities that may exist within multivariate, serial data (ordered in one dimension) at various scales relative to the length of the data series. However, SMW is subjective and relative, and therefore locates apparent discontinuities even within random, serial data. In this paper we present two nonparametric methods for determining the statistical significance of discontinuities detected by SMW. First, we describe a Monte Carlo method for determining the statistical significance of scale-dependent discontinuities (i.e., discontinuities that are significant relative to only one scale). Second, we propose a nonparametric, scale-independent method (it also is dependent upon scale size, but to a much lesser degree than the Monte Carlo method) that is more appropriate for locating statistically significant discontinuities that separate different, relatively homogeneous groups of varying size along a series. We examine the robustness of these two methods using computer-generated data having varying intensities of imposed discontinuities, and illustrate their application to locating boundaries between vegetation samples collected at systematic intervals across a desert landscape in southern New Mexico, USA.

AB By experiment, we show that the pollination success obtained from a bumblebee visit by an individual of Polemonium viscosum depends strongly on the size of nectar rewards offered and weakly on flower size. However, probably because the size of nectar rewards correlates with flower size, bumblebees discriminate among individual plants on the basis of flower size. If the bumblebees' preferences are learned, then it is likely that the nature of the preferences will depend on the bees' experience with reward/advertisement combinations and that this will be affected by the frequencies of the combinations in the population. Thus, pollinator preferences can be a source of frequency-dependent selection on floral traits in insect-pollinated plants. In general, when the pollimation performance of plants is determined in part by pollinator visitation rate, then the adaptive surfaces that Armbruster proposed for the study of relationships between form and function in flowers may alter under frequency-dependent selection. The shape of the adaptive surface may depend on population composition under the following conditions: intraspecific competition for pollinators, a correlation between nectar production rate and standing crop of nectar, and a correlation of standing crop of nectar with a component of a floral advertisement that can be learned by the pollinator.

AB We investigated the selective pressures associated with the possession of wings and migration in wing-dimorphic planthoppers (Homoptera:  Delphacidae).  Both migratory (macropterous) and flightless (brachypterous) forms occur.  We found that levels of migration (% macroptery) in field populations decreased significantly as the persistence of their habitats increased.  By using phylogenetically independent contrasts between congeners, we obtained the same result, which suggests that habitat persistence has influenced levels of migration independent of common ancestry.  Also, there was a clear difference in the density-wing form response between species in temporary and persistent habitats.  Macropterous forms were triggered at lower densities for species inhabiting temporary rather than persistent habitats.  However, males of species in temporary habitats were macropterous at both low and high rearing densities; macroptery was positively density-dependent in the females of these species and in both sexes of species in persistent habitats.  Our results suggest that habitat persistence influences the migratory capability of planthoppers in two ways:  (1) by selecting for habitat escape, and (2) by dictating the availability of mates.  In persistent habitats wings are less necessary for habitat escape and they are rarely required for mate location.  As a consequence and because wings impose a reproductive penalty, flightlessness prevails.  For species in temporary habitats, wings are favored in males to locate females at low colonizing densities and are favored in both sexes at high densities for reasons of habitat escape.  We conclude that habitat persistence has played a major role in shaping patterns of migration in this group of sap-feeding herbivores.

TI COMPETITION AND THE COEXISTENCE OF SPECIES IN A MIXED PODOCARP STAND

AB (1) The importance of intra- and interspecific competition in affecting the growth and survival of Dacrycarpus dacrydioides and Dacrydium cupressinum, the two dominant trees in a mixed podocarp stand in Ohinemaka Forest, south Westland, New Zealand, was investigated. Two lines of evidence (spatial patterning of trees and correlates of tree performance with neighbourhood density) were used to infer the importance of competition, (2) Intraspecific competition among D. dacrydioides trees appeared to be intense. Mean radial growth rate (MGR) was significantly negatively correlated with the number of conspecific neighbours, and patterns of non-random mortality resulted in a shift in spatial pattern from a significantly clumped to a significantly regular distribution. In contrast, intraspecific competition among D. cupressinum was less intense. D. cupressinum had a low rate of mortality, predominantly random spatial patterns of mortality. and a weak correlation between MGR and the number of conspecific neighbours. (3) Differences in the relative importance of intraspecific competition in affecting survival and growth of the two species was attributed to differences in the distribution and availability of suitable establishment sites. D. dacrydioides preferentially established on abundant level or slightly elevated sites, and in patches reached densities where resources were limiting. In contrast, the number and distribution of D. cupressinum were determined primarily by the availability of suitable elevated establishment sites that were scattered throughout the stand. The resticted number of suitable sites limited D. cupressinum to densities where resources were not severely limiting. (4) There was no evidence of interspecific competiton. Rather the two species avoided interspecific competition by partitioning the variability in forest-floor micro-relief. Partitioning of sites may permit the coexistence of the two species.

AB (1) The effects of time since abandonment and date of flowering on the number and biomass of seeds of Rumex acetosella were studied at monthly intervals over a single growing season in a successional series of abandoned fields at two sites near Paris. France. (2) Overall, a decrease in filled-seed production per plant was observed with increasing successional age, but only for the early summer period. A similar trend was observed for reproductive effort, i.e. filled-seed production per unit of vegetative biomass. (3) There were significant differences between the populations in the mean weight of filled seeds, but only for two of the five monthly surveys. The successionally intermediate and advanced populations at one of the sites showed the greatest seed biomass. (4) There were no significant negative correlations between the number and biomass of seeds when all the populations were pooled, but seed mass was negatively correlated with seed number at four sites in June. (5) Although the results provide no evidence for a trade-off between the various components of seed production in R. acelosella, they do indicate that genetically based differences in sexual resource allocation occur among plants growing along a successional habitat gradient.

AB At Monteverde, Costa Rica, the plants Besleria triflora (Gesneriaceae), Palicourea lasiorrachis, and Cephaelis elata (both Rubiaceae) share hummingbirds (Lampornis calolaema) as pollinators. To investigate the effect that intervening visits to Cephaelis flowers have on pollen transfer between plants of self-compatible Besleria or of self-incompatible Palicourea, we presented captive Lampornis with series of hand-held flowers: first, 2 or 15 flowers of either Besleria or Palicourea as pollen donors, followed by 0, 2, or 10 Cephaelis flowers, followed by 20 recipient flowers of the first species. In protandrous Besleria, we used male-phase flowers as donors and female-phase flowers as recipients. In distylous Palicourea, we used pin (long-styled) flowers as donors and thrum (short-styled) flowers as recipients. We assessed pollen transfer by counting pollen tubes in recipients' styles and, in Besleria, by counting pollen grains deposited on stigmas.
   Intervention of Cephaelis flowers strongly reduced pollen transfer among Palicourea flowers. Increasing the number of donor Palicourea flowers significantly increased the absolute amount of pollen transferred but did not overcome the negative effect of Cephaelis. Pollen transfer among Besleria flowers also declined with the intervention of Cephaelis flowers; the decline was less strongly significant than for Palicourea, perhaps because pollen loads on stigmas of some female Besleria flowers can contain self pollen left over from their male phase.
   Under controlled conditions, then, strong competition may exist where plants share pollinator individuals, a situation faced by the experimental species and many others at Monteverde. Other studies on these plants reveal that despite its demonstrability in the laboratory, however, competition among individual plants varies in its ability to explain density dependence in pollination among plant populations in the field. Furthermore, community-level patterns of coexistence among plant species at Monteverde feature few ''ghosts of competition past.'' The collective results demonstrate that studying the role of particular interactions in community structure must involve examinations of mechanisms at the level of individuals, processes at the population level, and patterns of coexistence rather than just one level of this hierarchy. Studying mechanisms alone could exaggerate their importance to community structure, whereas studying coexistence patterns alone could misjudge the strength of interactions among individuals.

AB In a tropical cloud forest at Monteverde, Costa Rica, three understory shrub species overlap greatly in flowering seasons and share hummingbird pollinators (Lampornis calolaema). We conducted two field experiments to determine if a plant's pollination and subsequent reproductive output reflect local densities of conspecific and heterospecific flowers. We controlled floral composition in the neighborhoods surrounding 12 focal plants of self-compatible Besleria triflora (Gesneriaceae) and of self-incompatible Palicourea lasiorrachis (Rubiaceae), producing prescribed mixtures of flowers of the focal plants' conspecifics and of Cephaelis elata (Rubiaceae). Each experiment subjected each focal plant to four different treatments: a floral neighborhood of 10 conspecific flowers and 10 of Cephaelis within a radius of 20 m (Treatment A); 90:10 (B); 10:90 (C); and 50:50 (D). Focal plants themselves always had 10 open flowers. We assigned the sequence of treatments to each focal plant in a Latin square crossover design using three balanced blocks of four plants each. Dependent variables were: frequency of hummingbird probes per flower; pollen tubes in styles; and seed output per flower. From standard models of competition for pollination, we predicted that pollination levels and seed production would be ranked among treatments: B(90:10) > D(50:50) > A(10:10) > C(10:90).
   These overall predictions were supported for both Palicourea and Besleria, based on tests for directionality showing that the rank order among adjusted treatment means did not differ from the order predicted. Separate a priori treatment contrasts indicated that in both species increasing flower density above base levels (Treatment A, 10:10) by adding conspecific flowers alone (B, 90:10) or along with Cephaelis (D, 50:50) increased the rate at which hummingbirds visited focal plants' flowers. In Palicourea, both the number of pollen tubes in styles and seed output per flower increased in the same fashion. In Besleria, the only effect was increased pollination (but not seed output) from A (10:10) to B (90:10). In contrast, enriching the basic neighborhood (A, 10:10) with Cephaelis flowers (C, 10:90) did not alter frequencies of hummingbird probes to either species of focal plant. Heterospecific enrichment did, however, decrease both pollination levels and seed output in Palicourea, and seed output in Besleria. In general, altering the floral neighborhood affected Palicourea more strongly than Besleria. Apparently the intensity of density dependence, at least in terms of female reproductive success, varies among plant species sharing pollinators. Seed outputs in self-incompatible plants such as Palicourea may closely reflect flower densities of neighbors, but interspecific effects on fertilization in self-compatible plants such as Besleria may be density vague.

TI RESPONSE OF MEDITERRANEAN GRASSLAND SPECIES TO CHANGING RAINFALL
SO JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID CENTRAL SPAIN; DEMOGRAPHY; PLANT
AB (1) Long-term changes (over 14 years) were investigated in the composition of a species-rich Mediterranean grassland ('dehesa') in south-western Spain. The frequency of every species of herbaceous vascular plant was recorded annually at the end of the growing season, from 1977 to 1986 and again in 1990, in permanent plots along a transect. Monthly rainfall data over the same period were typical of the Mediterranean climate: there was virtually no rainfall in summer (June-September), when potential evapotranspiration was high; rainfall in the cooler part of the year was unpredictable in amount and distribution. (2) The vegetation was dominated by winter annuals, which germinated after the autumn rains and fruited in late spring or early summer; they comprised 86 of the 99 species recorded. Most of these species displayed considerable variations in abundance over the period of study and the abundance of some fluctuated violently from one year to another. (3) Correlations were examined between the logit of total annual frequency of each species (n = 11 years) and rainfall totals over the growing season (October-May) and its three components: autumn (October-November), winter (December-February) and spring (March-May). Evidence for trends in logit frequency that might represent successional changes was sought from similar correlations with time. (4) The abundance of many species was highly correlated with rainfall, which accounted for up to 83% of year-to-year variance (in Juncus capitatus). Rainfall over the whole growing season was a good predictor of abundance for more species than any of its component periods (25 species with significant associations out of 99). Cluster analysis resolved five groups of species with similar year-to-year variations in abundance: two groups contained most of the species showing significant positive correlations with rainfall, and another group contained a small number of generally infrequent species that showed significant negative correlations. The species in the remaining two groups had few significant correlations with rainfall. Only three moderately abundant species were significantly correlated with time. Successional change was apparently much less important than rainfall as a source of variation in plant frequency. (5) The demographic mechanisms underlying these relationships, their implications for the regulation of community structure and their possible value in detecting the consequences of climatic change in the Mediterranean region are discussed.

AB This paper presents a life table for the common mud turtle, Kinosternon subrubrum, in a fluctuating aquatic habitat on the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina, USA, using data gathered in a 20-yr mark-recapture study. Data on survivorship and fecundity (clutch size, per capita clutch frequency) were assessed and compared to previously published life table statistics for the slider turtle, Trachemys scripta, in the same body of water and for the yellow mud turtle, K. flavescens, in Nebraska.
   The annual survival rate for adult female Kinosternon (87.6%) is significantly higher than that of adult female Trachemys (77.4%). Similarly, male Kinosternon exhibit an annual survival rate (89.0%) significantly higher than that of male Trachemys (83.4%). The mean annual proportion of female Kinosternon that are reproductively active (50.7%) also is significantly higher than that of Trachemys (37.2%). In addition, survival rate from the time eggs are laid by Kinosternon until the hatchlings enter the aquatic environment (26.1 %) is significantly higher than that for Trachemys (10.5%).
   Comparisons of our findings with those for K. flavescens indicate that these geographically separate populations of congeneric species also differ substantially in age at maturity, mean generation time, and the mean proportion of females that are reproductively active in any given year. Differences were also apparent in mean clutch frequencies and adult survival rates. The differences in life history traits between the two geographically separated populations of congeners seem to be as great as those between the two syntopic populations representing different families (Kinosternidae: K. subrubrum and Emydidae: Trachemys scripta). The comparison of life tables for two species from different families having different ecological and evolutionary histories, but living in the same habitat, and of congeneric species in different habitats, is instructive regarding the biological flexibility of species under natural conditions. However, the study suggests that environmental variability has a greater effect on life table statistics than do phylogenetic relationships.

AB To learn whether vine stems are less structurally stable than shrub stems, I studied the architecture, anatomy, and mechanics of western poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), a plant that grows as a vine when provided with external support but otherwise as a shrub. I assessed the relative structural stabilities of vines and shrubs, and the relative importance of stem morphological vs. material properties for this structural stability using the following types of information: aboveground architecture and biomass distribution, and geometric, anatomical, and material properties of the stems. Shoots that were supported by a fence (vines) had a lower proportion of their dry mass in primary stem and had more aboveground dry mass, more leaves, and a greater total length of stem than did unsupported shoots (shrubs). Both growth forms had about the same proportion of their biomass at a given relative height above the ground. Supported shoots were taller and had lower stem taper (change in radius per unit length of stem) than did unsupported shoots, and, in a common garden, had longer internodes. Xylem of supported shoots had a higher proportion of vessel lumen and lower maximum thicknesses of fiber cell walls than did xylem of unsupported shoots. Supported stems were less stiff (had lower apparent material stiffness in bending) than unsupported stems at diameter less-than-or-equal-to 3.5 cm. A simple model showed that the lower taper and lower material stiffness of vines yielded much lower flexural stiffness in vine than in shrub stems. A second model showed that simplified shrub stems could reach almost 11 m before becoming structurally unstable. Actual shrubs from the modelled environment, however, never exceeded 3.2 m in height. A simplified vine modelled for the same environment would become unstable at 1.2 m, whereas vines in the field can be over 30 m tall. These findings suggest that for poison oak (1) shrubs are overbuilt and vines are underbuilt for self-support, and (2) the higher structural stability of shrubs than vines is due mainly to differences in stem geometry, not to differences in stem material properties.

TI RANDOM PREY DETECTION WITH PAUSE-TRAVEL SEARCH
SO AMERICAN NATURALIST
LA English
DT Article
ID FUNCTIONAL-RESPONSE; MECHANISMS; CRYPSIS; ANIMALS
AB We develop a mechanistic approach to the relationship between prey density and predator-prey encounter rate, incorporating perceptual constraints, search costs, and search tactics. We find that encounter rate should be density-dependent and the functional response sigmoid whenever the effects of (1) density on distance to prey and of (2) distance on instantaneous rate of detection do not cancel perfectly. We can predict how search tactics should change with prey density and detectability given the various constraints. If search movements are relatively cheap in both time and energy, then pause-travel search tactics can reduce the density dependence toward linearity, approximating a Type II functional response. If we ignore mechanistic details like search tactics that vary over several orders of magnitude, we can describe very accurately the encounter rates generated by this process with the simple traditional form aD(b). We show how the critical exponent b relates to various constraints. The analysis leads to counterintuitive expectations about frequency dependence when prey types are intermixed.

TI COMPETITIVE EFFECT AND RESPONSE - HIERARCHIES AND CORRELATED TRAITS IN
   THE EARLY STAGES OF COMPETITION

AB (1) Competitive ability can be compared between species in two ways: effect of different neighbour species on performance of a single target species or response of different target species to a single neighbour species. In a 5-week glasshouse experiment, an additive design was used for all combinations of seven species as both target and neighbour species to determine if there were consistent hierarchies in competitive effect and/or response, what traits of individuals determined position in these hierarchies, and whether or not effect and response competitive ability were related during the early stages of competition. (2) Five weeks after sowing, significant non-linear regressions of target biomass on neighbour density were found for 59% of the forty-nine species combinations and significant linear regressions on neighbour biomass were found for 51% of the species combinations. The slopes of these regressions represent per-plant and per-gram competition coefficients, respectively. (3) Neighbour species differed strongly in competitive effect per plant. Differences in effect per gram, response per plant, and response per gram were much weaker. Nevertheless, consistent competitive hierarchies were found for both effect and response on both a per-plant and per-gram basis. (4) Different traits determined position in the effect and response hierarchies. Neighbour species with larger seed mass and larger maximum potential mass had stronger per-plant competitive effects, whilst neighbour species with higher maximum relative growth rates had stronger per-gram competitive effects. The reverse of this latter pattern was seen for competitive response: target species with lower maximum relative growth rates were better response competitors. Mean effect and response competitive ability of the seven species were uncorrelated with each other. (5) These differences in traits associated with strong effect and strong response competitive ability emphasize the importance of distinguishing between them in experimental studies, at least during the early stages of competition.

TI LIMITED FEMALE CHOICE AND THE EVOLUTION OF SECONDARY SEXUAL CHARACTERS
SO AMERICAN NATURALIST

AB This article studies the role that limits on female mate choice in polygynous species play in the evolution of preferred secondary sexual traits. Analysis of a diploid model of evolution by female choice sexual selection that incorporates limited female choice shows that the conditions under which an allele coding for a novel secondary sexual trait will increase in frequency when rare are more restrictive when female choice is more limited. This suggests the prediction that, all else being equal, species or populations whose females have limited mate choice are less likely to be sexually dimorphic in secondary sexual traits compared to species or populations whose females have relatively less limited choice.

AB (1) The growth patterns of tree height and stem diameter in crowded Abies veitchii, A. mariesii and Betula ermanii populations were investigated based on the diffusion model for growth dynamics in size-structured populations. (2) Size-dependent growth was found in each species, but the pattern was different between the species. Small, suppressed individuals of Abies spp. showed little growth in tree height but grew in stem diameter. In small, suppressed individuals of B. ermanii, the converse was found. (3) The diffusion model revealed that stem diameter growth of Abies spp. and tree height growth of B. ermanii are affected only a little by competition between individuals even under crowded conditions, and thus that growth in these dimensions is determined in a genetically strict manner for each species. These growth patterns correspond to the life-history traits and the successional status of Abies spp. (shade-tolerant late-successional species) and B. ermanii (a shade-intolerant early-successional species). (4) This study indicates the quantitative differences of assimilate partitioning between tree height growth and stem diameter growth in size-structured plant populations in relation to the characteristics and successional status of species.

ID PLANT ZONATION; SALT-MARSH; GROWTH
AB (1) Seasonal changes in redox potential (Eh) of peat were investigated in a floating mat which experiences a periodical inundation. In the inundated season (late December-June), Eh of the peat within 3 cm of the surface was 150-200 mV vs. NHE (standard hydrogen electrode) and it fluctuated little. It became < 50 mV in July, although the mat surface emerged from water and the peat surface was in direct contact with the air. (2) Redox potential began to increase in late July and reached its maximum in early November. Maximum Eh in slightly elevated areas (Menyanthes trifoliata community accompanied by Eriocaulon hondoense f. pilosum) was 484 mV. although the value in the relatively low area (pure community of M. trifoliata) was 295 mV. (3) An experiment on artificial emergence of submerged peat using plastic pots with peat supported the field observations. Even in peat that was exposed to the air in and after early May (2 months earlier than the emergence of mat surface), the peat near the surface became reducing in July as the surface of the floating mat. The earlier the peat exposed to the air, the higher the Eh became in autumn.

AB To investigate the potential response to natural selection of reaction norms for age and size at maturity, fresh body weight at eclosion was mass selected under rich and poor larval food conditions in Drosophila melanogaster. The sensitivity of dry weight at eclosion to the difference between rich and poor larval food was selected using differences in sensitivities among families. For both experiments, the correlated response to selection of age at eclosion was examined. The flies were derived from wild populations and had been mass cultured in the lab for more than six months before the experiments started. These flies responded to selection on body weight upwards and downwards on both rich and poor larval food. Selection on increased or decreased sensitivity of body weight was also successful in at least one direction. Sensitivity was reduced by selection upwards in a poor environment and downwards in a rich environment.

AB Earthworms represent the dominant fraction of soil macroinvertebrate biomass in Kansas tallgrass prairie and thus may have a large impact on nutrient budgets. To evaluate this impact I estimated cast production and rates of nutrient processing by the native genus Diplocardia and by exotic Lumbricidae in permanent plots on two soil types at Konza Prairie Research Natural Area. Total cast production was estimated from field population estimates, soil climate data, and cast production-temperature relationships obtained in the laboratory. The organic matter and mineral N and P contents of surface casts by month were used to estimate total processing of these substances in the field. Earthworms present in the study sites were Diplocardia longiseta, D. kansensis, D. rugosa, D. singularis, D. smithii, D. verrucosa, and the European species Aporrectodea caliginosa and Octolasion cyaneum. Estimated total cast production and nutrient processing by Diplocardia spp. exceeded that of exotics in both soil types, in spite of higher populations of Lumbricidae in one soil. Total annual soil consumption by all earthworms was 4-10% of the A-horizon, depending on soil type. Organic matter equivalent to 10% of total soil organic matter in the top 15 cm or to 100-300% of plant annual belowground production appears to pass through the earthworms each year. Mineral N processed was almost-equal-to 10-12% of annual plant N uptake, comparable to half of the input from precipitation, while the P processed was equivalent to 50% of annual uptake. In contrast to other grassland systems studied, the introduction of Lumbricidae had a negative effect on soil turnover and nutrient mineralization due to the lower throughput of Lumbricidae and their relative intolerance of summer soil temperatures.

AB Morphologically variable F2 genotypes derived from hybridization of coastal and inland ecotypes of the annual plant Diodia teres were used to identify selection on morphological traits in the natural habitat of each ecotype. These ecotypes occur in very different habitats, and have evolved pronounced morphological differentiation. Selection analysis can suggest whether present patterns of selection can explain morphological differences between ecotypes. F2 genotypes were characterized morphologically, clonally replicated, and transplanted into the habitat of each ecotype. Selection was measured on six morphological traits. Directional and stabilizing selection occurred on many traits; direction and strength of selection varied sharply at different stages of growth, as revealed by a path-analysis approach that divided selection into a set of independent components. Directional selection favored traits of the native population at the coastal habitat, but less so at the inland habitat. Selection was of sufficient strength to create the observed morphological differences between ecotypes in 25-100 generations, given constant selection and sufficient genetic variation. In effects on fitness, most traits were neither independent nor consistently interactive with other traits. Rather, many traits entered into strong but evanescent interactions affecting particular components of fitness. Observed interactions did not support the hypothesis that the morphology of each ecotype was functionally integrated to a high degree.

DT Article
ID PHEROMONE; INFORMATION; GOLDFISH; ANIMALS; GROWTH; FISHES
AB We develop a model for mate location by olfaction and apply it to reproductive behavior in the deep-sea hatchetfish Argyropelecus hemigymnus.  The model includes diffusion theory to model the geometry of the region of detectable pheromone around the female, kinetic theory to model the motion of the males prior to detection of a pheromone field, and a Monte Carlo search routine to estimate the time to locate the female after detection.  The model yields results that are consistent with our present understanding of the biology of A. hemigymnus.  The success of olfactory communication systems is strongly dependent on diffusion velocity, which is a function of depth in the occan.  The receiving organism must have low detection thresholds and high dynamic sensitivity to changes in odor concentration to use olfaction effectively for long-range detection and location of advertising females.  Olfaction appears to be critical to reproductive success and therefore viability for many dispersed and sparse populations living in deep ocean environments.

TI NEW SITE FORMATION AND COLONIZING VEGETATION IN PRIMARY SUCCESSION ON
   THE WESTERN AMAZON FLOODPLAINS
SO JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID DIVERSITY
AB (1) The major proportion of western Amazon forests grow on fluvial deposits and thus originated in floodplain environments. The fluviodynamic character of the sites initially colonized by plants was studied along different river types. and this information was combined with botanical observations from the same areas. Special emphasis was given to colonizing plant distribution and survival in relation to the abiotic environment. (2) Four frequently occurring landform types. each rich in microforms. were recognized in relation to the colonization process: fluvial bars, swales, abandoned channels and riverbanks. They are affected by seasonal fluctuations in the rivers and tend to be narrow, curved or linear patches. Local site and colonizing vegetation characteristics vary considerably between different river types (meandering or braided, rich or poor in suspended sediment). (3) The newly deposited fluvial sediments are poor in organic carbon and nitrogen. Colonization begins either with immigrant propagules dispersed by wind or water, or with the invasion of species by vegetative means. Usually numbers of individuals are few, and the initial vegetation pattern is a reflection of the small-scale mosaic of microsites. The pioneer flora (125 species recorded) includes many widespread perennial herbs, and seeds of most forest species do not germinate in the dry sediments. Herbaceous colonist species are almost non-existent in suspension-poor rivers of low erosion rate. (4) The persistence of the initial plant assemblage is controlled by the evolution of fluvial landforms. Only a few species among the set of colonists are significant in later forest succession. These include Tessaria integrifolia and Gynerium sagittatum, which resist moderate flood damage and resprout after burial. Mature seed populations of these 10- 15-m-tall species are abundant at the outermost margin of the successional forest just beyond the fluvial bars. The low representation of tree species in the colonizing phase suggests that the extreme environmental conditions at the river margins differ from other natural environments along the Amazon. (5) Aquatic succession on lakes affected by suspension-rich waters starts with genuine floating species. The general habits of these vegetation assemblages and their species composition are highly similar in the 'white-water' floodplains of the study area. An annual vegetation flush characteristically follows the flood period. On the other hand, macrophyte vegetation is almost non-existent on the floodplain lakes of suspension-poor rivers. (6) The Amazon floodplain corridors provide a good opportunity for ecological studies of plant colonization because basically similar succession is present at each meander along the rivers. Furthermore, the basic physiographic processes which form the sites and control their further evolution are both well known and measurable.

AB We experimented on how illumination, habitat structure, and three different species of owls affected the foraging behavior of Gerbillus allenbyi and G. pyramidum, two gerbil species that coexist on sand dune habitats in the Negev Desert, Israel. We also tested how illumination and habitat structure affected rates of predation by owls on the two gerbil species. In a large aviary, we manipulated presence and absence of owls, owl species, presence and absence of illumination, and shrub cover. In response to the presence of owls or to increased illumination, gerbils foraged less, shifted foraging activity to the bush microhabitat, and quit patches at a higher giving-up density of resources. In accord with moonlight avoidance, both gerbil species suffered higher predation rates under illumination than in the absence of illumination. In addition, G. pyramidum distinguished among owl species, as indicated by changes in patch use and habitat selection. Habitat structure also affected foraging behavior and rates of predation. Gerbils foraged less in the open than in the bush microhabitat, foraged less when there was no cover present, and foraged less in the bush microhabitat when patches were encumbered by entangling branches. In accord with avoidance of open areas, both gerbil species suffered higher rates of predation when shrub cover was 0% than when shrub cover was 10%. With 0% cover, G. allenbyi suffered higher predation rates than G. pyramidum, but with 10% cover, rates of owl predation did not differ between gerbil species. Rates of owl predation on the two species corresponded to their natural patterns of macro- and microhabitat partitioning; relative to G. allenbyi, G. pyramidum predominates on open sand dunes and biases its behavior toward the open microhabitat. The results suggest that predation interacts with resource competition to determine the distribution and habitat separation of G. allenbyi and G. pyramidum.

AB The nature of the variation which is created by mutation can show how the direction of evolution is constrained by internal biases arising from development and pre-existing design. We have attempted to quantify these biases by measuring eight life history characters in developmental mutants of Volvox carteri. Most of the mutants in our sample were inferior to the wild type, but deviated by less than tenfold from the wild-type mean. Characters differed in mutability, suggesting different levels of canalisation. Most correlations between life history characters among strains were positive, but there was a significant negative correlation between the size and the number of reproductive cells, suggesting an upper limit to the total quantity of germ produced by individuals. The most extreme phenotypes in our sample were very vigorous, showing that not all mutations of large effect are unconditionally deleterious. We investigated the effect of developmental constraints on the course of evolution by comparing the variance and covariance patterns among mutant strains with those among species in the family Volvocaceae. A close correspondence between patterns at these two levels would suggest that pre-existing design has a strong influence on evolution, while little or no correspondence shows the action of selection. The variance generated by mutation was equal to that generated by speciation in the family Volvocaceae, the genus Volvox, or the section Merillosphaera, depending on the character considered. We found that mutation changes the volume of somatic tissue independently of the quantity of germ tissue, so that the interspecific correlation between soma and germ can be attributed to selection. The negative correlation between size and number of germ cells among mutants of V. carteri is also seen among the larger members of the family (Volvox spp.), but not among the smaller members, suggesting a powerful design constraint that may be responsible for the absence of larger forms in the entire group.

AB We assess the degree to which adaptation to a uniform environment among independently evolving asexual populations is associated with increasing divergence of those populations. In addition, we are concerned with the pattern of adaptation itself, particularly whether the rate of increase in mean fitness tends to decline with the number of generations of selection in a constant environment. The correspondence between the rate of increase in mean fitness and the within-population genetic variance of fitness, as expected from Fisher's fundamental theorem, is also addressed. Twelve Escherichia coli populations were founded from a single clonal ancestor and allowed to evolve for 2,000 generations. Mean fitness increased by about 37%. However, the rate of increase in mean fitness was slower in later generations. There was no statistically significant within-population genetic variance of fitness, but there was significant between-population variance. Although the estimated genetic variation in fitness within populations was not statistically significant, it was consistent in magnitude with theoretical expectations. Similarly, the variance of mean fitness between populations was consistent with a model that incorporated stochastic variation in the timing and order of substitutions at a finite number of nonepistatic loci, coupled with substitutions delays and interference between substitutions arising from clonality. These results, taken as a whole, are consistent with theoretical expectations that do not invoke divergence due to multiple fitness peaks in a Wrightian evolutionary landscape.

AB Coexisting heteromyid rodent species of North American deserts differ in habitat use and in locomotory morphology. Quadrupedal species forage primarily in structurally complex microhabitats, such as under bush canopies, while bipedal species forage in open spaces. A common explanation for this morphology-microhabitat association is that species differing in morphology also differ in vulnerability to predators, that microhabitat structure affects predation risk, and that animals preferentially forage in the safest microhabitats. We tested this for two bipedal and two quadrupedal heteromyid species (matched by body size), and one cricetid species, by quantifying effects of habitat and illumination on activity and on risk of predation by Great Homed Owls.
   Capture frequencies were lower for all heteromyid species than for the cricetid species, Peromyscus maniculatus. Heteromyid activity was lower in open habitat and under bright illumination. Illumination had no significant effect on risk, perhaps because rodents changed activity patterns under full moon to compensate for a potential increment in risk. Habitat, however, did affect fisk: all species were attacked and captured more frequently in the open. Bipedal species were attacked relatively more in the open than were quadrupeds. If these results apply to all predators, they indicate that predation alone cannot account for the divergent microhabitat associations of bipedal and quadrupedal species. Bipedal heteromyids, however, escaped owl attacks more frequently than did quadrupeds of equivalent size. It is therefore conceivable that they experience lower overall risk in nature, where owls may preferentially attack more easily captured prey species when given a choice. Under these circumstances, owl predation could reinforce divergent microhabitat specializations based on some other factor, such as foraging economics, by restricting quadrupeds more strongly than bipeds to the safety of bushes.

AB (1) The boreal mosses Tetraplodon angustatus, T. mnioides, Splachnum ampullaceum and S. luteum (Splachnaceae) grow on the droppings of large mammals and have their spores dispersed by flies (Diptera). This study was conducted to determine if (i) the interactions between these mosses on droppings (within-patch interactions) and (ii) the influence of habitat and type of dropping on such interactions promote their coexistence. (2) Comparisons of two-species competition experiments with single-species growth experiments in which the mosses were grown from Spores on moose droppings in the laboratory and field indicated that the mosses compete for resources. Each species produced more gametophytes when grown alone on droppings than when grown in mixture with another species. (3) Laboratory and field studies examining two-species competition on moose dung in which the mosses were grown from spores also indicated that the relative competitive abilities of species differed. In the laboratory study these differences could be explained by differences in growth rates. (4) In dry habitats in the field, species of Tetraplodon produced more gametophytes than species of Splachnum and often eliminated them; the reverse was true in wet habitats. Congeneric species had relatively symmetrical competitive abilities in the field and did not eliminate each other from droppings. (5) The strong influence of dry and wet habitats on the chemistry of dung may account for the differences between the laboratory and field results. All species produced abundant and apparently healthy gametophytes on both moose and wolf droppings. (6) While the influence of habitat on relative competitive ability may potentially explain the infrequency of co-occurrence of species of different genera on droppings, the relatively symmetrical competitive abilities of congeneric species suggests that their long-term regional coexistence probably results from mechanisms that operate at larger spatial scales, such as large-scale fluctuations in the abundance and distribution of droppings in space and time, differential spore dispersal and the independent aggregation of spores of different species on droppings.

AB (1) Three mechanisms that may promote the coexistence of the boreal mosses Tetraplodon angustatus, T. mnioides, S. ampullaceum and S. luteum (Splachnaceae) have been examined: differences between dry and wet habitats; seasonal segregation of resources, and interspecific dispersal differences. These mosses grow on the droppings of large mammals and have their spores dispersed by flies (Diptera). (2) Droppings located in dry habitats were primarily occupied by Tetraplodon spp., whereas droppings in wet habitats were primarily occupied by Splachnum spp. In dry habitats there was a seasonal segregation of dropping colonization by Tetraplodon spp. Dung placed into the field in May, when sporophytes of T. angustatus matured, were exclusively colonized by T. angustatus, whereas dung placed into the field in June, when most T. mnioides sporophytes matured, were primarily colonized by T. mnioides. (3) Each species of moss attracted between ten and seventeen species of spore-carrying flies and the fly faunas attracted to each species were 77-92% different from each other in species composition. (4) Neither species of Tetraplodon appeared to have a clear dispersal advantage: for both, spore-carrying flies were predominantly associated with dung in dry habitats; spore-carrying flies captured on T. angustatus carried significantly more spores on average than did spore-carrying flies captured on T. mnioides; however, more flies captured on T. mnioides were found to be carrying spores than were flies captured on T. angustatus. (5) Although more flies captured on Splachnum luteum than on S. ampullaceum, were found to be carrying spores, S. ampullaceum (the weaker competitor) appears to have more of its spores dispersed to dung in wet habitats than does S. luteum. Spore-carrying flies captured on S. ampullaceum and associated dung carried significantly more spores on average than did spore-carrying flies captured on S. luteum. and a much greater proportion of spore-carrying flies associated with S. ampullaceum than with S. luteuum were also associated with dung in wet habitats.

AB The results of this study demonstrate that moderately polymorphic, uneven equilibria may result from a simple evolutionary process, namely, the invasion of mutant alleles, one at a time, into an extant population of alleles.  We have shown that the very small region of the viability parameter space affording stable, feasible polymorphism is easily reached.  A remarkable feature of this process is the modification of fitness distributions accomplished by the interaction of simple recurrent mutation and selection, a result that strongly underscores Ginzburg's point that allele frequencies and fitnesses coevolve.  Though a substantial fraction of these polymorphic stable equilibria involved total overdominance, the evolution of equilibria in which at least one pair of alleles was not overdominant reminds us that the results of studies of two alleles may be somewhat misleading.  The number of alleles maintained here provides only some help in explaining the variation shown in certain electrophoretic data; recurrent independent mutation with the initial fitness distributions used here will result in neither 40-allele polymorphisms nor monomorphisms.  The distribution of newly generated fitnesses may be an important variable.  We are currently examining other rules for fitness generation as well as incorporating genetic drift to see whether more realistic assumptions can help us understand natural variation.  The evolution of heterosis strongly suggests that it may not be necessary to examine structured fitness matrices to explain polymorphism:  the introduction of a more biologically realistic mutation process into a finite population may, in conjunction with the action of selection, give rise to different sorts of structures.

AB To determine the effect of growing conditions on population parameters in wild radish, (Raphanus sativus L.: Brassicaceae), we replicated maternal and paternal half-sib families of seed across three planting densities in an experimental garden. A nested breeding design performed in the greenhouse produced 1,800 F1 seeds sown in the garden. We recorded survivorship, measured phenotypic correlations among and estimated narrow-sense and broad-sense heritabilities (h2) of: days to germination, days to flowering, petal area, ovule number/flower, pollen production/flower, and modal pollen grain volume. Survivorship declined with increasing density, but the relative abundances of surviving families did not differ significantly among densities. Seeds in high-density plots germinated significantly faster than seeds sown in medium- or low-density plots, but they flowered significantly later. Plants in high-density plots had fewer ovules per flower than those in the other treatments. Petal area and pollen characters did not differ significantly among densities. Densities differed with respect to the number and sign of significant phenotypic correlations. Analyses of variance were conducted to detect additive genetic variance (V(a)) of each trait in each density. At low density, there were significant paternal effects on flowering time and modal pollen grain volume; in medium-density plots, germination time, flowering time and ovule number exhibited significant paternal effects; in high-density plots, only pollen grain volume differed among paternal sibships. The ability to detect maternal effects on progeny phenotype also depended on density. Narrow-sense h2 estimates differed markedly among density treatments for germination time, flowering time, ovule number and pollen grain volume. Maternal, paternal and error variance components were estimated for each trait and density to examine the sources of variation in narrow-sense h2 across densities. Variance components did not change consistently across densities; each trait behaved differently. To provide qualitative estimates of genetic correlations between characters, correlation coefficients were estimated using paternal family means; these correlations also differed among densities. These results demonstrate that: a) planting density influences the magnitude of maternal and paternal effects on progeny phenotype, and of h2 estimates, b) traits differ with respect to the density in which heritability is greatest, c) density affects the variance components that comprise heritability, but each trait behaves differently, and d) the response to selection on any target trait should result in different correlated responses of other traits, depending on density.

AB A sagebrush steppe community in northwestern Colorado was disturbed in 1984 and subjected to annual applications of nitrogen and phosphorus, and successional responses were studied over a 5-yr period. Phosphorus was not found to be significant but nitrogen did significantly affect succession for all years except the first. Three seral groups developed on the non-fertilized plots, the first two dominated by annuals and lasting 3 yr, the third transitional and dominated by perennials. The addition of N altered this successional pattern by allowing annuals to remain as site dominants through the 5th yr. Results of this study suggest that dominance of a site by annuals in early stages of secondary succession is related to high nutrient availability.

AB Phylogenetic systematics offers ethologists a method for uncovering macroevolutionary patterns of behavioral diversity, which can be used to generate predictions for experimental investigation of microevolutionary processes. I used phylogenetic methods to disentangle the contributions of various selection pressures in the evolution of sexually dimorphic nuptial coloration in gasterosteid fishes in general, and Gasterosteus aculeatus in particular. Based upon the phylogenetic relationships between breeding colors and breeding behaviors in the gasterosteids, three predictions relevant to a discussion of nuptial coloration in G. aculeatus were proposed. The origin and elaboration of nuptial coloration was (1) weakly associated with male/male interactions (intrasexual selection), (2) moderately associated with parental care (natural selection) and (3) strongly associated with male/female interactions (intersexual selection). I tested the hypothesized macroevolutionary relationships between male breeding color and behavior in two sets of experiments studying changes in male nuptial coloration across the breeding cycle and female choice based on intensity of male color. The results of these experiments at the microevolutionary level of analysis corroborated the macroevolutionary predictions and confirmed the original intuition of previous researchers: male body color intensity is an important component of female mate choice in G. aculeatus. This study demonstrates that a phylogenetic hypothesis can generate predictions that are experimentally testable and falsifiable.

AB The proportion of phenotypic variance in the length of the sexually selected tail of the monogamous barn swallow Hirundo rustica that is attributable to genetic variance was studied in the field in Denmark during a seven-year period. Tail length was on average 20% greater in males than in females. Tail length correlated with wing length, but not with other morphological traits. Tail length increased with the first molt, but remained constant during subsequent years. Changes in tail length between years, owing to molt were significantly affected by sex and by degree of infection with an haematophagous mite (Ornithonyssus bursa). There were significant differences in sexual size dimorphism between years, apparently as a result of environmental conditions in the African winter quarters during molt. Tail length was a highly repeatable morphological trait, and standardization of tail length for age effects only marginally increased repeatability. Heritability of tail length as estimated from regression of values for sons on those of their fathers was 0.59. This suggests that secondary sexual traits affected by strong directional selection still may show a statistically significant heritability.

AB The study reported here investigates the effects of fire intensity and combustion products (ash and char) on shrub and herbaceous seedling emergence in the field in a mixed southern California chaparral, which was dominated by a facultative seeder, Adenostoma fasciculatum, and by an obligate seeder, Ceanothus greggii. Fire effects were studied in two winter bums, one of which was manipulated by adding brush to experimental plots to increase fire intensity.
   Adenostoma was very sensitive to increasing fire intensity, with decreasing seedling production as fire intensity increased. This was detected within the normal range of fire intensities of a winter bum, and to a greater extent when intensities were experimentally modified. Ceanothus germination was either stimulated by, or very resistant to, increasing fire intensity. Increasing fire intensity also promoted earlier germination of Ceanothus. Herb species were also differentially affected by increasing fire intensities. Among the abundant herbs, fire annuals like Phacelia brachyloba were more resistant to increasing fire intensity than opportunistic annuals like Cryptantha muricata. Seedling production of one opportunistic annual, Lotus strigosus, was, however, stimulated by all levels of increased fire intensity. In most cases, ash and char did not affect field germination.
   Fire intensity can profoundly modify seedling production of shrubs and herbs after a fire. By substantially altering post-fire seedling populations, fire intensity may represent a major factor in controlling species composition and diversity in chaparral.

AB (1) High-density populations of Ocimum basilicum L. were grown in sand culture at three nutrient levels to investigate patterns of self-thinning in stands grown over a range of nutrient supply. (2) Populations of Ocimum at each of three nutrient levels showed self-thinning with different biomass-density relationships (thinning lines) for each level. The lines for the stands at the two lower nutrient levels lay below that followed by the stands grown at the high level. Thus competition was more intense in the stands grown at low nutrient levels, when compared at a common plant mass. However, because thinning proceeded fastest in the stands grown at high nutrient supply, competition at a common time was most intense in these stands. (3) It is proposed that the mechanism underlying intensified competition (irrespective of rate of development) is the extent of overlap of resource depletion zones to achieve given plant mass. If this overlap increases at lower resource levels to achieve a given plant mass, competition will intensify at the lower resource levels. However, the rate at which overlap develops at each resource level will determine the intensity of competition when stands are compared in time. (4) Plants of Ocimum from stands grown at lower nutrient levels tended to have less radial extension of the canopy for a given height, and to be shorter and have less radial extension for a given shoot weight. Thus they packed their shoot weight into a smaller canopy volume plant-1 than plants at high nutrient levels. If canopy packing had determined the relative positions of thinning lines, populations grown at low nutrient levels would have followed higher thinning lines than those at high levels. (5) Biomass packing, when measured at the population level, showed the reverse trend, i.e. it was lower in the stands at low nutrient levels. This occurred because of the wider spacing between plants in these stands than in the high-resource stands at a given biomass level. Canopy interactions between plants grown at low nutrient levels were less than in plants grown at high nutrient levels. Thus the major determinant of plant spacing in the stands at low nutrient levels was below rather than above ground. (6) Plants competing for nutrients can increase uptake by increasing the absorbing power of the root, and/or by growing more root. Root and root hair measurements failed to detect any morphological evidence of increased absorbing power in the plants grown at low nutrient levels. (7) Plants at the two lower nutrient levels grew relatively more root (weight and length than those at the high nutrient level. Just under half of this root growth occurred in the top 16% of the soil volume. Root densities achieved were so high that conditions for mutual overlap of depletion zones for mobile nutrients were present. This is taken as evidence that increased overlap of nutrient uptake zones occurred at lower nutrient levels in order for plants to achieve a given mass.

TI FINE LITTER DYNAMICS WITHIN THE TREE CANOPY OF A TROPICAL CLOUD FOREST

AB Fine litter deposition and decomposition within the upper tree canopy was measured in a neotropical cloud forest to determine the potential nutrient input to epiphyte communities from intercepted tree litterfall. A comparable amount of fine litter passed through the canopy (752 g.m-2.yr-1) as arrived on the forest floor (820 g.m-2.yr-1), but < 1% of the biomass and nutrients of this ''gross litterfall'' was retained within the upper tree canopy. The standing crop of litter in the canopy (almost-equal-to 170 g/m2 of branch surface area, 8.8 g/m2 of ground area) is equivalent to only 1% of the standing crop of litter on the forest floor. Measurements of leaf litter attrition (whole leaf loss from branches due to wind and other disturbances) with marked leaves documented that 70% of leaves deposited on branches are lost in the first 2 wk and nearly all are gone in 16 wk. Certain branch characteristics (branch angle, number of epiphyte stems and clumps) appear to affect the amount of litter retained at particular microsites. Decomposition of tethered, dead leaves within the canopy over a 12-mo period was half that of leaves on the forest floor (canopy litter turnover time = 2.8 yr). Assuming that litter accumulation within the canopy is at steady state, the biomass of fine litter retained and decomposed within the canopy was calculated as only 2.0 g.m-2.yr-1 and < 0.02 g.m-2.yr-1 for all nutrients. Nutrient replenishment of epiphyte communities appears to be decoupled from the litter-fall pathway, as input from litterfall retained within the canopy is small relative to epiphyte productivity and nutrient requirements reported in other studies.

AB Sexual cannibalism in orb-weaving spiders commonly takes place before copulation, even among virgin females. This behavior is curious because, although the female may obtain a nutritious meal, she risks remaining unmated. We present an economic model that accounts for sexual cannibalism by virgin females using stochastic dynamic programming. The model considers a female's expected reproductive output (which is a function of the number of copulations she has achieved) and her body size, both of which will depend upon her decision to either mate or cannibalize a courting male. The model demonstrates that cannibalism of courting males by virgin females can arise purely through foraging considerations and that the most important factors for the evolution of this behavior are the expected number of males encountered during the season and the distribution of mass gained from other prey items. The model also suggests a novel form of selection pressure on male body size.

AB I applied an observational approach, using strip transects, to document the abundance and the spatial distributions of members of an assemblage of subtidal fishes (Scorpaeniformes: Cottidae) in the San Juan Islands, Washington, USA. I then assessed the extent to which species-specific distributions were correlated with habitat availability and the potential for interspecific competition to modify patterns of abundance and resource use. The six common cottid species were Artedius fenestralis, A. harringtoni, Asemichthys taylori, Chitonotus pugetensis, Icelinus borealis, and Jordania zonope. A comparison of their observed distributions with the distributions of microhabitats along the transects revealed that all species demonstrated significant affinities for or avoidance of many of the predominant substrates: clean rock, silt rock, shell sand, gravel, mud, and algae. Using a stepwise regression technique, I found that the densities of individual cottid species were significantly correlated with the percentage cover of these substrate types along the transects and with transect depth.
   Several lines of evidence suggest that interspecific competition does not play a strong role in this assemblage. Species pairs that co-occurred on at least some transects did not show disjunct distributions. Microhabitat overlap of these species pairs was higher in sympatry (comparison of transects with both species present) than in allopatry (comparisons of transects with only one species present), counter to the expectation of niche divergence. Correlations of species densities after correcting for habitat heterogeneity with the Schoener-Crowell-Pimm technique revealed only one significant negative density correlation out of thirty potential correlations. Cottid diversity was not correlated with structural diversity along transects in spite of strong associations of each species with habitat structure. This suggests that the transect areas were undersaturated in the number of individuals and/or species of cottid fishes. The apparent lack of competition among subtidal cottids contrasts with studies on intertidal fish communities dominated by cottids for which there is observational evidence of interspecific competition.

AB The adaptive significance of the timing of oviposition in the thistle-feeding lady beetle Epilachna niponica was investigated at two localities (site A and site F) in the northwestern part of Shiga Prefecture, central Japan. I followed cohorts produced over a season and measured four components of lifetime fitness: egg survival, larval survival, female adult survival from emergence to the reproductive season in the following year, and lifetime fecundity. These data are based on mark-recapture data for > 9000 adult beetles and detailed life tables over 5 yr.
   Large variation in lifetime fitness was evident among cohorts within a population, but the two local populations showed a clear difference in patterns of cohort fitness. At site A, cohorts produced early in a season had higher lifetime fitness than later cohorts, whereas at site F, later cohorts (except for the last one) tended to have higher lifetime fitness. The major causes of these between-site differences were seasonal variation in intensity of egg and larval mortalities due to arthropod predation and host plant deterioration.
   Field observations revealed a significant difference in oviposition phenology between the two sites: early reproduction at site A and delayed reproduction at site F. The relatively longer reproductive life-span of females was responsible for the prolonged reproduction at site F. Results of a laboratory experiment that eliminated environmental variables agreed with the field observations, and suggested a genetic basis for the oviposition schedules. Correlation of reproductive pattern at each site with higher lifetime fitness of offspring suggests selection on the timing of oviposition to improve the lifetime reproductive success of females.

AB MtDNAs from 2 protein coding regions comprising 576 base pairs were sequenced from 17 individual sea urchins of the species Strongylocentrotus pallidus collected from the north Pacific and north Atlantic oceans. Twelve of 17 individual sequences were identical. Two of these were further sequenced in a third, 441 base pair region, and were also found to be identical. We show how to interpret these results using a simplified Markov model of mtDNA evolution at silent sites. The model was calibrated using 3 urchin species with a published fossil record, and shows that identical S. pallidus mtDNAs in different oceans shared a common ancestor at most 90,000-150,000 years ago (95% confidence interval of upper limit of divergence). The Markov model, used to examine patterns of genetic distance within and between species, shows unexpected variation in the rate of base substitution. The rate of change of G's at fourfold sites is nearly 20 times greater than the rate of change of C's. At twofold sites, this range is less extreme, although purines consistently have a higher rate of change than pyrimidines. Striking genetic similarity and recent genetic exchange between oceans for these urchins is in marked contrast to most other trans-Arctic marine populations, which usually show morphological and genetic differentiation at the species or subspecies level. Recent fossil evidence shows that the north Atlantic and northeastern Pacific have been the scene of radical faunal changes during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The genetic results presented here extend this conclusion to intraspecific patterns of genetic variability, and direct attention to the northwest Pacific where higher productivity and less environmental change may have left a heritage of greater marine genetic diversity.

AB The self-compatible orchid Microtis parviflora is pollinated by the flightless worker caste of the ant Iridomyrmex gracilis. The orchid is clonal and forms small patches, usually less than 1 m2, of disconnected individual ramets. Ant pollinators visited and revisited a limited proportion of available inflorescences, and 40% of all flower visits occurred within plants promoting self-pollination. Pollen labels indicated that self-pollination accounted for 51% of the pollen transfers, although pollen carryover extended beyond 16 flowers on 2 or 3 inflorescences. The distribution of ant movements between plants was leptokurtic with a mean of 12.4 +/- 14.9 cm and a maximum of 89 cm, but a high proportion of movements were within clones accentuating the level of self-pollination. However, some pollen transfers between inflorescences of unlike genotypes contributed to a low incidence (max = 8%) of outcrossing. In 12 patches examined by electrophoresis, the density varied from 11 to 61 inflorescences per m2 and a maximum of only 4 genotypes were detected. Electrophoretic analysis revealed populations were highly inbred: only 23% (N = 17) of the loci were polymorphic and the mean gene diversity h, was 2.7%. Heterozygotes were observed in only one population given a mean fixation index f, of 0.982. These results reflect the combined effects of restricted ant foraging and clonality. Nevertheless, while ant foraging was restricted, some outcrossing occurred and in the absence of clonality it is likely that ant foraging would have yielded a mixed mating system similar to those reported for a wide array of insect pollinators. Given the ability of ants to generate pollen flow, the reasons for the rarity of ant pollination appear to lie elsewhere.

AB Natural densities of common stream-dwelling harpacticoid copepods, Attheyella spp., reduced the density and biomass and increased the area-specific and cell-specific production of detritally associated bacteria. Bacterial density was reduced by as much as 58% and rod-shaped bacteria were reduced as much as 27%. Attheyella selectively removed larger rod-shaped bacteria. This resulted in a significant change in the size-frequency distribution of rod-shaped bacteria and a decrease in median cell length by 17-30%. The removal of larger sized cells by Attheyella probably contributed to the observed reduction in bacterial biomass. With copepods present, bacterial biomass was reduced as much as 45%. Estimated rates of ingestion of bacterial carbon by copepods are comparable to values for marine harpacticoids. Bacterial biomass appears to be a more important food source to microdetritivores than to macrodetritivores in streams.

AB We examined environmental effects on the correlation between age and size at metamorphosis in spadefoot toad tadpoles (Scaphiopus multiplicatus). These tadpoles occur in ponds of variable duration as two environmentally induced, trophic morphs: a large, rapidly developing carnivore morph and a smaller, more slowly developing omnivore morph. Drawing on data from both natural ponds and artificial pools we examined for both morphs the environmental determinants of, and the intercorrelations among, three life history parameters: age at metamorphosis, size at metamorphosis, and survivorship (both pre- and postmetamorphic). Censuses of four natural ponds revealed that age and size at metamorphosis for both morphs were inversely related, in contrast to many other amphibians and insects with complex life cycles. In artificial pools in which we simultaneously varied two diet components and pond duration, age and size at metamorphosis were negatively correlated in high food treatments and positively correlated in low food, long pond duration treatments. Ephemeral larval habitats should favor rapid differentiation; achieving large body size depends upon the quality and quantity of available food and the time available to develop. A negative relationship between age and size at metamorphosis may occur often in S. multiplicatus since this species is exposed to a rapidly diminishing food resource (anostracans). We predict that other organisms with complex life cycles faced with these conditions would possess an inverse relationship between size and age at metamorphosis.

AB Indirect predator-prey interactions have been suggested to be important in a variety of communities. However, we still understand little about the factors determining the relative importance of indirect and direct effects of predation or what forms indirect predator-prey interactions may take. We examined the direct effects of predation by an omnivorous grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio, and the indirect effects for prey species of interactions between this shrimp and other predators in an estuarine benthic community. Direct and indirect effects of predation were examined in the field using a combination of large- and small-scale enclosure/exclosure experiments. Specific interactions and mechanisms of effects were examined in laboratory predation studies, utilizing both two-species and multi-species systems.
   Grass shrimp predation reduced the densities of a variety of benthic fauna, but the effects varied seasonally and with prey size. Interactions between grass shrimp and other predators took two forms: reduction of an infaunal predator by shrimp predation and predation on grass shrimp by fish. Both types of interactions had a mixed effect on lower trophic levels, with enhancement of certain benthic prey and no effect on other species. Interactions between grass shrimp and their fish predators resulted in changes in shrimp distribution independent of changes in shrimp abundance, creating spatial refugia for shrimp prey. The dynamics of indirect interactions in this community are strongly affected by the omnivorous nature of the major predators. Our results emphasize the general importance of omnivory in regulating predator-prey interactions and in predicting the relative importance of indirect predator effects.

AB This study illustrates the physiological and biochemical responses to temperature of maternal phenotypes of plants of Echinochloa crus-galli that result in different progeny phenotypes. Our results provide a physiological scenario that accounts for strong, nongenetic, maternal effects. At low temperature, the photosynthetic rates of flag,leaves were reduced, while concentrations of sugars and starch were increased. These physiological modifications suggest reduced phloem translocation to the reproductive structures in plants grown under cold conditions. At high temperature, high respiration rates of inflorescences were observed during seed development. To offset the effect of ear (fruit) respiration, mother-plants grown under warm conditions would have to translocate some 30% more carbohydrates than at low temperature. Our study therefore suggests that environmentally induced modifications in simple physiological traits can account for an important reduction in resources available to reproduction. Changes in leaf starch, reducing sugars, and protein contents induced by temperature persist through the life of a second generation of plants. Biochemical modifications due to maternal effects may influence overall plant performance. For example, the higher protein concentration of seedlings grown from cold-matured seeds may enhance their cold tolerance.

AB Response surfaces describing the empirical dependence of surface pollen percentages of 13 taxa on three standard climatic variables (mean July temperature, mean January temperature, and mean annual precipitation) in eastern North America were used to infer past climates from palynological data. Inferred climates at 3000-yr intervals from 18 000 years ago to the present, based on six taxa (spruce, birch, northern pines, oak, southern pines, and prairie forbs), were used to generate time series of simulated isopoll maps for these taxa and seven others (hickory, fir, beech, hemlock, elm, alder, and sedge). The simulations captured the essential features of the observed isopoll maps for both sets of taxa, including differences in migration patterns during the past 10000 yr that have previously been attributed to differential migration lag. These results establish that the continental-scale vegetation patterns have responded to continuous changes in climate from the last glacial maximum to the present, with lags less-than-or-equal-to 1500 yr. The inferred climatic changes include seasonality changes consistent with orbitally controlled changes in insolation, and shifts in temperature and moisture gradients that are consistent with modelled climatic interactions of the insolation changes with the shrinking Laurentide ice sheet. These results pose new ecological questions about the processes by which vegetated landscapes approach dynamic equilibrium with their changing environment.

TI SENESCENCE IN NATURAL-POPULATIONS OF MAMMALS - A COMPARATIVE-STUDY
SO EVOLUTION
LA English
DT Article
DE MAMMALS; MORTALITY RATES; SENESCENCE
AB Here, I use published mortality data from 56 natural populations of mammals to examine evidence for senescence, an increase in the probability of mortality with age. Data on extent of senescence and life history characteristics are compared across taxa in an attempt to test theories for the evolution of senescence in natural populations. In accord with theoretical expectation, senescence is highest in short-lived species with short generation times. In contrast to theoretical expectation, however, senescent increases in mortality rate do not begin until well after age at maturity in most cases. I also present evidence in support of the hypothesis that senescence will be lower in large-brained taxa.

AB Offspring from half-sib and full-sib families of the hard clam, Mercenaria mercenaria were reared in five locations along the Atlantic Coast to test for the presence of genotype-environment interaction for juvenile growth rate. Location effects upon growth rate variation were prevalent; of the genetic effects, the additive genetic by location variance was predominant with the nonadditive genetic by location component contributing to a lesser degree to the interaction variance. The additive and nonadditive variation over all environments was negligible. Genotype-environment interaction was found to be at least partially due to a change in the amount of genetic variation expressed at each location; with significant additive variation detected at Charleston and Georgetown, SC sites and significant nonadditive variation at Millsboro, DE. Genetic covariance/correlation analysis indicated that reversals in relative family performance across locations were prevalent, implying the possibility of habitat specialization among genotypes. In addition, graphical analysis produced no evidence of a ubiquitously superior genotype. These analyses suggest that genotype-environment interaction should act to constrain the evolution of juvenile growth rate in Mercenaria, preserve any heritable variation associated with this trait and may lead to the development of phenotypic plasticity for growth.

AB (1) Time of reproduction in Oenothera biennis was controlled experimentally by gibberellic acid applications in a glasshouse experiment. Performance of vegetative plants and plants reproducing at various ages was compared by means of growth analysis. (2) Regardless of age, reproduction increased stem allocation and decreased root and leaf allocation. Early reproduction reduced growth relative to vegetative plants, while late reproduction had no effect on growth in the long term and enhanced growth in the short term. Seed output increased with age at reproduction up to a point after which there was little change. (3) The reduced growth of plants reproducing at an early age was due to a decrease in leaf area ratio, and the enhanced growth of older plants to a temporary increase. Specific leaf area in older plants increased with reproduction, temporarily over-compensating for the decrease in leaf allocation. There was a temporary increase in unit leaf rate in plants reproducing at a young age but not in plants reproducing at a late age. (4) Changes in specific leaf area were the result of a switch in leaf morphology between vegetative and reproductive plants. Vegetative plants produced leaves with petioles which increased in length with age. This morphology minimized self-shading in the vegetative rosettes. Leaves produced after reproduction had short petioles and, consequently, a higher specific leaf area. Plants reproducing at an early age produced few new leaves and exhibited little change in specific leaf area. (5) It is suggested that the beneficial effects of reproduction on canopy structure and photosynthesis that are observed in many species can compensate for the cost of reproduction, providing the accumulated nutrient reserves are sufficient to supply the reproductive structures.

AB Root(1988b) proposed that a physiological limit on metabolic rate constrains the northern distributions of wintering birds. Thermoregulation requires that metabolic rate increase as temperature declines, and hence a ceiling on metabolism that is reached before food or other factors become limiting would set the northern extent of a species distribution.
   I compared data with two predictions stemming from the proposal. First, there should be close correspondence between the northern range boundaries of species and temperature isotherms. To test this, I re-evaluated the data and found that only 8-42% of the species that Root classified as limited by temperature had northern range boundaries that corresponded to particular temperature isotherms. The second prediction examined was new: Species' northern limits should scale to body mass, because the ceiling on metabolism is stated as a multiple of basal metabolic rate, which itself scales to body mass. Large species should extend farther north than small species. A test of the prediction using Root's data showed little evidence that a constraint strongly affects the distributions of birds. In a second test, I analyzed additional recent Christmas Bird Counts that include areas farther north than were available to Root. I found that species of all sizes occur at the lowest temperatures, indicating that a ceiling on metabolism does not generally constrain the distributions of birds wintering in North America.
   My analysis turned up one other unexpected result: Few large passerines in North America have northern distribution boundaries that occur in warm, southerly areas, whereas as small species have northern distribution boundaries in southern as well as in northern areas. The pattern might reflect the relationship between body size and the size of a species' geographic range coupled with the geography of North America. Large species tend to have only large geographic ranges, whereas small species are not so restricted. The avifauna of North America north of Mexico is bounded by a barrier formed by the Gulf of Mexico and a turnover in avifauna between the United States and Mexico. To the north of such a barrier, the northern distribution boundaries of large species should be well away from the barrier because of their large size.

   SELECTION
AB Behavior is a major component of growth rate variation in fish, but the genetic relationship between behavior and growth is largely unknown. In particular, it is not known how behavior responds to natural or artificial selection on growth. It has been argued that artificial selection for fast growth in competitive environments might lead to higher levels of overall aggression, and therefore there would be no net gain in assimilation efficiency or growth. The contrary has also been argued. It is not immediately obvious, therefore, whether fish that avoid interacting with conspecifics should grow faster, or whether more aggressive, dominant individuals should grow faster. In the present study, we artificially selected fish on the basis of growth in two environments that differed in the intensity of social interactions. In the high interaction environment (HI), food was provided to excess inside a floating cork ring, which limited access to the food and allowed fish to attempt to monopolize the food supply. In the low interaction environment (LI), an equivalent amount of food was spread over the container's surface. In each social environment, fish were selected within family for fast and for slow growth rate during two generations (G1 and G2). The response was measured in the third generation (G3) on the directly selected trait (growth) and on a correlated trait (agonistic behavior). The magnitude of the direct response to selection on growth in medaka was directly related to population density, i.e., selection was most effective at high densities. Agonistic behavior was inversely related to growth when individuals were raised and selected in an environment where enforced social interaction took place, so long as food was not limited in quantity.

AB Carex exilis occurs in bogs and fens along the Atlantic coast, but only in fens in the midcontinent. I experimentally tested five hypotheses explaining this pattern. Reciprocal transplants were made, and no differences were found among populations, implying that there are no bog-adapted ecotypes. Instead, C. exilis growth and reproduction depended most on conditions under which plants were grown. Plants from all populations studied could complete their life cycle in coastal bogs, coastal fens, and midcontinental fens, but not in midcontinental bogs. Greenhouse experiments showed that salinity and acidity had no significant effect on germination and growth; increased nutrient supply and water table level did. Seedlings of C. exilis grew vigorously on peat from a midcontinental bog when the water table was kept artificially near the moss surface, but most died when the water table was at its natural level, 20 cm or more below the moss surface. The water table of coastal bogs is normally high. Water level affected competition for light between Sphagnum moss and C. exilis seedlings. Under the drier conditions of midcontinental bogs, Sphagnum overgrew the seedlings; under wetter conditions typical of coastal bogs, seedlings grew faster than Sphagnum, and coexisted with the moss.

TI ENERGETIC CONSTRAINTS AND SIZE-BASED TACTICS - THE ADAPTIVE SIGNIFICANCE
   OF BREEDING-SCHEDULE VARIATION IN A MARINE FISH (EMBIOTOCIDAE,
   MICROMETRUS-MINIMUS)
SO AMERICAN NATURALIST
LA English

AB Female breeding schedules in the viviparous dwarf surfperch (Micrometrus minimus) vary systematically with size: small females conceive and bear young later in the season than large females. We test two general hypotheses for this pattern: (1) energy reserves impose a proximate energetic constraint on the timing of reproduction, and thus small females breed late because they carry less stored energy: (2) small females postpone reproduction as an adaptive size-specific tactic to maximize reproductive success. The hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, and both appear to apply to the dwarf surfperch. Among yearling fish, those that conceive their broods early in the season do so at higher reserve levels than females that breed late in the season. Late breeding places less demand on stored energy, and postponement enables individuals with low initial reserves to breed without drawing energy stores down to lethal low levels. However, lipid reserves do not explain all of the size-based variation in breeding schedule. In fish of both age classes, small size causes a delay in breeding, independent of lipid reserves. This is consistent with our second hypothesis, that small females postpone as a tactic. A potential tactical payoff is offspring number because females grow throughout gestation, and fecundity increases with size, larger broods can be produced by delaying conception. We show that small females realize greater proportional increases in fecundity for equal delays in breeding.

AB We used 3 x 2 x 2 factorial experiments in a temporary pond to assess the relative importance of predator density (0, 2, or 4 salamander larvae), prey density (20 or 40 tadpoles), and time of prey introduction (early or late) on interactions between predaceous larval salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) and their anuran prey (Pseudacris triseriata). We examined how these factors and their interactions affected mass at metamorphosis, length of larval period, growth rate, and survival. These experiments demonstrated the effect of body size on predator-prey interactions by manipulating time of introduction of size-structured prey in a system with a gape-limited predator.
   Microhabitat differences in primary productivity, sources of predation other than salamanders, and abiotic factors were important determinants of community structure. High levels of salamander predation negatively affected tadpole survival, but affected no other response variable. We detected no density-dependent effects in either taxon. Tadpoles in the early treatment had longer larval periods and lower survival rates than those in the late treatment. Interactions of factors, including time of introduction, were common. Biotic and abiotic factors differentially affecting growth of predator or prey appear to be responsible for these differences.
   Priority effects in arrival to breeding sites, or climatic events affecting the growth rate of predator, prey, or both, play a role in determining community structure. Interactions of factors complicate the predator-prey relationship. In our experiment, the effects of time of introduction are highly correlated with body size in the two temporal treatments. Our results indicate that more realistic models of predator-prey systems, or population dynamics, should incorporate size structure of predator and prey.

AB We tested the hypothesis that spatial scale of investigation has an effect on the probability of detecting density dependence in the field. Specifically, we examined parasitism rates by two different parasites of one host (the salt-marsh planthopper Prokelisia) with different dispersal capabilities. One parasite, the wasp Anagrus, attacked host eggs and flew widely over the marsh, traveling on the order of kilometres. The other, the strepsipteran Elenchus, parasitized host nymphs and adults. Females of this parasite cannot fly, and dispersal is by triungulinid nymphs, which walk on host plants and can only disperse on the order of metres from their spent maternal corpse. We found no dispersing planthoppers to be carrying Elenchus. We expected no density dependence by Elenchus on a large scale, that is, over an area of 1-2 km2 but possibly some evidence of density dependence on a small scale, that is, within a few metres. By similar logic, we expected Anagrus perhaps to show density dependence at both scales because it disperses so well.
   Parasitism rate by both insect species varied widely both in space, even between adjacent sites, and through time. We found little evidence of density dependence for either type of parasite at any spatial or temporal scale. Failure to detect density dependence may be due less to the effect of looking at the wrong spatial scale than to the idiosyncratic behavior of individual parasite species.

AB The interaction between two species is usually assigned as though they were in isolation from all other species. Here we use a (known) method that determines species interactions more realistically, within the framework of the community to which they belong. This ''inverse'' method evaluates all the effects that one species experiences from another, both direct and indirect. We use this method to study the classical (though highly controversial) ''competition community,'' where each species is considered (in the ''isolated pair'' approach) to suffer from the presence of every other. The model we use takes account of the fluctuations in interaction coefficients that one must expect in the real world, both from one species pair to another, and as the effect of ambient environmental variations.
   Remarkably, the ''inverse'' method finds that generally a high proportion (20-40%) of the interactions must be beneficial, or ''advantageous,'' when not lifted out of the community context in which they actually occur. The contrary case, called here ''hypercompetitive,'' in which each species suffers from every other species, can occur only if the environment is nearly constant, and the species closely akin to each other, with both of these conditions holding and persisting to a degree that must be considered implausible.
   The results of the model remain valid, even after incorporating a number of major structural modifications, thus indicating robustness in its predictions. We survey the available field data and show that they are in good general agreement with the conclusions reached, on the high proportion of interactions which must be ''Advantageous in a Community Context'' (ACC).

DT Article
AB (1) Vertical mat movement in relation to surface-water fluctuations was measured for 1 year at three marshes differing in dominant emergent vegetation and location in the Mississippi River delta plain of coastal Louisiana, U.S.A. (2) The freshwater marsh, dominated by Panicum hemitomon, floated directly with ambient water levels, provided they were high enough to float the mat. Water levels varied by c. 70 cm and mat movement by 55 cm. An intermediate-salinity marsh closer to the Gulf of Mexico and dominated by Sagittaria falcata moved 35 cm vertically during the study period, and water levels moved 70 cm. A brackish marsh. dominated by Spartina patens, moved only 3 cm in response to c. 40 cm of vertical water movement. (3) The freshwater marsh floated throughout the year, provided ambient water levels were high enough, and mat movement followed water-level movement directly (r2 = 0.97). In contrast, the intermediate marsh exhibited seasonal buoyancy. In the summer and early autumn, this marsh responded to water-level oscillations directly (r2 = 0.94,). It was the least buoyant in late winter (r2 = 0.29). (4) Mat movement reflected differences between marshes in substrate bulk density, mineral density and degree of decomposition. The shallow substrate of the two fresher marshes, which could respond directly to water levels, contained almost no mineral sediment (9% by dry weight at the fresh site and 17% at the intermediate). whereas the brackish marsh, which showed only small fluctuations relative to water movement, contained almost 50% mineral sediment by weight. The fresh marsh had the most fibric substrate in the upper 30 cm; the organic substrate material became progressively more decomposed with proximity to the Gulf of Mexico and with depth.

TI AGE-SPECIFIC WEANING SUCCESS OF NORTHERN ELEPHANT SEALS IN RELATION TO

AB We studied the effect of age and previous breeding experience on the probability of successful reproduction in female northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris). Reproductive data, collected over a 12-yr period, were analyzed by multiple logistic regression to describe the functional relationships among the variables. We also examined the relationships among age, experience, date of breeding, and reproductive success to determine if differences in timing explain age-specific productivity. Finally, we investigated the relationship among age, experience, and maternal behavior to determine if correlates of reproductive effort could be related to age- and experience-specific patterns of reproductive success.
   Reproductive success increased between the maternal ages of 3 and 7 yr and then levelled off, demonstrating an asymptotic relationship. However, the relationship between reproductive success and age, after statistically controlling for previous experience, showed instead that success increased linearly throughout an animal's lifetime. In contrast, after statistically controlling for age, reproductive success was related to experience in a parabolic fashion; success increased with experience for the first few breeding attempts, but declined later in an animal's reproductive lifetime. The effects of experience depended on age: among young animals experience was apparently beneficial, but among old animals greater experience was deleterious. These results suggest experience-related senescence. Timing of breeding was related to experience, rather than age, in a curvilinear fashion; arrival and parturition dates were later for inexperienced and very experienced females, and were earliest for moderately experienced animals. Young animals that gave birth later in the season experienced reduced reproductive success; we observed no such decline in older animals. Thus, among young females, arriving and giving birth earlier each year was adaptive. Aggressiveness and dominance increased with age and experience, but we were unable to separate the effects of age and experience.
   We contend that the experience-related drop in reproductive success reflects the cost of reproduction. Breeding at a young age and/or continuously appears to result in lower reproductive success later in life. Furthermore, curvature in age-specific reproductive success can be explained by experience-related senescence. This result has general applicability, suggesting that age-related senescence instead may be due to reproductive ''burn-out.'' These results indicate that previous breeding experience and differences in individual quality do not explain the pattern of increasing reproductive success with age in northern elephant seals, and provide indirect support for the hypothesis that animals increase reproductive effort as they age to offset a concomitant decrease in residual reproductive value.

AB Few experimental studies of mating behavior have examined mating behavior shifts in response to ecological factors (e.g., predators, starvation). We conducted experiments designed to: (1) examine multiple trade-offs between predator avoidance, feeding behavior, and copulation duration in a semiaquatic insect (Microvelia austrina); and (2) address the influence of altered copulation duration on male reproductive success. To examine multiple trade-offs, we used a 2 x 2 factorial design where we measured the amount of time that mating microveliids remained in tandem, for starved and fed microveliids in the presence and absence of predaceous water striders (Gerris remigis). We also looked at the effects of presence vs. absence of green sunfish (Lepomis cyanellus) on microveliid tandem duration. To address the impact of premature pair separation on male mating success, we separated paired microveliids in field populations and measured the time required for each sex to find new mates. To examine the effects of local sex ratio on remating times of males and females, we quantified the sex ratio of field populations via periodic censuses and correlated local sex ratio with remating times. Finally, to address oviposition rates while pairs are in tandem, we measured female oviposition patterns relative to tandem duration for poorly fed and well-fed females.
   Both starvation and gerrid presence significantly reduced tandem duration. As a result of male-biased sex ratios, males that prematurely separated from females often faced long search times before securing a new mate. Females oviposited at a constant rate while in tandem. A simple computer simulation incorporating the above observations suggests that reductions in tandem duration can decrease fertilization rates.

AB The herbivorous sea slug Placida dendritica (Gastropoda: Opisthobranchia: Ascoglossa) formed feeding groups on the coenocytic green algae Codium setchellii and C fragile, but not on the related green alga Bryopsis corticulans. The trophic implications of Placida congregation were examined in a series of laboratory experiments. The effect of group membership on Placida growth depended on the number and relative sizes of individuals in the group. Members of Placida congregations composed of similar-sized individuals grew significantly faster than single individuals. In mixed-sized congregations, however, trophic benefits were not shared equally among all members. Small slugs always benefited from the presence of conspecifics, small or large; large slugs, however, benefited only if conspecifics were comparable in size. Small Placida tended to reduce the growth rate of large conspecifics. Although the mechanisms of intraspecific facilitation and competition among group members were only partially elucidated, a slug's feeding not only stimulated other group members to feed but also modified algal condition, enhancing feeding and growth of conspecifics.

TI SHADE AS A CAUSE OF THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE CACTUS
   NEOBUXBAUMIA-TETETZO AND THE NURSE PLANT MIMOSA-LUISANA IN THE TEHUACAN
   VALLEY, MEXICO
SO JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article

AB (1) The establishment phase of Neobuxbumia tetetzo, a giant columnar cactus dominant in the Tehuacan Valley in central-southern Mexico, occurs mostly beneath the canopies of trees and shrubs which act as nurse plants. This pattern cannot be attributed to preferential seed dispersion, as Neobuxbaumia fruits open while still on the plant, dropping c. 1000 seeds fruit-1 randomly around the parent plant. (2) An experimental field analysis of germination and survivorship of cohorts under different environmental conditions was performed in order to determine the underlying mechanisms associated to the establishment of N. tetetzo beneath the canopies of Mimosa Iuisana, a legume which is the most abundant shrub in the community. The experimental treatments followed a factorial design, with three levels of radiation (open space, artificial homogeneous shade and the shade produced by Mimosa luisana), two levels of predation (exclusion and non-exclusion of predators), and four topographic aspects (north, east, south and west). (3) Seed germination was lowest in open spaces. In all treatments, exclusion from predators significantly increased seedling survival. Only the shaded treatments had live individuals at the end of the experiment, 2 years later. The results suggest that the nurse-plant effect between Neobuxbalumia tetetzo and Mimosa luisana is chiefly the result of differential survival in shaded microsites with less direct solar radiation, and consequently with lower daytime temperatures and lower evaporative demand. (4) In order to determine the generality of these results, field samplings were conducted in two Mexican deserts located outside the tropical belt: the Vizcaino Desert in Baja California and the Gran Desierto de Altar in Sonora. In these deserts direct solar radiation has a southern azimuth all year round. Five of six succulent species analysed showed a significant pattern of greater establishment on the shaded north sides of nurse plants. (5) The amelioration of the physical environment produced by the nurse plants is important in the patch-structurated population dynamics of many communities of desert plants.

AB A natural landscape gradient of P-deficient pocosin (evergreen shrub bog) and bay forest ecosystems was used to test three hypotheses concerning P availability and P reabsorption efficiency: (1) that variations in vegetation height and aboveground biomass among even-aged pocosin stands are related to variations in soil P availability; (2) that microbial processes control P availability in these soils; and (3) that the proportion of P reabsorbed from senescing foliage in native plants is inversely related to soil P availability.
   The natural gradient from short pocosin to bay forest was found to represent a gradient of increasing P availability, as indicated by increases in: (1) total P in surface (0-15 cm) soils, from 19.6 to 118.3 kg/ha; (2) seasonal and annual PO43- supply to in situ anion-exchange resins; and (3) P concentrations in native plant foliage. Increases in P availability were accompanied by a significant decline in the N:P ratios of both plant leaves and surface soils.
   Microbial processes strongly influenced the supply of available P. Soil microorganisms immobilized up to 90% of added (PO43-)-P-32 during laboratory incubations, but when microbial uptake was inhibited, as much as 90% of added (PO43-)-P-32 remained in the available pool. A decline in the ratio of microbial: total P in surface soils, from 56.3 to 37.4%, and an increase in the ratio of net: gross P mineralization (estimated by isotope dilution), suggested that as P availability increased, microbial control decreased.
   Native plants reabsorbed both P and N efficiently from senescing foliage, reaching maxima of 86.6 and 80.5%, respectively; natural variations in soil P availability did not affect the proportion of either nutrient reabsorbed. In general, however, plants tended to reabsorb greater proportions of foliar P than N.
   Natural variations in P availability, the factors controlling P availability in these soils, and the potential for differential nutrient reabsorption by native plants have important implications for the cycling and accumulation of P and N in pocosin and bay forest soils. Landscape-level processes may have contributed to the observed variations in vegetation and P availability along this natural gradient.

AB The Island Fox, Urocyon littoralis, is a dwarf form found on six of the Channel Islands located 30-98 km off the coast of southern California. The island populations differ in two variables that affect genetic variation: effective population size and duration of isolation. We estimate that the effective population size of foxes on the islands varies from approximately 150 to 1,000 individuals. Archeological and geological evidence suggests that foxes likely arrived on the three northern islands minimally 10,400-16,000 years ago and dispersed to the three southern islands 2,200-4,300 years ago. We use morphometrics, allozyme electrophoresis, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) restriction-site analysis, and analysis of hypervariable minisatellite DNA to measure variability within and distances among island fox populations. The amount of within-population variation is lowest for the smallest island populations and highest for the mainland population. However, the larger populations are sometimes less variable, with respect to some genetic measures, than expected. No distinct trends of variability with founding time are observed. Genetic distances among the island populations, as estimated by the four techniques, are not well correlated. The apparent lack of correspondence among techniques may reflect the effects of mutation rate and colonization history on the values of each genetic measure.

AB This study documents evolutionary modifications in mechanisms of gastrulation in Heliocidaris erythrogramma, an echinoid with lecithotrophic larvae. Radially symmetrical cell rearrangements and changes in cell shape drive elongation of the archenteron in the ancestral mode of echinoid gastrulation. Cell marking experiments indicate that in H. erythrogramma, however, prolonged movement of cells over the ventral lip of the blastopore accompanies extension of the archenteron. Evolutionary modifications to archenteron extension in H. erythrogramma thus include utilization of a different type of cellular movement as well as the imposition of dorsoventral asymmetry in cellular movements. The conservation of gastrulation mechanisms among phylogenetically divergent echinoids with planktotrophic development suggests that the plesiomorphic condition has persisted at least 250 million years and perhaps much longer. Yet H. erythrogramma diverged from an ancestor with planktotrophic development only about 10 mya, indicating that morphogenetic mechanisms of early development can undergo substantial evolutionary changes, even after long periods of stasis.

AB (1) One- to six-year-old natural seedlings of Abies amabilis, Tsuga heterophylla and T. mertensiana were collected from 15-cm-deep volcanic tephra deposited beneath a surviving tree canopy during the 1980 eruption of Mount St Helens, Washington, U.S.A. Seedling dimensions and architecture were measured and dry weights of leaves, stem and roots determined as loss-on-ignition. (2) Abies seedlings were heavier than Tsuga initially, with deeper and more-complex roots; however, biomasses of Abies and Tsuga seedlings became more similar with time. Height above the cotyledons was similar in older seedlings of the two genera, but branching began earlier in Tsuga than in Abies. (3) Tsuga had a higher relative growth rate than Abies, with both greater leaf-biomass ratio and greater assimilation efficiency. Leaf allocation of Abies exceeded that of Tsuga at first, but eventually became less than that of Tsuga. (4) Most measures of size decreased for Tsuga as canopy cover increased; for Abies, only the amount of root branching declined. As litter increased, root dimensions of both genera declined, but biomass of Tsuga increased whereas that of Abies decreased. Abies seemed less affected by both shade and limited soil moisture than Tsuga. (5) Seedling growth rate and allocation appear to be important in deter-mining the types of micro-environments in which the two genera can establish, and thus may affect long-term stand dynamics. Root characteristics differentiated taxa more clearly than those of shoots.

AB We investigate Pollen-mediated gene dispersal within a natural population of poke milkweed, Asclepias exaltata. We use paternity exclusion analysis with seven polymorphic isozymes to quantify pollen dispersal among plants in the population. Realized gene dispersal via pollen is much greater than potential gene flow inferred from pollinator flight distances between plants but is similar to a random distribution based on all interplant distances. Extensive pollen carryover due to the unique pollination system of the plants and the behavior of their large butterfly pollinators may explain the extensive pollen movement in the population. There was no evidence of an "optimal outcrossing distance" in this population. Matings between genetically similar plants resulted in reduced seed-set and seed viability within fruits, but genetic similarity between mating pairs was independent of the spatial distance separating them. Thus, extensive gene dispersal via pollen creates a large neighborhood size in milkweeds that may prevent genetic structure in small local populations, a prerequisite for optimal outcrossing distances to exist.

AB A model similar to the single-species source-sink models developed by Pulliam and by Pulliam and Danielson is described for species that have "distinct" habitat preferences and preemptive occupation of sites within habitats. The model shows that the interactions between two species do not result solely from the intrinsic properties of the species involved. They are also functions of the landscape in which the species occur. One species may cause an increase (facilitation) in the equilibrium population size of another species if the high-quality source habitat for the second species is rare relative to the abundance of low-quality sink habitat. A species may inhibit another if the second species' source habitat is abundant. Combinations of facilitation and inhibition effects describe the interactions between two species. There are two sets of possible interactions for any landscape of two habitat types. These are [(-, +), (-, -), (+, -)} and {(-, +), (+, +), (+, -)}. Species for which individuals can sample a large number of sites are likely to exhibit one of the interactions in the first set. Species for which individuals sample only a few sites are likely to exhibit interactions from the second. Within each set of interactions, the relative abundances of each habitat will determine which interaction will occur in the landscape.

AB Very few ecological studies have attempted to fully test the integrative role of abiotic and biotic factors in interspecific interactions. There is little if any dispute about the value of such an approach in community ecology. However, there is great disagreement over the present direction of the field; we advocate a reemphasis of the integrative role of abiotic and biotic factors. By using literature examples and data on the role of salinity in reversing the competitive relations between fish of the genus Lucania, we have suggested a reemphasis on these interactions. This represents a blend of the traditional fields of ecology, physiology, and toxicology and could facilitate progress in community ecology. As such it could also be a significant part of the new direction sought for the field of physiological ecology. Finally, we are not arguing that abiotic parameters are necessarily more important than any of a group of multiple factors that may be involved in regulating community structure, only that they must be included as possible controlling variables in any complete study.

AB Spatial variation in the resistance structure of Linum marginale (wild flax) populations to the rust fungus Melampsora lini, and in the racial structure of this pathogen, was investigated by sampling 10 populations distributed throughout the Kosciusko National Park, New South Wales, Australia.  Considerable differences were found among populations in the structure of both host and pathogen.  Host populations were divided into three broad categories:  (1) populations susceptible to all testing races; (2) populations containing a strictly limited number of resistant phenotypes; and (3) populations with a considerable diversity of resistant phenotypes.  The pathogen populations also showed a range of diversity.  The major differences between these populations were determined by the occurrence and frequency of four common races of pathogen (races A, E, K, and N).  These differences were apparent both at a regional spatial scale (over the 100 km separation of the most distant populations) and at a local scale where major differences were detected between two populations only 300 m apart.  The distribution of the four common races of M. lini was consistent with the hypothesis that a fitness cost was associated with unnecessary virulence.  In general, however, differences in the structure of pathogen populations from genetically very similar host populations implied that, in addition to host resistance genes, other evolutionary forces are also important in determining the genetic structure of individual pathogen populations.

AB To maximize net gain of a tree, leaves must be replaced when net gain of a leaf per unit time over the leaf's life span is maximum. A model in which leaf longevity is determined to maximize the net gain of a leaf per unit time is constructed. The model predicts that leaf longevity is short when initial net photosynthetic rate of the leaf is large, long when the construction cost of the leaf is large, and short when the decrease in net photosynthetic rate with time is large. The model describes leaf habit (deciduousness and evergreenness) with the length of the favorable period for photosynthesis within a year and simulates distributional pattern of leaf habit along latitudes. The percentages of evergreenness decrease with decreasing favorable-period length and reach the minimum at an intermediate length of the favorable period but increase again with a decrease in the length of the favorable period. A bimodal distributional pattern with two peaks, one at lower and the other at higher latitudes, is observed for the percentages of evergreenness. Percentages of deciduousness show a unimodal distribution pattern with a peak at midlatitude.

AB Computer simulations of clines (Brues, 1972; Endler, 1977) as well as theoretical arguments (Nagylaki, 1975), have shown that steps in gene frequencies will be pulled to partial barriers (areas of reduced gene flow) if they form within approximately a cline width of the partial barrier.
   The behavior of a hybrid zone between two chromosomal taxa ("Moreton" and "Torresian") of the acridine grasshopper Caledia captiva in southeast Queensland has been analyzed and found to conform qualitatively with a model of altered gene flow patterns. Clines in four enzyme systems were analyzed for 1983 and 1986 along a transect across the hybrid zone. The clines have shifted towards an area of regenerating forest, while homozygote frequencies have increased at this point. This forest barrier has broken the continuity of the spatial distribution of C. captiva, forming population islands in part of the hybrid zone, and thus reducing the amount of gene flow. The distance between the barrier and the original cline is approximately of the order of a cline width, so that they would be expected to interact.
   Historical information suggests that the secondary contact between the "Moreton" and "Torresian" taxa occurred very recently (1844-1940), due to the intensive land-clearing activities during the European settlement.

AB Aster furcatus is a rare, self-incompatible plant with fewer than 50 known populations throughout its range. We verified self-incompatibility in A. furcatus by conducting experimental self- and cross-pollinations and by examining seed set in a small population comprised of a single clonal genet. We examined variation at 22 electrophoretic loci in 23 populations of A. furcatus from across its range in Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri. Except for two rare alleles found in single individuals in three populations, all loci but one of those examined were fixed for single alleles. The only variable locus (triosephosphate isomerase, TPI-1) tended to exhibit genotype frequencies in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium or with a slight excess of heterozygotes. Although overall gene diversity was extremely low, TPI genotype frequencies were indicative of an outcrossing plant. We examined the subpopulation genetic structure among clonal plants within one Wisconsin population in greater detail. F statistics indicated that much of the genetic variation at the polymorphic TPI locus was due to differentiation among populations. We discuss the implications of self-incompatibility and low levels of genetic variation for the evolution and conservation of Aster furcatus and other rare plants with similar breeding systems.

AB The patchy local distribution of the common milkweed, Asclepias syriaca, organizes populations of a beetle that feeds on it, Tetraopes tetraophthalmus, into numerous local demes.  Genetic and ecological characteristics of demes of adult milkweed beetles occupying two naturally occurring size classes of patches, defined as large and small, were studied in order to describe the effect of patch size variation on local population structure.  Allele frequency variance in two of three protein polymorphisms was significantly greater in collections of beetles from an array of 13 small patches when compared to collections from an array of 11 large populations.  A multivariate measure of variance using information from all 3 genetic markers confirmed that the small patches displayed greater overall genetic differentiation.  This was further quantified by computing an F(st) value, combined across loci, of 0.018 for the small patches and 0.004 for the large patches.  No significant difference between patch size classes in mean allele frequency was detected.  Mark and recapture studies of the adults found in five small and four large patches showed the residence times of adults in small patches to be less than half of those found in large patches.  This was interpreted as resulting from higher emigration rates from small patches.  It is proposed that greater genetic differentiation is found among demes from smaller patches because smaller patches support smaller population sizes and further because smaller patches act as net exporters of migrants while larger patches act as net migrant importers.

AB The population genetic structure of the American liver fluke, Fascioloides magma, and its definitive host the white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus, was examined in South Carolina. Flukes were significantly more common in deer from river-swamp habitat than upland areas and prevalence increased with host age. The distribution of flukes among deer occurred as a negative binomial with the mean dispersion parameter, k, equal to 0.17 and the range from 0.10 to 1.11 within local areas. Significant spatial genetic differentiation was observed for flukes and deer. Patterns of genetic distance in flukes were not concordant with those of the definitive host nor were they related to geographic distance between sample locations. Spatial genetic differentiation among flukes reflected the tendency for individual hosts to harbor multiple individuals from a limited number of parasite clones. The large population size of the parasite and movements of the definitive host tend to counteract factors that lead to spatial differentiation.

TI TROJAN SPARROWS - EVOLUTIONARY CONSEQUENCES OF DISHONEST INVASION FOR
   THE BADGES-OF-STATUS MODEL
SO AMERICAN NATURALIST

DT Article

   INDIVIDUAL RECOGNITION; DOMINANCE STATUS; IMMUNE-RESPONSE
AB An adapted game-theory model for the "badges of status" hypothesis is introduced, and factors influencing the formation of "honest" stable population states are investigated. The stability of these states is then studied when two "dishonest" mutant strategies, "cheat" and "Trojan sparrow," are evoked. The honest population states are stable against invasion by the cheat strategy if social control of deception, in the form of punishment from aggressive individuals, is sufficiently severe. The Trojan-sparrow strategy is found to be successful for invading honest population states under all conditions, which indicates that the conventional badges-of-status model is fundamentally evolutionarily unstable in the absence of constraints limiting phenotypes to honesty. Without honest phenotypic limitation we predict that mixed fighting strategies will evolve but that individuals will not display accurate information regarding their aggressive intent and that dominance hierarchies will be based on true measures of resource-holding potential and not badge size. Hence, the conventional badges-of-status theory can be reduced to the conventional hawk-dove model and cannot be used to explain the evolution of mixed fighting strategies without honest phenotype limitation. We identify the reproductive trade-off, honest "handicap," and/or genetic and/or pleiotropic constraints under which badges of status may prove evolutionarily stable by the limitation of the strategy set to honesty.

AB Ponds containing the parthenogenetic zooplankter Daphnia pulex with and without chaoborid predators were sampled over the course of a season.  A significant (P < 0.05) Spearman rank correlation was found between predator density and the expression of an antipredator defense (neckteeth) by the Daphnia.  The reaction norms (percent induction of a single genotype versus predator density) of clones isolated from predator-free and predator-rich habitats were determined in a laboratory setting.  There was a statistically significant different response among the six clones tested (P < 0.05).  Clones isolated from chaoborid ponds showed significantly greater sensitivity to the presence of predator than clones from predator-free ponds (P < 0.05).  In the laboratory, food levels under which prey were cultured affected induction of the antipredator response.  Highest induction was found at the lowest food level used.

AB Considerable attention has been paid to the phenomenon of infanticide in recent years. Five functional categories of infanticide have been defined. Here I concentrate on those that either have been described as the outcome of possible competition for limited resources or have by default been classified is the result of social pathology. Many of the species that show infanticide of this nature also show adoption of unrelated young at fairly high frequencies. I suggest that the Possibility of caring for nonfilial offspring creates an intergenerational conflict, or arms race, whereby offspring separated from their parents or receiving parental care of substandard quality (insufficient for their survival) should be selected to solicit care from adults other than their parents and the potential adoptive parents are selected to avoid giving such care. Evidence suggests that most examples of supposedly pathological infanticide, or resource-based infanticide, are the result of potential foster parents killing unrelated offspring when these offspring can clearly be identified as nonrelatives. Support for this idea comes from observations that (1) such infanticide is most common in group-living or colonial species, where chances of encountering wandering offspring are high; (2) infanticidal individuals come almost exclusively from the sex that bears the primary costs of adoption; (3) such infanticide occurs only under conditions where victims can clearly be identified as nonfilial; and (4) in species with little or no cost to adoption, adoption is common, but infanticide is nonexistent.

AB The results of this study indicate that individuals of the hermaphroditic species Catomerus polymerus allocate proportionately more of their reproductive resources to female function when they occur in small mating groups than when they are in large ones. The most plausible explanation for this result is one provided by Charnov: in small mating groups individual fitness is increased by a bias in energy allocation toward female function.

AB Fisher proposed an equilibrium model for the birth sex ratio in which expected reproductive success, E(RS), of sons and daughters, the birth sex ratio, and the relative cost of producing offspring of different sexes were inextricably linked. In a population of wedge-capped capuchin monkeys (Cebus olivaceus), we used the observed intrinsic rate of natural increase (r), calculated from demographic life tables, as a measure of E(RS). Reproductive success of females varied with group size, and there was a quantitatively predictable variation in birth sex ratio. Groups with 15 or more individuals produced on average a birth sex ratio of 1:1.9, while groups of less than 15 produced a birth sex ratio of 1:0.83. For the population as a whole, the birth sex ratio of 1:1.57 (n = 95) is strongly skewed toward daughters. On average, the E(RS) of sons is greater than that of daughters, which suggests that the cost of producing daughters is lower than for sons. Daughters might be cheaper because they "pay back" parents by not dispersing and thus help parents produce future offspring.

AB Male butterflies display a diversity of mate-location tactics. This article describes the observed diversity in encounter-site locations and in the behavior of males at encounter sites and attempts to reveal the evolutionary patterns in this diversity by assessing the ecological correlates of various tactics. For species that pupate on the larval food plant and that feed on relatively large larval food plants, males focus their mate-locating efforts on the larval food plant. Otherwise, males use non-resource-based encounter sites such as hilltops, or landmarks in the environment. The ecological correlates of the behavior of males at encounter sites are examined with respect to site tenacity, time of day when encounter sites are visited, the occurrence of site defense, and the behavior when waiting (perch or fly). The analysis suggests that these variables should be considered separately in that they may evolve independently. Currently, the data on butterfly mating systems are insufficient to draw strong conclusions about their evolution. However, the approach taken in this article will hopefully provide a useful framework for future research efforts.

AB The overall rate of self-fertilization can be viewed as the sum of two distinct processes:  1) self-pollination of all ovules in a flower (whole-flower self-pollination); and 2) self-pollination of some of the ovules in a flower, occurring together with outcrossing of the remaining ovules (part-flower self-pollination).  In some situations these processes may be equated with different modes of self-pollination.  A model of the mating system in which the progeny of separate fruits serve as the unit of observation is presented.  The model partitions the overall rate of self-pollination into components attributable to whole- and part-flower selfing.  When the mating system is estimated using information on marker genotypes from chasmogamous fruits in two species of Glycine together with the whole-and part-flower selfing model, the results indicate that the chasmogamous flowers in a subalpine population of G. clandestina underwent a significant level of whole-flower selfing, whereas in another, lower elevation population of G. clandestina and in a subtropical population of G. argyrea, they did not.  This difference is thought to be related to the contrast in the variability of environmental conditions for insect-mediated pollination between the habitats sampled.  In particular, the large component of whole-flower selfing observed in the subalpine population of G. clandestina may be due to self-pollination that is induced during periods unfavorable to insect-mediated pollination.  It can be demonstrated that such induced selfing will be selected whenever environmental conditions are such that pollinator activity limits seed set, and moreover that induced selfing can result in the selection of overall levels of self-pollination that are intermediate between 0 and 1.  Monte Carlo simulation is employed to show that ignoring the correlation of self-fertilization events that result from whole- and part-flower selfing may lead to biased estimates of mating system parameters.

AB Animal species differ in the variability of their clutch sizes, as well as in mean clutch sizes.  This phenomenon is particularly obvious in lizards, where virtually invariant clutch sizes have evolved independently in at least 23 lineages in seven families.  Reduced variance in clutch size may arise either as an adaptation (because females with less variable clutch sizes have higher fitness) or as an indirect by-product of selection on other life-history characteristics.  Comparative data on Australian scincid lizards indicate that variance in clutch sizes is lowest among species with low mean clutch sizes, small body sizes and a low variance in body sizes of adult females.  Phylogenetic analysis shows that evolutionary decreases in the variance of clutch size have accompanied decreases in mean clutch sizes and decreases in the variance of adult female body sizes.  Tropical lizards may also exhibit lower variance in clutch size.  Most of these characteristics are correlated in occurrence, and may be allometrically tied to small body size.  Hence, low variance in clutch size may be a consequence of allometric effects on a correlated suite of life-history characteristics.  Exceptions to the general patterns noted above-especially, lizard species with invariant clutch sizes but large body sizes-may be due to loss of genetic variance for clutch sizes in lineages that have passed through a "bottleneck" of small body sizes and hence, low variance in clutch sizes.

AB Samples of the gall-forming aphids Pemphigus populicaulis and P. populitransversus (both elongate and globular morphs) were re-collected at sites in eastern North America after 13 to 16 years.  Twenty-three morphometric characters of the galls, stem mothers, and alate fundatrigeniae were analyzed by univariate and multivariate methods.  Varying proportions of the variance of each character are attributable to the four levels of variation-locality, year, year by locality interaction, and among galls (within one year and locality).  The year by locality interaction level generally has the greatest variation and is highly significant.  Year and locality effects tend to be lower and not significant.  The variance components do not exhibit trends with time.  Geographic variation patterns of single variables or factor scores in the original and revisited populations show significant spatial structure overall but lack clear-cut spatial patterns, especially clines.  Observable patterns of variation match results of the spatial analyses:  most characters lack clear trends; patterns in the revisited data do not resemble patterns for the same variables in the original data.  Variability profiles for characters change little over the time span and are comparable among and within localities.  Covariation among characters over localities is largely maintained during the time interval despite the changes in patterns.  Fluctuating interclonal competition among aphids on secondary hosts is believed to cause the marked heterogeneity in space and time among the aphids in the galls.

AB We define a new genetic identity measure that is especially well suited for asexual polyploid species as it circumvents errors in the estimation of gene frequencies.  It also can be applied to sexuals allowing the study of phylogenetic relationships in species complexes consisting of sexuals and asexuals of different ploidy levels.  The measure groups genotypes into classes dependent on homozygosity vs heterozygosity and the number of ancestral allele types vs the number of presumed new mutations.  Its value is related to evolutionary time since divergence.  The application of the method is illustrated by using electrophoretic data on the species group Solenobia triquetrella (Lepidoptera:  Psychidae).  A high similarity of estimated relationships among the proposed as well as other genetic identity measures is shown in the case of diploid sexual and asexual races of this species group.  The phylogenetic relationships within the group are reanalyzed and monophyletic vs polyphyletic origin of parthenogenesis in this species complex is discussed.  The genetic identity values found by the proposed procedure are explained by a polyphyletic origin of parthenogenesis, though a monophyletic origin of parthenogenesis in a broader sense cannot be excluded.  The explanation of the phylogenetic relationships is based on the assumption of hybridization between related species and the extinction of one ancestral species.  Furthermore, the genetic diversity is compared among sexual and parthenogenetic races of the species.

AB The genetic and ecological effects of population subdividsion were investigated for two wild strains of Tribolium castaneum and two wild strains of T. confusum and compared with the effects of population subdivision on the synthetic laboratory strain of T. castaneum (c-SM), used extensively in earlier experiments. For the c-SM strain, it has been shown repeatedly, for a variety of different population structures (different combinations of effective numbers, N(e), and migration rates, m), that large heritable differences in population growth rate arise among demes during 10 to 15 generations of population subdivision. Because this laboratory strain was synthesized by mass mating several "inbred" strains in 1973 (80 to 100 generations ago), it is possible that it has genetic variation for fitness (measured as the heritable variance among demes in the rate of population increase) unusually large compared to natural populations of flour beetles. In this paper, I report that natural populations of flour beetle exhibit as much or more phenotypic and genetic variation in the effects of population structure on fitness than the laboratory strain, c-SM. The observation of substantial heritable variation for fitness in natural populations is unexpected under additive theory and may be indicative of nonadditive genetic variance.

AB Fledgling sex ratios biased in favor of the less costly sex in sexually dimorphic birds have been used as evidence in support of Fisher's theory that parents should invest equally in sons and daughters. However, such biased sex ratios are also predicted as a nonadaptive consequence of a 1:1 hatching sex ratio and greater vulnerability to starvation of nestlings of the larger sex. We used estimates of the relative costs of males and females to predict the minimum sex-ratio bias at fledging that could possibly allow equal investment by independence, for seven species of sexually dimorphic birds. Although reported values for three of the species were potentially consistent with the values predicted by Fisher's theory, the observed values for the four most dimorphic species were far too male biased for investment at independence to be equal. We suggest that male-biased mortality among nestlings in sexually dimorphic species is the cost males bear for being large as adults and is the nonadaptive cause of biased fledging sex ratios in these species.

AB Among social Hymenoptera, the evolution of the worker caste has reached its apex in the ants, in which some taxa have evolved complex physical worker caste systems. Diverse worker caste systems can be generated through regulation of three aspects of larval growth: critical size, growth parameters, and reprogramming of these factors. Even the most complex caste systems could have evolved simply by the addition of revised programs to the end of an ancestral developmental pathway for workers. Worker castes in ants provide a system in which to study the evolution of reaction norms and developmental switches. In ants, the simplest developmental switch, revision of critical size alone, does not lead to discontinuous phenotypes. Only when changes in growth rules are tied to the decision to revise critical size are distinct phenotypes produced from the alternative developmental programs. The addition of ever more physical castes may be limited by both developmental and ecological factors.

AB I examined plasticity of jaw and skull morphology induced by feeding different diets in two species of the neotropical cichlid genus Geophagus. The two species possess different modes of development, which affect the size at which young begin feeding. I hypothesized that the difference in size at first feeding could lead to a difference in the amount of change inducible in the two species. The young of the substrate-spawning species, G. brasiliensis, which begin feeding at a smaller size, were predicted to be more plastic than those of the mouthbrooding species, G. steindachneri. The two diets used to induce differences were brine shrimp nauplii and chironomid larvae. Numerous measures of the jaw and skull differed significantly between groups fed the two diets but the amount of plasticity induced was small and would not present a problem for taxonomists. Contrary to my prediction, both the magnitude and pattern of plasticity induced in the two species was similar. Thus, mode of parental care and the size at which young begin feeding do not affect the degree of plasticity. Fish fed brine shrimp nauplii were longer in oral jaw region, but were shorter and shallower in the area behind the oral jaws. An additional group of G. brasiliensis was fed flake food to compare the results of this study to other studies. The differences in measures between fish fed brine shrimp diets and flake food diets were greater than those between fish fed brine shrimp and chironomid larvae. A possible role of plasticity for enhancing rather than retarding morphological evolution is discussed.

AB The importance of higher-order interactions to community structure has been debated for decades. We attempt to resolve the conflict by placing higher-order interactions in their appropriate functional relationship with indirect effects. Indirect effects are changes in the outcome of a pairwise relationship caused by other species. These changes can be mediated through changes in species densities (altering the frequency of encounters) or through a change, in the nature of the relationship itself (such as a change in the per capita competition coefficients in Lotka-Volterra models). These latter forms of indirect effects, limited by their specific mechanistic definition, are higher-order effects. They can be resolved empirically only if density effects can be accounted for, and this additional analytical requirement may explain their scarcity. We also test the competitive relationships among mycophagous drosophilids and describe an indirect effect. However, there was no evidence of a significant higher-order effect; the nonadditive effect is apparently mediated through changes in species densities. Previous laboratory studies of multispecies Drosophila communities failed to document nonadditive effects. We suggest that the multigenerational approach of earlier studies may obscure indirect effects that could be important to natural communities.

AB Previous work on colonial hydroids in the genus Hydractinia has demonstrated that colony morphology is highly variable and determines intraspecific competitive ability. Competitive encounters are known to be common in nature, suggesting that intraspecific competition may be a major selective force acting on morphological variation. A replicated common garden experiment demonstrated a genetic basis to morphological variation and two data sets provided correlative support for the hypothesis of selection by intraspecific competition. First, morphologies inferior in competitive ability were less abundant in two adult, postcompetition, samples than in juvenile, precompetition, samples from the same populations. Second, among eight populations, the relative frequency of different morphologies was correlated with the frequency of intraspecific competition observed in each population. The direction of selection by competition on the morphological variation present in this species conflicts with recent predictions based on surveys across diverse taxa, suggesting limitations to the inference of competition as a past selective agent on the basis of present day correlations among species.

AB The aspen blotch miner, Phyllonorycter salicifoliella, has occurred at extremely high, "epidemic" densities on its quaking aspen host trees for at least 10 yr in Itasca State Park, Minnesota, USA. During the 1986 through 1988 growing seasons, I censused density, survival, and sources of mortality for eggs, larvae, and pupae on branches at two heights on four host trees. I constructed cohort life tables to determine: (1) dominant sources of mortality, and (2) which sources of mortality were spatially density dependent. The impact of parasitism on leaf miner success was also measured by excluding parasitoids with cages from four trees in 1986.
   Most mortality occurred during larval development and was caused by interference, parasitism, and unknown causes. Interference means that one larva kills another when mines coalesce during the first three instars. Egg mortality, predation, and death from premature leaf abscission were generally low, except in 1988 when a severe drought caused significant early leaf fall.
   I tested if dominant sources of mortality were density dependent at four spatial scales: per leaf, twig, branch, and tree. Larval interference was the only consistently density-dependent cause of death. No between-trophic-level interactions imposed density-dependent mortality.
   Although interference was spatially density dependent, it appears incapable of regulating P. salicifoliella population size. Instead, P. salicifoliella densities approached population "ceilings" delimited each year by availability of young leaves during oviposition. Cessation of the outbreak is unlikely until stochastic meteorological events increase overwintering mortality and/or severely disrupt synchrony between oviposition flights and availability of young foliage.

AB Experiments were conducted to determine if three plant defenses affected the parasitoid Cotesia congregata in a fashion that would influence herbivore-parasitoid interactions. We evaluated the developmental rate, size, and survival of the parasitoid Cotesia congregata, when reared from Manduca sexta fed on diets containing either nicotine, rutin, or hordenine. These results were compared to the effects of the same three chemicals on unparasitized M. sexta. The influences of the three plant defenses differed. In general, however, the effects of these allelochemicals on the parasitoid paralleled those on the unparasitized hornworm. The one major exception was that concentrations of nicotine that had little or no effect on the hornworm caused significant mortality of parasitoids. Neither rutin nor hordenine had large or consistent negative effects, although rutin had a pronounced effect on both hornworm and parasitoid developmental times.

ID BODY SIZE; PATTERNS
AB (1) This paper describes and analyses the mean number of parasitic helminth species per host individual among Canadian freshwater fish. (2) Helminth diversity varies among host species. (3) The diversities of different taxa of helminths are correlated both within and among host species. (4) Helminth diversity is positively correlated with host size, longevity, diet and geographical range. Size (or longevity) produces the strongest correlations; when the effect of size is removed, only diet remains correlated with helminth diversity. Size and diet together explain about 40% of variance in helminth diversity among host species; the model is most successful for cestodes, where about 60% of the variance is explained. (5) Most of the ecological covariance of helminth diversity is displayed at rather high taxonomic levels, perhaps because of lag between host evolution and parasite adaptation.

AB (1) We studied breeding dispersal in male and female great reed warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus L.) at lake Kvismaren in South Central Sweden from 1984 to 1990. In the two study plots, Marsh A and Marsh B, the numbers of breeding birds increased over the years. (2) About 55% of the breeding birds returned to the study site between years and 80% returned to the same breeding marsh. Birds that had bred successfully were more likely to return to their breeding marsh than those that had failed. (3) Between years, 18% of females and 6% of males returned to breed in their former territories and males tended to move further than females. Less than 15% of the females with their previous year's mate alive, Te-established the pair bond. (4) The order of territory settlement was similar between years. Both males and females settled earlier in year(t + 1) in territories that were occupied early in year(t), than in territories occupied late or in territories that had been unoccupied. (5) Males and females that arrived relatively earlier than they did the year before occupied a territory of higher rank. Such males increased their reproductive success significantly whereas females did not. (6) The attractiveness of territories was fairly constant over the study period. By dividing the territories into two groups, attractive and less attractive, based on the average order they became occupied by males, we show that males became mated with more females and had higher reproductive success in the attractive territories. Reproductive success of females did not differ between attractive and less attractive territories. (7) The high marsh fidelity for both males and females cannot be explained by benefits from optimal inbreeding, re-mating with former mates or breeding in the same territory. Instead, we suggest that the adaptive significance of returning to their breeding marsh (neighbourhood fidelity) is that the birds can use knowledge about the quality of several territories, gathered in year(t), and settle in the best territory available at the time of their arrival in year(t + 1). (8) In most bird species, females are less faithful to their breeding sites than are males. In the polygynous great reed warbler, the variance in reproductive success is much larger among males than among females. Although there might be a higher cost for males to disperse this might be overcome by a greater benefit if they succeed in occupying a high quality territory. This potential fitness gain should entice males to disperse.

AB The most isolated northern stand of Colorado pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) at Owl Canyon, Colorado, USA has a broad and flat size class distribution common to population expansions, with the largest and oldest trees near the center of the grove. Analyses of fossil packrat (Neotoma sp.) middens within the grove indicate that the stand originated by long-distance dispersal rather than by vicariance, a distinction seldom possible because of the unknown or incomplete histories of such isolated populations. Our 5000-yr pollen and macrofossil record suggests that pinyon pine colonized the site sometime between 1290 and 420 yr BP, the latter age corresponding to the oldest tree in the stand. Electrophoretic data from living trees show that this colonization was not attended by typical founder effects predicted by theory or observed for other known founder events. Despite its isolation, recent founding, and probable long-distance origin, the Owl Canyon stand has not suffered significant losses in genetic variation relative to likely source populations. Large initial population size, multiple founding events, rapid population growth, or selection favoring heterozygous genotypes could all explain the high heterozygosity and only slightly reduced polymorphism and number of alleles per locus found in the Owl Canyon stand. These results demonstrate the genetic complexity of founder events and the utility of blending complementary approaches such as paleoecology and genetics to better understand the population biology of peripheral isolates.

TI DETERMINANTS OF CHICK SURVIVAL IN THE LESSER BLACK-BACKED GULL -

AB (1) Avian egg size is commonly held to be an important index of egg 'quality' because it reflects the quantity of yolk reserves available to the chick during embryonic development and on hatching. (2) The assumption that egg size may therefore play an important part in determining chick survival overlooks the confounding variable of parental quality which may influence both egg size and fledging success. (3) In order to test the hypothesis that the abilities to produce large eggs and to rear chicks successfully may be positively related, and to investigate the relative contributions of parental quality (ability to produce large eggs) and egg size per se to chick fledging success, a clutch transfer experiment was performed in which clutches of large eggs were cross fostered with clutches of small eggs. (4) Large eggs produced chicks which were not only skeletally larger (tarsus length) but also heavier for their size than those from smaller eggs, both of which could contribute to increased chances of survival. (5) Logistic regression analysis showed that both egg size and the quality ot the foster parents contributed significantly to the probability of fledging. Parental quality was more important than egg size in determining chick survival, which suggests that correlations between survival and egg size found by other workers in nonexperimental situations may be due to the confounding effect of parental quality. (6) The contribution of large egg size to chick survival in the lesser black-backed gull Larus fuscus L., appears to be mediated via advantages of increased skeletal size, rather than body condition, on hatching. (7) As large egg size is advantageous, selection for increasing egg size is implied. The likely counterbalancing forces are discussed.

AB The spatial distribution of diaspores in seed banks can be significantly affected by physical processes that act on diaspores after they reach the soil surface. We examined how diaspore morphology and soil particle size affect diaspore incorporation into soil in a disturbed alpine ecosystem on the Beartooth Plateau, Montana, USA. Diaspores of alpine species with varying morphology were sown over soils of five different particle sizes and later collected from three depths. Regardless of diaspore morphology, the total number of diaspores trapped increased with increasing particle size until a threshold soil particle size was reached above which no more diaspores were trapped. At small particle sizes (0.5-1.0 and 1.0-2.0 mm) small diaspores and diaspores with adhesive seed coats were trapped, but most large diaspores moved horizontally across the surface and were not trapped. The majority of those diaspores trapped were at the 0-1 cm depth at small particle sizes. At large particle sizes (2.0-4.0, 4.0-8.0, and 8.0-16.0 mm) high numbers of large diaspores were trapped, and more diaspores moved vertically through the soil column. In small particle size soils small diaspores reached greater depths than large diaspores. Diaspores with adhesive seed coats responded more like large diaspores in terms of vertical movement. Diaspore length and eccentricity (length/width) were highly correlated with entrapment at small particle sizes and appeared to have the greatest effect on horizontal movement. Mass and width were significantly correlated with numbers of diaspores trapped in large particle sizes and were influencing vertical movement.
   Models based on the Weibull probability distribution were used to describe diaspore "survival" on the soil surface and to describe vertical movement in the soil column.
   This study indicates that on exposed soils in windy environments diaspore morphology and soil particle size greatly affect the spatial distribution of diaspores in seed banks. For diaspores of a given species, the optimal soil type traps a high number of diaspores but precludes significant downward movement.

AB In parasitic life cycles, transmission events, that is, the passage of a parasite from an "upstream" host to a "downstream" host, often involve behavioral adaptations that result in an increase of the chances of the parasite's being actually transmitted. These behaviors stem from evolutionary changes in the parasites' genomes: either the parasites select responses (their own responses or those they provoke in upstream hosts) to stimuli arising from downstream hosts or from the environment where they live, or they select stimuli (arising from themselves, or from alterations they provoke in upstream hosts) that are addressed to downstream hosts. The various processes are differentiated on the basis of behavioral adaptations and illustrated by examples. The difficulty of demonstrating that the traits are actually the result of a selective process favoring transmission and several unresolved questions are discussed.

AB Although competition for mutualists is known to be an influential force in plant-animal interactions, its importance in animal-animal associations is largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that phloem-feeding membracids (Publilia modesta) compete intraspecifically for the protective services of an ant mutualist (Formica altipetens). By experimentally increasing membracid densities in the field, we observed three negative effects due to competition for ants: (1) a 45%-59% reduction in the number of ants tending membracid aggregations, (2) a 63% increase in the abundance of a predatory salticid spider (Pellenes sp.), and (3) a 59% reduction in the mean number of membracid nymphs per plant. In total, the loss of protective services due to competition for mutualists translated into a 92% decrease in the production of newly eclosed membracid adults. These findings provide the first experimental demonstration that animal species compete for mutualists. In addition, our work indicates that mutualisms can be strongly influenced by the local biotic neighborhoods in which they occur and thus may be far more variable than previously thought.

AB Pines growing in unproductive habitats experience more damage by moose than those growing in more productive habitats. This suggests that trees in unproductive habitats are qualitatively different, e.g., more palatable to moose, and/or less able to recover from browsing. Moose browsing was compared on four phenotypes of Scots pine taken from a gradient of forest productivity. The trees were exposed, side by side, at test stations during winter.
   Consumption of twig biomass was highest on pines from the most productive habitat and lowest on those from the moderately productive habitat with an overstory of mature pines. Consumption was intermediate on pines from the least productive habitat and from the moderately productive habitat without an overstory. Pines from the highly productive habitat had greater nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus content and more readily degradable dry matter (when incubated in the rumen of a cow) than did pines from the less productive habitats. Even though they provided a lower quality food for moose, pines in the less productive habitats generally suffered most from moose browsing. The slender twigs and the slow growth rate of these pines allow the moose to browse the main part of the needle-bearing twigs, in contrast to pines from more productive habitats. We also recorded the mortality response to simulated winter browsing in living pines on this same forest productivity gradient. Pine mortality was greater in the less productive habitats than in the more productive ones. These findings largely explain why pines growing in habitats of low and medium productivity suffer more than pines in highly productive habitats, where the possibility for growth is better. Severe damage to stands growing on poor soils most probably arises where moose density is high and where moose have already harvested most of the available twigs from pines growing in the more productive habitats. The moose are then forced to utilize the suboptimal food resources available in less productive habitats.

AB We used laboratory feeding trials to examine the responses of copepods to a variety of cyanobacteria of differing size, morphology, and toxicity. Diaptomus birgei exhibited behaviors ranging from strong preferences for some taxa of cyanobacteria to almost complete rejection of other taxa when allowed to feed in low-concentration mixtures of a high-quality green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardi, and each of 16 taxa of cyanobacteria. Our results demonstrate the overriding importance of chemical factors. Copepods exhibited very high clearance rates for some filaments and colonies but rejected morphologically similar strains shown to contain potentially toxic compounds.
   Responses to resource abundance exhibited three patterns, each consistent with the assumptions and predictions of an optimal diet model. First, selectivity for high-ranking cyanobacteria declined in high-concentration mixtures with Chlamydomonas relative to selectivity in low-concentration mixtures. Second, a test of the effects of time without food showed that hunger, rather than food concentration per se, was responsible for these shifts in selectivity. Finally, each toxic strain was consistently ingested at very low rates, even when offered as the sole food resource. Experiments with complex mixtures of natural seston revealed similar patterns of consistently strong discrimination against a presumably toxic cyanobacterium and concentration-dependent selectivity for presumably nontoxic taxa.
   Our results show how the behavioral flexibility of copepods can be adaptive in lakes with significant populations of cyanobacteria. The ability of copepods to feed size-selectively on filaments and colonies and to discriminate against toxic forms suggests that these grazers may be important in the evolution and continued success of toxic strains.

   SIGNIFICANCE
AB A low fruit:flower ratio has been observed in many plant species, and several functional advantages of nonfruiting flowers have been proposed. One hypothesis is that surplus flowers provide an ovary reserve in case of loss due to unpredictable external mortality at the flower level. In this article a quantitative model is proposed in which the optimal flower number is a function of two fitness costs. First, each flower represents a cost that reduces potential seed production. Second, those cases in which fruit production is ovary limited represent a cost. The model predicts that more flowers may be produced than there are resources necessary for them to develop to maturity, even if the only function of the surplus flowers is to serve as reserve ovaries. The number of surplus flowers increases with increasing fruit-cost:flower-cost ratio and increasing ovary mortality. The presented model suggests a method by which to formulate quantitative, testable predictions on optimal fruit:flower ratios and may thus serve as a null hypothesis for alternative functional explanations of the occurrence of surplus flowers. A scanning of available literature suggests that the proposed model may explain very low fruit:flower ratios in a few species with costly fruits, whereas in species with relatively cheaper fruits more modest numbers of surplus flowers are favored by the proposed mechanism.

TI PARENT-OFFSPRING CONFLICT OVER THE SEX-RATIO IN A DIPLOID POPULATION
   WITH DIFFERENT INVESTMENT IN MALE AND IN FEMALE OFFSPRING
SO AMERICAN NATURALIST
LA English
DT Article
ID EVOLUTIONARY GENETIC STABILITY; SELECTION; MODELS; LOGIC
AB A two-locus diploid model is developed in order to analyze stable mother's and offsprings' strategies concerning the offsprings' sex determination and progeny's sex ratio when the cost of rearing a male offspring is different from the cost of rearing a female offspring.  It is shown that if the ratio in cost is lambda:1, then the resulting stable sex ratio in the population lies between the value 1:lambda, obtained with full mother's control, and 1:lambda-1/2, obtained with no maternal interference.  The effects of biologically relevant parameters on the sex ratio and sex determination are investigated.

AB Ehrlich and Raven's postulate that rapid diversification follows innovation in plant defense has often been invoked a posteriori for plant lineages of unusual diversity and chemical distinctiveness.  The postulate can be more rigorously tested by defining a novel class of defense using chemical and/or anatomical criteria, independent of taxonomic lineage.  If multiple plant lineages have evolved the new defense type, then according to the postulate they should be consistently more diverse than their sister groups (of equal age, by definition) when the latter retain the primitive defensive repertoire.  Secretory canals are an independently defined, repeatedly evolved feature that functions to protect plants from herbivores and pathogens.  The canals might therefore be expected to allow plant radiation in an adaptive zone of reduced herbivory and disease.  We have quantified the evidence for this hypothesis by comparing the diversities of lineages that have independently evolved canal systems with their sister groups for as many plant lineages as current taxonomic evidence allows.  A sign test showed that canal-bearing lineages have consistently higher diversities than their sister groups (P = .0021).  Explanations for this result, other than selective advantage conferred by secretory canals, are examined and provisionally rejected.

AB The influence of predaceous fish in affecting components of fitness of immature and adult macroinvertebrates was examined using a predator enclosure/exclosure experiment in a southern Ontario stream. The stonefly Paragnetina media is a semivoltine species with a midsummer emergence period. After exposure of P. media to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) between May and August (repeated twice, 1987 and 1989), we observed significant reductions in nymphal density, size (head width), and condition (mass/head width). Reductions in density were attributable to nymphal emigration and predation. Selective predation on larger stoneflies (direct effects), together with changes in nymphal feeding rate, activity, and distribution (indirect effects), reduced size and condition of stoneflies exposed to trout. After August-to-October (I 986 and 1989) and January-to-April (1988) exposures, we observed no effect of trout on these parameters.
   Adult stoneflies (P. media and Alloperla mediana) cannot feed, and consequently any energy that they channel into reproductive efforts must be derived from the aquatic stage. Thus, we postulated that the impact of trout on immature P. media and A. mediana might manifest itself negatively on stonefly adults. Although size and emergence pattern of adult P. media and A. mediana did not differ between enclosure/exclosure sections of stream, in the presence of trout both species suffered significant reductions in condition, fecundity, and total number to emerge. These findings demonstrate that direct and indirect effects of a predator can cascade from immature to adult prey and from aquatic to terrestrial eco-systems.

AB (1) The relationships between litter size and juvenile and maternal survival were investigated for 9 years in a marked population of Columbian ground squirrels (Spermophilus columbianus Ord.) in south-western Alberta, Canada. (2) A population increase during the first 4 years was characterized by larger litter size, greater adult female body weight and greater survival than in the last 4 years, during which the population decreased. (3) During the increase phase, modal litter size at emergence from the natal burrow was four, and the number of juveniles surviving to the following spring increased with litter size. During the decrease, modal litter size was three, and juveniles in large litters experienced high mortality. (4) Maternal survival was independent of litter size during the increase phase, but declined for litters larger than three in the decrease phase. The fitness costs of different litter sizes seem to vary according to population dynamics, possibly as a result of changes in resource availability.

AB We experimentally studied the effects of avian predation on grasshopper abundance in western North Dakota during the summers of 1988 and 1989. Grasshopper densities in 15 x 15 m plots from which birds were excluded (NO BIRDS) were compared with similar-sized plots where birds were allowed to forage (BIRDS). Plots were established in early June at 16 sites (8 per year), and grasshopper densities were estimated from hoop counts in NO BIRDS and BIRDS plots at 2-wk intervals until the end of July. There were significantly more grasshoppers in NO BIRDS plots than in BIRDS plots in 1989 (P < .0001), but not in 1988 (P = .137). The difference between treatments in 1989 was first detected 6 wk after the exclosures were erected. Between years there were no differences in initial grasshopper abundance in all treatments (P > .388). After the final hoop count each year, sweep-net sampling was also used to estimate grasshopper densities. By this method, average grasshopper density in late July was 26% and 37% lower in BIRDS plots than in NO BIRDS plots in 1988 and 1989, respectively. Average length, total biomass of grasshoppers, species richness, and species diversity, however, did not differ between the treatments. In 1988, 2 of 15 grasshopper species were significantly more abundant in the NO BIRDS plots. There was no difference between the treatments among 16 species identified in the 1989 samples, but the power of our tests to detect differences for individual species was low. Our results support the hypothesis that avian predation reduces insect populations at low and moderate densities.

AB Sex and age data were collected on 60 111 feral horses (Equus caballus L.) removed from eighty-nine areas in Nevada, Wyoming, and Oregon between 1976 and 1987. (2) Sex ratios of young seldom differed from parity; however, sex ratios of adults were commonly skewed toward females. No evidence of differential capture probability between adult males and females could be detected; therefore, skewed adult sex ratios were attributed to differential survival. (3) Age-specific trends in sex ratios indicated that the proportion of males steadily decreased from near parity in foals, to lows of 0.61-0.77 in the 4-5-year age-classes. The trend then reversed with males becoming predominant (1.08-1.36) in the > 10 years age-class. (4) Population simulations suggest that survival diffentials of 0.05-0.07, favouring females to 4 years of age, and 0.02-0.04 favouring males in older age-classes were required to mimic observed age-specific sex ratio changes. To obtain the high proportion of males in the > 10-years age-class, onset of senescence also had to be earlier for females. (5) Causes for differential survival in the immature age-classes are uncertain, but may relate to behavioural or metabolic differences between the sexes. Differential survival between adult males and females is attributed to differences in the energetic costs of reproduction and disparity in their reproductive life spans.

AB In this paper I examine occurrence patterns and habitat use of a New World tropical tadpole species assemblage from primary tropical terra firme forest. First, I describe phenology of reproduction. I then undertake a population approach to examine abiotic characteristics associated with sites used for reproduction by each species. Finally, analysis at a more general level tests to see if some correlative structure exists at the community level, i.e., do sites with similar tadpole species also have similar abiotic characteristics? A significant correlation would indicate, for example, that sites with similar abiotic characteristics also share species assemblages.
   Fifty-three independent aquatic sites were sampled across two consecutive rainy seasons (two 9-mo periods). Twenty-five tadpole species were encountered during the entire study. Significant differences existed among four types of habitats (terra firme pools, peccary wallows, streamside pools, and streams), all located within primary undisturbed forest, with respect to abiotic characteristics such as site permanency and mean depth of water. Most of the rainfall was concentrated between December and May, and phenology of reproduction was strongly affected by the rainfall pattern. For each of the 11 most common species, discriminant analyses revealed the major abiotic characteristics that differed between sites used and not used by those species. On a broader scale of analysis, Mantel tests showed no significant correlations among sites in the similarity of their abiotic characteristics and indices of similarity in their tadpole assemblages. There was also no concordance among sites between either type of similarity and actual proximity of locations. These results indicate that although individual species are responding to habitat characteristics and breed in sites having specific attributes, there are no large-scale species assemblages that covary in habitat use.

AB (1) This study examined the interaction between Heligmosomoides polygyrus (Nematoda) and wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus, populations housed in large open-air enclosures at Wytham Woods, Oxfordshire, between April 1988 and 1990. (2) Wood mouse reproduction was strongly seasonal and mimicked that of wild populations. Overall, reproduction was not influenced by the presence of the parasite. (3) In contrast, wood mouse survival (from 1 month of age onwards) was compromised in infected mice compared with controls. Survival also varied with month of mouse birth, such that survival was poorest for individuals born in the middle of the breeding season (April-August) and greatest for those born at the end of this period (August-October). (4) Parasite prevalence was 98% and average intensity of infection around 80 worms per mouse. Male mice harboured slightly more parasites than females, although differences were not statistically significant. (5) Parasite burden of individual mice varied greatly, ranging from 0 to 371 worms per mouse, and parasites were highly aggregated or overdispersed within the host population. Overdispersion was similar in both sexes and increased with mouse age. (6) There was a negative correlation between worm burden and mouse age in female, but not in male, wood mice. Parasite fecundity (assessed through parasite gg counts) was not associated with mouse worm burden. (7) Infection of offspring born to 'infected' and 'control' enclosures during May 1990 demonstrated no significant differences in susceptibility to repeated H. polygyrus infection under experimental conditions in the laboratory.

AB (1) Common frog, Rana temporaria, tadpoles inhibit the growth, prolong the development, and reduce the survival of natterjack toad, Bufo calamita, tadpoles. In a replicated pond experiment, B. calamita tadpoles treated with the faeces of R. temporaria tadpoles displayed growth inhibition. A unicellular organism was identified in tadpole faeces which is known to cause inhibition in laboratory cultures. (2) Overlap in the development periods of R. temporaria and B. calamita tadpoles is reduced when R. temporaria metamorphose before B. calamita. This subjects natterjacks to a steadily declining level of interspecific competition. Under such conditions, B. calamita tadpoles may be released from an initial period of growth inhibition, and metamorphose the same size as controls raised without R. temporaria. However, even with growth retrieval, time to metamorphosis and mortality are both increased relative to controls. (3) The effects of large R. temporaria tadpoles on B. calamita were not significantly different from those of small R. temporaria tadpoles. Large R. temporaria tadpoles metamorphosed before small R. temporaria tadpoles, thereby providing a longer retrieval period for inhibited B. calamita tadpoles. (4) When the breeding periods of R. temporaria and B. calamita are well-separated, temporal niche overlap between the tadpole stages will be reduced and growth inhibition ameliorated. However, such conditions may still prolong B. calamita development. Tadpoles may therefore be exposed to aquatic predators for longer, and incur a greater risk of dying as a result of pond desiccation.

AB Many studies in population ecology and competition theory are based on models in which the consumption rate of a resource is some function of resource availability and in which the yield of new consumers is constantly proportional to the amount of resource consumed. For such models, the best competitors at equilibrium have low resource requirements, and the best competitors in nonequilibrium habitats have high maximal growth rates. In this study, I abandon the assumption of constant yield and allow consumption rates to be a function of the consumer's internal state with respect to a resource, as well as a function of external resource availability. Specifically, I study functions and parameters describing the competition of planktonic algae for a dissolved nutrient, phosphorus, that is supplied in periodic pulses. In this model, trade-offs between competitive abilities in equilibrium and nonequilibrium habitats can arise in several ways. The most important trade-offs are likely to involve the capacity to store nutrient and the relation between consumption rate and internal nutrient state. It is possible that a species may have unimpressive rates of growth and consumption as functions of resource availability but nevertheless be a superior competitor. It is also possible that no trade-offs between competitive abilities in equilibrium and nonequilibrium habitats arise: that the same species is the best competitor in all habitats. Which of these possibilities is prevalent in natural phytoplankton can only be determined empirically, by adequate knowledge of the constraints on and correlations among the physiological properties of algae.

TI ESTIMATION OF SPATIOTEMPORAL REARRANGEMENT IN A PATCHY HABITAT AND ITS

AB (1) An ordination (PCA)-based method was developed to estimate the degree of spatio-temporal rearrangement between two groups of organisms. (2) The ordination was based on the relative occurrences of the organisms among sampling sites. Rows of the data matrix (variables) represented the different sampling sites, and colums (PCA-objects) represented the subsequent times of sampling. (3) The spatial rearrangements were detected from the position of objects on scattergrams of the PC-analysis. (4) The degree of rearrangement of real organisms was estimated by a calibration curve constructed using simulated rearrangement of computer-made populations. (5) The method was applied to selected Auchenorrhyncha populations. Generations of the oligophagous Kosswigianella exiqua Boheman and the summer diapausing Mendrausus pauxillus Fieber showed intragenerational spatial rearrangement. A third species, Turrutus socialis Flor, showed more than 25% of intergenerational spatial rearrangement, in connection with the wider host plant spectrum. (6) These different strategies reflect the direction of adaptation, namely adaptation to the whole patchy habitat or to the single patches themselves. The developed method seems to be useful in distinguishing the two possibilities.

AB (1) The properties of a large and well-documented estuarine food web are examined to see how closely they conform to the patterns described for food webs in general. Average food-chain lengths are longer and the degree of omnivory is higher than for the majority of published webs. The web is similar to others in the proportions of top, intermediate and basal species and the links between them, and in the relationships between the number of trophic links and web size and between the number of predators and the number of prey. (2) The effects of taxonomic resolution on web properties are examined by progressively aggregating web elements into coarser taxonomic classes. Aggregation resulted in a marked reduction in average food-chain length and reproduced the relationship between the number of trophic links and the number of species and between the number of predators and the number of prey. The proportions of top, intermediate and basal species and the proportions of links between these groupings were insensitive to our aggregation procedure.

AB We determined sex ratio, initial egg complement, and size of adult Aphytis melinus, an ectoparasitoid of California red scale, Aonidiella aurantii. Host scales were reared on leaves of four citrus cultivars previously shown to differ in suitability for scale growth and survival. Wasps from scales reared on leaves of lemon (Citrus limon) produced nearly twice the proportion of female progeny as did wasps from scales reared on leaves of grapefruit (Citrus paradisi), orange (Citrus sinensis), or mandarin (Citrus unshiu). Moreover, female wasps from lemon-reared scales had highest initial egg complement, followed by wasps reared from grapefruit, mandarin, and orange. The quality of scales for the production of fecund, female wasp progeny also varied seasonally over all cultivars pooled. Scales reached largest size when reared in the cooler autumn temperatures and were more than twice as suitable for the production of fecund, female A. melinus as scales reared in early summer or midsummer. Results suggest that the mechanisms allowing persistence of the interaction between California red scale and A. melinus may vary among different citrus cultivars.

AB (1) The reproductive success of 474--574 pairs of common guillemots was studied from 1985 to 1987 on Skomer Island, Wales. (2) Laying was highly synchronized, and within years productivity decreased seasonally from shortly after the period of peak laying. (3) The timing of breeding of one group of forty-five pairs was experimentally delayed by 13 days to test whether timing of breeding relative to calendar date or relative to other pairs was the factor causing the seasonal decline in productivity. The results showed that timing relative to other individuals rather than calendar date was important. (4) Naturally late-breeders provisioned chicks at a lower rate than early breeders, but there was no evidence for a seasonal deterioration in food availability. (5) The effects of physical characteristics, breeding density and synchrony on productivity were examined in a logistic regression analysis for 567 breeding sites. Only density and synchrony had significant effects. Productivity increased with density and decreased for late breeders. (6) Predation was the main cause of breeding failure. High-density breeding reduced vulnerability to predators. Synchrony was important for the benefits of high-density breeding to apply throughout the breeding period, and also for swamping predators.

AB (1) We examined the relationship between nutritional condition of nestlings and their subsequent survival in the population of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) on Mandarte Island, B.C., Canada. Nestlings in higher condition had higher survival to independence from parental care. However, survival from independence to recruitment into the breeding population was not related to nestling condition. (2) We tested whether high nestling condition was sporadically advantageous as a buffer against unpredictable food shortages, or whether high nestling condition was always advantageous. Also tested was whether increasing nutrient stores or increasing structural size were more important to nestlings. (3) Nestlings in higher nutritional condition had higher survival in 7 of 8 years. The response of nestlings to supplemental food was to grow structurally larger, and not to produce a nutrient store. (4) Comparing nestlings from first and second broods, we found that parents did not consistently produce offspring of above or below average condition. (5) Variation in nestling condition in relation to brood size would result in only a 6% difference in average survival of offspring between largest and smallest broods. Brood-size-related variation in nestling condition appears unimportant in determining optimal brood size. (6) Of those offspring that survived to independence, males had been in better condition as nestlings than had females.

AB (1) Intraspecific aggregation has been postulated to facilitate the coexistence of competing species that share patchy resources. Data on adult emergence numbers of four mycophagous species of Drosophila from field-collected mushrooms show that these species exhibit highly aggregated distributions, both in collections comprising several naturally occurring species of mushrooms and in those of a single species for which mushroom size, condition, exposure time, and location in the field were controlled. (2) The relation between the mean and the variance in the numbers of flies emerging per mushroom reveals that the mean level of larval crowding increases with overall population density. Aggregation of larvae of each species is due to (i) females laying eggs in clutches of more than one egg, and (ii) non-random distributions of ovipositing females across breeding sites. (3) The emergence number of different species of Drosophila tend to be positively correlated across mushrooms, especially between species belonging to the same species group. In fact, within species groups, intraspecific and interspecific aggregation of ovipositing females contribute about equally to the proportional increase in the number of competitors an individual larva shares a mushroom with. Thus, aggregation does not appear to play an important.role in the coexistence of species belonging to the same species group. (4) The probability of parasitism of emergent Drosophila by the nematode Howardula aoronymphium Welch is generally independent of emergence numbers. Thus, although density-dependent parasitism could promote coexistence of species that have independent aggregated distributions, we find little evidence of such density dependence in these species.

AB (1) Data on the number of insect species per host-plant, host-plant physical characteristics (geographic range, size and leaf form), the presence of biosynthetically distinct classes of secondary metabolites and intensity of biochemical investigation were compiled for the British umbellifers (Apiaceae) from the Phytophagous Insect Data Bank, previously published studies, and phytochemical literature, respectively. (2) Measures of the chemical diversity and uniqueness of each plant species were derived from the phytochemical data, and four hypotheses relating insect species richness to these chemical variables were explicitly developed and tested using single and multiple regression techniques. (3) The diverse defence and biochemical barrier hypotheses predict negative correlations between insect species richness and chemical diversity and uniqueness, respectively, because plants with diverse or unusual defences should show reduced insect colonization over evolutionary time. Alternatively, the common chemistry and enemy escape hypotheses predict positive correlations between insect richness and these two chemical variables, because plants with diverse chemistry have a higher probability of sharing chemicals common to other plants, facilitating host shifts, and because insect herbivores on biochemically unusual plants may escape from predators and parasites that use host odours to locate prey, again facilitating host shifts. (4) As in previous studies, size of plant geographic range, plant size and leaf form all influence insect species richness. Together, these variables account for 46% of the variance in insect species richness, leaving up to 54% of unexplained variance that could potentially be accounted for by host plant chemistry. (5) Insect species richness is not significantly correlated with chemical uniqueness; thus there is no support for the biochemical barrier or enemy escape hypotheses. (6) Insect species richness is positively correlated with chemical diversity, supporting the common chemistry but not the diverse defense hypothesis. However, support for the common chemistry hypothesis is tenuous, because of the confounding effects of intensity of biochemical investigation. When intensity of biochemical investigation is factored out, the effects of chemical diversity on insect species richness are still positive and significant but account for only 5% of the variation. (7) We conclude that there is no evidence from these data that biochemically diverse or unusual British umbellifers support less-species-rich assemblages of insect herbivores. While the data suggest that chemically diverse plants have more insect species, we consider this evidence to be weak, at best. (8) We discuss the need for further tests of these hypotheses and the types of phytochemical data required.

AB (1) Mean body length and mean sea-age at maturity of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, increased with increasing mean annual water discharge (1-300 m3 s-1) of the spawning river, r2 = 0.53 and r2 = 0.41, respectively. Rivers between 40 and 300 m3s-1, however, showed no such significant correlation. (2) Mean body length and mean sea-age at maturity also increased with passable length (4-126 km) of the spawning river, r2 = 0.30 and r2 = 0.24, respectively. However, passable river length did not add significantly to regression models having mean annual water discharge as the independent variable. (3) Among rivers, body length at sexual maturity for one-(r2 = 0.31) and two-sea-winter (r2 = 0.34) fish increased with mean sea-age at maturity of the population. (4) Among post-spawners, some spawned annually, others biennially. The proportion of biennial spawners increased significantly with sea-age at maturity (r2 = 0.69). In rivers with mean sea-age at maturity between 1.0 and 1.4 years, 0-40% of the fish spawned biennially. In rivers where sea-age at maturity was between 2.0 and 2.3 years, 80-100% spawned biennially. (5) The proportion of biennial spawners depended on fish size (r2 = 0.97). The majority of the smallest adults (< 60 cm) spawned annually, the largest (> 90 cm) biennially. (6) Recapture rates of tagged post-spawners decreased with increasing body length (r2= 0.45) suggesting that small adults had higher sea survival than large ones.

AB We present a simple random model for food web connectance. We model observed webs as random samples drawn from the universe of all possible randomly connected sets of n objects, with no biological interactions assumed. We then drop out links based on observed link-magnitude data and sampling effects. The resulting connectance curves nicely bracket real data, suggesting (1) that food webs may in fact be randomly connected, and (2) the mere fact that previously proposed models can generate the observed connectance values does not guarantee the correctness of the models. This study also suggests that studies of food web topological properties may bear reexamination.

AB (1) We examined the effect of food availability on the population dynamics of red squirrels. A temporary, ad libitum food addition was conducted during two summers in Douglas fir (low population density) and white spruce (high population density) forest habitats from 1985 to 1988 in south-central British Columbia, Canada. (2) The addition of supplemental food resulted in a strong increase in recruitment, primarily by juvenile immigrants in autumn. Increased recruitment caused a fourfold increase in population density in fir habitat and a twofold increase in spruce habitat. Both recruitment to the food-supplemented grids and the decline in density following the removal of food were density-dependent. (3) Supplemental food had no clear effect on juvenile or adult weights, juvenile growth rates, juvenile or adult survival, reproductive parameters or sex ratios. (4) The difference in red squirrel population density in the two habitats was due to higher average food availability in white spruce habitat. The availability of excess food during the food addition period indicated that factors other than food availability limited the population at high density.

AB (1) To evaluate the role of territorial behaviour in limiting the population density of red squirrels, I conducted removal experiments in Douglas fir (low population density) and white spruce (high population density) forest habitat from 1985 to 1988 in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Removals in spring and autumn were used to examine the effect of territorial residents on breeding density and on juvenile recruitment, respectively. I assessed the effect of settlement patterns on population density and territory size by using simultaneous and asynchronous removals. (2) When residents were removed from Douglas fir habitat in spring, red squirrel populations returned to a density similar to the control areas or the pre-removal density, in five of six removal trials. In autumn, population density recovered to control or pre-removal densities in four of six trials. (3) In white spruce habitat, population density returned to the control or pre-removal density in three of four trials in both spring and autumn. In both fir and spruce habitat, immigrants of unknown origin repopulated the removal areas. (4) After the removal of residents in spring, females in breeding condition immigrated to the removal areas in five of six trials in fir habitat and in all four trials in spruce habitat. Males in breeding condition immigrated to the removal areas in all trials in both habitats. Territory size did not decrease after the simultaneous removal of adults in spring. (5) Territorial behaviour limited the recruiment of juvenile immigrants in autumn and breeding adults in spring. and may limit overall population density. Food abundance appeared to have a much stronger influence on population density than did settlement patterns.

AB (1) Habitat use and resource utilization of sympatric Arctic charr and brown trout in four lakes and allopatric Arctic charr in three lakes were investigated in central Norway. Fish were sampled both in epibenthic and pelagic habitats simultaneously with sampling of zooplankton resources. (2) Depth distribution of both Arctic charr and brown trout was correlated with Secchi disc transparency. Sympatric brown trout lived mainly in littoral areas down to 1 Secchi disc unit and were even more confined to near-surface waters in the pelagic zone. Sympatric Arctic charr were most abundant in epibenthic areas between 2 and 5 Secchi disc units and between 1 and 2 units in pelagic habitats. However, allopatric charr used chiefly littoral areas down to 2 Secchi disc units, but they also utilized depths down to 8 Secchi disc units. (3) Generally, the food of allopatric and sympatric populations of Arctic charr differed greatly from that of brown trout. Typically the food overlap index calculated was lower than 70%. (4) A comparison between habitat use of allopatric and sympatric charr indicated that Arctic charr were excluded by brown trout from littoral areas during summer. However, this habitat segregation was broken down in November through winter. (5) Habitat and resource utilization between Arctic charr and brown trout was explained by selective differences and asymmetric competition with brown trout as the dominant species in shallow areas from spring through autumn. In late autumn through winter (November-May), Arctic charr may be superior to brown trout because of higher activity at low temperatures.

TI DIVORCE IN GREAT TITS - CHANCE OR CHOICE - AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH
SO AMERICAN NATURALIST

DT Article
ID PARUS-MAJOR; BREEDING SUCCESS; PAIR-BOND; FEMALE PARENT; MATE CHOICE;
   AGE; DISPERSAL; BIRDS
AB I measure divorce rates in great tit (Parus major) pairs in the year following an experimental alteration of their clutch or brood size.  I show that pairs with experimentally reduced clutches or broods produce fewer fledglings and have higher divorce rates, while pairs with enlarged clutches or broods raise more fledglings and have lower divorce rates, as compared with control pairs.  The manipulation probably influences divorce rates through its effects on reproductive success, and individuals use fledgling production to assess the quality of their breeding situation.  Divorce thus results from an active choice and ultimately is a means for individuals to increase future reproductive success.  Whether divorce is proximately a result of an avoidance of the previous partner or the previous territory is not clear, although the former seems a more likely alternative.

AB We tested the commonly made assumption that reduction in leaf quality reduces the survivorship of herbivores indirectly by increasing their exposure to natural enemies. Caterpillars of the butterfly Pieris rapae were placed on collard plants that had been experimentally manipulated to have leaves either rich or poor in nitrogen. On low-nitrogen plants caterpillars both developed more slowly and devoted more of their time to feeding than on high-nitrogen plants. When exposed to large (> 2 mm) predators and parasites in a natural setting, the survivorship of caterpillars on low-nitrogen collards was reduced greatly compared to caterpillars protected from predators and parasites. Survivorship of caterpillars on high-nitrogen plants was reduced significantly less dramatically when exposed to predators and parasites. Small (< 1-2 mm) pupal parasites that were able to reach the caterpillars through the mesh of the predator exclusion cages emerged more frequently from individuals reared on high-nitrogen plants.

AB Although seasonal patterns of algal succession have received considerable attention, few studies have attempted to elucidate the processes that contribute to short-term algal succession following disturbance. We framed the present study around four general mechanisms of succession in order to investigate the contribution of species-specific autecologies and interspecific interactions to observed short-term patterns of algal succession in a productive third-order stream in Kentucky, USA.
   Observations in different current environments in the stream during two consecutive winters were used to classify dominant species as early or late successional based on changes in relative abundance through time on newly exposed substrates. Assemblages of the same age but differing in the relative abundance of early- and late-successional species were developed in streamside channels recreating both current environments to measure growth parameters (e.g., reproduction) of dominant species and to test for interspecific interactions.
   Of the five dominant species of algae in the winter assemblage, three species were consistently classified as early successional (i.e., decreased in relative abundance with increasing assemblage age) and two species as late successional. Early-successional species differed in their growth form and strategy for initially dominating the substrate, having high densities in the water column, high probabilities of attaching, or fast early reproductive rates. Late-successional species exhibited a more extended growth form and had the highest per capita reproductive rates during later growth. Late-successional species reduced the reproductive rate of early species as succession proceeded in both current environments but were not themselves inhibited by biovolume increases. While differences in growth strategies between early- and late-successional species indicated the importance of passive tolerance mechanisms of succession, density-dependent interactions during community development were consistent with active tolerance mechanisms. As in terrestrial plant communities, successional patterns in benthic algal assemblages appear to result from several processes that defy explanation by a single mechanistic model.

AB In order to evaluate the relative importance of asexual and sexual reproduction to the fitness of a clonal organism, matrix projection models were used to quantify the contributions of each of these reproductive modes to population growth of the soft coral, Alcyonium sp., a species that undergoes frequent colony fission. The demographic and fitness consequences of eliminating either asexual or sexual reproduction from the life cycle of this species were examined by sensitivity analysis and by altering selected entries in the transition matrices to simulate changes in reproductive allocation.
   Four populations of Alcyonium sp. were monitored photographically for two years to record colony growth, mortality, fission, sexual reproduction, and larval recruitment. Despite high turnover, population densities remained reasonably constant. The 24-52% mortality was matched approximately by recruitment of daughter colonies produced by fission. Sexual reproduction was infrequent, and no larval recruitment was observed. The frequency of both fission and sexual reproduction increased with increasing colony size, while mortality decreased with increasing size.
   Size-class transition matrices constructed from the demographic data were analyzed by the methods of Caswell (1986, 1989). In both years of the study the size distributions of colonies observed in the field did not differ from the stable size distributions predicted from the projection models. Eliminating sexual reproduction from the life cycle did not alter the predicted stable size distributions; eliminating fission shifted the size distributions of all four populations towards the larger size classes. Reproductive value increased with increasing colony size. Damping ratio, rho, a measure of the rate of convergence to the stable size distribution, increased with increases in both fission and sexual reproduction, suggesting that rapidly growing populations are more stable than slowly growing populations.
   Projected growth rates (= relative fitness, lambda) of the four populations ranged from 0.66 to 1.15. Sensitivity analyses indicated that sexual reproduction contributes < 1% of the value of lambda, while > 40% of lambda is accounted for by transitions between the upper size classes in the population, either by fission or growth. Eliminating sexual reproduction from the life cycle had a negligible effect on fitness (lambda); eliminating fission greatly reduced-lambda and suggested rapid extinction for all populations. This result held even when sexual reproductive output was increased by an order of magnitude. The results of these simulations suggest that selection for increased-lambda will increase fission at the expense of sexual reproduction in this species.

AB Plants of Plantago major were grown for two generations in different environments. Seed germination of the second generation was examined for the effects of maternal environments, as well as subsequent plant growth and reproduction in the presence of inter- and intraspecific competitors. Maternal treatments were (1) plants that had received nutrient pulses in both the first and second generations (PP plants), (2) plants that had received a nutrient pulse only in the first generation (PC plants), (3) plants that had received a nutrient pulse only in the second generation (CP plants), and (4) plants that did not receive a nutrient pulse in either generation (CC plants). Under favorable conditions (without interaction with a leaf canopy and root system of grasses), seeds of CC plants generally germinated earlier and had a higher final germination percentage. In contrast, under a Poa canopy, seeds of PP plants germinated earlier and had a higher final germination percentage. For adult plants, there were significant interactions between maternal environment and neighbor density. The effects of maternal environments on leaf area generally were evident before flowering but disappeared after flowering. The greatest difference in leaf area occurred between CC and PP plants, and these were often different from CP and PC plants. There was a significant three-way interaction among the type of competition, maternal treatment, and neighbor density for biomass characters. In intraspecific competition with one neighbor, the spike biomass was highest in PP plants followed by CP plants, PC plants, and CC plants, with the last significantly lower than the first two. In general, the juvenile maternal effect did not necessarily result in an adult reproductive advantage. The influence of the maternal environment differed among plant characters.
   These results demonstrate that maternal environmental factors can affect plant phenotypic characters for at least three generations. The expression and the extent of these maternal effects varied with the resource condition experienced by the progeny, the intensity of competitive interactions, and life history stage.

AB (1) This study examines the influence of size-selective predation on competition between two rockpool Daphnia species, D. magna (Straus) and D. longispina (O.F. Muller). Two different predator profiles were used, one simulating a gape-limited (vertebrate) predator, and the other simulating a size-dependent (invertebrate) predator sensu Zaret (1980). Predation was executed by manually removing fixed percentages of populations in susceptible size-classes in accordance with the profiles, irrespective of species. Thirty-six two-species and seven one-species experiments were performed with predation rates from 0 to 90% per 8 days. (2) Under gape-limited (vertebrate) predation, the time to extinction of the larger D. magna decreased with increasing predation rates. In the size-dependent (invertebrate) predation experiments, coexistence of both species was common up to c. 75% predation per 8 days, and then D. longispina became extinct at higher predation rates. Extinctions of the sub-dominant species did not occur when it was reared alone under high predation rates. Both interspecific competition and predation appeared to be important for the exclusion of the species most susceptible to predation. (3) The results support the idea that vertebrate predation can be important in regulating prey size distribution and species composition in rockpool and pond zooplankton communities. They also suggest that low rates of invertebrate predation may have little effect on zooplankton composition in rockpools and ponds. (4) Predation and competition interacted to produce differences in species composition between different predation rates and profiles. Interspecific competition was still of importance under high predation rates. It is therefore suggested that the view that either one or the other of these processes operates in a particular community may be too simplistic.

AB The abundance and distribution of settlers, recruits, and adults of the barnacle Semibalanus balanoides were monitored in the high, mid, and low intertidal zones at two adjacent, but physically and biologically different sites (A and B) on a rocky intertidal shore in Nova Scotia following a rare occurrence of ice scouring. Availability of planktonic cyprid larvae also was measured at site A. There was a strong concordance between cyprid availability and settler density over the main settlement period among intertidal heights, where each was inversely related to intertidal height. Differences in cyprid availability with intertidal height were related to immersion time as the larvae, in general, were uniformly distributed at the water-substratum interface. Settlement rate was strongly correlated with cyprid availability in the low intertidal zone al site A, where most settlement occurred. In all zones at both sites, recruit density at the end of the main settlement period was a positive function of settler density over this period: on average, 79% of the variation in recruit density was explained by settler density over the main settlement period. Adult density and total settler density also tended to be strongly related: 86% (mid zone at site A) and 73% (high zone at site B) of the variation in adult density was explained by total settler density, except where postrecruitment mortality (i.e., predation) was high (e.g., only 1% of the variation in adult density was explained by total settler density in the low zone at site A). Local hydrodynamics, which influences supply and distribution of planktonic larvae, may dictate the distribution of settlers and, ultimately, adults on this shore.

AB In siblicidal birds, overt aggression is used by nestlings to resolve competition for food, and the nestlings of most species diminish or abate their combat when that competition is relaxed. Previous studies of colonial herons and egrets, however, have indicated that the proximate cue on which the aggression was assumed to be predicated, namely, current food levels, has no effect on sibling fight rates; that is, "hunger" does not provide such a switch-off cue. We tested whether aggression might be curtailed in cattle egrets by the obvious alternative, attention to overall demand. When one of three chicks was temporarily removed from experimental nests, the remaining sibs virtually ceased fighting; when it was returned, hostilities resumed. This effect was not influenced directly by the rank of the removed chick, or by the amount of food available to the others (indeed, parents corrected for the change in brood size by bringing less food). By terminating aggression when brood size drops from three to two, the remaining nestlings stand to save the costs of needless fighting when they have little to gain from continuing attacks. We propose that species probably do best by relying on current food amount for the truncation of sibling fighting whenever that cue allows an accurate assessment of pending competition, with brood size used mainly as an alternative or backup system. Supply-based mechanisms should be more flexible and reversible than those predicated on demand. In species such as egrets, the senior siblings can probably achieve a modicum of "reversibility" by exercising restraint during attacks. By using nonfatal intimidation of nest mates, seniors probably control the competition while forestalling the irreversible step of premature siblicide.

AB Fitness loss among males as a result of cuckoldry is often large, and a number of paternity guards have evolved in response to the presence of cuckoldry risks. Paternity guards such as mate guarding protect the paternity of males but also indirectly announce the fertility status of the guarded female. When such "involuntary" fertility cues have arisen, the negative effects of the cues can be ameliorated either by modifying the paternity guard or by direct announcement of female fertility. Male announcement is a reliabile indicator of male quality, if the degree of mate fertility announcement depends on male phenotypic quality and the quality of his resources, and if costs of announcement are relatively higher for low- than for high-quality males. Cuckolder males would then maximize their reproductive success by preferentially intruding during female fertility on sites with little announcement. Intensive announcement of female fertility will be a phenotype-limited evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), since benefits continue to accrue to males relative to their investment in announcement. If male announcement rate is an honest measure of male quality, neighboring females are predicted to choose males with a high announcement rate as extrapair copulation partners. Similarly, the interest taken by a male's own females in neighboring males should be inversely related to that male's announcement rate. Sexual selection should therefore drive the announcement strategy. Information on song activity in male passerine bird species provides empirical support for the model.

AB Costs of locomotion are frequently ignored in models determining the optimal diet of free-ranging ungulates. In order to determine whether such omissions are justified, the relationship between bite size and distance travelled per day is investigated in several wild species of ruminant grazing natural pastures in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. (2) The distance travelled to obtain a gram of food rises exponentially as bite size declines. Animals feeding on short swards have small bite sizes, but it is suggested that animals feeding selectively on course grasslands would also have small bite sizes. It is shown that the heat production in locomotion of selective animals can form a large fraction of the daily intake of metabolizable energy. (3) A simple model of the energy exchange in free-ranging ruminants is developed incorporating parameters of diet quality and heat production. The model applies to pastures which do not set a limit to the daily intake of dry matter. The optimum level of selection for high quality constituents in the grass sward is found by determining the conditions in which energy retention (net energy) is at a maximum. (4) For any particular pasture, the optimum level of selection is found to be strongly dependent on the cost of locomotion per day and on the difference between the metabolizable energy concentration of high and low quality constituents, weakly dependent on the average quality of forage, and independent of the ruminant's resting metabolic rate. (5) The model predicts that the optimum level of selection by large grazing herbivores will be lower than that of smaller animals. This is because large herbivores gain more from digesting low quality constituents due to their ability to digest cell walls, and also because the foraging costs of large animals are higher.

AB Methods are available in the literature for the measurement of instantaneous growth rates in field samples of photosynthetic microbes and procaryotic saprotrophic microbes, but there has been no such method for eucaryotic saprotrophic microbes (members of the kingdom Fungi). We have devised a technique for estimating instantaneous growth rates for ergosterol-containing fungi in field material, and preliminarily applied the technique to estimation of fungal productivities and throughputs in two types of standing-dead grass (one saltwater, one freshwater), obtaining plausible values (e.g., conversion efficiencies, total fungal production divided-by leaf mass loss, were calculated to be 36-64%). This method is based on measuring rates of radiolabeled acetate incorporation into ergosterol. We examined several potential problem areas for use of radiolabeled precursors in measurement of microbial molecular syntheses, and its extrapolation to microbial productivity. Key findings were: (a) 5 mmol/L added acetate (required for maximization of detection of rates) had positive or neutral impact on 48-h fungal growth, and no shift-up (sudden upward change in rate) or lag in incorporation of acetate into ergosterol occurred between 0.25 and 1.25 h of incubation of naturally decaying leaf (Spartina alterniflora) samples with 5 mmol/L acetate; (b) bacterial assemblages on leaves did not contribute radioactivity to the ergosterol fraction after incubation with radioacetate (as opposed to > 30 Bq per centimetre length of leaf containing fungal mycelium); (c) the average empirical factor for conversion from nanomoles C-14-acetate incorporated to micrograms organic fungal mass produced was 8.2-mu-g/nmol (coefficient of variation, 27%). We tentatively conclude that the acetate-to-ergosterol method is tenable for measurement of natural fungal productivity.

AB The effects of different light and soil nutrient conditions on foliar chemistry and acceptability of Inga oerstediana seedlings to leaf-cutter ants were investigated. I determined differences among (1) leaves that were initiated and matured under identical conditions but subsequently were subjected to different light and fertilization treatments and (2) leaves that were initiated and matured under different soil, light, and fertilization treatments. I also assessed the relationship between environmentally induced differences in plant growth and the production of carbon-based secondary chemicals (specifically, tannins). Finally, I determined whether increases in tannins corresponded to decreases in the acceptability of leaves to leaf-cutter ants.
   Once a leaf matured the concentrations of tannins did not change as a function of light and soil nutrient conditions despite very large differences in growth rates among the treatments. Leaves that expanded to maturity under different soil, light, and fertilization treatments did differ in tannin chemistry, and treatment differences in plant growth rates appeared to dictate tannin chemistry. When growth was light limited, tannin concentrations were low, but when growth was nutrient limited, tannin concentrations were high.
   Only leaves that expanded to maturity under different environmental conditions differed in their acceptability to leaf-cutter ants. Decreases in tannins did not result in parallel increases in acceptability. Despite higher concentrations of tannins, leaf-cutter ants preferred the leaves of seedlings that were grown at 20% light over leaves of seedlings grown at 2% light. However, fertilization increased the acceptability of leaves when seedlings were grown at 20% light, a result consistent with the avoidance of very-high-tannin leaves.
   From these results I suggest that spatial variation in resource availability in lowland tropical rainforests would result in differences in tannin chemistry, and in susceptibility to leaf-cutter ants. However, temporal changes in resource availability would only be important to tannin chemistry and susceptibility if the duration of the change were long enough to allow new leaves to be produced.

AB By providing supplemental food to Marsh Tits (Parus palustris) from the day the first egg was laid, effects on clutch size could be directly attributed to food without the confounding effect on laying date.
   Females provisioned with additional food responded by laying, on average, one egg more than control females. Differences in territory quality did not influence this result because, on territories occupied in both years, one more egg was laid in the year of provisioning. Although the rate and amount of extra food provided were equal during the two experimental years, the resulting clutch sizes of provisioned females differed between years by more than one egg in absolute terms. Further, the mean clutch size of provisioned females declined seasonally in parallel to that of unprovisioned females. I conclude that clutch size in Marsh Tits is determined by a tactical decision based on declining values of offspring with the progress of the season. However, within the limits set by this tactical decision, the availability of food during egg-laying also plays a role.

AB In this study laboratory experiments were conducted to test predictions of capture performance based on an understanding of the hydrodynamics of contrasting feeding modes (ram and suction feeding) and on an observed ecomorphological pattern among marine members of the temperate fish family Cottidae. Small-mouthed species that feed predominately on grasping prey (e.g., crabs, isopods, gastropods) were predicted to have low capture success on an elusive prey (shrimp) and to use kinematics more consistent with suction-feeding mechanisms; large-mouthed species that feed predominately on elusive prey (e.g., fishes, shrimp) were predicted to have high capture success in attacks on shrimp and to use ram-feeding kinematics. Laboratory experiments in which predators were videotaped in attacks on either hippolytid shrimp or cancrid crabs tested both the attack success and kinematic predictions.
   Small-mouthed cottid species had significantly lower attack success on shrimp (20-41% vs. 45-56%) than did large-mouthed cottids. Both groups had similar high success rates in attacks on crabs on a sand surface: 93-100% for small-mouthed species and 85-95% for large-mouthed species. Most small-mouthed cottids used attack kinematics more typical of suction feeding (e.g., shorter predator-prey distances and slower attack velocities) than did ram feeders. One small-mouthed species, Jordania zonope, used attack kinematics similar to those used by large-mouthed cottids in attacks on shrimp, and had higher capture success than other small-mouthed species, but had significantly lower capture success than large-mouthed species. All predators showed some ability to modify their attack kinematics when attacking prey with different escape tactics, but cottids showed little intraspecific variation in attack kinematics, in contrast to several recent studies of the strike mechanics of lower vertebrates.
   These results emphasize the importance of both mouth morphology and attack kinematics in determining interspecific differences in capture success and, perhaps, diet. The success of the simple predictions presented here provides hope that general predictions of foraging ecology may be derived from morphological patterns when the prey are treated not by their taxonomic affinities but by the functional demands they make on their predators.

AB The allometric relationship across species between population density and body size determines whether community resource use is distributed more equitably, less equitably, or the same as inferred from the species-abundance distribution. The relationship between body size and population density within the 72 natural communities that were studied typically takes a form in which community resource use is less equitably distributed than are the species' abundances. Small-bodied species living at densities well below those predicted by allometric models use a much smaller share of the community resources than do larger-bodied species. Knowledge of the ecological forces that determine the relationships between body size and population density within communities is central to understanding the patterns of community resource use. Relationships between population density and body size that emerge at the community level may be explicable, at least in part, by evolutionary principles applied to characteristics of individuals of different sizes and ways of life.

AB This is the first study reporting patterns of island occupancy in a guild of mammals with detailed information on the processes affecting these patterns: dispersal, colonization, and extinction. We surveyed the presence of three species of shrews, Sorex araneus, S. caecutiens, and S. minutus, on 108 islands in three lakes in Finland. A significant compensatory effect between island area and isolation was detected in one species, but most islands were so little isolated (< 1 km) that isolation played no great role in this study. The position and the slope of the incidence function varied greatly among the species. Fitting the model J = 1/(1 + y/A(x)) to the observed incidence functions, and assuming that the annual extinction probability is 1 on islands of A = 0.5 ha, yielded quantitative predictions of the rates of colonization and extinction in the three species. Observed rates agreed remarkably well with the predicted ones (median difference 200/o). Overwater dispersal rate and/or ability was lowest in the smallest species (S. minutus), probably because of its short starvation time and slow swimming rate. Unexpectedly, this species had the highest colonization ability (rate of successful colonization conditional on arriving at an island). There were no significant differences between the species in colonization rate, but interspecific differences in extinction rate were highly significant and negatively correlated with body size. We suggest that these differences are due to increasing importance of environmental stochasticity with decreasing body size in shrews. This hypothesis is supported by larger coefficients of variation of abundance in small than in large species on the mainland.

TI CHANGES IN THE FLIGHT PERIOD OF THE HEDGE BROWN BUTTERFLY
   PYRONIA-TITHONUS DURING RANGE EXPANSION
SO JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY

DT Article
ID MANIOLA-JURTINA
AB (1) The range of the hedge brown butterfly Pyronia tithonus (L.) has extended northwards in Britain, certainly over the last three decades and probably over a longer period. (2) During the latter part of this period of expansion (1976-89) regular counts have been made throughout the flight period of this butterfly at sites in England and Wales. Data are presented from thirty-five sites. (3) The length of the flight period, averaged over all years, was significantly shorter close to the edge of the range. (4) The flight period has become significantly longer during the years of monitoring and the mean flight date has become earlier. (5) Extension of the flight period and change in mean flight date were not significantly related to distance from the range edge. (6) It is suggested that the extension of the flight period and expansion of range are likely to be related. It is not known whether the relationship is causal or whether both parameters are influenced by further, unknown, factors.

TI SEARCH THEORY AND MATE CHOICE .2. MUTUAL INTERACTION, ASSORTATIVE

SO AMERICAN NATURALIST

AB I have extended the sequential search model for mate choice to include situations in which "passive" mates (males in most cases) can adjust their perceived fitness in accordance with the expected fitness from the "active" searching sex (in most cases females). For example, males may adjust the intensity of their display based on the fitnesses of searching females. Increases in adjusted male fitness are expected with increases in the average fitness of the searching females. When fitness is temporally discounted, then adjusted fitness increases with increasing discount rate. The adjusted "passive" (male) fitness will be less than the average fitness in the population of "active" (female) searchers. When the passive (male) sex shows individual variation in minimal fitness requirements they will accept in the searching active (female) mates, then the passive mates and active mates will show an assortative mating equilibrium. Similarly, if the adjustments to fitness in the passive mates depend on the perceived fitness of the opposite sex, then individuals will show assortative mating. If individuals of either sex show sustained variation in search characteristics, for example, variation in search costs, the probable number of encountered individuals, and/or the temporal onset of search, then variation in the fitness distribution in each sex can be maintained. Most behavioral sources of variation can be considered some form of informational disequilibrium.

AB Field observations on the effect of brook trout on an assemblage (sometimes described as a guild) of predatory salamanders suggest that the interactions among predators in small, headwater streams may be important in determining the structure of this assemblage of predators and thereby, the predation pressure felt by species at lower trophic levels. The interactions among predators and the potential role of those interactions in headwater stream communities was examined in 16 replicated experimental streams. I examined the ecological interactions among four species of co-occurring predators, adult Salvelinus fontinalis (98-122 mm standard length [SL]), larval Gyrinophilus porphyriticus (36-58 mm snout-vent length [SVL]), larval Eurycea bislineata (13-21 mm SVL), and Cambarus bartonii (6-17 mm carapace length [CL]), in an experiment that began in mid-June and ran for 3 mo. Brook trout affected both survival and growth of the larger salamander species, Gyrinophilus, and Salvelinus and Gyrinophilus affected the growth of the smaller salamander Eurycea and the crayfish Cambarus. The presence of Gyrinophilus had no effect on relative condition or fecundity of Salvelinus. Larger predators caused Cambarus and Eurycea to alter their activity levels and habitat, but Gyrinophilus made no adjustments to the presence of Salvelinus. Results demonstrate that Gyrinophilus is vulnerable to predation/aggression from brook trout, but that Eurycea and Cambarus are able to behaviorally avoid predation by both large predators at a significant cost to growth. The effect of brook trout on the two species of salamander in the experimental streams parallels the observed differences between salamanders in trout and trout-free waters in the field. Thus, interactions among predators in headwater streams directly and indirectly influence population dynamics of the interacting species by affecting survival, growth, behavior, and habitat use. The interactions among these predators can determine, in part, the predation environment experienced by individuals at lower trophic levels.

AB (1) We used an experimental protocol that allowed us to distinguish the relative influences of egg load and experience with host contact on foraging behaviour and clutch size decisions in the gregarious parasitoid Aphytis lingnanensis Compere. Egg load was manipulated without concurrent changes in experience by exploiting size-related variation in fecundity and by holding parasitoids at different temperatures to vary the rate of egg production. (2) Egg load influenced the intensity of searching behaviour. Parasitoids with smaller egg loads required more time within a foraging arena to discover hosts. (3) Parasitoids with smaller egg loads and parasitoids with a prior experience with host contact deposited smaller clutches. (4) Total host handling time was inversely related to parasitoid egg load. Increased egg load had a similar accelerating influence on each of the component activities that comprise host handling, including preparation for oviposition, oviposition, and post-oviposition grooming and resting. (5) The probability of successful parasitoid egg to adult development was independent of clutch size. Progeny size, however, decreased with increasing number of competing sibs. (6) A. lingnanensis clutch size decisions do not conform to the static expectations of a forager maximizing the fitness gained per egg, per host, or per unit time. Rather, clutch size decisions appeared to be fundamentally dynamic, responding to changes in parasitoid physiology (egg load) and the parasitoid's perception of host availability (experience).

AB The cost of sexual reproduction is material used to produce sperm that is unavailable for eggs. Producing sperm causes a decline in a species' growth rate. This cost of sex evolves as a result of sperm-sperm competition, and its magnitude depends on the ratio of monogamous to promiscuous matings. The benefit of sexual reproduction is a higher long-term growth rate in a fluctuating environment. This benefit exists because a sexual population has a less variable growth rate from generation to generation than an asexual population under the same conditions. The benefit of sex may exceed the cost of sex.

AB We compared nonbreeding finch densities (biomass) with seed abundance in arid and semiarid sites in Kenya, the United States, Brazil, and Argentina. Our objectives were to examine whether densities are limited by food, and whether a given seed abundance results in similar finch densities on different continents. We also wished to estimate the relative roles of food and other biotic factors in determining absolute density, by comparing the observed densities to those that might potentially be achieved on a given food supply. We used data from the finches of the Galapagos Islands as an approximate measure of the food-imposed upper limit to finch density because food there is short, emigration is restricted, and predation is reduced.
   Half the variation in finch densities across sites around the world could be explained by standing seed abundance, strongly suggesting that finches on mainlands are food limited. Densities on different continents were roughly similar when seed supplies were the same, despite the different phylogenetic origins of finches present. Nevertheless, average densities on mainlands were only about one-quarter the densities found on Galapagos islands. Low mainland densities possibly result from competition with other granivores (e.g., rodents and ants). However, mainland finches restrict their foraging to areas of relative safety, where seed densities may be lower than elsewhere, hinting that predation may also reduce densities. We suggest that predation and possibly other biotic factors limit mainland populations jointly with food, and do not simply reduce densities below a point where food is limiting.

AB Predicting the species density (number of species per unit area) of communities is a major goal of ecology. We present a regression model of species density on a local (0.25 m2) scale for the vegetation of freshwater shorelines in southwestern Quebec, Canada. Two attributes of the vegetation, the amount of aboveground biomass (in grams) and the proportion of the vegetation composed of obligate perennial species, predicted 76% of the variation in species density. The success of the predictor variables suggests that competitive intensity, as reflected in biomass levels, and the time elapsed since the last disturbance event, as reflected in the proportion of the vegetation composed of obligate perennials, are important determinants of local variation in species density. The model was then tested against independent data from shoreline vegetation in southeastern Ontario, Canada. There were no significant differences in the two data sets in their response to the two independent variables in the full model. However, only 42% of the variance in species density was explained in the combined data set.

AB We asked what factors keep the seed beetles Stator limbatus and S. pruininus (Bruchidae) restricted to different species of Acacia (Leguminosae) in sympatry. Factors assessed were plant microenvironment, interspecific competition, suitability of seeds for food, and enemy impact. Females selectively oviposited on seeds of their normal host when given a choice of acacia seeds in their normal host microenvironment. This result occurred whether seeds of the other acacia were offered with or without potential competitors in them. Host suitability was determined by comparing full-siblings on both acacias. Three performance variables were measured: (1) emergence per egg laid, (2) time to emergence, and (3) size of females. Stator limbatus performed best on its normal host in all three variables measured, while S. pruininus performed best on its normal host in emergence time but showed no difference in percent emergence or female size. We also assessed the impact of the egg parasite Uscana semifumipennis (Trichogrammatidae) on the two species of bruchids when the bruchids occurred in their normal hosts. Uscana attacked both bruchids at the same level (20% of eggs parasitized). Thus, the proximate determinant of locality restricted use of hosts is oviposition behavior, which we suggest relates best to differences in the suitability of hosts for larvae.

AB Many vertebrate populations exhibit large variation in natal dispersal distances. Murray (1967) showed by simulation that this variation need not have a genetic basis, but could result from two factors, chance variation in proximity to suitable sites, and competition with sibs and neighbors for those sites. Waser (1985) developed an analytic model of the first of these effects, which predicts the probability that an individual will locate an available site within any given distance, under two limiting search strategies. We extend the model to consider the distances traveled by multiple dispersers from a site, under both search strategies, and show that competitive exclusion by early dispersers can further increase the variation in dispersal distances. This incorporates the effects of competition with siblings, but not with dispersers from other natal sites, and brings us part way toward an analytic solution to Murray's original model. In addition, we discuss both the difficulties inherent in testing models of dispersal, and the importance of doing so for the understanding of various behavioral, population, and evolutionary processes.

AB Sympatric, conspecific animals may use resources in different ways: a population of foragers with a generalist diet may be composed of polyphagous individuals or of different types of oligophagous individuals. The sea slug Placida dendritica (Opisthobranchia: Ascoglossa) exhibited the latter pattern. Individual slugs from different green algal host species exhibited different rank preferences of and performances on host species. Feeding preferences did not change through time and were independent of Placida size. In addition, the slug's highly rigid feeding specificity was not modified through hunger level, algal condition, or social interactions with experienced conspecifics. Thus, Placida frequently died when maintained on "unfamiliar" host species that sympatric conspecifics consumed. The extreme trophic specialization of Placida suggests that the costs of switching host species may be extremely high in short-lived foragers.

AB We studied population responses to variation in larval density in a salamander (Ambystoma laterale) that breeds in splash pools on exposed rocky shorelines at Isle Royale, Michigan. Population densities and size distributions were sampled in the field with little error because the water is clear and the pools are kept free of sediment and vegetation by waves from winter storms on Lake Superior. We experimentally manipulated salamander densities in 12 natural pools (three replicates each of four densities) and simultaneously monitored salamander populations in 27 control pools on two islands. The experiment demonstrated that increasing density significantly reduced survival and growth, and increased the skew in the size distributions of individuals. Each of these responses was also observed in the undisturbed natural populations. Density effects were probably due to interference because (1) natural variation in the densities of prey taxa did not influence salamander performance in the experiment, (2) salamander density had no effect on prey availability, and (3) tail damage from attacks by conspecifics was widespread and positively correlated with density. We conclude that density dependence is commonplace in salamander larvae, and probably makes an important contribution to regulating the population size of Ambystoma laterale at Isle Royale.

AB I conducted a field test of the hypothesis that the dynamics of a predator-prey interaction should be affected by the number of interacting subpopulations within an assemblage. I used a "successful" biological control system, the phytophagous European red mite (Panonychus ulmi) and its predator, the phytoseiid mite Typhlodromus pyri. An orchard was established where apple trees were arranged in groups of 1, 4, or 16 and the dynamics of the mite populations on the trees followed over a season. The pests reached highest densities and were most persistent on trees in the largest groups. These results are explained in terms of an interaction between prey immigration/emigration and predation.

AB Water-filled treeholes provide an experimental setting for examining processes within an ecosystem, and influences of external factors on those processes. Using a limnological, experimental approach involving both natural tree holes and laboratory microcosms of the tree hole ecosystem, we identified and studied interacting, biotic processes, including dynamics of bacterial populations and variation in concentration of inorganic nutrients in tree hole water, and density-dependent competition for food among larvae of the mosquito Aedes triseriatus. We characterized the influence of external factors (inputs of leaf detritus and stemflow) on those processes. Analyses of water samples over time showed that tree hole water was rich and dynamic in nutrients (nitrite, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, and sulfate); ammonium was the dominant form of inorganic nitrogen. Variation in nutrient concentrations in microcosms depended upon exogenous inputs (leaf detritus and stemflow water), dilution of nutrients by stemflow, nutrient cycling processes (nitrification, denitrification, and sulfate reduction), and ammonium excretion by mosquito larvae. The densities of bacteria in tree hole water, obtained using direct counts of DAPI-fluorochrome stained samples and epifluorescence microscopy, ranged from 2.0 x 10(6) to 6.0 x 10(7) cells/mL, and in microcosms from 4.6 x 10(5) to 2.6 x 10(8) cells/mL. Experimentation mentation involving microcosms revealed that bacterial abundance was reduced by mosquito feeding and stemflow flushing. Further experiments showed that stemflow flushing increased mosquito productivity from microcosms several-fold and released mosquitoes from density-dependent competition. This effect was likely related to nutrient input and the simultaneous removal of toxic metabolites owing to inputs of stemflow water. We conclude that disturbance by a physical factor, stemflow, has a major influence on the interactions of nutrient dynamics, bacterial populations, and mosquito productivity in temperate tree-hole ecosystems.

AB In amphibians, evidence of kin recognition is limited to anurans, and neighbor recognition has only been documented in the territorial adults of a frog and a terrestrial salamander. We examined whether kin and neighbor recognition occur among larval salamanders (Ambystoma opacum: Ambystomatidae) that are known to be aggressive and cannibalistic. Our results indicate that larval A. opacum discriminate siblings from nonsiblings on the basis of four types of agonistic behavior. Larvae were significantly less aggressive and more submissive to siblings than to nonsiblings, regardless of whether larvae were presented with familiar or unfamiliar opponents. However, larvae made no distinction between familiar and unfamiliar individuals, which suggests that neighbor recognition does not occur in this species. Suppressed aggression and increased submission toward siblings in larval A. opacum may function to minimize harmful acts of aggression (biting and, ultimately, cannibalism) among siblings, thus enhancing the inclusive fitness of related individuals. This avoidance of siblings in larval salamanders, in contrast to the preferential aggregation of siblings in larval anurans, suggests a divergence in the possible function of kin recognition among amphibians.

AB I examine the nonlethal effects of a predator, an odonate larva (Anax junius), on competitive interactions between two species of anuran larvae (bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana, and green frog, R. clamitans). The anurans coexist in permanent ponds, which sometimes contain high densities of A. junius. Laboratory experiments indicated that in the absence of the predator, the two species were similar in competitive abilities and grew at virtually identical rates. In the presence of caged A. junius, however, the bullfrog grew to be larger and the green frog much smaller than when the predator was absent. Both species reacted to the presence of A. junius by reducing activity and altering space use. I argue that the reductions in activity in the presence of the predator affected the two species differently, which in turn changed competitive interactions. I discuss the relation between activity level and competitive ability, and the potential for predators to alter competitive relations by affecting activity levels of syntopic species (a higher order interaction). Vulnerability to predators also increases with activity, and I discuss the implications of an activity-mediated trade-off between growth rate and predation risk to interactions among anuran larvae. Finally, I present a method for quantitatively evaluating the net balance of (negative) direct mortality effects and (sometimes positive) indirect effects that alter competitive ability.

AB Two methods for estimating climatic response functions by measuring realized climatic niche spaces are compared. The first, direct gradient analysis, utilizes measures of abundance of the species at sites spanning the climatic range of the species' occurrence. The second, geographic distribution analysis, quantifies the proportion of the species' total areal occurrence that is found within each climatic zone. A geographic information system is used to digitize species distribution maps and climatic isoline maps, and to compute areas of coincidence. The methods are compared, using independent data sets, on eight species of Californian coastal sage scrub. The position of species maxima along climatic gradients coincided for 75% of the 24 cases in which climatic response from the two methods was compared. This result suggests that the quicker and less expensive geographic distribution analysis method may have value in generating first approximations to climatic response functions. The geographic distribution analysis method is also used to characterize the realized climatic niche space for an additional eight species of Californian hard chaparral. Most species' response surfaces from data throughout the species' range were approximately bell shaped along climatic axes, providing some confirmation of theoretical expectation. The smoothness of such curve shapes will, however, be somewhat sensitive to the scale of sample resolution.

AB To investigate adaptations for long-range acoustic communication in birds, I analyzed associations between broad categories of habitats and properties of territorial songs for eastern North American oscines. From published recordings, I obtained three frequency properties (maximal, minimal, and dominant) and three temporal properties of songs (presence of sidebands, presence of buzzes, minimal period of repeated elements). Sidebands and buzzes indicated rapid amplitude modulation of a carrier frequency. Habitats occupied by territorial males were classified into six categories (broad-leaved or mixed forest, coniferous forest, parkland or forest edge, shrubland, grassland, and marshes). Frequencies in songs correlated strongly with body size, which varied among habitats. Analysis of covariance and phylogenetic regression, after controlling for body size, revealed an association of maximal but not dominant or minimal frequencies with habitat. In contrast, the temporal properties of song were all strongly associated with habitat, even within phylogenetic groupings. These results suggest that the temporal properties of songs of many oscines have evolved to reduce the effects of reverberation in forested habitats. Exceptional species might have retained features of song subject to degradation to permit listeners to judge distances to singers. In addition, adaptations for acoustic communication in different habitats might include differences in the perception of songs.

AB (1) Field experiments were conducted to investigate movement and patch formation of the ectoparasitic snail, Boonea (= Odostomia) impressa (Say) on its oyster host, Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin). (2) Snails were contagiously distributed, typically positively spatially autocorrelated, and moved frequently among existing snail aggregates, choosing hosts independently of the hosts' physical characteristics. Despite movement of 20-30% of the snail population daily, snail patches persisted over periods of 2 weeks or more. (3) The distance between hosts was more important in determining the spatial distribution of snails in the host population than parasite crowding. When host density was high, movement of snails between snail patches reduced the variance in patch size as predicted by some models of ecological fitness, such as risk spreading. (4) Increased snail density did not affect the frequency of movement indicating hat crowding did not affect the size of snail patches over densities normally encountered in the field. A directionally biased random walk model for the parasite reproduced most physical characteristics of snail distribution including the decline in variance and, the persistence of snail patches. (5) By preferring to move frequently among existing aggregates, Boonea impressa choose to minimize the variance in the size of snail patches rather than minimizing movement and, hence, energy expenditure.

AB The vegetative and reproductive growth of tropical forest plants often occurs in short bursts separated by longer quiescent periods. Seasonal changes in moisture availability may be a cause and, if so, may cue growth in a proximate sense or limit growth in an ultimate sense. Two 2.25-ha plots of mature forest were irrigated for three consecutive dry seasons on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, to discriminate among the various possibilities. The responses of three Piper species and four Psychotria species are reported.
   Irrigation disrupted the timing of leaf flush for all seven species. Irrigation increased annual leaf production for just one species, however, and had no effect on annual inflorescence production for the Psychotria nor on stem radial growth. These responses are consistent with the hypothesis that water stress constrains the timing of growth while only rarely limiting total annual growth. However, leaf turgor potentials observed among control plants may not have been sufficiently low to constrain leaf and inflorescence production, and other effects of irrigation cannot be discounted. Possible phenological cues that were affected by irrigation include soil moisture content, air temperature, relative humidity, and the timing of nutrient inputs from decaying litter. There was no evidence that a "water stress requirement" must be met during the dry season before wet season budbreak. The gradual decay in synchrony for leaf production for all four Psychotria species suggests that endogenous rhythms contribute to growth periodicities in this genus.

AB (1) The recolonization of an area in east-central England by sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus (L.) was studied after the local population had been eliminated, almost certainly by organochlorine pesticides. Over a 10-year period, nest numbers increased rapidly to begin with and then more slowly, with a mean rate of 21% per year. (2) Over the whole 10 years, the estimated annual survival of breeders was at least 76% for males and 74% for females, and mean productivity was 2.1 young per nest. Throughout, the breeding population contained a large proportion of first-year birds, with an overall figure of 35% of All male breeders and 25% of all female breeders. As the breeding population grew, young raised in the area tended to disperse ever greater distances from their natal sites. (3) Comparison of the increasing population with stable and decreasing populations in southern Scotland showed that differences in population trend were associated mainly with differences in the recruitment of new breeders (greatest in the increasing and lowest in the decreasing population) and in age of first breeding (earliest in the increasing and latest in the decreasing population). There were also differences in dispersal distances (shorter in the increasing population), and in the annual survival of breeders (greater in the increasing population). In contrast, differences in breeding success between areas were slight, and non-significant.

AB We examine temporal variation in measures of developmental stability, such as the degree of fluctuating asymmetry and the number of phenotypic deviants per individual, in three populations of the common shrew Sorex araneus L. by using several characters of skeletal morphology.  We compare a population from central Siberia with a high-amplitude 4-yr cycle with a population from southern Finland with noncyclic dynamics.  The level of developmental stability varies significantly among the years in both populations.  In the cyclic population in Siberia, developmental stability is highly correlated with population density, suggesting that in this case high density (or something related to it) is the most important negative factor affecting breeding females.  In the noncyclic population in southern Finland we find no correlation between developmental stability and density.  In both cyclic and noncyclic populations, developmental stability correlates positively with breeding success, indicating that breeding success is affected by the physiological condition of breeding females.  Another relationship is found between developmental stability and natal dispersal (in eastern Finland), the rate of natal dispersal being highest when developmental stability is lowest.  Developmental stability may be used as another population parameter, providing integrated information on the various factors that may adversely affect breeding females in natural populations.

AB (1) Environmental heterogeneity has two components:  the overall variance of sites within an area, and the way in which the variance between sites changes with the distance separating them.  It can be studied indirectly through the measurement of physical attributes of the environment, or directly through the response of organisms to the environment.  Studies using direct bioassays are of two kinds:  implant studies, in which plants are grown in the natural environment, and explant studies, in which plants are grown in samples of the environment, such as soil cores, under controlled conditions.  Explant studies give conservative estimates of heterogeneity.
   (2) This paper describes explant trials within a 50-m x 50-m area of undisturbed Fagus grandifolia-Acer saccharum forest situated south-east of Montreal, Quebec.  Three sampling schemes were used:  random sampling, to yield an unbiased estimate of variation; nested sampling, to yield preliminary estimates of spatial structure (i.e. correlation of nearby sites); and grid sampling, to yield detailed information on structure at spatial scales of 50 m, 10 m and 1 m.  Two series of trials were conducted, a bioassay using Arabidopsis thaliana and another using Hordeum vulgare.  Two replicate soil cores for each of two genotypes of each species were collected at each site in each trial.  Plants were sown into these cores in the glasshouse, and several characters scored on each, including dry mass at harvest, which is closely related to reproductive success.
   (3) Random sampling gave substantial and significant estimates of environmental variance for most characters, including all measures of dry mass in both species.  The environmental correlation for dry mass scores was about 0.25-0.40.  Nested sampling showed that variance generally decreased from scales of 10 m through 1 m to 0.1 m.  Grid sampling showed that the variance among sites increases with the distance separating them.  The regressions of log variance on log distance were linear, with slopes, for the dry mass scores, of about 0.15-0.25.  Environmental structure was detected in this way even within 1-m quadrats among sites 0.1 m apart.
   (4) The correlation between sites decreases with increasing separation on all spatial scales examined.  Moreover, the correlation structure was independent of spatial scale:  correlation declined at the same rate at all scales, when distance is expressed as the absolute distance divided by the grid dimension.  Environments are about equally complex at all spatial scales.

AB (1) Sets of families of the annual herb Impatiens pallida were created by crossing random individuals from a natural population growing in an undisturbed Fagus grandifolia- Acer saccharum forest in Quebec.  Replicate samples of these families were then planted into random sites in the same area from which the parents had been collected.
   (2) Survival, growth and fecundity were scored in two experiments, conducted in similar Fagus-Acer habitats but in different locations and years.  Various measures of all three variables were positively correlated with seed size; large seeds sometimes gave rise to large and fecund plants but small seeds never did.
   (3) The fitness of most individuals was zero; a very small minority was highly fecund, and contributed most of the seed produced by the population.
   (4) Survival, growth and fecundity varied between sites within a 50-m x 50-m area:  there is substantial environmental variance at very small spatial scales in undisturbed natural environments.  This result extends previous work on physical and biological measures to random sets of native genotypes.
   (5) The environment is structured at very small spatial scales.  Nearby sites at scales of 1-10 m were positively correlated both because of trends extending over the study area as a whole and because of much smaller-scale trends causing local patchiness.

AB (1) Genetic change over time in a population of Luzula parviflora was investigated by germinating seeds from a seed bank that was time-stratified beneath a solifluction lobe at Eagle Creek, Alaska. The oldest subpopulation was inferred to be approximately 150 years old.
   (2) Seven censuses were conducted to compare morphological and growth traits between young (recently buried) and old subpopulations as well as between the young subpopulation and the active seed bank.
   (3) When plants which germinated directly from the seed bank were grown in a common environment, subpopulations differed for nearly all variables measured. Young subpopulation plants were initially smaller than plants from other subpopulations, but because of significantly higher growth rates, many of the differences in size were not significant by the final census.
   (4) Differences which may have been due to maternal/environmental effects were minimized by clonally replicating all genotypes from young and old buried subpopulations. Each genotype was subjected to three nutrient levels. For morphological traits that differed, the young subpopulation tended to be larger than either the plants from the active seed bank or the old subpopulation. In the same comparisons, growth rates of plants from the young subpopulation tended to be less. In addition, there was a tendency (P < 0.10) for the young subpopulation to respond differently to nutrient treatments.
   (5) Persistent phenotypic differences in both the common and multiple-environment experiments demonstrate genetic differences between different-aged subpopulations of L. parviflora. These differences may be the result of selection or drift acting over approximately 150 years.

AB We have little idea to what extent natural variation in the size-independent shape of animals might be owing to environmentally caused variation in whole-body development rate. In this study we experimentally manipulated development rates in both the larval and juvenile stages of the green tree frog, Hyla cinerea, by raising animals at different food levels. We studied the effect of this development-rate variation on that fraction of the variance of head width and of tibiofibula length that remains after removing snout-vent length as a covariate. The development rate of larvae raised at different food levels had no effect on their size-adjusted head width or tibiofibula length at metamorphosis. Similarly, the food-controlled rate at which juveniles developed had no influence on their shape at a larger size. We also raised small metamorphs as juveniles to determine whether, for head width and tibiofibula length, the relation between body part and snout-vent length among metamorphs (static allometry) has the same slope as that relation in growing juveniles (longitudinal allometry). For tibiofibula length, the two allometries are indistinguishable. For head width, the longitudinal allometry may be steeper than the static, but further studies are needed to confirm this result.

AB In the hummingbird-pollinated herb Ipomopsis aggregata, selection through male function during pollination favors wide corolla tubes. We explored the mechanisms behind this selection, using phenotypic selection analysis to compare effects of corolla width on two components of male pollination success, pollinator visit rate and pollen exported per visit. During single visits by captive hummingbirds, flowers with wider corollas exported more pollen, and more dye used as a pollen analogue, to stigmas of recipient flowers. Corolla width was less strongly related to visit rate in the field, and had no direct effect on visit rate after nectar production and corolla length were controlled for. Moreover, the phenotypic selection differential was 80% higher for the effect on pollen exported per visit, suggesting that this is the more important mechanism of selection.

AB Temporal variation in host availability between years may be the dominant parameter determining host associations in a large assemblage of pierid butterflies (Lepidoptera:  Pieridae) feeding on plants (Capparales) living in a seasonal environment (Morocco).  Stenophagous butterflies are associated with hosts whose densities are predictable from year to year.  In contrast, euryophagous consumers use both predictable and highly variable hosts that often occur at low densities.  There is little evidence for altered host-use patterns when consumer species co-occur.  Herbivore diet breadth and specificity are unrelated to consumer community composition and are better understood in terms of factors determining adaptation to habitats and potential hosts.  Two groups of potential hosts escape herbivory:  apparent, predictable species whose chemistry is probably atypical of Capparales and species with low apparency and low predictability.  These latter species are also generally unpalatable and unsuitable for larval growth, a finding that contradicts the widely held view that less apparent plants are more palatable than apparent plants.  We propose that the inverse relation between apparency and palatability observed in temperate-zone studies is an intermediate stage in an evolutionary trajectory leading to permanent escape from herbivory as herbivores lose adaptation to seldom encountered hosts.  Potential hosts may therefore escape herbivory by two evolutionary trajectories:  (1) acquisition of novel chemistry (or other trait) that is too different to be accomodated by existing variation in the consumer population (an escalation of the "arms race") and (2) reduction in apparency and predictability, or "ecological escape," followed by gradual accumulation of changes that herbivores are unable to track.

AB We have investigated the potential for genetic exchange by transformation within a Mojave Desert population of Bacillus subtilis.  Almost all strains surveyed were competent for transformation, and the strains varied over almost three orders of magnitude in their levels of competence.  This high degree of variation suggests that natural selection toward an optimal level of competence is, at most, very weak in this population.  Six of 24 competent strains showed sexual isolation from laboratory strain 168 (i.e., heterogamic transformation was reduced).  Direct crosses between selected pairs of Mojave strains indicated sexual isolation within the Mojave population.  Levels of sexual isolation observed within this population of B. subtilis were much less than those previously observed for transformation between named Bacillus species.  Sexual isolation between 168 and Mojave strains, and among Mojave strains, was due to differences in restriction-modification systems and to DNA sequence divergence.

AB The paleobiogeographic histories of three North Atlantic hermit crab lineages were compared with a single-copy DNA-DNA hybridization phylogeny of their symbiotic hydroid genus Hydractinia to test hypotheses of shared history between these host and symbiont lineages. A survey of the geologic literature suggests that two vicariance events in the Quaternary are responsible for existing range disjunctions of the host hermit crab lineages. The Hydractinia phylogeny revealed two distinct clades, one with a primarily northern and the other with a primarily southern distribution. In two of three cases, hydroids associated with closely related hermits on both sides of the range disjunction appear as sister taxa in the phylogeny. A linear scaling between a measure of hydroid sequence divergence and independent geologic estimates of the timing of the vicariant events believed to have established the hermit crab range disjunctions is consistent with the claim of temporal coincidence of cladogenic and vicariance events. These findings provide evidence for shared history of symbiotic associations in two of the three cases.

TI CONTACT SAMPLING FOR THE DETECTION OF INTERSPECIFIC ASSOCIATION - A
   COMPARISON IN 2 VEGETATION TYPES
SO JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID SAXICOLOUS LICHEN COMMUNITY; CANADIAN ROCKY-MOUNTAINS; ROCKSLIDE;
   PATTERN
AB (1) A community of saxicolous lichens and the seral communities of primary succession on subalpine moraines were compared with respect to (i) the treatment of 'no-contact' samples, (ii) the hypothesis of proportionality (that the probability of a species being a contact neighbour is proportional to its probability of being an initial sample), and (iii) the procedure for examining all pairwise associations.  The effect of spatial autocorrelation in the lichen data was evaluated, and the analysis was modified to accommodate the possibility of self-contact in the seral communities.
   (2) The data show that in the lichen community, treating uncolonized rock as if it were a species can be justified, and that while there is significant spatial autocorrelation, it does not have a large effect on the investigation of species pairs.
   (3) In the moraine communities, it was found that the number of species with significantly many no-contact samples declined from the youngest surface and that the interspecific associations among the major plant categories were remarkably consistent through the series of moraines.
   (4) In both kinds of vegetation, the proportionality hypothesis was rejected.  The analysis of data from these very different communities shows how the treatment of contact data can be modified to accommodate and evaluate the differences.

TI SEXUAL SIZE DIMORPHISM AND SIBLING COMPETITION - IMPLICATIONS FOR AVIAN

AB The blue-footed booby's (Sula nebouxii) first-hatched chick aggressively dominates and outgrows its sib and sometimes kills it when food is in short supply. Differential male mortality is expected since females grow to be 27% heavier than males and should have an advantage in sibling competition in mixed-sex broods. Surprisingly, when the male hatches first, even though his sister outgrows him, he usually sustains dominance over her throughout the nestling phase, and he grows and survives normally. When the sister hatches first, despite a large, persistent sibling size disparity the male grows and survives normally. These observations contradict the prevailing hypothesis that in sexually dimorphic birds that practice siblicidal brood reduction the smaller sex suffers differential mortality as the result of its disadvantage in sibling conflict in mixed-sex broods. Such species consequently are not expected to modify their primary sex ratio or associate sex with hatching order in response to biased mortality in brother-sister conflict.

TI ROVER - A STRATEGY FOR EXPLOITING COOPERATORS IN A PATCHY ENVIRONMENT

   EVOLUTION; RELATIVES; BEHAVIOR; OSTRACISM; MODEL; GAMES
AB We present a computer simulation that examines the dynamics of cooperative behavior in a patchy environment. A new defecting strategy called "ROVER" is introduced, which uses a rule analogous to the "marginal value" theorem to determine how long to stay in a patch. A wide range of parameter values allow ROVERs to invade a metapopulation of tit-for-tat strategists (TFT) and spread either to fixation or to a stable equilibrium in which ROVER is the majority strategy. Our model, along with previous models that invoke different mechanisms, suggests that even guarded forms of cooperation such as TFT are often vulnerable to invasion and that a stable mixture of cooperators and exploiters might be common in nature.

TI FRUGIVORY IN TREESHREWS (TUPAIA)
SO AMERICAN NATURALIST
LA English
DT Article
ID FOOD
AB Four species of treeshrews (Tupaia spp.) studied in the field in Sabah, Malaysia, show intense frugivory concentrated on small, soft, bird-dispersed fruits. Observations of a wild individual and captives of two species show that treeshrews reject indigestible fibers and other parts of fruits before swallowing the pulp. Transit times of fruit through the gut are rapid and body-size dependent, with mean times to first defecation of marker dye of 20 min (range, 13-29 min) for Tupaia minor (almost-equal-to 60 g mass), and 57 min (range, 38-73 min) for Tupaia tana (220 g mass). The intestine of Tupaia species consists of a long small intestine, rudimentary or no cecum, and a greatly reduced, narrow, smooth colon. The fruit-processing method, rapid food transit time, and gut morphology of treeshrews resemble those of frugivorous bats but are unlike those of small primates.

AB We investigated how fruit types, or combinations of fruit types and life forms, affect species number in the large, mostly tropical plant family Rubiaceae.  The aim to test the hypothesis that animal dispersal promotes species diversification in plants.  Information was compiled for 427 of the 630 genera in the family.  Analyses were based on genera and on groups of taxa derived from a cladistic study of chloroplast DNA variation in the family.  The results demonstrated that no single trait explains variation in species number.  Instead, certain combinations of dispersal modes and life forms promote species richness.  Genera consisting of (1) herbs with abiotic dispersal, (2) shrubs with animal dispersal, and (3) shrubs and trees with winged seeds were all characterized by comparatively large species numbers.  These results imply an association between seed dispersibility and rate of species diversification.

AB Two parapatric chromosomal races of the common shrew (Sorex araneus) in Poland differ in their complement of metacentric arm combinations:  hk, io, gr, nm (race IV), and hi, ko, gm, np (race II).  In hybrids, these eight race-diagnostic metacentrics form two randomly segregating complexes.  The first complex (C1) occurs in the form of a ring configuration ok/kh/hi/io, or a chain o/ok/kh/hi/i (when there is Robertsonian polymorphism of the element io).  The second complex (C2) always takes the form of a six-element chain configuration r/rg/gm/mn/np/p.  The C2 complex may be shortened to five or even four elements, when acrocentrics g, m and n are present.  In the contact zone we found shrews of pure races (race II or IV), as well as hybrids with C1 or C2 complexes, and recombinants hi, ko, gr, nm.  Complex heterozygotes are likely to suffer reduced fertility due to malsegregation at meiosis.  However, the C1 hybrids with ring configurations occur with a high frequency throughout the contact zone.  This suggest that their fitness is only slightly lowered relative to pure race individuals, in contrast to the hybrids with C1 or C2 chain configurations, which presumably have a more heavily reduced fertility.  On the other hand, at the center of the zone there is a high proportion of recombinants, which, being chromosomal homozygotes, should display normal meiotic segregation.  Furthermore, the high frequencies of recombinants within the contact zone should facilitate gene flow between the races.  The occurrence of recombinants plays a similar role as the appearance of the maximum frequencies of acrocentric homozygotes described in several contact zones of S. araneus.

AB We examined mtDNA and nuclear allozyme genotypes in hybrid populations formed from interbreeding of westslope cuthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki lewisi) and Yellowstone cutthroat trout (O. c. bouvieri). These subspecies show substantial genetic divergence (Nei's D = 0.30; mtDNA P = 0.02). Diagnostic alleles at multiple nuclear loci and two distinct mtDNA haplotypes segregate in the hybrids. Nuclear and mtDNA genotypes are largely randomly associated, although there is slight disequilibrium in both nuclear and cytonuclear measures in some samples. Consistent positive gametic disequilibria for three pairs of nuclear loci confirm one previously reported linkage, and indicate two more. Allele frequencies provide no evidence for selection on individual chromosome segments. However, westslope mtDNA haplotype frequencies exceed westslope nuclear allele frequencies in all samples. This may be explained by differences in the frequency of occurrence of reciprocal F1 matings, by viability, fertility, or sex ratio differences in the progeny of reciprocal matings, or by weak selection on mtDNA haplotypes.

AB Efforts to detect effects of cytoplasmic genes are confounded by the problem of partitioning nuclear and cytoplasmic effects. In this study we test for effects of mtDNA haplotype on development in hybrid populations of cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarki) with randomly associated nuclear and mtDNA genotypes. We have previously described several intraspecific hybrid swarms formed by interbreeding of westslope cutthroat trout (O. c. lewisi) and Yellowstone cutthroat trout (O. c. bouvieri). Genetic distance between these subspecies is high (Nei's D = 0.30; mtDNA P = 0.02), and diagnostic alleles at multiple nuclear loci and two distinct mtDNA haplotypes are present in the hybrids. Historical associations between alleles at nuclear loci and between cytotypes and nuclear alleles have largely decayed. We test for differences in meristic characters between fish with alternate mtDNA haplotypes. Counts and fluctuating bilateral asymmetry for these characters have been previously shown to be sensitive indicators of genetic differences that affect development. No differences were found between mtDNA types in meristic counts or fluctuating asymmetry. Therefore, the alternate mtDNA haplotypes had no detectable effect on development as measured by meristic counts in these hybrid populations. However, diagnostic alleles at one nuclear allozyme locus (CK-C1) were associated with several fin ray counts.

AB Migration in insects usually occurs prereproductively so the precalling period, between emergence and the first release of pheromone, determines the number of nights over which females of migrants such as Mythimna separata can express their migratory potential.  Precalling periods (PCP's) ranged from 3 to 21 nights in F1 females from insects collected in the field in eastern China.  As technical problems precluded the use of a sib-analysis design, the genetic basis of this variation was investigated by analysis of the correlation between daughters' and mother's PCP's and by selection in isofemale lines followed by reciprocal crosses.  The results of these analyses indicated that PCP is strongly influenced by genes located on the X chromosome, inherited from the male parent in Lepidoptera.  Genetic regulation of migratory potential, of which PCP is a crucial component, can be expected to evolve in tropical species such as Mythimna separata, whose larval habitats are associated with unpredictable tropical rainfall.  This species has no preimaginal diapause but makes regular seasonal incursions every spring and early summer to high temperate latitudes at which it cannot overwinter.  Where migrants are carried by winds, as occurs in these migrations, the predominantly poleward winds at this time of year must create a genetic cline across latitude, in which migratory potential of the summer populations founded by the migrants increases with increasing latitude.  We suggest that X-linkage of genes influencing PCP may reduce the genetic load associated with this polymorphism by reducing the frequencies of inappropriate PCP genotypes in these summer populations.  Thus, in autumn when winds are predominantly northerly, fewer individuals at any latitude will lack the capability to make the return journey southward.  Some support for this model is provided by the observed distributions of PCP's of F1 females from moths collected in the field in central and northern eastern China.  If X-linkage of genes influencing PCP contributes to the stability of these migratory cycles, it can be expected in other species with similar migratory strategies.

AB In this article we show that, for host-parasitoid interactions in a heterogeneous environment and with discrete generations, the dynamic effects of any patterns of distribution of searching parasitoids can be assessed within a common, simple framework. The populations are regulated if the distribution of searching parasitoids is sufficiently heterogeneous. Specifically, the square of the coefficient of variation (CV2) of the searching parasitoids per host must exceed unity. This criterion is demonstrated to apply approximately, in general and also in several specific cases. We further show that CV2 may be partitioned into a density-dependent component caused by the response of parasitoids to host density per patch and a density-independent component. Population regulation is enhanced as much by density-independent as by density-dependent heterogeneity.

TI EFFECTS OF THE TIMING OF MULTIPLE GRAZINGS BY GEESE ON NET ABOVEGROUND
   PRIMARY PRODUCTION OF SWARDS OF PUCCINELLIA-PHRYGANODES

   NITROGEN; MODEL; DEFOLIATION; VEGETATION; RESPONSES
AB (1) The effects of the frequency and timing of multiple grazings (including faecal input) by captive goslings of the lesser snow goose on net above-ground primary production (NAPP) and shoot nitrogen content of swards of the forage grass, Puccinellia phryganodes were examined.  The effects of clipping and addition of nitrogen on the growth in pots of individual tillers of this grass were also investigated in a factorial experiment designed to separate the effects of each treatment.  The experimental design of both investigations was closely based on the foraging behaviour of wild geese on Puccinellia swards.
   (2) The clipping of leaves per se which mimicked the leaf demography of shoots grazed by wild birds had a detrimental effect on shoot growth and NAPP.  Addition of nutrients ameliorated the adverse effects of clipping on shoot growth.  Plants which received nutrients, but whose leaves were not clipped, produced the highest amount of above-ground biomass.
   (3) During the summer of 1987 plots of Puccinellia were either grazed once every 12 days (one to six occasions), or once every 24 days (two or three occasions), or on three occasions at intervals of 12 days late in the season after the wild geese had left the marsh.  Plots grazed on three occasions at intervals of 12 days from late June to early August during the period of rapid growth of above-ground biomass most closely mimicked the foraging behaviour of the wild geese.
   (4) Seasonal cumulative NAPP in 1987 was significantly higher in plots grazed on three occasions than in ungrazed plots, plots grazed once, or plots grazed repeatedly throughout the season.  In 1988 plots were not grazed and a similar trend in NAPP was obtained, except that the NAPP of plots grazed late in the season in 1987 was low.  The departure of wild geese in early August may be necessary if swards are to recover from the effects of defoliation.
   (5) During the summer of 1987, forage quality (N content) and NAPP together were highest in plots grazed on three occasions at intervals of 12 days - the treatment closest to the foraging pattern of wild birds.  In July of the following summer shoot nitrogen content did not differ among the exclosed plots, irrespective of the treatment in 1987, and all values were lower than that for shoots from adjacent swards which were grazed and fertilized by wild geese.
   (6) The results show that NAPP and the nutritional quality of forage are dependent on faecal input, the number and timing of the grazing events and the phenology of plant growth.  The role of the herbivore in maintaining grazing lawns of Puccinellia is discussed.

ID NATURAL-POPULATIONS; SIMULANS
AB Drosophila melanogaster males were collected from two field sites and tested for territorial success in the laboratory. The territorial and nonterritorial males were crossed with females from an inbred strain, and progeny cultured in the laboratory were characterized for territorial success. For one field site, progeny from territorial parents were relatively more successful than progeny from nonterritorial parents, indicating heritable variation among males from the field. No heritable differences were found for the other field site. Evidence for heritable variation in this one-generation test was also obtained for males from a laboratory stock. Territorial males from the field sites and from laboratory cultures were heavier than nonterritorial males. However, heritability for body weight in the field was low, and weight did not contribute to heritable variation in territorial success except in experiments with the laboratory stock.

   POPULATION; SELECTION; POLYMORPHISM
AB In self-compatible plants the selfing rate is directly related to the relative amounts of self and outcross pollen deposited on receptive stigmas.  As a result, the fraction of ovules self-fertilized by a particular plant is a function not only of the fraction of the pollen it produces that is deposited on its own stigma but of the amount of pollen exported by other plants in the population and the probability that exported pollen successfully reaches its receptive stigmas.  Thus, the reproductive success of different genotypes is both frequency- and density-dependent.  In dense populations in which the probability of successful pollen export is relatively high, complete outcrossing is evolutionarily stable, even in the absence of inbreeding depression.  In sparse populations, genotypes that increase the selfing rate in the population may increase in frequency, but genotypes that cause complete selfing can never become fixed, unless reproduction is pollen-limited.  Whenever self-fertilization can evolve, mixed mating systems are evolutionarily stable.  This model predicts that selfing rates should be both density-dependent and frequency-dependent.  The limited data currently available are consistent with both of these predictions, although there are several complications in attempting to apply the mass-action model directly to biotically pollinated plants.  These results suggest that the probability of successful outcrossed reproduction plays at least as important a role in determining the mating system of plants as inbreeding depression.

AB (1) Modes of recruitment of herbs and shrubs, and the extent to which availability of propagules affected distribution of the various species after disturbance were examined in a field experiment of canopy removal at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, U.S.A.
   (2) The most common shrubs after canopy removal were Rubus idaeus and Viburnum alnifolium; the most common herbs were Aster acuminatus, Dennstaedtia punctilobula and Dryopteris spinulosa. All of the first-year recruitment of Rubus occurred through germination of buried seeds. In contrast, first-year recruitment of the other four species occurred through survival of pre-existing stems or expansion of pre-existing patches, or both. Recruitment of Viburnum, Dennstaedtia and Dryopteris during the second and third years of regrowth continued to be strictly vegetative, whilst recruitment of Aster occurred through newly dispersed seeds as well as rhizomatous growth.
   (3) The spatial distribution of herbs and shrubs after overstorey removal was strongly related to the location of predecessors before removal. During the first year of regrowth, the locations of almost all stems of all species except Rubus were associated with presence of pre-disturbance individuals on that site.
   (4) Collections from seed traps indicate that seed production in the site with overstorey removal was higher than in the surrounding, intact forest for most species. Some unoccupied sites were colonized by these seeds during the second and third years of regrowth.
   (5) The overall distribution of woodland species such as Viburnum alnifolium, Dryopteris spinulosa and Lycopodium lucidulum was unaffected by overstorey removal. After three years of regrowth, the spatial distribution of these species was entirely restricted to locations where predecessors grew in the pre-disturbance forest.
   (6) Life-history traits of herbs and shrubs at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest closely corresponded to Grime's 'competitive', 'stress-tolerant' and 'ruderal' strategies. It appears that ruderals obscured but did not affect spatial patterns of stress-tolerators and competitors that were present in the forest before overstorey removal. This suggests that, in the absence of physical destruction to existing herbs and shrubs in the forest, 'disturbance' has, in the short term at least, little effect on spatial patterns of some understorey species.

AB We use a general additive quantitative genetic model to study the evolution of costly female mate choice by the "handicap" principle.  Two necessary conditions must be satisfied for costly preference to evolve.  The conditions are (i) biased mutation pressure on viability and (ii) a direct relationship between the degree of expression of the male mating character and viability.  These two conditions explain the success and failure of previous models of the "handicap" principle.  Our model also applies to other sources of fitness variation like migration and host-parasite coevolution, which cause effects equivalent to biased mutation.

AB (1) Fruits of the five common fleshy-fruit plant species in an Israeli Mediterranean scrub were removed by twelve bird species of which seven were transients.
   (2) Fruits of shrubs Rhamnus palaestinus and Pistacia lentiscus were removed mainly by all-year residents, while fruits of a semi-parasitic dwarf shrub Osyris alba, a vine Rubia tenuifolia and a tree P. palaestina were removed mainly by transients.
   (3) Rhamnus was visited by most bird species more often than expected from its relative abundance, and the highest density of bird-deposited seeds was found under Rhamnus.  Scrub clearings were largely avoided by birds.
   (4) Fruits of the two shrub species were deposited under conspecific adults more often, but reached a greater diversity of habitat types, than the semi-parasitic shrub and the vine, which depended closely on other plants.
   (5) Fruits of the semi-parasite and the vine may reach few but high-quality deposition sites, whereas those of bushes and trees reach a wider variety of habitat types.
   (6) No relation was found between body size, taxonomic affinity or status (resident or transient) of a bird species, and its dispersing efficiency.
   (7) It is concluded that, as no plant species is more successfully dispersed than another, but a trade-off may exist in dispersal attributes, there is also no 'ideal' disperser bird species.

AB Using both multivariate and univariate regression techniques, I measured selection acting through female reproductive success in two hermaphroditic species with precise pollen placement but different pollinators: hummingbird-pollinated Lobelia cardinalis and bumblebee-pollinated L. siphilitica. Six traits were analyzed in two populations of L. cardinalis and one population of L. siphilitica: flower number, mean number of flowers open per day, inflorescence height, number of days in flower, median-flower date and nectary-stigma distance. In another study it was found that female reproductive success in one population of L. cardinalis was much less pollen limited than in the other two populations, and it was therefore expected that selection of female reproductive traits in this population would be weaker. In this univariate analyses correlations caused nearly all traits to have significant directional selection coefficients. However, in the multivariate analyses no traits in L. siphilitica experienced directional or quadratic selection. Selection acted differently in the two L. cardinalis populations. The less pollen-limited population experienced positive directional selection on flower number median-flower date, while in the other L. cardinalis population there was positive directional selection on flower number and nectar-stigma distance and both positive directional and positive quadratic selection on height. The functional significance of floral traits in these two species and the probable effect of increased sample sizes are discussed.

ID SEED-DISPERSAL
AB (1) Diaspore weight and dispersal were measured in 229 plant species of the central Australian arid zone.  The frequency distribution of log diaspore sizes was unimodal, as has been observed for other habitats.  The quantity of reserve (embryo plus endosperm) stored in the seed was related to the weight of the dispersal unit.
   (2) Reserve weight was greater for woody species than for herbaceous species.  Within each growth form, there was no clear relationship between perenniality and reserve weight.
   (3) Most graminoids were wind dispersed, and elaiosomes for ant dispersal were more common among the woody species.  The number of species with unassisted seeds was low in central Australia, when compared with other arid communities.

AB Do genetic correlations among phenotypic characters reflect developmental organization or functional coadaptation of the characters?  We test these hypotheses for the wing melanin pattern of Pieris occidentalis butterflies, by comparing estimated genetic correlations among wing melanin characters with a priori predictions of the developmental organization and the functional (thermoregulatory) organization of melanin pattern.  There were significant broad-sense heritabilities and significant genetic correlations for most melanin characters.  Matrix correlation tests revealed significant agreement between the observed genetic correlations and both developmental and functional predictions in most cases; this occurred even when the overlap between developmental and functional predictions was eliminated.  These results suggest that both developmental organization and functional coadaptation among melanin characters influence the genetic correlation structure of melanin pattern in this species.  These results have two important implications for the evolution of melanin pattern in P. occidentalis and other butterflies:  1) most phenotypic variation in pattern may reflect variation among, rather than within, sets of developmentally homologous wing melanin characters; and 2) in a changing selective environment, genetic correlations may retard the disruption of functionally coupled melanin characters, thus affecting the evolutionary response to selection.

TI OPTIMAL OFFSPRING PROVISIONING WHEN RESOURCES ARE NOT PREDICTABLE
SO AMERICAN NATURALIST
LA English
DT Article
ID CLUTCH SIZE; NUMBER; ENVIRONMENT; SELECTION; ABORTION
AB I begin with two basic premises:  first, that organisms frequently must base offspring allocation decisions on expected levels of resource availability, and second, that allocated resources are at least partially nonrecoverable.  Given this, how many offspring should an organism begin to provision?  Here, I develop an analytical model to address this question.  In this model I make offspring fitness a function of the integral of all possible resource states, multiplied by the probability density function for parental resources.  Parental fitness is the product of offspring fitness and the number of offspring.  I solve this basic model numerically and find that the optimum offspring number for iteroparous organisms is not strongly affected by variance.  In contrast, semelparous organisms maximize their expected reproductive success by initiating fewer offspring as variance increases.  I use my results to provide a theoretical explanation for seasonal seed size decline in plants.

TI KEYSTONE CHARACTERISTICS OF BIRD-DISPERSED FICUS IN A MALAYSIAN LOWLAND
   RAIN-FOREST
SO JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PHENOLOGY; FIGS
AB (1) The fruiting of 307 Ficus trees in 74 ha of lowland forest at Kuala Lompat, Malaysia, was monitored monthly for 3 years.
   (2) The guild of twenty-nine species of bird-dispersed Ficus exhibited asynchronous fruiting phenology, with no recurrent annual pattern.  Fig crops were available in all 36 months of the study, but whilst medium-sized and small-sized figs were always available, crops of large-fruited (mean fig diameter of > 20 mm) bird-dispersed Ficus were scarce, with only around sixteen fruiting events year-1 km-2 of forest.
   (3) Seven Ficus species exhibited fruiting patterns which suggested some seasonality, with significantly more fruitings than expected in the period February-April.  This period is before the usual major annual community peak in fruiting, at a time when other fruit resources are relatively scarce.
   (4) Ficus forms a uniquely important group within the subset of plants with bird-eaten fruit because of their numerical abundance, intra-crown synchrony of fruit ripening, relatively short intervals between fruiting, large crop sizes and intra-population fruiting asynchrony.  These characteristics, combined with their availability at times when other fruits are scarce, makes Ficus a most important keystone plant resource.
   (5) For frugivores to be dependent on figs in South-east Asia they need to be wide-ranging.  Frugivorous birds with small home ranges may have to rely on keystone plants other than Ficus during some periods of fruit scarcity.

AB (1) Variation in the physical environment was investigated at scales of 0.1-50 m in the understorey of a southern Quebec forest, dominated by Acer saccharum and Fagus grandifolia, to determine if the spatial heterogeneity necessary to account for the evolution and maintenance of genetically diverse populations of forest plants exists in this old-growth forest.
   (2) To characterize spatial heterogeneity in the understorey during the late summer, soil pH and the availability of K+ and NO3- ions in the soil solution were measured.  The sampling programme involved analysis of replicate soil cores at 555 points dispersed throughout a 50-m x 50-m area in a valley previously undisturbed by human activities.
   (3) A geostatistical analysis demonstrated that all three edaphic measures are predictably similar up to about 2 m, but that at greater distances the predictability is negligible and the environmental regime is best estimated by the mean for the site as a whole.
   (4) These results demonstrate environmental variance at scales relevant to seed dispersal and genetic neighbourhood size in understorey herbs such as Impatiens.  This spatial pattern of environmental variation may contribute to the maintenance of genetic variation through selection of locally adapted subpopulations.

ID TUNDRA; ACCUMULATION; ALASKA
AB (1) In cold environments, such as Arctic tundra, buried seeds can potentially persist in the soil for centuries or millennia. The possibility of obtaining time-stratified seed populations from Alaskan tundra was investigated in two ways. First, a deep layer of organic soil was sampled from a vertical profile through accumulating peat in Eriophorum-tussock tundra. Secondly, an organic soil buried by the slow, downslope erosional deposition of mineral soil (solifluction) was sampled; the progression of samples taken upslope under the deposit represented progressively older buried soils.
   (2) Both buried organic soils contained viable seeds, as determined with a germination assay. In Eriophorum-tussock tundra, only seeds of Carex bigelowii were found at depth. Dating by accelerator mass spectrometry of seed coats removed from these seeds showed that they were essentially modern. Several species germinated from the solifluction-buried organic soil, with viable seeds of Luzula parviflora and Carex bigelowii being found in the greatest numbers and persisting for the longest time. Dating of seed coats showed that these seeds persisted for at least 197 +/- 80 years, although viable seeds were also found associated with wood fragments 295 +/- 75 years old.
   (3) The buried seed profile under the solifluction lobe represents a 'time transect' two or three centuries long. Because seed coats were dated without killing the emerging seedling, this time transect can be used to make direct ecological genetic comparisons of past and present individuals from a single population.

   STRATEGIES; DENSITY; SCALE
AB The fitness of white-footed mice living in nest boxes was monitored in patches of forest, edge, and fence-row habitat to test theories of habitat selection. Reproductive success was significantly greater in the forest than in the other two habitats, a result that supports theories based on exclusive access to resources. The frequency distributions of litter production and recruitment success within habitats were not significantly different from random expectation. All litters produced in a particular habitat had equal chances of success, regardless of which box they were born in. Small-scale patches within habitats appear not to differ in the fitness achieved by individual colonists. The pattern of habitat use was inconsistent with the selection of individual breeding sites that maximize reproductive success. Site selection appears to be modified by processes acting at larger spatial scales. This interpretation is in agreement with census data that demonstrate the role of spatial scale as a predictor of density in these and other small mammals.

AB A two-locus diploid model of sexual selection is presented in which the two loci govern, respectively, a trait limited in expression in one sex (generally male) and the mating preferences of the other sex (generally female).  The viability of a male depends on its genotype at the trait locus.  In contrast, all females are equally viable and all individuals are equally fertile with respect to the two loci.  Near fixation at both loci, evolution at the mating locus is neutral and hence a new mating preference allele will increase only through random genetic drift or through a correlated response to the increase of a new advantageous trait allele.  If, however, a polymorphism is already maintained at the trait locus through overdominance in fitness then the increase of a rare preference allele depends only on the recombination rate between the loci and not on the new preference scheme.

AB We introduce a method for estimating the parameters of simple host-parasitoid models from field data relating percent parasitism to local host density per patch. By using these parameters, the coefficient of variation (CV2) of the density of searching parasitoids can be calculated. This quantity is important because a general criterion for heterogeneity to regulate discrete-generation host-parasitoid models is that CV2 > 1 (Hassell et al. 1991). The method further allows one to partition CV2 into two components: a host-density-dependent component caused by nonzero covariance between the spatial distributions of the host and parasitoid (HDD), and a component that is independent of host density (HDI). By using this method, we have analyzed 34 sets of published data. Heterogeneity is sufficient to regulate the populations (CV2 > 1) in approximately one-third of the published cases. In approximately 90% of the cases in which CV2 > 1, the density-independent component of CV2 is considerably more important for population regulation than the direct or inverse density-dependent components.

AB In this study we examine the cytoplasmic inheritance patterns of an interspecific hybridizing population of Fremont and narrowleaf cottonwoods, using mitochondrial DNA. Three mitochondrial probes showing polymorphisms were used to distinguish between trees of known nuclear inheritance. Every tree screened had only one cytoplasmic genotype, either Fremont or narrowleaf. Thus, these results demonstrate that mitochondria are uniparentally inherited in these trees. Previous studies of the nuclear inheritance of this interspecific hybridizing population of cottonwood trees indicated an asymmetry in the frequency of parental genes. Using mitochondrial markers we tested one hypothesis potentially responsible for this asymmetric distribution (i.e., trees of mixed genotypes will be sterile or will not survive if their cytoplasm is derived from one or the other parent). Our results, however, show that both Fremont and narrowleaf mitochondrial markers are found in trees with mixed nuclear genotypes. Thus, nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibilities do not appear to account for the asymmetric distribution of nuclear genotypes within the hybrid swarm. An alternative explanation for the observed asymmetric distribution of nuclear genotypes is advanced. Although nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibilities do not appear to account for the asymmetric distribution of nuclear genotypes within the hybrid swarm. An alternative explanation for the observed asymmetric distribution of nuclear genotypes is advanced. Although nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibilities do not appear to explain the asymmetric distribution of nuclear alleles within the hybrid zone, nonrandom associations between nuclear and cytoplasmic genotypes do exist. For example, all F1 hybrids had Fremont mitochondrial genotypes. Furthermore, backcrosses between F1 hybrid and narrowleaf trees have a higher than expected proportion of heterozygous loci and a higher than expected proportion of Fremont mitochondria. We propose that seeds, seedlings, or trees with high proportions of heterozygous loci are at a disadvantage unless they also have the Fremont mitochondrial genotype. While it is generally difficult to infer dynamic processes from static patterns, studies such as ours enable one to gain new insights to the dynamics of plant hybrid zones. A hybridization pattern of decreasingly complex backcrosses as one proceeds from higher to lower elevation within the hybrid swarm, a residue of Fremont cytoplasmic DNA within the pure narrowleaf population, and the unidirectional nature of these crosses suggest that the narrowleaf population may be spreading down the canyon and the Fremont population receding. The eventual fate of the hybrid zone, in relation to these processes, is discussed.

AB Local mate competition theory has emphasized the importance of sperm competition in determining individual patterns of sex allocation in outcrossing hermaphrodites. In this article I develop a more general model of local mate competition that incorporates fertilization efficiency. I use this model to predict interspecific differences in sex allocation. These predictions are tested by using dry weights of male and female gonadal tissue from six species of hermaphroditic sea basses. In all four paired comparisons, when two of the three factors presumed to determine sex allocation patterns are relatively constant, the shift in sex allocation between species is correctly predicted. Neither levels of sperm competition nor the expected effects of spawning behavior on fertilization efficiency can account for all of the differences in sex allocation, although sperm competition does correctly predict the most differences in sex allocation. Overall, the interspecific differences are predicted by either the level of sperm competition or by factors affecting fertilization efficiency. A broader view of local mate competition that includes aspects of sperm competition and the dynamics of fertilization should ultimately provide more accurate predictions of sex allocation in hermaphroditic organisms.

AB (1) The pollinating efficiency of moths was examined during four seasons by counting the number of pollen grains that individual moths deposited on the stigmas of virgin female flowers of Silene vulgaris.
   (2) Experimental pollination showed that c. 150 pollen grains per flower were required to achieve the average natural full seed-set in the plant population.  Although 57% of the flower-visiting moths deposited pollen, only about 10% of the moth visits delivered greater-than-or-equal-to 150 pollen grains in one visit to virgin female flowers, indicating that seed-set usually originated from multiple pollinator visits.
   (3) Pollen receipt indicated pollination by a guild of noctuid and sphingid moths.  The abundance of the dominating pollinator species varied strongly between years.
   (4) Most species deposited about the same mean number of pollen grains, although they were taxonomically diverse and had different flower-visiting behaviours and proboscis lengths.  Even noctuid moths of the genus Hadena, known as associated larval seed predators of S. vulgaris, were not especially frequent or efficient pollinators despite the fact that these moths influence their larval food resource through pollination.
   (5) The annual and seasonal variation in abundance among pollinator species and lack of variation in pollination efficiency among them are factors which counteract specializational trends and control evolutionary retention of plastic and unspecialized floral traits in S. vulgaris.  They thereby provide an option for opportunistic responses in this species.

TI DYNAMICS OF SOIL-STORED SEED BANKS OF 6 SHRUBS IN FIRE-PRONE DUNE FYNBOS

AB (1) Soil-stored seed banks of six non-sprouting dominant shrubs with small seeds (0.4-4.6 mg) were determined in three mature (13-year-old) dune fynbos communities each autumn for 3 successive years.  A comparison of methods of estimating seed banks by counting seeds vs. counting germinants showed neither method to be superior; a knowledge of other life-history characteristics, such as seed input and germination cues, was essential in evaluating results.
   (2) Instead of the large seed banks typical of shrubs from fire-prone vegetation, dune fynbos shrubs had relatively small seed banks:  the highest mean seed density recorded was 825 +/- 1187 seed m-2 (mean +/- 1S.D., n = 50).  Shrub and community seed banks showed no significant increments over 3 years.  After a fire, seed banks were depleted by more than half.
   (3) Removal of seeds by ants and rodents from the soil surface was relatively rapid.  Almost all seed had been removed from open depots by the sixth day of cafeteria experiments.  Removal rates by ants of elaiosome-bearing (myrmecochorous) seeds was not significantly different from non-myrmecochorous species; neither were the intact seeds of a myrmecochorous species removed faster than the seeds from which the elaiosome had been removed.  The results indicate that seeds are removed by ants as much for granivory as for myrmecochory.
   (4) Seed burials showed that seed bank losses due to decay and germination varied widely amongst species and with seed age, with losses ranging from 12% to 93%.
   (5) There were large differences in seed-bank sizes between the six species which could be attributed to their life-history attributes such as seed production, dispersal mode and germination requirements.  The myrmecochorous species with relatively large and poorly dispersed seeds, small to moderate seed production and seed-bank sizes, and germination and seedling establishment cued to post-fire conditions, were most vulnerable to local extinction.

AB Fisher's runaway process is the standard explanation of the evolution of exaggerated female preferences.  But mathematical formulations of Fisher's process (haploid and additive diploid) show it cannot cause stable exaggeration if female preference carries a cost.  At equilibrium female fitness must be maximized.  Our analysis shows that evolutionary stable exaggeration of female preference can be achieved if mutation pressure on the male character is biased, that is, mutation has a directional effect.  At this equilibrium female fitness is not maximized.  We discuss the reasons and evidence for believing that mutation pressure is typically biased.  Our analysis highlights the previously unacknowledged importance of biased mutation for sexual selection.

AB (1) Seeds of thirteen herbaceous species from chalk grassland in The Netherlands were buried in their natural habitat.  Samples were exhumed at regular intervals over 3 years.  Mortality and germination in situ were recorded.  The surviving seeds were tested for germination in light and darkness and with different temperature regimes.
   (2) Seed mortality was low, except in Gentianella germanica and Origanum vulgare.  In Carlina vulgaris, Leontodon hispidus and Scabiosa columbaria disappearance of seeds was mainly caused by germination in the soil.
   (3) Freshly harvested seeds of Arenaria serpyllifolia and Linum catharticum had an absolute light requirement for germination which was retained during burial.  Burial induced a light requirement for germination in Origanum vulgare.
   (4) All species that germinated showed some degree of primary dormancy and seasonal change in secondary dormancy.  This was most pronounced in short-lived species.
   (5) The seasonal change in secondary dormancy of surviving seeds was most evident either from germinability in light (Arenaria, Daucus carota and Linum), in darkness (Carlina, Leontodon, Plantago lanceolata and Scabiosa), or both (Centaurea scabiosa).  The response of the seeds to temperature also varied seasonally.
   (6) The amplitude of seasonal change in dormancy tended to decrease during the 3-year of burial in some species (Arenaria, Linum and Daucus).
   (7) Rhinanthus minor and R. alectorolophus seeds only germinated in late winter and were dormant during the remainder of the year.

AB (1) This study determined the minimum light requirements and the photo-adaptive behaviour of submerged freshwater macrophytes representing different taxonomic groups (charophytes, bryophytes and angiosperms), and their depth distributions in the field. Relative growth rates (mu) of macrophytes were measured in the laboratory at photon flux densities (PFD) between 0 and 105-mu-mol m-2 s-1 at 7-degrees-C. Dark respiration rates were measured subsequently on the adapted plants.
   (2) Mean rates of carbon loss were low in plants kept in the dark (5.9 mmol C mol-1 cell C day-1) and corresponded to experimental dark respiration rates. Mean dark respiration was only 7.0 mmol C mol-1 cell C day-1 at the light compensation point (I(c)), which was on average 6.9-mu-mol m-2 s-1. Light compensation points and respiration rates were variable within species collected at different times and approached the variability among species. The growth efficiency in low light (the slope of mu vs. PFD) varied less within species and showed differences among species which were positively related to the maximum growth rate at high light. Overall, macrophyte species with different depth distribution or taxonomy did not differ systematically in dark respiration and growth performance in low light in the experiments.
   (3) Experimental I(c) levels of the two charophyte species, converted to annual means (78-165 mol m-2 year-1), corresponded to annual PFD levels of 40-200 mol m-2 year-1 at the depth limit of charophyte species in the hypolimnion of oligotrophic temperate lakes. Experimental I(c) levels of normally rooted angiosperms were much lower than PFD levels at their depth limits in epilimnetic waters. However, these plants formed no roots at low light in the laboratory and needed c. 24-mu-mol m-2 s-1 for proper root development. Considering that this light level (505 mol m-2 year-1 or 7% of surface PFD) is needed for root development, correspondence with depth limits was much closer. These comparisons are complicated by daily and seasonal variability of light and temperature under field conditions. However, seasonal adaptations in the field, and the possible operation of loss processes (e.g. grazing and detachment), should cause greater light requirements for survival of field populations.
   (4) Comparisons between freshwater macrophytes and phytoplankton show larger chlorophyll:carbon and protein:carbon ratios of phytoplankters, which combined with their smaller size lead to higher growth-light efficiencies, higher respiration rates and overall lower I(c) levels.

AB The water strider species Limnoporus dissortis and L. notabilis hybridize across a broad zone in western Canada. Body length and alleles at four allozyme loci show a steep cline along the east slope of the Rocky Mountains in western Alberta, while in central British Columbia the parental phenotypes coexist without merging fully. One sex-linked locus shows little introgression, while there is apparently considerable gene flow at three autosomal loci. Although the hybrid zone has characteristics of a broad tension zone, the spatial distribution of introgression suggests that habitat patchiness and differential habitat associations of the two species also contribute to the pattern of hybridization. Asymmetry in interspecific mating success and incompatibilities of sex chromosomes with each other or with cytoplasmic factors appear to account for the occurrence of L. dissortis genotypes within the range of L. notabilis, and the lack of L. notabilis genotypes within the range of L. dissortis. The genetic structure of this hybrid zone supports the importance of sex-linked traits in maintaining the integrity of species, while its spatial structure suggests that extrinsic habitat features can combine with intrinsic genetic incompatibilities to produce complex hybrid interactions.

AB We examined foreleg length and body size variation in two species of oil-collecting bees (Rediviva; Melittidae) in southern Africa.  Oil-collecting bees harvest oil from host flowers by rubbing their forelegs against oil-secreting trichomes.  Significant differences in foreleg length occur among populations of both species.  Rediviva "pallidula" populations vary significantly in mean foreleg length (11.34 +/- 0.42 mm to 12.67 +/- 0.36 mm), but not in body length (10.59 +/- 0.74 to 10.80 +/- 0.64), and foreleg length and body size are not significantly correlated.  Instead, foreleg variation appears to be a function of host plant spur length.  Ninety-two percent of the variance in foreleg length of R. "pallidula" is explained by mean Diascia spur length.  Rediviva rufocincta populations vary significantly in mean foreleg length (10.12 +/- 0.70 mm to 12.34 +/- 0.68 mm) and in body length (9.03 +/- 0.26 mm to 10.56 +/- 0.24 mm).  Foreleg length scales allometrically with body size in this species as 90.5% of the variance in foreleg length can be explained as a function of body length.  Body size appears to be constrained by the morphology of the oil-secreting host plant.
   Both bees collect floral oil with specially modified setae on the tarsi of their forelegs.  The length of the disti- + mediotarsus (refered to here as "tarsus") in relation to the entire foreleg is shorter in R. rufocincta and does not increase as rapidly with increasing foreleg length as for R. "pallidula."  These differences in variation can be attributed to differences in position of oil within the flowers of the respective host plants.  Rediviva "pallidula" collects oil from Diascia species that have the oil deeply situated in narrow floral spurs of varying length, while R. rufocincta collects oil from the broadly saccate flowers of Bowkeria verticillata and B. citrina.

AB Quantitative genetic models are used to investigate the evolution of generalists and specialists in a coarse-grained environment with two habitat types when there are costs attached to being a generalist.  The outcomes for soft and hard selection models are qualitatively different.  Under soft selection (e.g., for juvenile or male-reproductive traits) the population evolves towards the single peak in the adaptive landscape.  At equilibrium, the population mean phenotype is a compromise between the reaction that would be optimal in both habitats and the reaction with the lowest cost.  Furthermore, the equilibrium is closer to the optimal phenotype in the most frequent habitat, or the habitat in which selection on the focal trait is stronger.  A specialist genotype always has a lower fitness than a generalist, even when the costs are high.
   In contrast, under hard selection (e.g., for adult or female-reproductive traits) the adaptive landscape can have one, two, or three peaks; a peak represents a population specialized to one habitat, equally adapted to both habitats, or an intermediate.  One peak is always found when the reaction with the lowest cost is not much different from the optimal reaction, and this situation is similar to the soft selection case.  However, multiple peaks are present when the costs become higher, and the course of evolution is then determined by initial conditions, and the region of attraction of each peak.  This implies that the evolution of specialization and phenotypic plasticity may not only depend on selection regimes within habitats, but also on contingent, historical events (migration, mutation).  Furthermore, the evolutionary dynamics in changing environments can be widely different for populations under hard and soft selection.  Approaches to measure costs in natural and experimental populations are discussed.

AB (1) Three approaches were used to determine if phenotypic and genetic variation existed among seed subpopulations of different ages within an Arctic seed bank:  (i) morphology and growth rate of seedlings were compared under a common environment; (ii) morphology, growth rates and ecological response to temperature-controlled environments and density were compared using vegetative offspring (ramets); (iii) relative competitive responses of ramets were compared under multiple environments.
   (2) Phenotypic differences in leaf length and number of leaves were demonstrated among the subpopulations.  Seedlings of the young subpopulation initially had longer leaves, but this difference was lost within 4 weeks indicating that the difference was probably of maternal or historical origin.  The young subpopulation consistently maintained a greater number of leaves across environments and through time, however.  These differences indicate that genetic change occurred in the population under natural conditions within c. 200 years.
   (3) Consistent differences in response to environment and density were also found.  The old subpopulation did not show as great a response to increasing temperature as the young subpopulation.  Also, biomass of the old subpopulation was unaffected by an increase in density, whereas the young subpopulation showed less growth at increased density.  The origin of these differences are probably due to evolutionary change within the extant, seed-producing population rather than genetic change occurring within the seed bank.  Differential response to density was not reflected in a difference in relative competitive ability.

AB Similarity in morphological form may arise from common ancestry (failure to evolve), from parallel evolution, from convergence, or from reversal to an apparently ancestral condition. Homoplasy from convergence, parallelism, and reversal is common, and its ubiquity creates difficulties in phylogenetic analysis. Convergent evolution often is considered one of the most powerful lines of evidence for adaptive evolution. But an alternative explanation for convergence and other evolved similarities is that limited developmental and structural options exist. Identical forms can be obtained when particular developmental phenomena are triggered by very different kinds of stimuli or when constraints exist that shape external form or limit morphological expression to a few options. Examples from plethodontid salamanders are used to illustrate an approach combining internalist and externalist analytical methods. In order to explain how morphologies evolve in lineages, both functionalist and structuralist approaches are necessary, combined in a context in which phylogenetic hypotheses and their tests are continuously pursued. When homoplasy is rampant, as in salamanders, we can expect discordance with phylogenetic analyses based on nonmorphological data sets.

AB Simple theoretical models are used to explore the effect of changed food density on optimal foraging effort when a forager faces a trade-off between energy (nutrient) gain and risk of mortality. Models of simple iteroparous and semelparous life histories show that the optimal effort or amount of risk may increase or decrease with increasing food density. Increases are more likely for iteroparous than for semelparous life histories, and are more likely when the increase in food availability is of short duration. The possibility of starvation makes it more likely that foraging effort will decrease with increasing food density. Organisms whose foraging goal is to minimize mortality are especially unlikely to increase effort in response to increased food availability. If there is a cost associated with the amount of food ingested, effort is more likely to decrease with increasing food. Some limitations of previous theoretical treatments of the foraging effort question are discussed. Previous experimental results illustrate the full range of responses to food density predicted here.

AB Populations of the lizard Anolis limifrons were censused for 19 yr at the Lutz site on Barro Colorado Island (BCI) and for 4 yr at 20 additional sites in central Panama. Census data provided estimates of population density at the end of the wet season (December) and indices of per-capita food intake and annual recruitment. Year-to-year changes in density of as much as 5- to 8-fold were observed at Lutz over 19 yr and of 2- to 3-fold were observed over 4 yr at other sites. Changes in population density at 11 BCI sites were synchronous over 1983-1986, while population density fluctuated independently at non-BCI sites. Populations of A. limifrons exhibited significantly greater generation-to-generation variability than populations of West Indian Anolis and of lizards in temperate-zone habitats (mostly arid lands in North America). An index of per-capita food intake was negatively related to density both for temporal comparisons at Lutz and for spatial comparisons among sites. The relative number of young individuals at the end of the wet season was negatively related to population density and positively related to an estimate of food intake. Partial correlations indicated that the positive association between the relative number of young individuals in the population and food intake was independent of the negative association between food intake and population density. Recruitment was thus depressed when density was high and enhanced when food was relatively abundant. Despite the potential for density-dependent regulation, Anolis limifrons populations are highly unstable, presumably because of random perturbations of the environment. Rainfall is implicated causally although population density was only weakly associated with rainfall - density at BCI was positively associated with rainfall during the dry season and negatively associated with rainfall during the wet season and with total annual rainfall. Population attributes that contribute to instability are rapid population turnover and a middle-level trophic position in a complex food web.

AB The estimation of the relationship between phenotype and fitness in natural populations is constrained by the distribution of phenotypes available for selection to act on. Because selection is blind to the underlying genotype, a more variable phenotypic distribution created by using environmental effects can be used to enhance the power of a selection study. I measured selection on a population of adult damselflies (Enallagma boreale) whose phenotype had been modified by raising the larvae under various levels of food availability and density. Selection on body size (combination of skeletal and mass at emergence) and date of emergence was estimated in two consecutive episodes. The first episode was survival from emergence to sexual maturity and the second was reproductive success after attaining sexual maturity. Female survival to sexual maturity was lower, and therefore opportunity for selection greater, than males in both years. Opportunity for selection due to reproductive success was greater for males. The total opportunity for selection was greater for males one year and for females the other. Survival to sexual maturity was related to mass gain between emergence and sexual maturity. Females gained more mass and survived less well than males in both years but there was no linear relationship between size at emergence and survival for females in either year. However, females in the tails of the phenotype distribution were less likely to survive than those near the mean. In contrast, small males consistently gained more mass than large males and survived less well in one year. There was significant selection on timing of emergence in both years, but the direction of selection changed due to differences in weather; early emerging females were more successful one year and late emerging males and females the other. The number of clutches laid by females was independent of body size. Because the resources used to produce eggs are acquired after emergence and this was independent of size at emergence, female fitness did not increase with size. Small males may have had lower survival to sexual maturity but they had higher mating success than large males. Resources acquired prior to sexual maturity are essential for reproductive success and may in some species alter their success in inter- and intrasexual competition. Therefore, ignoring the mortality associated with resource acquisition will give an incomplete and potentially misleading picture of selection on the phenotype.

AB I examined patterns of covariation of three morphometric blossom characters [gland area (GA), gland-stigma distance (GSD), and bract length (BL)] within genets, among genets, and among populations of the tropical vine, Dalechampia scandens (Euphorbiaceae). Covariance between BL and GA was evenly distributed among the three levels. This observation, coupled with developmental information, indicates that the two characters change size similarly during development, that there is probably genetic covariance between them (apparently caused by pleiotropy), and that the genetic covariance may have constrained (at least proximally) the course of population differentiation with respect to these characters. Most covariance between GSD and GA occurred at the among-population level. This observation, coupled with developmental information, indicates that there is negligible ontogenetic covariance and that within populations there is probably little or no genetic covariance between the two characters. Among-population covariance has probably been caused by natural selection operating in a correlated fashion on characters that functionally interact in pollination.

AB Diet selection and optimization may be affected by nonadditive interactions (or associative effects) among ingested diet items. Associative effects occur when one diet item affects the digestion (either positively or negatively) of another diet item. Feeding trials were conducted with an opportunistic omnivore, the yellow-bellied slider turtle (Trachemys scripta scripta), on three diets: duckweed, insect larvae, and duckweed/larvae mix. Diet had a significant effect on digestibilities and intake, but not on transit time.
   There was a significant associative effect in the duckweed/larvae diet. For all diet components except lipids, the digestive efficiencies measured in the duckweed/larvae diet were significantly greater than those predicted from the digestive efficiencies for duckweed and larvae diets when fed alone. The presence of larvae in the digesta significantly improved the digestive processing of duckweed, probably by supporting greater numbers or diversity of cellulolytic microbes. A given mass of duckweed provided almost-equal-to 70% more energy and 20% more nitrogen to the turtle when ingested with insect larvae than when ingested alone.
   Associative effects should be incorporated in optimal foraging models and studies of diet selection because the value of a diet item can vary with the foods with which it is ingested. The assigned value must include not only the direct nutritional gain from the item, but also the indirect nutritional gain (or loss) through positive (or negative) effects on digestion of food items with which it is ingested.

AB Two subspecies of killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, inhabit the Atlantic coast of the United States. The contact zones between them are typified by morphological, physiological, nuclear gene, and mitochondrial DNA clines. Considerable debate exists about the importance of restricted gene flow and natural selection in maintaining these clines. To evaluate the relative importance of these two evolutionary forces we employed analysis of mtDNA as an independent measure of gene flow.
   Solutions of equilibrium diffusion equations suggested that killifish dispersal must be less than 2 km to maintain previously observed allozyme frequency clines in the absence of strong selection. To determine whether populations separated by distances greater than 2 km accumulate significant genetic differences we examined a total of N = 480 individuals from five killifish populations spanning a continuous shoreline distance of 8.4 km. Distribution of the 25 detected haplotypes indicated that most of the variation was within rather than between sampling locations. No evidence of geographic structure was detected, nor were there any significant genetic differences between killifish populations.
   With these data, gene flow was evaluated by estimating effective migration rate (N(e)m) between the populations. N(e)m was estimated from G(st)(N(e)m = 49.4), from F(st)(N(e)m = 24.1), by the private alleles approach (N(e)m = 18.5) and via four phylogenetic analyses (N(e)m ranged from 11.4 to 16.9). Regardless of the analysis, N(e)m was greater than one; the threshold level at which gene flow is strong enough to prevent differentiation due to genetic drift. This suggests that while the characteristics that distinguish Fundulus subspecies may have arisen in isolation, the current clinal distributions exhibited along the Atlantic coast are most likely maintained by selection.

AB Controversy over the effect of Quercus douglasii on the productivity of California grassland has been fueled by conflicting reports. In some studies, understory grassland productivity was < 25% of open grassland productivity, whereas in other studies understory productivity exceeded 200% of that of surrounding grassland. We examined light, temperature, soil nutrients, soil moisture, and fine tree root distributions under selected Q. douglasii trees (12 that appeared to have suppressive effects on understory productivity, and 12 that appeared to enhance understory productivity) in order to determine how variations in these factors were associated with the differences in understory grassland productivities. We found that grassland productivity is likely to be facilitated by nutrient inputs via litterfall and throughfall under all trees, but that trees with low understory grassland productivities had substantially higher amounts of fine roots in the upper 50 cm of soil and much lower predawn xylem pressure potentials than trees with high understory productivities and presumably deeper root systems. Root exclosures reduced the negative effects of these trees on the dominant understory grass species, and further experiments indicated that the negative effects of the tree roots may partially result from allelopathic oak root exudates. Thus, shallow fine tree roots may inhibit understory productivity, and variations in Q. douglasii root morphology may explain the intertree variations in facilitating/interfering effects on understory species.

AB Foraging decisions by large herbivores in a heterogenous environment with several available plant species are a scale problem. If, for example, the foraging decisions primarily occur at the stand level, then stands of trees might be regarded as patches within a habitat of several stands over which intake rate is to be maximized. The food consumption within a stand should be in proportion to the availability of different food types. If, on the other hand, food selection occurs at the tree level within a stand, then the individual trees are regarded as "patches"; total stand exploitation should then be the result of foraging decisions made within the stand. We tested these two hypotheses in field experiments in winter with free-ranging moose (Alces alces) having access to artificial stands of trees. In these stands Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) was mixed with either aspen (Populus tremula) or alder (Alnus incana). In experiment A, where the total available pine biomass per stand was much greater than any of the additional species, total stand consumption did not differ between stand types. In experiment B, where pine biomass did not dominate to the same extent, pine + aspen stands were more heavily used than pine + pine and pine + alder stands. The within-stand consumption of different species appeared to be nonrandom, i.e., the tree biomass was not consumed in proportion to availability. The mean pine biomass consumption per tree did not differ between stand types in either experiment. We conclude that the food selection appears to occur primarily at the tree level within stands. The level of decision might also be important for the performance of the plant species exploited. The results from this study question the general validity of recent hypotheses regarding "associational protection" in plant communities. We suggest that the optimal patch use approach taken in this study might give better insight in these kinds of plant-animal interaction problems.

AB Males of many iguanid lizard species defend territories against conspecific males. We investigated whether territoriality in male sagebrush lizards (Sceloporus graciosus) was associated with defense of mates. Studies on the sagebrush lizard in western Colorado, USA, included mark-recapture census and removal of adult females from the territories of resident males. Adults and juveniles were clearly distinguished by body size. Resident males did not abandon their territories following the removal of adult females. Resident males did not expand the size of their territories following the loss of adult females. Males were not defending juvenile females because most male territories did not include juvenile females. Sagebrush lizards are long lived, and territory defense probably ensures several mating opportunities. We postulate that loss of a mate in one season may be less important than the long-term benefits of territory maintenance and repeated reproduction.

AB Despite widespread interest in the impact of herbivores on plants, very few studies have addressed the morphological mechanisms by which plants compensate for losses due to herbivore attack, and fewer still have examined compensation in long-lived, herbaceous species. I conducted a 3-yr experimental study of dwarf fireweed's (Epilobium latifolium) responses to real and simulated attack by a momphid caterpillar. I found that the type and extent of plant responses change with morphological and temporal scale. For instance, damaged shoots showed effective compensation, producing between 89 and 583% more branch tissue than undamaged shoots. However, clumps of shoots are joined by perennial rhizomes; a single year of herbivore damage to a clump's shoots reduced net growth by > 75% over a 3-yr period. Clump form also changed following attack; in the year after damage shoot number was reduced by 51%, while mean shoot size either increased or was unaffected. Further complicating the caterpillar's impact on its host was its inhibition of mammalian herbivory:  simulated caterpillar damage reduced the probability of mammalian attack from 20 to 6%. These complicated and very different changes following herbivory illustrate the need to study compensation mechanistically and in the context of a plant's biotic environment in order to understand its importance and consequences.

AB Previous studies have shown that in several angiosperms and the liverwort Marchantia the chloroplast gene rpl2, encoding ribosomal protein L2, is interrupted by an intron, but that in spinach (Spinacia oleracea, Caryophyllales) this intron has been lost.  We have determined the distribution of the rpl2 intron for 390 species representing 116 angiosperm families.  Filter hybridizations reveal that the intron is absent from the chloroplast genomes of all examined families of the Caryophyllales, suggesting that the intron was lost in the common ancestor of the order.  Sequencing of the rpl2 gene in five genera of the Caryophyllales and in Rumex (Polygonales) not only confirms the filter hybridization results, but also shows that for all taxa lacking the intron, the rpl2 gene has undergone a precise deletion of the intron.  In all cases, it is the original rpl2 gene that has sustained loss of its intron.  This implies that in chloroplast DNA, integration of exogenous genes (e.g., a reverse transcript of a spliced mRNA) occurs mainly by homologous, replacement recombination, rather than by illegitimate recombination elsewhere in the genome.  Filter hybridizations also reveal that the rpl2 intron was lost independently in the common ancestors of at least five other lineages of dicotyledons:  Saxifragaceae (s.s.), Convolvulaceae (including Cuscuta), Menyanthaceae, two genera of Geraniaceae, and one genus of Droseraceae.  The molecular and phylogenetic implications of these independent intron losses are discussed.

AB Because food and habitat are closely linked for small herbivores that live on plants, food choice in the field may be constrained by the need to choose plants that provide safe living sites. We investigated the importance of food value and refuge value in determining the plant utilization patterns of the herbivorous marine amphipod Ampithoe longimana. When offered a choice of five common seaweeds, this amphipod fed most readily on Dictyota and Hypnea and less readily on Sargassum, Chondria, and Calonitophyllum. Rates of feeding on the different seaweeds were unrelated to seaweed gross morphology, toughness, nitrogen, or protein content. When cultured on each of these seaweeds in the laboratory, amphipod survivorship was high on Dictyota (82%), intermediate (35 and 18%, respectively) on Sargassum and Hypnea, and low (0%) on the other seaweeds. Survivorship on the different diets was strongly correlated (r = 0.930) with algal protein content; however, neither protein content nor amphipod performance on the different diets was significantly related to feeding rates on those diets. Additionally, amphipods from the three seaweed species that produced some survivors did not differ in growth rate, fecundity, egg size, or age at first ovulation. Variance in survivorship, and related measures, among sibling groups of amphipods suggested that this amphipod population possessed heritable variation for performance on the different seaweed species.
   In the field, abundance of A. longimana on the different species of algae was more clearly related to the preference of omnivorous fishes for these algae than to feeding rates of the amphipods when given those algae in the laboratory. A. longimana was more abundant on Dictyota and Sargassum (both unpalatable to omnivorous fishes), than on Hypnea, Chondria, and Calonitophyllum (all of which are palatable to fishes). During the season when omnivorous fishes were abundant, density of A. longimana increased on Dictyota, which is chemically defended from fishes, but decreased or remained unchanged on the seaweeds that are more palatable to fishes. Competition with other amphipods as a group did not appear to explain the distribution of A. longimana among seaweeds, since there were no negative correlations between A. longimana abundance and total amphipod abundance in any month. The lack of any consistent relationship between host-plant use in the field and either feeding preference or diet value, as measured by survivorship and reproduction, suggests that host-plant use by A. longimana may be strongly constrained by requirements for shelter from predation.

AB To determine if the arrangement of secretory canals in leaves affects foraging by folivorous insects, we examined the behaviors of 33 species found on diverse canal-bearing plants. Insect behaviors were categorized into three principal classes: vein cutting, trenching, and neither behavior. Canal architectures were ascertained by damaging leaves with standardized tests and measuring the secretory response.
   Our observations document a precise correspondence between herbivore behavior and canal morphology. Vein-cutting insects occur on plants with arborescent canals (resin canals in Anacardiaceae and nonarticulated laticifers in Apocynaceae, Asclepiadaceae, and Moraceae). By severing the secretory canals in leaf veins, insects prevent the flow of secretion to distal branches of the canals. Trenching insects, in contrast, are found on plants with net-like canal systems (anastomosing articulated laticifers in Asteraceae and Caricaceae, and exuding phloem in Cucurbitaceae). To eliminate secretion outflow from these plants, the insects must transect all strands of the network by cutting a trench. The secretory canals of the Convolvulaceae (nonanastomosing articulated laticifers) differ from the preceding categories in being restricted primarily to the major leaf veins. The behavior of herbivores on this family is also distinct:  all feed between the major veins without prior vein cutting or trenching.
   Thus, insects employ the same behavior on similar canal architectures, even when their host plants otherwise differ in taxonomy, secondary chemistry, and canal type. The occurrence of vein-cutting and trenching behaviors in multiple lineages of insects that include caterpillars, beetles, and katydids indicates that the behaviors have evolved repeatedly, apparently through convergence. Our comparative analysis supports the view that these preingestive behaviors function specifically to deactivate defensive canal systems.

AB Population samples of an African C4 grass, Panicum coloratum L., were collected from two locations in the Serengeti Grasslands varying in grazing intensity, one a high-grazing location (GA = grazing-adapted), the other a low-grazing location (NGA = nongrazing-adapted). Plants were cloned, put in controlled environments mimicking the natural photo-thermoperiod, and subjected to light grazing pressure by a generalist-feeding North American grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes. Carbon assimilation and redistribution were measured in the short term with an infrared gas analyzer and C-11-labelled CO2, coupled with a three-compartment analytical model, and by harvesting whole plants at the end of a 12-wk regrowth experiment.
   Results documented several significant differences between the GA and NGA samples, suggesting the evolution of physiological traits related to C assimilation, translocation, and storage in response to previous grazing history. Pregrazing net C-fixation rates, translocation rates, and C-storage pools were identical for the two ecotypes. After grazing, overall C-fixation rates were 39% higher for the GA plants, and the regrowth data suggest they remained higher than NGA rates throughout the experiment. Removal of < 10% of initial green-leaf biomass by grazing at each grazing period produced major differences in carbon flux between the two samples.
   Throughout the experiment GA plants produced and stored more C in leaves, stored less C in stem sinks, had higher phloem activity, and translocated more of the labile C to roots where it was stored in higher quantities. This suggests that storage of labile C reserves in sinks or pools readily accessible to the plant, which allows rapid mobilization after grazing, is an important element of adaptation to grazing. Major storage of labile reserves in stems, characteristic of the NGA plants, may be advantageous in ungrazed habitats where there is vertical growth due to canopy closure and competition for light, but such storage makes those reserves accessible to grazers.
   GA ecotype plants in the regrowth experiment compensated completely for the eight weekly defoliation events by the time of the 12-wk harvest; yield of the NGA ecotype was reduced 2 1 % by the moderate level of grasshopper grazing. Increased total yield (biomass harvested plus compensation) by the GA ecotype was expressed in both above- and belowground biomass, suggesting that suppression of the latter does not contribute to compensation by the former.

TI THE EFFECTS OF A SUCCESSIONAL HABITAT MOSAIC ON A SMALL MAMMAL COMMUNITY

AB Small herbivorous mammals living in successional patchy environments may be affected by both patch size variations and successional changes. If patch size affects densities of residents then larger patches should have higher densities compared to smaller patches because larger patches often have greater habitat diversity and lesser chances of stochastic events destroying the population. If patch size affects length of time animals spend on patches (persistence rates) then smaller patches should have lower persistence rates compared to larger patches because smaller patches contain fewer resources. Larger animals may be constrained by body size, as well as population size, to reside only on the larger patches because smaller patches do not contain enough resources. If successional changes affect resident animals that are host specific on colonizing plant species, then the effects may be noticeable immediately following field abandonment because plant species replacement rates are most rapid then.
   Four small mammal species were included:  Sigmodon hispidus, Reithrodontomys megalotis, Microtus ochrogaster, and Peromyscus maniculatus. The field was divided into patches that varied in area by two orders of magnitude with patches of each size treatment placed in each section of the field. Patch size effects on densities and persistence rates of the four mammal species were tested with analyses of variance. Plant species were grouped according to seven life history traits so as to include relative percent cover of most plant species. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to identify which variables (patch size, field sections, and percent relative cover) significantly explained variations in small mammal densities.
   Effects of patch size on animal densities and persistence rates varied among animal species. The largest species, Sigmodon hispidus, was never found on the smallest patches, but densities of Reithrodontomys megalotis, Microtus ochrogaster, and Peromyscus maniculatus were often highest on the smallest patches. Animal density variations were often significantly explained by patch size using multiple regression analyses (P less-than-or-equal-to .001). However, lack of consistent trends with respect to the other independent variables included in the equations and variable R2 values suggested that other, unmeasured, variables may have influenced the results. Persistence rates of the three species were often highest on the largest patches. Results suggested that animals visited small patches more often than large patches without staying, and used large patches to create territories. Small and medium patches may have been used as archipelagos of preferred habitat interspersed with less desirable habitat.
   The first stage of old-field succession was completed by the end of the 3rd yr:  perennials replaced annuals as the dominant plant species. Neither patch size nor field sections significantly affected percent cover.

AB Three general hypotheses have been proposed to explain why many large herbivores have highly aggregated patterns of distribution: dilution of predation risk, maintenance of forage in an immature but highly nutritious growth stage, and ideal free distribution in relation to spatial variation in either forage quality or primary productivity. Evaluation of the latter two hypotheses has been hampered by lack of a formal theoretical framework for assessing the effects of forage quality on resource acquisition by herbivores. A model is proposed that demonstrates how trade-offs between instantaneous intake and forage digestibility might lead to optimal rates of energy intake at low to intermediate levels of forage abundance. Simulations based on the energy-intake model suggest a number of key environmental factors that should determine the impact of forage maturation and spatial variation on herbivore distribution patterns. All of the proposed advantages of aggregation may have general applicability, but the relative importance of each probably varies according to the specific circumstances facing a given herbivore population.

AB Polemonium viscosum has a continuous distribution from 3,500 m in the krummholz to 4,025 m on the summit ridges of Pennsylvania Mountain, Colorado.  Seeds produced by plants at opposite ends of this cline, 1.5 km apart, differed significantly at allozyme loci in two consecutive breeding seasons.  Mean multilocus F(st) values for both years (0.015 and 0.069) were significantly different from zero, indicating restricted gene exchange between subpopulations.  Average allele frequencies at two individual loci also differed significantly between families comprising krummholz and summit subpopulations.  Progeny of plants growing on the summit had higher leaf production rates, more densely packed leaflets, and lower resistance to aphids than progeny of plants growing in the krummholz site, when tested under greenhouse conditions.  These differences probably reflect the restricted opportunities for growth and severe exposure at high elevations, and the increased risk from herbivores near timberline.  The two subpopulations did not differ in leaf length (stature), leaf width, or pubescence.  Reciprocal transplanting of seedlings between krummholz and summit sites confirmed that the differences were adaptive, since progeny from each subpopulation performed significantly better in their parent's habitat.  Coordinated studies of genetic structure, quantitative variation, and local adaptation across the elevational range of P. viscosum provide a comprehensive view of ecotypic divergence in this widespread alpine plant.

AB To help elucidate mechanisms of larval ethanol tolerance seven isochromosomal lines of Drosophila melanogaster with different second chromosomes were fed a growth-limiting concentration of ethanol (4.5% v/v) and examined for associations between growth traits and biochemical characteristics that had previously been implicated in the determination of tolerance variation. Repeated measures of survival and development time over four generations verified the inherited nature of these traits. Significant variation among the lines were evident for flux from ethanol into lipid, for activity levels of alcohol dehydrogenase and glycerol-3-phosphate oxidase (GPO), and for levels of long chain and unsaturated fatty acids. A high degree of positive association occurred among the variables. A partial correlation analysis controlling for performance of the lines on ethanol-free medium revealed a strong association between the degree of long chain fatty acid content and line survival when ethanol was fed. The correlation between GPO activity and survival in an ethanol environment appeared to depend on the association of GPO activity with long chain fatty acid content. The positive correlations of flux from ethanol into lipid with many of the other variables suggested that the ADH pathway influenced the level of ethanol tolerance. These associations are all consistent with the hypothesis that the lipid content of body tissues, especially the levels of long chain and unsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes, may have an important influence on both spatial and interspecific variation in the ethanol tolerance of larvae.

AB Genotype-environment interaction occurs when a genotype that has a superior phenotype in one environment loses its relative advantage in some other environment. Such interactions are of particular interest to evolutionary ecologists when the "environment" is another species in the community. Interspecies interactions of this sort differ from other genotype-environment interactions because the environment for one species is itself an evolving entity, that is, another species. When selection acts only at the level of the individual, these interspecies interactions normally cannot contribute to a response to selection. When selection is acting at the community level, however, interspecies interactions can contribute to a response to community selection. Variation that is expressed as environmental variation at the individual level becomes heritable variation at the community level. In the experiment reported here simple communities consisting of two species of flour beetles, Tribolium castaneum and Tribolium confusum, were studied. I measured the general intermixing ability of strains of each species and the specific intermixing ability of pairs of strains of both species in the communities, using a diallel experiment similar to that used to measure general and specific combining ability of individuals. The results indicate that there is significant general intermixing ability for traits measured in both species, and significant specific intermixing ability for one trait (adult population size) measured in T. confusum. These results are discussed in relation to community selection.

AB Seed-eating ants are part of a guild of granivorous desert species that compete for food.  This study examines the factors that influence the intensity, location, or temporal pattern of foraging in the red harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex barbatus.  I consider behavioral flexibility on three time scales:  year to year, day to day, and hour to hour.  On a yearly time scale, there does not appear to be any simple relation between high intensities of foraging and survival rate.  Colony-specific differences in foraging activity persist from one year to the next, but survivorship is not higher in colonies more likely to forage.  Distributions of nests change from one year to the next and are usually underdispersed or clumped.  Colonies live for 15-20 yr.  Colony behavior is more stable, and more likely to avoid intraspecific conflict, in older colonies (> 5 yr old) than in younger ones (2 yr old).  Mortality rates of 2-yr-old colonies are similar to those of older ones.  Other results suggest that a colony's competitive status is determined by its behavioral flexibility in changing conditions, on daily and hourly time scales.  Each day that a colony forages, it chooses a few foraging routes out of a larger set of available ones.  This decision is made early each day by the patrollers, a distinct group of workers, before the foragers emerge from the nest.  The choice of foraging trails is influenced by interactions with neighboring colonies.  The extent to which neighboring colonies forage on trails that intersect, and engage in long-term conflict, depends on colony age and food availability.  When there is a food incentive, pairs of neighboring younger colonies are more likely than older pairs to continue using foraging trails that overlap.  On an hourly time scale, the intensity of foraging depends on the rate of food intake and on the activities of workers, such as patrollers, engaged in other tasks besides foraging.
