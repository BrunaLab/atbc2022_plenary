AB The amounts and chemical composition of bulk precipitation were investigated over a continuous 21-mo period (January 1990 to September 1991) at four sites along an East-West transect perpendicular to the coast of Southwest Viti Levu, Fiji. Measured rainfall totals in 1990 ranged from 1796 mm at the coastal Korokula station to 2113 mm at the inland Tulasewa station, which is somewhat higher than the long-term average of 1707 mm at a reference weather station located in the centre of the study area. The first 9 mo of 1991 were relatively dry (range 1027-1533 mm) with a total of 1157 mm at the reference site as compared to a long-term average of 1330 mm. Concentrations of all investigated constituents in bulk rainfall were low, except during the passage of cyclone Sina due to the deposition of large amounts of, especially, chloride, sodium and sulphate in sea spray. Concentrations of sodium and magnesium could be explained fully by maritime contributions to the rainfall composition at all sites, Maritime contributions to the concentrations of calcium, sulphate and potassium accounted for 10-40% of the total, whereas bicarbonate, ammonium, nitrate, silicon, aluminium, iron and manganese were derived exclusively from terrestrial sources. The annual atmospheric nutrient deposition rates were low by pan-tropical standards, particularly when the contribution of cyclone Sina was excluded. Annual totals (in kg ha(-1)) ranged from 2.4-8.8 for nitrogen, 0.4-1.1 for phosphorus, 2.3-4.9 for potassium, 1.4-1.9 for calcium and from 1.1-1.3 for magnesium. The inclusion of the contribution by the cyclone more than doubled the deposition of potassium, calcium and magnesium, although values still remained well within the range reported for humid tropical areas. The estimated atmospheric deposition of nutrients over a typical rotation period (16 y) was sufficient to balance losses in harvested Pinus caribaea logs (stemwood plus bark) of potassium, calcium and magnesium, but not of nitrogen and, probably, phosphorus. Nutrient losses associated with the harvesting of stemwood alone were compensated entirely by the atmospheric inputs.

AB The role of regeneration strategies in structuring tropical tree communities has been a recent focus of attention of tropical ecologists. Canopy discontinuities created by tree-falls are considered to be critical to many rain forest trees for establishing and completing their life cycles. It was investigated whether it is advantageous for two common large-seeded and shade-tolerant Amazonian tree species, the palm Astrocaryum murumuru and the legume, Dipteryx micrantha, to have their seeds dispersed to gaps. The dispersal process was simulated by placing experimental seeds and seedlings in gaps and in the shaded understorey, and then following their performance. Seeds and seedlings from the two species were used. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the survival functions and compare survivorship curves. Survival of Astrocaryum seeds, and of Dipteryx seeds and seedlings, was higher in two gap zones (crown and bole) than in the shaded understorey (both near and far away from a conspecific adult). A higher proportion of seedlings of both plant species survived within gaps than in the shaded understorey over an 18-wk period. One year after the seedlings had been transplanted into gaps these patterns still held. Naturally occurring Astrocaryum seeds survived better beneath conspecific adult trees located within 30 m of gaps than beneath trees located 100 m from gaps. Variation in gap size was significant for Dipteryx seeds, but not for Dipteryx seedlings and Astrocaryum seeds and seedlings. Dipteryx seeds survived longer in smaller than in larger gaps. By colonizing tree-fall gaps, these two species improved their chances of completing their life cycles.

AB A comparative study was undertaken of Amazonian fish diversity and density (abundance and biomass) in nutrient poor (blackwater) and richer (whitewater varzea) habitats in the vicinity of Tefe, Brazil. The whitewater sampling sites, in the floodplain of the Rios Solimoes and Japura, had high turbidity (Secchi disc 0.03-0.7 m), a conductivity of 64-110 mu S cm(-1) at 25 degrees C and a pH of 6.6-6.9. The blackwater sites Lagos Amana, Iama and Tefe had a low turbidity (Secchi disc 2.0-2.2 m), a conductivity of 7-11 mu S cm(-1) at 25 degrees C and a pH of 5.3-6.0. The fish communities of open water, floating meadow and forest margin were sampled. Both whitewater and blackwater sites held high diversity fish communities with many species in common. Whitewater habitats were more diverse yielding 108 species, compared with only 68 from blackwater. Fish density within floating meadow was estimated during high water April and May 1994, and low water October 1994 and March 1995. During the high water season fish biomasses in blackwater lakes (31.1 g m(-2)) were significantly greater than those of either whitewater lakes (13.4 g m(-2)) or whitewater river channels (3.45 g m(-2)). At low water, in October, whitewater channels were generally found to hold the highest fish biomass (204 g m(-2)) although in March a blackwater site yielded the highest fish biomass recorded (285.9 g m(-2)). The amount of floating meadow habitat within whitewaters is however much greater than that in blackwaters. It is suggested that blackwaters may offer a stable habitat resulting in a high standing crop. In comparison, variation in conditions such as dissolved oxygen concentration in the whitewater may limit standing crop, but still allow periods of high productivity. Evidence was found for migration of fish from varzea lakes during periods of low oxygen availability. The high diversity and biomass of fish caught in both whitewater and blackwater lakes indicates that water acidity and conductivity are poor predictors of fish diversity and density in tropical floodplain lakes.

AB Studies of predation on propagules of the mangroves Avicennia marina, Bruguiera exaristata, Ceriops tagal and Rhizophora stylosa were made in a forest in northern Australia to test the generality of the dominance-predation model. This model states that an inverse relationship exists between the dominance of a species in the canopy of mangrove forests and the rate of predation on the propagules of that species. Significant differences in predation were found among the four species, and among patches of forest dominated by the different species. Predators attacked more than 50% of the propagules of all species except R. stylosa, so are likely to significantly affect forest structure. The intensity of predation did not, however, vary as the dominance-predation model predicted. Instead, predation on the propagules of a species appeared to depend on the availability of propagules of other, more highly preferred, species.

AB Man-made grasslands dominated by Imperata cylindrica (L.) Beauv. in forested areas of lowland Nepal are commonly cut and/or burned annually. Changes in grass forage quality following different treatments of cutting and burning and axis deer (Rn's arn's) response to such habitat manipulations were investigated. Samples of matured grass were collected in December 1990, February and April 1991 from three experimental sites: cut, burned, cut-and-burned. Four locations on cut-and-burned grassland were repeatedly sampled at 12-d intervals from January to April 1992. Numbers of axis deer were recorded during the dry season of 1991/1992 on grassland plots receiving the following treatments: cut, cut-and-burned, and uncut/unburned (controls). Based on grass quality differences between December and February and between December and April, cut-and-burned treatments gave the greater increase in forage quality. N was significantly higher on cut-and-burned plots than on cut plots both in February and in April, while Na, K and P was significantly higher in February. On plots cut-and-burned in January, Ca concentrations were relatively low while the P content fell below required levels for domestic stock towards the end of the dry season in April. Na concentrations were below the minimum required levels for both domestic and wild ruminants during the whole period. When an entire grassland was cut, deer density increased gradually. When the same area was subsequently burned, the daily deer density increased much more rapidly. Axis deer preferred burned plots compared to plots neither cut nor burned and to cut plots. Plots burned in late February had higher densities of axis deer than plots burned 1.5 mo earlier. When nearby recently burned plots were available, deer density was reduced on plots burned earlier.

AB To study regeneration on landslides, we counted the number of woody stems at least Im tall in 2 m x 5 m permanent plots on Puerto Rican landslides for 5 y and generated successional pathways for all plots in 16 different landslides using principal components analysis (PCA). PCA separated plots well, with early successional plant species (Cecropia schreberiana, Schefflera morototoni, Alchornea latifolia, Gonzalagunia spicata) positively associated with axes I and II, and the negative portion of axis II associated with a mix of those species and mid-successional species (Inga vera, Piper glabrescens). Pathways generally showed (1) a positive association with axis I in early succession, (2) a negative association with both I and II later in succession, (3) little evidence of a decrease in the rate of succession, and (4) a lack of convergence of pathways over the 5 y of our study.

AB Bukit Belalong, Brunei, is a small mountain (913 m) of uniform shale lithology with continuous primary rain forest from its base to its summit. Three 0.25 ha plots were established at each of three altitudes (200, 500 and 850 m) to investigate the altitudinal zonation of the soils and the vegetation. One soil profile from each altitude is described and chemical analyses of the soils indicate that they are similar at ail altitudes. In each plot all trees greater than or equal to 10 cm dbh were measured and identified as far as possible. Maximum tree height was greatest at 200 m (60 m) and least at 850 m (33 m). Tree density (number of individuals ha(-1)) increased with altitude. The forest at 850 m was the most species- and family-rich, but since the ratio of species to individuals did not vary significantly among altitudes, the higher species richness is attributed partly to the larger number of trees sampled. The Dipterocarpaceae was the most important family in terms of basal area at all altitudes, bur its proportion of basal area was much smaller at 850 m than at the other altitudes. The Dipterocarpaceae was the most diverse family at 200 m and 500 m, but at 850 m its diversity was exceeded by the Lauraceae, Myrtaceae and Euphorbiaceae and equalled by the Clusiaceae. The forests at 200 m and 500 m are classified as lowland rain forest and that at 850 m is classified as a lower montane forest.

AB Similarities and differences among eight upland rain forest sites in Peruvian Amazonia were measured separately by using Melastomataceae, pteridophyte and tree species compositions and edaphic characteristics of the sites. All three plant groups showed a similar pattern among the sites, and this pattern could be explained by edaphic differences but not by geographical distances among the sires. The explicability of site-specific edaphic characteristics on the basis of geological history is discussed. The results suggest that both pteridophytes and Melastomataceae can be used as indicators of floristically different rain forest types that are edaphically defined. Distribution patterns of these plant groups can be studied much more rapidly than the patterns of trees and therefore both Melastomataceae and pteridophytes may be used in large scale phytogeographical studies that are urgently needed in the face of rapidly advancing deforestation.

AB Kentropyx calcarata (Teiidae) and Mabuya nigropunctata (Scincidae) occur together in lowland tropical forest of the Amazon near the Rio Curua-Una of Brazil. During the wet season of 1995 these lizards were common at forest edge along narrow roads that transect forest, in treefalls and along streams where sun reaches the ground. Both species are heliothermic, basking to gain heat. Their association with open patches results from high activity temperature requirements in an environment where sun availability is low. Null temperature distributions from forest and treefalls showed that forest does not offer opportunities for hear gain similar to treefalls. Moreover, the large proportion of time spent basking by both species indicates the importance of these patches for thermoregulation. K. calcarata aia is slightly larger in body length and heavier at a given body length than M. nigropunctata. Both species are active foragers that seek out prey while moving through the habitat, feeding on orthopterans, roaches and spiders. M. nigropunctata also eat significant numbers of insects that occur on vegetation, such as hemipterans. Prey size is larger in K. calcarata and associated with lizard body size. Prey size does not vary with body size in M. nigropunctata and prey are typically relatively small.
   Many of the ecological differences between these two lowland forest species appear to be historical: the ecology of K. calcarata is very similar to that of other species of Kentropyx and teiids in general and the ecology of M. nigropunctata is most similar to that of other studied species of south American Mabuya.

AB Patterns of trap response in the Central American spiny rat (Proechimys semispinosus), a frugivorous forest rodent, were examined in relation to age, sex, density and resource abundance. Populations on four small islands (designated numbers 4, 8, 14, and 52) in Gatun Lake (central Panama) were sampled by live-trapping for four nights every month for four years. Trappability was calculated as the proportion of all individuals known to be alive that were actually captured. Mean body mass at first capture was within the range of subadult body masses and differed among islands but not between sexes. Trappabilities summed over the entire study were generally low and differed among islands and age classes (juveniles, subadults and adults) and between sexes. In general, adults were more trappable than juveniles and subadults, and females (particularly adults) were more trappable than males. Trappability and the number of captures per individual varied seasonally and were generally greatest during December and January. Monthly estimates of these two variables were examined for autocorrelation, and the order of the autoregressive error model was determined separately for each island population. The arcsine of trappability and the number of captures per individual were regressed on log,, densities of spiny rats and of fruiting trees and lianas after controlling for autocorrelation. Both trappability indices were negatively related to the density of fruiting trees and lianas on islands 8 and 14, indicating that spiny rats may be seasonally food-stressed. The number of captures per individual was related positively to the density of spiny rats on island 52 and negatively on island 8. Results indicate that spiny rat populations must be sampled with greater intensity and duration than temperate forest rodents.

AB The red crab Gecarcoidea natalis is the most abundant land crab on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean, and is found wherever native rain forest is still intact. The largest crabs grow to >120 mm carapace width and reach >500 g in mass. Red crabs are diurnally active, and moisture appears to be the most important factor governing surface activity-activity was nil below 77% RH, relatively low at 87% RH, and high above 95% RH. The crabs retreat to the interior of their burrows during dry periods, but emerge rapidly in response to rain. Because of their dependence on moisture for surface activity, red crabs show greater levels of activity during the wet season. Annual breeding migrations and moulting activity decreased the density of surface-active crabs at the main study sites for several weeks at the start of the wet season, and fruit and leaf fall caused dramatic local increases in the density of active red crabs. Density and biomass at the main study sites averaged 1.3 crabs m(-2) and 1454 kg ha(-1), respectively, and 1.2 crabs m(-2) and 1137 kg ha(-1) at a total of five sites across the island. Rough calculations suggest that the island-wide population is at least 100 million individuals. Red crabs are the dominant consumer on the forest floor, and consume seeds, seedlings and leaf litter. Because they are both abundant and widespread, these animals have the potential to be the most important determinant of pattern and process in rain forest on Christmas Island.

AB A seed-removal experiment was conducted to assess the role of Proechimys semispinosus (Central American spiny rat) as potential predator and disperser of Astrocaryum standleyanum (black palm) seeds. One hundred fresh ripe A. standleyanum fruits were placed in semipermeable cages on each of 14 small islands in Panama, and seed disappearance rates were calculated for each island. Spiny rat density and biomass were determined by live-trapping on each island for 5 consecutive days and 4 nights. Censuses of fruiting trees were conducted on each island to control for effects of food availability on removal of palm fruits. Disappearance rates were related positively to total spiny rat density, density of adult and subadult spiny rats, and spiny rat biomass, but, the density of fruiting trees accounted for very little variation. Spiny rats evidently prey heavily on A. standleyanum seeds, based on the high removal rates and on feeding observations of captive individuals. Since spiny rats may scatterhoard A. standleyanum seeds, they may also function as effective seed dispersers if seeds are removed to favourable germination sites unavailable to other seed predators. Results indicate that spiny rats, because of their abundance and wide distribution, may be important but overlooked predators and dispersers of A. standleyanum seeds and of other large-seeded tree species.

AB The change of mound structure of the fungus growing termite, Macrotermes gilvus, which has no clear air passage system in the mound, was examined in relation to the mound growth in a rubber plantation of southern Thailand. The nest proper consisted of the hive with a royal chamber and nursery, and diffused chambers with fungus combs. The location of the hive became higher with the growth of the mound. Therefore, colonies with a very large mound utilize only the upper mound part and this may be due to the lack of air passage systems in this species. A colony with a Very large mound is not in reality commensurately large in colony size and this may be the reason why the density of huge mounds of M. gilvus in Thailand is much higher than that of Macrotermes in Africa.

AB Isolated in forest patches, mangrove stands often experience different physical conditions (rainfall, tide, salinity) despite similar floristic composition and structure. These abiotic factors are known to influence mangrove phenology but their potential effect on the local invertebrate and bird fauna have not been investigated. This study contrasts two sites of black mangrove (Avicennia germinans) located on the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Panama. The two mangrove sites are characterized by different rainfall and tide patterns, and consequently ground inundation and salinity. These mangrove sites also differed in their plant phenology as well as invertebrate and bird composition. Although 95% of the bird species sampled occur on both coasts, the two mangrove sites shared only 34%. Moreover, each bird community was composed of a particular feeding guild assemblage consistent with the abundance distribution of their invertebrate-prey. Because floristically similar mangrove stands can support different invertebrate and bird faunas, conservation efforts should target mangrove patches submitted to different physical factors in order to preserve biodiversity.

AB The effects of escape distance to parental trees and tree clusters on the removal of Brazil-nut seeds (Bertholletia excelsa, Lecythidaceae) by vertebrate seed predators were examined in an entirely undisturbed stand of Brazil-nut trees of eastern Amazonia. Population density estimates, based on line-transect censuses, are also presented for Bertholletia trees and agoutis (Dasyprocta leporina), the most important scatterhoarder and seed predator of Brazil-nuts at this site. Seed removal experiments were conducted within and outside a natural Bertholletia tree cluster (castanhal) during both the wet and dry seasons. While there were no within-cluster effects of escape distance from parent trees on seed removal rates, overall seed removal within the cluster was significantly greater than that well outside the duster. Moreover, removal rates in the wet season were consist entry higher than those in the dry season both within and outside the tree cluster. Results suggest that the probability of early seed survival for Bertholletia, in relation to distance to seed sources, operates on different spatial scales, and that seed predators allocate greater foraging effort to scattered seeds during the fruitfall (wet) season, when buried seed stocks are being cached by agoutis.

ID LARGE TERMITE MOUNDS; ISOPTERA; UGANDA; KENYA; POPULATIONS; SUBHYALINUS
AB The position of Miacrotermes michaelseni mounds were mapped in six areas of 1.5 to 31.0 ha in a range of habitats on the fringes of the Okavango delta. Abundance varied significantly between and within habitats with highest densities in relatively stable floodplain woodland. In all sites apparent overdispersion of active mounds was not statistically significant when edge effects were taken into account. When active and inactive mounds were combined some overdispersion was seen but due to the disturbance regime the probability of all mounds being active simultaneously was small. Intraspecific competition was, therefore, not considered likely. Our results and reanalyses of dispersion patterns in published accounts for Macrotermes species suggest that although mound dispersion can appear to be regular this is probably a result of historical precedence and chance events rather than any current density-dependent process.

AB The variations in macronutrient concentrations of the leaves of Terminalia superba and Pycanthus angolensis were studied and the concentrations of nutrients in leaves before abscission were compared with those after abscission. The amounts of nutrients returned to the forest floor were also computed from litter fall data at the start of maximum annual fall in the Reserve. With the exception of potassium in Pycanthus angolensis, there were significant variations in the nutrient concentrations of the two species with the time of year. With increasing leaf age the concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium declined in Terminalia superba while magnesium concentration decreased in Pycanthus angolensis leaves. Furthermore, calcium showed an increasing concentration in Terminalia superba with increase in leaf age. The concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium decreased before leaf fall. Estimated losses in nitrogen phosphorus and potassium before abscission were 44, 53 and 50%, respectively, whereas generally there was an increase (40%) in the concentration of calcium at leaf fan. Magnesium did not follow a definite pattern. The return of calcium through litter fall to the forest floor was the greatest of all the major elements. The distribution and Variation of foliar nutrient concentrations in the leaves of Terminalia superba and Pycanthus angolensis and the importance of the amount of litter and the concentration of the various nutrients in the influencing soil fertility are discussed.

AB The fate of seeds of eight tree species was followed during 4 y of storage in the soil of an Afromontane forest at Gara Ades in the eastern highlands of Ethiopia. Seeds were enclosed in nylon mesh bags and buried at 5 cm soil depth. The bags were exhumed at intervals and the viability of the seeds was assessed by germination and cutting tests. Seeds of Bersama abyssinica and Ekebergia capensis germinated in the soil almost completely within a year after burial. The seeds of Juniperus procera, Olea europaea and Podocarpus falcatus also germinated to a substantial degree in the soil but with a distribution over several years, and some seeds of these species remained Viable at the end of the 4-y period. Germination in the soil was very low in seeds of Acacia abyssinica and Croton macrostachyus throughout the whole burial period and the seeds kept their viability. In C. macrostachyus fresh seeds were highly dormant, but after 3 y or more in the soil they germinated readily in the laboratory suggesting an altered dormancy with time in the soil. Dormancy in seeds of A. abyssinica and Indigofera rothii was not altered throughout the study period as evidenced by marginal or no germination during incubation in the laboratory. The differential seed behaviour observed during storage in the soil can be an indicator of the regeneration strategy of the species studied. B. abyssinica, E. capensis, J. procera, O. europaea and P. falcatus form seedling banks on the forest floor and lack persistent soil seed reserves in contrast to A. abyssinica, C. macrostachyus and I. rothii which accumulate reserves of long-lived seeds in the soil. The generally high levels of dormancy and somewhat extended viability in the soil, even in several of the species producing seedlings in undisturbed forest, may have been selected for under a climate of seasonal drought and unreliable rainfall that characterizes this region.

AB Hong Kong has a native angiosperm fora of approximately 1800 species, of which 27% (482 spp.) bear fleshy, presumably vertebrate-dispersed fruits, including 76% of the 337 tree and shrub species and 70% of the 103 climber species. Morphological characteristics were determined for 255 species and nutritional characteristics of the fruit pulp for 153 species. Most fruit species were black (45.1%) or red (24.3%) and 85.9% had a mean diameter <13 mm. Nutritional characteristics varied widely between species with ranges and median values as follows: pulp percentage (range 10.0-99.2%, median 69.2%), water content of pulp (11.1-94.0%, 78%), lipid (0-84.0%, 2.0%), soluble carbohydrate (4-88%, 53%), nitrogen (0.2-3.4%, 0.86%), neutral detergent fibre (1-44%, 14.3%). Fruit development time (50-360 d, 156 d) showed a negative correlation with lipid content, but no significant correlation with fruit or seed size. Principal components analysis of fruit characteristics was dominated by a trend from single-seeded fruits with a thin, lipid-rich pulp layer to multiple-seeded fruits with much, watery, carbohydrate-rich pulp. Bird-dispersed species cover the full range of fruit characteristics except those too large to swallow and too hard to peck bits from. Mammals (bars, civets and/or macaques) are known or suspected to consume most of the fruits too large for birds as well as many bird fruits but none with high-lipid content. Summer fruits (May-September) were significantly larger and had significantly higher seed size and carbohydrate content than winter fruits (November-March). Winter fruits took more than twice as long to develop as summer fruits.

AB Experiments were performed to investigate monthly variations in seed fate of Carapa procera (Meliaceae), a rodent-dispersed subcanopy tree species in French Guiana. A total of 600 thread-marked seeds were placed on the ground in mature forest under 20 adult trees during different months (March, April and May 1991) of the species' fruiting season. In 1991 the seed crop reached 1536 seeds in the study area, with a majority of seeds being produced in March and May. On average, seed removal rate steadily increased from March (23%) to May (96%). Of the seeds removed, the proportion cached almost doubled between March (28%)-April (25%) and May (48%), whereas the proportion eaten (gnawed) steadily declined between March (43%) and May (9%). Approximately 75-100% seed removal was therefore associated with intense scatterhoarding and low seed predation, especially in May. Greater seed dispersal rates occurred during the late wet season when fruit diversity decreased but when overall fruit biomass peaked because of fruiting occurrence of large-seeded species. The seasonal hoarding behaviour of rodents is discussed.

AB Root biomass, root lengths, and mycorrhizal associations were compared in a series of primary and Acacia-dominated secondary rainforest stands on nutrient-poor, red podzolic soils developed from low grade Palaeozoic metasediments. Five soil cores to 200 mm depth were collected at random locations from each of 20 sites. Ten of these sites were in 20-25 m high closed secondary forest (30-40 y old) dominated by Acacia aulacocarpa and ten sites were located in primary, selectively-logged, rainforest (28-32 m tall). Arbuscular mycorrhizas were the only form of association found in the primary forest sites. Ectomycorrhizas dominated the secondary forest sites although arbuscular mycorrhizas were also present. The primary forest sites had significantly higher root biomass (34.4 +/- 17.8 t ha(-1)) and root length (33,400 +/- 3,200 km ha(-1)) than the secondary forests (11.6 +/- 4.6 t ha(-1) and 25,200 +/- 4,800 km ha(-1) respectively), and this was interpreted as a reflection of the greater allocation of biomass to roots necessary to support the greater above ground biomass. The specific root length in the secondary forest (340 +/- 119 cm g(-1)) was twice that of the primary forest (154 +/- 65 cm g(-1)) indicating that the trees in the secondary forests achieved a degree of soil exploration which was comparable to that in the primary forest with less than half the biomass allocation to roots. The dominance of ectomycorrhizas in the secondary forest was associated with the prevalence of Acacia aulacocarpa, and the results cannot be extended to other secondary forests in the region. The implications that the dominant ectomycorrhizal associations have for the patterns of successional development and the patterns of species colonization in these Acacia-dominated secondary forests are discussed.

AB The effect of canopy species dominance on understorey light availability in secondary forests was examined for Pentaclethra macroloba and Goethalsia meiantha, two common tree species with contrasting canopy architecture at La Selva Biological Station in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa Rica. In each of six 12- to 16-year-old successional stands dominated by one of these species, relative abundance and basal area of the focal species were determined within a 20 m x 50 m plot. Light availability at 1 m height was measured within each plot using a Licor-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer at 27 locations and by analysing hemispherical photographs taken at 10 locations. Across stands, mean LAI values were significantly negatively correlated with canopy openness. Understorey microsites beneath Pentaclethra had significantly higher light availability than microsites beneath Goethalsia. Across stands, however, light availability was not correlated with either total basal area or stem density of trees greater than or equal to 10 cm DBH. These results indicate that basal area and stem density of trees in the upper levels of the forest canopy are poor predictors of light penetration to the understorey. One hypothesis suggested here is that dense subcanopy and understorey vegetation in tropical secondary forests can strongly influence understorey light levels. Alternatively, light transmittance characteristics of the upper forest canopy may be influenced by species-specific differences in canopy architecture or foliage density that vary independently from tree diameter and density.

AB The growth habits of five species of hemiepiphytic fig trees (Ficus subgenus Urostigma) were compared to see if any species occupied distinct canopy positions or showed unique host preferences in lowland rain forest in Gunung Palung National Park, Indonesian Borneo. Highly significant differences among species were found in the height of establishment on hosts, the level at which fig crowns were deployed, and the size and taxa of host trees. Ficus stupenda, F. dudia, and F. subtecta all had mean establishment heights between 29 and 31 m above the ground, had their crowns in the upper canopy, and predominantly occupied large trees in the Dipterocarpaceae. F. consociata and F. xylophylla established at significantly lower mean heights of 24 and 18 m respectively, had their crowns predominantly in lower canopy layers, and disproportionately occupied smaller non-dipterocarp trees. These patterns were consistent both within lowland forest on alluvial terraces, which was most intensively sampled, and when data were combined from three other contiguous lowland forest habitats. Ficus species appear to be specialized to some extent for distinct microhabitats within the canopy.

AB The root and trunk characteristics of species in a complex, lowland, evergreen, tropical rainforest at a seasonally inundated, coastal site on siliceous sands were examined. Roots in the soil were predominantly colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi although ectomycorrhizas were found on four species which contributed almost 25% of total basal area. Surface root mats were not a characteristic of the study site. In contrast, the ability to produce apogeotropic (upwardly growing) aerial roots which grew on and within the bark on trunks and branches was a consistent feature of the dominant species of trees in this forest. Eleven species representing eight families and constituting more than 85% of the basal area at the site produced these roots. Most trunks with DBH greater than 20 cm supported apogeotropic aerial roots produced by a range of species including themselves. Apogeotropic roots were most frequently found on the basal 0.5 m of trunks; however, they did occur up to 5 m above the forest floor. Apogeotropic aerial roots originated both from epicormic buds under the bark and from soil, and they were frequently colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal fungi. There was a strong association between the ability to support these upwardly growing roots and the occurrence of laminated papery and flaky bark. We postulate that production of apogeotropic roots may provide a mechanism for nutrient uptake and root respiration during periods of inundation, for intercepting nutrients in stemflow and/or for extracting nutrients from bark.

AB Seasonal variation in the consumption of cactus fruit by the bat Glossophaga longirostris was related to the availability of this resource in the arid pocket of Lagunillas in the Venezuelan Andes. When fruits were scarce, G. longirostris ate items not preferred in other seasons. The intra-specific flowering periods of the most common cactus species, Stenocereus griseus and Subpilocereus repandus, were synchronized but the number of flowers open per night was low. S. griseus and S. repandus had separate flowering and fruiting periods, possibly to reduce competition for dispersers and poliinators while providing food resources for bats throughout the year. G, longirostris is bimodally polyestrous with extended reproductive periods, probably as a response to the continual availability of cactus flowers and fruits. A strong interdependence between columnar cacti and G. longirostris was demonstrated. Sexual reproduction of the cacti would be greatly reduced without the bats, which in turn could not live in the arid study area without the food sources provided by these cacti.

AB The relationship between sepal and nut size of fruits was studied in fruit of 394 species of Dipterocarpaceae in Malesia and Sri Lanka. The fruits of many dipterocarps have long twisted sepals which have a role as blades for dispersal by gyration. But long sepals decrease resource allocation to other parts, and increase the chance of fruit being trapped in the canopy. The frequency distribution of the ratio of sepal length to nut length was bimodal. The gyration-dispersed group with longer sepals comprised 74% of Dipterocarpaceae studied. The group with short sepal mainly comprised understorey trees, but there were a few emergents. In both groups, sepal areas were expressed as a power function of nut volumes'. Because fruit weight per sepal area increases with fruit size, larger fruits fall more quickly than smaller fruits, and sepals of the former can not serve so effectively as propeller blades. This is consistent with the fact that a few emergent trees with large nuts have short sepals and are not dispersed by gyration. Therefore, the re-evolution of shore fruit sepals appears to have been mainly due to two reasons: reduction of tree height and enlargement of nut size.

AB Clusters of four circular forest plots, 0.2 ha in total area, were inventoried for canopy tree (greater than or equal to 30 cm gbh) and terrestrial herb floristic composition at 46 sites in the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, Singapore. The Nature Reserve covers a complex mosaic of lowland tropical forest of different successional stages, with much of the area covered in secondary forest 50-100 years old developed on exhausted agricultural soils. A total of 449 species of tree and 59 species of terrestrial herb were recorded from the clusters. Facultatively-terrestrial epiphytes were excluded from the analysis. Possible reasons for the low herb diversity are discussed. There was a marked similarity between ordinations (detrended correspondence analysis) of the clusters based on tree canopy composition weighted by species relative contribution to cluster total basal area and the herb flora composition, with a highly significant correlation between first axis scores of the two ordinations. Both ordinations showed the three clusters from freshwater swamp forest to be highly distinctive from the rest. The two forest strata exhibited a parallel response to the successional gradient, though the low diversity and patchy distribution of the herb flora blurred the distinction between primary and secondary communities more clearly seen in canopy composition.

AB Two formicarial ant-plants endemic to Panama and adjacent areas of Costa Rica co-occur in mid-elevation cloud forest yet have distinctive modifications to house and feed small, retiring ants. Besleria formicaria (Gesneriaceae) hosts only Pheidole sp, which harvest the oil-rich seeds of its host and other plants and insect parts. Hoffmannia vesciculifera (Rubiaceae) hosts only Solenopsis sp. ants which obtain lipid and possibly other nutrients from vescicular tissues. Judging by their abundance in refuse deposits, fern sporangia appear to be a plentiful and evenly distributed resource exploited by both ant species.

AB Hurricane Gilbert caused disturbance to Jamaican montane rainforests in 1988. This study provides a detailed characterization of landscape-level changes in light below the canopy of these forests after the hurricane. Hemispherical photographs were taken below the forest canopy at four sites at permanent points 1 m above the ground between 7 and 33 mo after the hurricane. For each photograph photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was computed. PAR declined exponentially in all sites during the period of measurement. During the first 24 mo after the hurricane, PAR beneath the canopy was significantly greater in sites that had been defoliated during the hurricane than in sites where few trees bad been defoliated. By 28 mo after the hurricane there was no significant difference in PAR beneath the canopy among the four sites. By 33 mo after the hurricane canopy recovery was nearly complete and PAR was only slightly higher than measurements made before the hurricane. Our results were compared with studies of changes in light environment resulting from treefall gaps and under deciduous canopies. PAR during the first 18 mo after the hurricane was similar to that recorded in small canopy gaps in other forests. widespread defoliation caused by hurricanes can thus increase PAR beneath the canopy over large areas and consequently opportunities may arise for widespread recruitment of tree species in response to increased light levels.

AB In the Sahel during recent decades, anthropogenic disturbance and periods of drought have caused changes in woody species frequency. The internal water status of six coexisting species was analysed to estimate the importance of water constraints in this process. Predawn and midday xylem pressure potential and stomatal conductance were monitored monthly for two years. The relations between xylem pressure potential and transpiration made it possible to determine the hydraulic conductivity of the soil-plant system. Two types of results were obtained. First, there was considerable diversity in water status of the different species. Minimum predawn xylem pressure potentials (dry season) ranged from -1.5 MPa to -5 MPa depending on species, with interseasonal variation from 0.08 MPa to 2 MPa. Response to rainfall was very rapid (a few days) or very slow (several months). The three functioning types defined using these results were compared with the phytogeographical status of the species. Second, more specific phenomena were observed. (a) Some species (Balanites aegyptiaca and Boscia senegalensis) showed an imbalance between the predawn xylem pressure potential and the soil water status during the rainy season; (b) a sharp increase in xylem pressure potential was observed in deciduous species in the middle of the dry season; probably related to bud break; and (c) the water status was always favourable for Combretum glutinosum. The few remaining individuals seem to benefit from very favourable subsoil water supply conditions.

AB A comparative study of the damage caused by Hurricane Hugo on the three main types of forest in the lesser Antilles was carried out in the mangrove forest, the semi-evergreen forest and the rainforests of Guadeloupe. Hurricane impact on these forests showed at first that high canopy trees generally prevented understorey trees from heavy direct damage (shield effect). In the species-poor, structurally homogeneous stands, in the mangrove forest, species' susceptibility was the major determinant in both intensity and type of damage. Damage was heavy in places and showed a certain spatial uniformity. In the rainforest, the high structural complexity of the vegetation generally induced a great variability in the spatial distribution of damage even at a small scale. Due to the presence of tall trees, indirect damage was locally very heavy. Clumps of large trees formed resistant structures which diminished lethal damage below the main canopy (cluster effect). In such a highly structured, species-rich forest, species' susceptibility was concealed at the local scale by the prevailing influence of vertical structure. Because of its relatively rich flora but low stature, the semi-deciduous forest exhibited intermediate patterns of damage. It was concluded that floristic composition and forest structure help to explain, and to predict, hurricane damage to forest cover.

AB Changes in structure of a Costa Rican upper montane Quercus forest were studied in twelve 0.1 ha plots along a chronosequence including 8- to 20-year-old Early Secondary Forest (ESF), 25- to 32-year-old Late Secondary Forest (LSF) and mature Primary Forest (PF). In 1.2 ha 2854 stems greater than or equal to 3.0 cm dbh belonging to 42 tree species were recorded. Tree species richness per 0.1 ha ranged from 15 to 30. Diversity indices did not change significantly during succession. Stem density did not differ significantly among successional phases, while basal area was significantly higher in PF than in ESF and LSF. Maximum canopy height and basal area increased linearly during the first three decades of recovery. Height and dbh showed a significant, logarithmic regression for all forest phases. A period of 84 y was estimated as the theoretically minimum time needed for structural recovery. The maximum canopy height and basal area recovered two to five times slower in upper montane than in lower montane or lowland Neotropical forests.

AB A total of 200 variable-area plots covering 20.3 ha containing 4000 trees with a basal area of 921.4 m(2) were assessed over a combined elevational range of 410-2180 m in the moist forests of three Tanzanian Eastern Are mountains: West Usambara, Nguru and Udzungwa. Plot data were ordinated on the basis of species presence/absence, frequency and basal area. Axis 1 of ordinations based on species presence/absence are correlated with elevation. Axis 1 of the frequency-weighted ordination was correlated with elevation in the Nguru and Udzungwa mountains, but plots from the West Usambara showed a rainfall-related discontinuity. Axis 1 of the West Usambara basal area-weighted ordination showed evidence of long-term dynamics of Ocotea usambarensis and in the Udzungwa mountains was determined by presence of Parinari excelsa. Plot diversity was not correlated with elevation or latitude, but was lower in disturbed, low rainfall or more seasonal forest. Stem density was positively correlated with elevation and was greater on ridge tops than valley sides and valley bottoms.

AB A total of 14 spotlight surveys were carried out from January 1992 to February 1993 along 37 km of the Klias River in north-western Sabah, Malaysia. Surveys were at low tide between 1900 and 0600 h from a survey boat at 15 km h(-1) by two observers. A total of 221 sightings were made, which varied between 2 and 29 per survey (mean 15.8). A total of 55 juvenile crocodiles were captured, with 16 recaptures. Calculated density was 0.9-1.8 individuals km(-1), while the estimated crocodile population was 46.1 +/-10.2 (SD) for the survey area. Percentage sightings according to total length were: 42% less than or equal to 0.5 m; 40% >0.5-less than or equal to 1.0 m; 5% >1.0-less than or equal to 3.0; and 13% eyes only. Recapture of 16 tagged juveniles suggested that hatchlings less than or equal to 0.5 m total length remained within >0.5 km of their release point for at least one month, and juveniles 0.5-less than or equal to 1.0 m more than one year. Hatchlings had growth rates between 0.01 and 0.08 cm d(-1) and 0.3 and 1.5 g d(-1), while larger juveniles grew at least 0.11 cm d(-1) and 2.7-2.9 g d(-1). Stomachs of hatchlings and juveniles contained crabs (Ocypodidae), prawns (Atyidae), insects and small fish (Hemiramphidae). Relatively large numbers of juvenile Crocodylus porosus (82.4%) in the Klias River suggests that the area, though under hunting pressure, is desirable as a site for the conservation of C. porosus in the Sabah.

AB Evidence from southern African semi-arid savannas suggests that high elephant densities in nature reserves cause the over-utilization of woodlands. Northern Botswana, with its prolific elephant population, is expected to follow such a pattern unless the densities of elephants which could be sustained by indigenous woodlands are determined and maintained at carrying capacity. Above ground biomass production was estimated for mopane (Colophospermum mopane) woodlands, a principal food source for elephants, which grows over much of northern Botswana. Densities of trees and shrubs, dimensions of plants and elephant densities were recorded within stratified plots situated according to a regional rainfall gradient. Mean estimates of above ground biomass (foliage and twigs) were 9.41 and 7.83 t ha(-1) for shrubs and trees respectively. A logistic model described the maximum levels of biomass removal from plants before over-utilization of mopane occurred. Variables incorporated in the model included above ground biomass of mopane shrubs and trees, growth rates of plants and expected off-take by elephants. The model predicted a complete biomass regain within 10 y if no elephant browsing occurs. Intensive elephant browsing in woodlands containing 15 elephants km(-2), however, can suppress biomass production if growth rates of plants fall below 70% of the maximum annual rate. Nonetheless, there was no substantial evidence to suggest that elephants will reduce the biomass of mopane woodlands in northern Botswana below a sustainable level if their numbers are allowed to increase considerably beyond the current estimate.

AB Cape clawless otters Aonyx capensis and African mottled eels Anguilla bengalensis were suspected of reducing numbers of rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in the upper Kairezi River, Zimbabwe, by preying on them and competing for the river crab Potamon perlatus. The analysis of otter, eel and trout diets showed that this is unlikely. Trout was an unimportant prey item for otters, none were found in the stomachs of 13 large eels, and any predation was probably minimised by the low densities of these predators. Some competition was probably present because crabs occurred in the diets of otters (relative occurrence 41.9%), eels (63.2%) and trout (7.4%), but it was impossible to quantify. Since these predators shared the crab food resource, the guild concept provided the basis for an analysis of their potential competitive relationships. Comparisons between the sizes of crabs selected and those available suggested that resource partitioning was occurring. Trout selected small crabs from the invertebrate drift, and because they were restricted by their mouth gapes. Otters and large eels ate larger, more abundant crab sizes; it is proposed that they instead partition resources spatially by feeding in separate micro-habitats. Intraguild predation by otters on eels may benefit trout by reducing competition for aquatic insects. Competition within the guild probably recedes in the dry season, when eels become inactive.

AB Five species of rodent (Rattus rattus wroughtoni, Mus platythrix, Funambulus tristriatus, Cremnomys blanfordi and Golunda ellioti) were live-trapped over a period of eight months in three different habitat types (moist evergreen forest, moist deciduous forest and teak plantation) in Anaimalais Wildlife Sanctuary, Tamil Nadu, India. Small mammal densities ranged between 16.3 individuals ha(-1) and 20.7 ha(-1) for the natural forest sites and were 10.4 ha(-1) in the teak plantation. Moist deciduous forest had the highest species richness and diversity scores. Although the teak plantation site had the same mammal species richness as the moist evergreen forest, numbers of individuals and overall small mammal biomass in the plantation was far lower than on the natural forest sites. Compared to moist deciduous forest, species richness and diversity were significantly lower on the teak plantation. R. r. wroughtoni and M. platythrix were the two most common species captured on all three sites. R. r, wroughtoni was the most common small mammal species captured, reaching densities of 14.5 ha(-1) in moist evergreen forest. G, ellioti was the least common species, present only in moist deciduous forest. Demographic patterns and microhabitat selection were examined for R. r. wroughtoni, M. platythrix, and F. tristriatus. Only M. platythrix appeared to show any distinct seasonality in reproduction, with an increase in capture of breeding individuals towards the end of the wet season. Discriminant analysis did not reveal any distinct microhabitat preferences for any of the species. However, R. r. wroughtoni showed a significant association with bamboo, and F. tristriatus was associated with areas of higher canopy height and density in moist deciduous forest.

AB The relationship between seedling recruitment (under and away from parent trees) and the behaviour of seed dispersers and predators, was explored in a three-year study in Kibale National Park, Uganda. On the basis of 1261 hours of observation, the foraging activity of the diurnal frugivores which fed on fruit from six tree species was quantified. The fate of dispersed and non-dispersed seeds and seedlings was examined experimentally. The findings suggest that a trade-off exists between factors that promote seedling growth in areas with high seedling density and factors that promote dispersal by frugivores. For example, dispersal of Mimusops bagshawei increases both seed and seedling survival; seeds placed away from adult conspecifics had a 8% lower probability of disappearing than seeds placed under adults and seedlings away from adults had a 30% greater probability of surviving than seedlings grown under adults. In contrast, for Uvariopsis congensis, dispersed seeds had a 56% greater probability of disappearing than seeds directly under a parent tree, while the survival of dispersed and non-dispersed seedlings was similar. Non-dispersed seed and seedling disappearance were correlated with the percentage of the Fruit crop removed from focal trees, suggesting that the ability to survive under an adult maybe related to other aspects of the tree's life history.

AB Two dung beetle assemblages from rainforest and open forest in the wet tropics of north-eastern Australia are described. The fauna was sampled using flight intercept traps, baited pitfall traps and light traps, with flight intercept traps being the most effective sampling technique. Dung beetle species were found to be highly habitat specific with a switch from rainforest to open forest assemblages occurring over tens of metres. The majority of the fauna was active at night. The most abundant species were attracted to a variety of food types but several species appeared to specialize on either dung or mushrooms.

ID WEST-AFRICA; NIGERIA; RESERVOIR
AB The phytoplankton periodicity of a tropical upland reservoir in Nigeria (Liberty Dam, Jos Plateau) and a temperate-type lake (L. Naranbagh) from the Kashmir Himalaya were compared. Variations in the phytoplankton communities in the water-bodies were both quantitative and qualitative. Liberty Dam conformed to the oligotrophic-desmid plankton type whilst in L.Naranbagh, phytoplankton resembled the eutrophic chlorococcales-diatom plankton type. Contrary to the general belief of muted (or lack of) seasonal changes in tropical regions, phytoplankton succession in the Jos reservoir was pronounced with dense persistence of some species for relatively short periods. The most striking fluctuations, typical of many temperate waters, were characteristic of L. Naranbagh with a build-up of plankton during summer and autumn. Variability in photosynthetic productivity was related to shifts in the climate-dependent population densities. The seasonal growth of the Jos phytoplankton reflected the alteration from the dry 'Harmattan' (December-February) to wetter (May-September) periods. These are analogous to the winter (December-February) and summer (June-August) seasons of the Kashmir Himalayan Valley. Phytoplankton associations and periodicities in each of the two warm-belt lakes were strongly driven by their respective local environments, including especially the marked seasonality of the climatic variables (rain, wind and solar radiation). Detailed comparisons of adequate long-term data from tropical and temperate waters are still required.

AB The life history of Cora marine was followed for one year in two permanent streams at 600 m elevation in Guanacaste National Park, Costa Rica. The water temperature was c. 21 degrees C year-round, but there was a distinct wet-dry seasonality, very little rain falling from January to May. In both streams, C. marina was univoltine. Adults first appeared at the beginning of May and the flight period coincided with the wet season. The availability of water-soaked logs as oviposition sites probably restricts reproduction to the wet Season. Eggs hatched from mid-July to December. Recruitment to subsequent larval instars was slow during the wet season but increased at the start of the dry season. Final-instar larvae were collected from March to October. Oviposition in logs above the stream and the ability to live in the low oxygen conditions of the hyporheic zone probably allow eggs and small larvae to survive wet season spates.

AB Changes in the composition and structure of mid-altitude, semi-deciduous tropical forest in Mpanga Research Forest Reserve, Uganda are described for a 25-year period between 1968 and 1993. Three surveys of a 0.64 ha (80 m x 80 m) permanent plot were carried out in 1968, 1982 and 1993, during which a total of 397 trees with a dbh greater than or equal to 9.5 cm were identified. Forty-nine species were identified in total, representing 19 families. Eight individuals remain unidentified. Dbh measurements were recorded for 359 non-buttressed trees, whilst the equivalent measurement for 38 buttressed trees was the diameter of the trunk immediately above the buttress. Basal area, diversity and density of trees increased within the plot during the survey period by, respectively, 8% (from 39.2 to 42.2 m(2) ha(-1)), 7% (from 44 to 47 species) and 11% (459 to 508 trees ha(-1)). The main compositional changes were increases in understorey trees and a decline in seral taxa. Growth rates (productivity) and turnover were lower during the period 1982 to 1993 than the period 1968 to 1982. Rates of growth and mortality were generally highest in seral species and lowest in main canopy taxa. Mortality rates were also highest amongst the smallest trees enumerated (dbh <30 cm). Changes in composition and structure over the survey period are believed to reflect forest recovery after low intensity pit-sawing was curtailed from 1951. Forest recovery also may have caused the reduced growth rates and turnover recorded for the most recent survey period, by restricting the opportunities for light-demanding, faster-growing and relatively productive seral taxa, and to have outweighed any effects of externally-driven processes, such as changes in atmospheric conditions.

AB A survey of the diurnal raptor community (46 resident species) at five altitudinal levels from 100 to 4600 m was made in Venezuela using 106 1-km(2) sample quadrats and then compared with similar censuses (211 plots) in southwestern Colombia and eastern Ecuador. Six habitat types were defined and habitat preferences were measured from every encountered birds and from the association between individual abundances and the coverage of habitat types on plots. The overall species richness steeply declined with elevation in all three countries. The raptor community consisted mostly of tropical species that rapidly decreased in both abundance and frequency of occurrence with elevation. A small set of subtropical-temperate forest specialists partly replaced them al mid-elevation and only two species occurred in the paramo of Venezuela, against 5-7 in the other countries. Although originally the gradients were probably almost completely covered with forest, a large parr of the raptor community is now composed of grassland species, three of them extending from the lowlands to the tree line. The relative impoverishment of the Venezuelan community, especially at upper levels, is attributed to a peninsular effect at the narrow extreme northern tip of the Andes and perhaps also to Former forest fragmentation. Within some species, different subspecies had discrete altitudinal distributions and interspecific competition may explain differences in the range extension of some species between countries. Today, however, accelerating deforestation may result in a severe decline of forest-interior species and a probable reduction in the altitudinal range of at least some of them. Species naturally associated with forest gaps or edges usually tolerate a high degree of forest fragmentation and degradation bur only one of them may become abundant in heavily human-altered woodlands. Few grassland specialists have become more widely distributed in the increasingly deforested landscapes.

AB The trophic ecology of Konaino Creek, a small mountain headwater stream draining rainforest in the aseasonal tropics on Bougainville Island, Papua New Guinea, was examined and a food web was constructed. The major source of energy in Konaiano Creek was allochthonous detritus, most of which had been terrestrially degraded to fine particulate organic matter rather than entering the stream as leaf litter. This line detritus was collected by the filler-feeders (mostly Simuliidae and also Hydropsychidae) which formed the dominant Functional feeding group (64.4% of the fauna). Thus filterers processed most of the allochthonous detritus and made the energy available to other trophic levels, rather than shredders (1.7% of the fauna) which perform this role in temperate headwater streams. Collector-gatherers made up 22.7% of the fauna, carnivores, mostly Odonata, Decapoda (crabs) and Hydrobiosidae, comprised 2.8% of the Fauna and grazer-scrapers made up 7.4%. The latter were inhibited by low instream production owing to heavy shading and the instability and abrasion of the substrate due to frequent spates. In comparison, the trophic ecology of the nearby, coastal, Bovo River (with a catchment mainly in rainforest but mostly cleared with introduced species at the study site) was quite different and it was dominated by collector-gatherers (74%) and grazer-scrapers (15%).

AB Amorphophallus johnsonii (N. E. Brown) flowers during April in the main rainy season in Ghana. Anthesis starts at dusk with fluid oozing from the upper spadix accompanied by a strong aminoid odour. Just after dark large numbers of carrion beetles (Phaeochrous amplus) and occasional dung fly species (Hemigymnochaeta unicolor and Paryphodes tigrinus) visit the inflorescences. The beetles become trapped in the lower spathe overnight and remain in the spadix until the following evening. Between 1630 and 1645 h the following day, the anthers produce long threads of sticky pollen. The trapped beetles escape just after dark by crawling up the spadix, past the dehisced anthers and fly away from the spadix tip. Marked beetles were seen to transfer pollen from male phase to female phase inflorescences. Successful fertilisation was only effected if pollen was transferred on the same night from a male inflorescence 30 m or less away. Pollen is psilate and typical of beetle pollinated Araceae. Berries ripen approximately 70 d after fertilization and ripen basisetally in the infructescence.

AB Fog interception and rainfall were measured at 14 stations across the Central Cordillera in western Panama. Fog interception and rainfall were measured monthly during 1988-1989 with artificial fog catchers and rain gauges, respectively. Fog interception was highest on ridges and increased with increasing altitude. Fog interception contributed between 2.4 and 60.6% of the total water input, depending on altitude and exposure to the prevailing winds. Absolute amounts of annual fog interception ranged from 142 to 2295 mm. Although low clouds were more frequent in montane forests, clouds close to the ground also occurred in the lowlands. During the study period, there was a gradient of increasing total rainfall from the Caribbean (3355 mm) to the Pacific side (5759 mm) of the Central Cordillera. Nevertheless, rainfall was more seasonal on the leeward side of the mountain range. Seasonal variation in fog intereption was different from rainfall patterns and no correlation was found between monthly (or annual) rainfall and fog interception. The results of this study showed the importance of montane forests for the preservation of water sources, particularly along ridges of the Fortuna drainage basin that provides more than 50% of the electricity of the Republic of Panama.

AB Patterns of energy allocation in the cane toad, Bufo marinus, were explored by analysing the seasonal variations in at bodies and gonads in two populations subjected to different rainfall regimes and water permanency. In both populations? fat deposition occurred shortly after the rainy season due to an increase in feeding activity. In contrast, the timing of reproduction varied between sites according to the availability of suitable water bodies. Nevertheless, Females with mature oocytes were predominant during the dry season, even in populations that bred throughout the year in permanent ponds. This suggests that seasonal variations in the nutritional condition of adults may also result in a tendency towards cyclicity in the reproduction of B. marinus in tropical regions. Analyses of allometric relationships of reproductive and storage tissues with body weights indicated that the fractions of weights in reproductive tissues did nor vary either with the size of females or between populations. On the contrary, not only did larger toads have proportionally larger far bodies, bur those from wet sites had greater fractions of weight allocated to Fat bodies than those from dry sites. This suggests that reproductive output may be fixed in this species and, therefore, excess energy is allocated to Fat bodies. Given that the initiation of ovarian cycles depends on the restoration of proper nutritional levels, energy stored in fat bodies during breeding may allow females to resume a new ovarian cycle shortly after spawning and thus maximize the number of reproductive events.

AB The dispersal of African Acacia seeds in the presence and absence of large mammalian herbivores and ostriches was assessed in a savanna ecosystem in South Africa. In the absence of large herbivores, A. tortilis and A. nilotica pods were mainly dispersed in the shade, directly beneath the tree crown and seeds remained in pods for over 18 months. In the presence of large herbivores, A. tortilis, A. nilotica and A. karroo seeds were freed from pods and were dispersed into open, non-shaded habitats. Impala dispersed most A. tortilis seeds (18,900 ha(-1)), giraffe most A. nilotica seeds (1060 ha(-1)) and giraffe and kudu most A, karroo seeds (452 and 488 ha(-1), respectively). Seedling survival in dung in open environments may exceed that of seedlings in soil shaded beneath the tree crown. It appears that seed dispersal by large herbivores may be advantageous to future seedling recruitment.

AB Two mixed-species bird hocks were studied in a high-altitude humid secondary forest in the Andes of Ecuador. Birds were mist-netted and colour-ringed for individual identification. The flocks (A and B) were followed to record structure, dynamics, home range and activity pattern. All observations of the two hocks studied included members from all vertical levels, which is different from flocks of Amazonia. In two nucleus species, some individuals alternated between the flocks, a feature nor previously reported. Various tanagers were loosely associated, joining and leaving flocks. Minimum home-range sizes of flocks A and B were 4.2 ha and 7.8 ha, respectively. Some individuals of two species used an area encompassing the home ranges of both flocks. Mean flock sizes in A and B were 21.7 and 44.7 individuals, whereas the mean numbers of species were 13.7 and 21.7, respectively. Number of species and individuals were high compared to even most lowland flocks. Altogether, mixed-species flocks in different habitats and at various latitudinal and altitudinal sites appear to have some features in common, but others are highly distinct. Compared to the great stability of Amazonian flocks, some high-altitude flocks of secondary forest in the Andes appear to be more dynamic and unstable.

AB The fruit of six species of Diospyros (Ebenaceae) provide food for eight species of diurnal primates in the Lope Reserve, Gabon. Both succulent flesh and immature seeds are eaten but patterns of consumption vary among the primate species. Interactions between D. mannii, which has very large fruit (9 cm x 7 cm) and seeds (5 cm x 2 cm), and primates were observed in detail. D. mannii fruit are unusual, being covered by a dense mat of irritant hairs that are largely retained, but become looser on ripening, when fruit are abscissed. Primates do not ear immature seeds of this species bur do predate on seeds of some other Diospyros species. Ripe flesh (and ripe seeds) of D. mannii are eaten hy gorillas and chimpanzees but not by monkeys. Comparison of fruit characters and or feeding patterns of primates for the six Diospyros species suggests that large seeds are potentially vulnerable tu high levels of predation but the presence of irritant hairs provides protection during fruit development. Abscission of ripe fruit (shown only by D. mannii) appears to afford additional protection from predation on ripe seeds by arboreal monkeys. These observations underline the complexity of plant-animal interactions in tropical Forests and suggest that some fruit characters have evolved to reduce seed loss during maturation.

AB Archival rainfall data are used to investigate changes in drought frequency and severity in Sabah and other parts of northern Borneo since the late nineteenth century. Two measures of drought severity are used: drought duration (given by the number of consecutive months with less than 100 mm rain); and drought intensity (indexed by the cumulative rainfall deficit below 100 mm per month of a drought sequence). Within northern Borneo dry periods are very short (<3 months) and infrequent in Sarawak, south-western Sabah, Brunei and central and western Kalimantan; droughts occur seasonally, but are comparatively short in north-western Sabah; droughts are less frequent, but more severe in eastern Sabah and parts of eastern Kalimantan. In coastal Sabah and Brunei, there has been a statistically significant increase in the frequency and severity of droughts since the late 1960s. Al Sandakan, two drought-prone epochs in 1877-1915 and 1968-92 (each experiencing five droughts of at least 4 months duration) are identified, separated by a 52-year period that was nearly drought-free. At Sandakan also, the ecologically damaging 1982-3 drought was neither as long or severe as those of 1903 and 1915. Links with El Nino-Southern Oscillation events are found to be nor as strong as previous studies have suggested. Possible implications of the spatial and temporal patterns in drought magnitude-frequency for differences in tropical rain forest character within the region are discussed.

AB In the tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island, habitat characteristics, diel acidity changes, CO2 uptake and growth were investigated for the epiphytic cactus Epiphyllum phyllanthus (L.) Haw. It occurred most frequently in tree cavities with its roots in canopy soil and was especially abundant on two tree species: Platypodium elegans J. Vogel and Tabebuia guayacan (Seem.) Hemsl. Its maximum net CO2 uptake rates were low under natural conditions (1.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) but were comparable to those of other CAM and C-3 epiphytes under wet conditions in a screenhouse. Under both natural conditions and in the screenhouse, partial shade enhanced growth and CAM activity. When plants grew under a photosynthetic photon flux of c. 4 mol m(-2) d(-1), their nocturnal acidity increase and total net CO2 uptake were twice as much as for plants growing at lower (an average of 2.4 mol m(-2) d(-1)) and higher (7.7 mol m(-2) d(-1)) photosynthetic photon fluxes. Stem elongation was 27% greater at the intermediate photosynthetic photon flux. Seedlings of E. phyllanthus survived three months of drought and responded rapidly to rewetting, recovering fully within three days. Transpiration rates and nocturnal acidity increases also recovered to the values of well-watered plants a few days after rewetting, indicating that this species can take advantage of episodic rainfall during the dry season.

AB The abundance of all tree and shrub species has been monitored for eight years in a 50 ha census plot in tropical moist forest in central Panama. Here we examine population trends of the 219 most numerous species in the plot, assessing the impact of a long-term drying trend. Population change was calculated as the mean rate of increase (or decrease) over eight years, considering either all stems greater than or equal to 10 mm diameter at breast height (dbh) or just stems greater than or equal to 100 mm dbh. For stems greater than or equal to 10 mm, 40% of the species had mean growth rates <1% per year (either increasing or decreasing) and 12% had changes greater than or equal to 5% per year. For stems greater than or equal to 100 mm, the figures were 38% and 8%.
   Species that specialize on the slopes of the plot, a moist microhabitat relative to the plateau, suffered significantly more declines in abundance than species that did not prefer slopes (stems greater than or equal to 10 mm dbh). This pattern was due entirely to species of small stature: 91% of treelets and shrubs that were slope-specialists declined in abundance, but just 19% of non-slope treelets and shrubs declined. Among larger trees, slope and non-slope species fared equally. For stems greater than or equal to 100 mm dbh, the slope effect vanished because there were few shrubs and treelets with stems greater than or equal to 100 mm dbh. Another edaphic guild of species, those occurring preferentially in a small swamp in the centre of the plot, were no more likely to decline in abundance than non-swamp species, regardless of growth form. Species that preferentially colonize canopy gaps in the plot were slightly more likely to decrease in abundance than non-colonizing species (only for stems greater than or equal to 10 mm dbh, not greater than or equal to 100 mm). Despite this overall trend, however, several colonizing species had the most rapidly increasing populations in the plot.
   The impact of a 25-year drying trend and an associated increase in the severity of the 4-month dry season is having an obvious impact on the BCI forest. At least 16 species of shrubs and treelets with affinities for moist microhabitats are headed for extinction in the plot. Presumably, these species invaded the forest during a wetter period prior to 1966. A severe drought of 1983 that caused unusually high tree mortality contributed to this trend, and may also have been responsible for sharp increases in abundance of a few gap-colonizers because it temporarily opened the forest canopy. The BCI forest is remarkably sensitive to a subtle climatic shift, yet we do not know whether this is typical for tropical forests because no other large-scale censuses exist for comparison.

AB Effects of irradiance, root competition and water availability on germination and seedling establishment of Swietenia macrophylla King were investigated in tropical secondary dry forests in the Guanacaste Conservation Area, Costa Rica. The fate of seeds sown in the beginning and the middle of the rainy season was studied in abandoned pasture, and in deciduous and semi-evergreen secondary forest. In the pasture, experimental treatments were mown and unmown grass. In the forest sites, thinning to increase light and trenching to reduce root competition were combined in a factorial design. Effects of moisture availability on germination were tested by supplementing natural rainfall in the initial rainy month. Germination at the beginning of the rainy season was not influenced by the supplementary water and was higher in the semi-evergreen forest than in the deciduous forest and pasture. In the forests, germination was little affected by irradiance or root competition. More seeds germinated in unmown than in mown pasture during the initial rains, but were not influenced by mowing when sown in the peak of the rainy season. Seedling mortality was low (<10%) during the initial months, but increased greatly in the dry season. Seedlings germinating early in the rainy season had a higher survival than those germinating later. The relatively slight effects of the different treatments and habitats on seedling establishment suggest that this species is rather insensitive to the large microsite variation in secondary vegetation.

AB Ant species were sampled in three rainforest and 10 rehabilitated bauxite mine plots at Trombetas, in the tropical monsoonal region of Brazil. Rehabilitation ranged from 0 to 11 years in age and was mainly performed by planting mixed native forest tree species. One plot supported single-species blocks of Australian Eucalyptus and Acacia species. Two hundred and six ant species were recorded, of which 82 were exclusively found in the native vegetation, 54 were confined to the rehabilitation and 70 were found in both situations. In contrast with other studies, ant species richness in the Eucalyptus/Acacia plantation was as great as in the areas rehabilitated with native vegetation. The overall rate of return of ant species was considerably greater than in mines situated within subtropical regions of Brazil, Africa and Australia. However, if the greater richness of ants in the native vegetation at Trombetas was accounted for, the proportional return of the original ant fauna was not particularly rapid. The return of ant species slowed as the rehabilitated areas aged. In comparison with forest, the rehabilitation was characterized by proportionately more generalist species and fewer specialists, especially from the soil and litter layers. The full range of habitat requirements for the ant community has not been restored by the eleventh year of rehabilitation and further management may be required to enhance the degree of colonization. It is suggested that the findings for ants may apply to other components of the biota as well.

AB A permanent plot of 28 ha was established in a dense wet evergreen forest in the Western Chats of India to study the functioning of the ecosystem. Since April 1990, 1981 trees of greater than or equal to 30 cm gbh have been enumerated in a systematic sampling of five strips totalling 3.12 ha. This paper describes the main structural and floristic characteristics of the plot.
   The density (635 trees greater than or equal to 30 cm gbh per hectare) and basal area (39.7 m(2) ha(-1)) are high. Despite the high diversity (Simpson's D = 0.92 and Shannon's H' = 4.56), four species are distinctly dominant in terms of an importance value index (relative density + relative basal area). Each of these four species occupies a different layer in the ecosystem: Humboldtia brunonis Wall. (Fabaceae) dominates the undergrowth, Myristica dactyloides Gaertn. (Myristicaceae) the intermediate strata, Vateria indica L. (Dipterocarpaceae) the higher canopy level and Dipterocarpus indicus Bedd. (Dipterocarpaceae) the emergents. This pronounced species hierarchy is one of the most important characteristics of the evergreen forests of the Western Chats. The two dipterocarps account for 20.1% of the total number of trees and contribute 40.9% to the total basal area. This formation can, therefore, be considered as the westernmost lowland dipterocarp forest of Asia.
   Analysis of the spatial variations in the floristic composition and in the structure of the main species populations shows that two kinds of mature phases can be identified: where the topography is raised and gently sloping, the vertical structure of the stand is discontinuous, with Dipterocarpus indicus and Vateria indica forming an emergent layer above a dense undergrowth; on slopes, the stand is lower, vertically continuous and saturated with Vateria indica and Myristica dactyloides. The link between the structure of the stand and dynamic processes is discussed.

AB In a 1-ha plot all ground herb species were recorded. Within the plot selected properties were investigated in three 20 m x 20 m subplots. The number of ground herb species and individuals in the subplots were lowest near to a local hilltop and they increased towards the lowest part of the plot. There was no significant difference in canopy openness, or in thickness of leaf litter layer, between the upper and lower subplots. In the upper subplot the soil layer was thin and the weathered bedrock was close to the surface. In the lower subplot the soil was much deeper. The pH and concentrations of Mg were significantly lower and % loss-on-ignition, total P and total N concentrations were significantly higher in the upper subplot. Elevation and soil moisture were significantly correlated in the upper 10 cm of soil. It is not possible to select any one abiotic property as being the critical determinant of the gradient of ground herbs. However, it is suspected that the availability of water in the topsoil, particularly after droughts, may be more important than the soil nutrients in limiting herb distribution.

AB Trapping was conducted in primary and secondary forests to investigate the effects of past logging on small mammal communities. Thirteen 1-ha sites were snap-trapped for three consecutive days in tropical monsoon rainforest in Xishuangbanna Nature Reserve, southern China. A total of 3900 trap-days yielded 198 captures, of which 118 were in the primary forest and 80 in the secondary forest. A total of 12 ground-dwelling species (eight Rodentia, Muridae; three Insectivora, Soricidae; one Insectivora, Erinaceidae) were caught, five (all Rodentia, Muridae) occurred in the primary forest and ii in the secondary forest. The most abundant species was Niviventer confucianus, accounting for 62% and 39% of the total captures in the primary and the secondary forests, respectively. In the secondary forest the mean abundances of the two dominant species, N. confucianus and Maxomys surifer, were reduced, and a non-commensal form of Rattus rattles disappeared, but N. fulvescens showed no change while Mus pahari increased. The seven species which occurred only in secondary forest had very low abundance. Overall, the multivariate Mantel test showed the two communities to be significantly different. After logging, species diversity increased, and the two dominant species had increased body mass and their mean abundance decreased.

   tropical dry forest
ID SEMI-DECIDUOUS FOREST; COSTA-RICA; TREES; LOWLANDS
AB To examine the potential contribution of herbarium material to the description and analysis of tropical tree phenology, flowering times and geographical distribution were graphed for 1673 flowering collections from 18 species native to Neotropical dry forests and phenological differences between species were analysed. These include the timing and duration of flowering as well as morphological differences such as flowering on leafless twigs vs flowering on shoots bearing old or new foliage. Species-specific flowering periods of herbarium collections are similar to those observed in phenological field studies, but are often longer because of the larger geographical and temporal sampling range. Conspecific collections of different geographical origin show distinct differences in flowering periodicity, which are correlated with differences in the timing and intensity of the dry season. Interspecific differences in the timing of phenology relative to the dry season indicate differences in the control of phenology by seasonal drought. Herbaria thus represent a large potential source of phenological information which can either supplement and extend phenological field studies or provide phenological information for dry forest species not studied in the field but well represented in herbarium collections.

AB Data on densities, biomass and ecological factors governing the distribution of various wild ungulate species in the different management units of Gir forest from 1987 to 1989 were collected. Density of ungulates ranged from 50.8 km(-2) to 0.42 km(-2), the highest for chital (Axis axis), followed by chinkara (Gazella gazella), sambar (Cervus unicolor), nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus) and chowsingha (Tetracerus quadricornis). The density of chital did not vary significantly between different censuses and management units. The wild ungulate biomass ranged from 3290 kg km(-2) in the National Park to 1900 kg km(-2) in the Sanctuary East. Following the partial removal of people and livestock in the mid-1970s, there was an increase in the population of all wild ungulates except nilgai and wild pig (Sus scrofa). Concurrently, there was an increase in the proportion of wild ungulate prey in the lion's diet. Chital density has shown a 1320% increase. An increase in suitable habitats and a decrease in direct competition with livestock are the most likely factors to have triggered the eruption in chital population. These density estimates are discussed in relation to the prevailing ecological conditions in different management units of Gir.

AB The scaling of crown size and trunk diameter with tree height (allometry) was determined for 14 common species of the tropical wet lowland forest at La Selva, Costa Rica. The study showed that allometric differences between species are related to adult size, regeneration niche (gap vs. non-gap) and longevity, as follows: (1) adults of understorey species are larger crowned than similar statured (6-15 m) saplings of canopy trees; (2) species commonly found in gaps as saplings are somewhat larger crowned than shade-tolerant species over the 1-6 m height range; and (3) long-lived canopy species show greater increases in crown breadth with increasing height than do short-lived species. Trunkallometryis related to mechanical requirements for support, including the need to withstand greater wind forces in the upper canopy. The common canopy species, Pentaclethra macroloba, which comprises 40% of the basal area at La Selva, is particularly wide-crowned and thick-trunked at its maximum height. On the other hand, the comparatively narrower crowns and trunks of the other canopy species allow them to reach a given height with less biomass. These differences in allometry may influence tree density and forest structure at La Selva.

AB Introduced either accidentally or purposefully for the creation of cultivated pastures, African grasses are becoming major invaders of ecological reserves and national parks of the Brazilian savannas, the cerrado. African grasses are particularly good colonizers of disturbed sites. Germination in the field and laboratory, and seedling establishment in the field were studied for the African species Andropogon gayanus Kunth var. bisquamulatus (Hochst.) Hack., and for the native species Echinolaena inflexa (Poiret) Chase and Schizachyrium tenerum Nees. The African species had a higher and faster germination rate than the two native species, but its seedling mortality was higher. The main cause of seedling mortality in the field was herbivory by ants. It is suggested that the invasion of cerrado by African grasses depends on the kind of management being practised.

AB Palmate umbrella tents used by tent-making bats in Trinidad, West Indies, were observed in three species of Neotropical palms, Sabal mauritiiformis, Coccothrinax barbadensis and Mauritia flexuosa. Tents were most common in palm leaves that have supporting petioles angled at 50-70 degrees above the horizontal. The shape and volume of tents is influenced mostly by leaf morphology (leaf width and leaflet length) and age of the tent. Tent-crowns varied from being heart-shaped in S. mauritiiformis, oval or round in C. barbadensis and spade-shaped in M. flexuosa. Leaves in which tents were constructed were most often beneath overhanging vegetation, and were generally free of vegetation below, allowing bats to enter and depart from tents without being impeded by the clutter of adjacent vegetation.
   Singles and small apparent harem groups of two bat species, Artibeus jamaicensis and Uroderma bilobatum, were captured and observed in tents made from the leaves of S. mauritiiformis and C. barbadensis. No bats were observed in tents constructed in leaves of M. flexuosa. The apparent harem social organization in these and other tent-making bat species suggests that leaves modified into tents may provide critical and defendable resources that promote the evolution of polygyny. This hypothesis is based on the observed patchy distribution of suitable palm trees, the inappropriateness of many palm leaves as potential tents and the resultant architecture provided by palmate umbrella tents. We suggest that tent-making is an adult male behaviour.

AB The effects of heat treatment and fire on seed germination of Acacia sieberiana D.C. and Acacia gerrardii Benth. were studied. Dry heat and fire were studied separately. Seeds treated with dry heat were set to germinate in petri-dishes under laboratory conditions. Other seeds were planted in plots at the Uganda Institute of Ecology, Mweya, which were then burnt, and subsequent seedling emergence was monitored. The effect of heat treatment on seed germination depended on heat intensity and duration of exposure. Higher intensities reduced the germination capacity of Acacia seeds. Short exposure of seeds stimulated germination but prolonged exposure rapidly reduced seed viability. A. sieberiana had a higher heat resistance than A. gerrardii. The survival and germination of seeds after fire increased with depth of burial and A. sieberiana survived better than A. gerrardii. The germinability of seeds of A. gerrardii was not significantly increased by fire.

AB The Kibale Forest, western Uganda, is the only site where studies have compared the impact of elephants on rainforest regeneration in logged and unlogged control areas. Elephants used heavily logged areas more than lightly logged and unlogged areas. Forest gaps were used more by elephants than closed-canopy areas and large gaps more than small ones. Gaps were larger in logged than unlogged forest. There were lower densities of young trees (saplings and poles) and a higher incidence of elephant damage to them in heavily logged forest than in lightly logged and unlogged sites. Elephant use of an area and damage to young trees was inversely or unrelated to the density of young trees and directly related to the density of herbaceous tangle. Heavy logging resulted in large areas of herbaceous tangle, which attracted elephants who suppressed forest regeneration by damaging young trees and perpetuating the herbaceous tangle. The tangle directly competed with regeneration of young trees while also attracting elephants and rodents (seed and seedling predators) and facilitating increased windthrow of trees. Selective browsing of young trees by elephants affected rates of regeneration, growth form and species composition. Rather than remove elephants, a more effective and humane approach to long-term management of logging is to reduce logging offtake and incidental damage caused by timber extraction.

AB A bibliographical and herbarium investigation on the pollination syndrome of Mexican columnar cacti (tribe Pachycereeae) was conducted. Most Mexican species of columnar cacti show a chiropterophilic - pollination syndrome and they flower synchronously in March to May. The floral biology, reproductive system and visitors (to both fruits and flowers) of Neobuxbaumia tetetzo, the most abundant and dominant columnar cactus of succulent forest in the Tehuacan Valley, were studied. This species reached densities of c. 1200 individuals ha-L. The bats Leptonycteris curasoae and Choeronycleris mexicana were its only pollinators, whilst a more diverse array of visitors disperse seeds. Contrary to findings for multiple pollinators of columnar cacti in extratropical deserts in North America, the relationships between N. tetetzo and nectar-feeding bats was strong and tightly coupled in Mexico.

AB Cordia elaeagnoides is locally important within a large area of southern Mexico as a highly gregarious canopy tree of dry forest and as a timber species. Its recruitment is problematic so studies of its reproduction and population dynamics were undertaken. The distylous hewers are apparently self-compatible, and pollination and seed dispersal are by wind. Pre-dispersal mortality is largely from embryo abortion, and post-dispersal predation is mostly by generalist rodents. Some seeds may survive in enforced dormancy for two or more years. Recruitment was apparently absent for more than a decade, but had previously occurred within established stands, where size classes were interspersed at random. Population size structure suggests that recruitment over the last century occurred in several pulses. Growth rates determined from ring counts and remeasurement of marked trees support a size-age relationship. The youngest reproductive trees are estimated to be about 18 years old, and about 5% of the present population is over 95 years old.

AB A population of the tropical lizard Tropidurus hispidus, isolated on a granitic rock outcrop in tropical forest of northern Brazil, was studied during the 1993 wet season. Four types of observational studies revealed that lizards are active throughout most of the day. During 10-minute intervals, individual lizards moved five times for an average of 240 cm and tongue-flicked once. Habitat temperatures vary considerably during the day, with rock and air temperatures in sun exceeding body temperatures of lizards during much of the activity period. During most of the day, lizards thermoregulate by moving among shady, filtered sun, and sunny microhabitats maintaining body temperatures near 35 degrees C. Temperatures of lizards active during cloudy periods were significantly lower than temperatures of lizards during sunny periods, indicating that clouds decrease the ability of lizards to effectively thermoregulate. Most feeding occurs in the afternoon at edges of rock outcrops with ants, insect larvae, termites and beetles dominating the diet. Comparisons with a near-by savanna population revealed differences in body size (males only), activity period (longer on rocks), body temperatures (higher on rocks), number of prey categories consumed (lower on rocks), mean size of prey (larger on rocks), number of prey eaten (fewer on rocks) and microhabitat use (more restricted on rocks).

TI LEAF-CUTTING ANTS AND FOREST GROVES IN A TROPICAL PARKLAND SAVANNA OF

   SUCCESSION; WOODLAND SAVANNA
AB Some savanna areas in the Orinoco Llanos region in Venezuela are characterized by the abundance of small forest groves, resulting in a parkland landscape. We hypothesized that forest groves are the result of colonization of the open savanna by forest species, facilitated by the activity of leaf-cutting ants. In this paper we present results from a field study conducted on an ecotonal belt between a deciduous gallery forest and an open savanna in the western Llanos of Venezuela. In seven transects, trees, groves and leaf-cutting ant nests were counted, size parameters evaluated and distance from grove to forest measured. Soil chemical analysis and microclimatic measurements were performed in the forest, grassland and groves. Floristic composition of the woodland component of the savanna (scattered trees) was very dissimilar from that of the forest, but the composition of the groves was essentially a mixture of both woodland and forest species. Woodland trees were present in all groves, whereas forest trees were present only in larger groves. The size structures of populations of the two types of trees differed significantly according to the size of the grove; also, woodland tree population structure differed significantly between open savanna and groves. The Frequency of groves with Atta laevigata nests increased with the size of the grove, and groves with forest trees were positively associated with the presence of nests. A. laevigata nests improved the soil of groves, increasing N, Mg, Ca and organic carbon, bur other soil properties were not modified. Temperatures at ground level in the dry season were ameliorated in the groves compared with the grassland, and this effect increased with the size of the grove. We concluded that a dynamic process of grove formation is facilitated by the aggregation of a few woodland trees, followed by the successful invasion of forest trees and a leaf-cutting ant nest. The results did not show any clear sequence of arrival of the ants or the forest trees, but it seems clear that these two would act synergistically, improving conditions for each other.

DE CONSERVATION; GIRAFFA; NIGER; SAHEL; WEST AFRICA
AB The distribution of the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis peralta Thomas 1898) has greatly diminished in West Africa, and now the last remaining population, reduced to less than 100 individuals, is found in Niger. These giraffes of west Africa are seriously threatened by extensive deforestation and clearing of their habitat. They live peacefully with humans and cattle and participate in an essential way in the dynamics of vegetation. Their disappearance would represent another step towards the impoverishment of the inheritance of Africa, a process already too far advanced. To save them, a fundamental rethinking of the connection between the environment and development on the one hand, and on the responsibilities of rural communities for the management of their natural resources on the other, has to be undertaken.

AB The relationship between Camponotus sp, ants and the carnivorous pitcher plant, Nepenthes bicalcarata, from Borneo were investigated. The ants nest in the hollow tendrils of the plant, and feed on large prey items caught by the pitchers. These are hauled from the pitcher fluid by the ants and consumed. When large prey items are absent, the ants feed upon mosquito larvae which inhabit the pitcher fluid. The accumulation of excess prey in pitchers can lead to putrefaction of the contents, and disruption of the pitcher's digestive system. Experiments on the possible benefits of the ants' behaviour to the plant showed that the accumulation of excess prey and the putrefaction of the pitcher contents were significantly reduced in the presence of the ants. The accumulation of ammonia in pitchers was unaffected by the presence of the ants when small prey were added to pitchers, but was reduced significantly in the presence of ants when large prey were added. It is suggested that Camponotus sp. and N. bicalcarata have a mutualistic association, from which the ants obtain food and nesting sites and, in return, prevent damaging accumulation of excess prey in the pitchers.

AB We compared reproductive characteristics of the dendrobatid frog Colostethus trinitatis at the Tamana cave in the Central Range hills and at five forest stream sites in the Northern Range hills of Trinidad. There were significant differences between sites in adult female body size, intraovarian clutch size (in absolute terms and relative to body size) and the size of tadpoles carried by male frogs. Clutch sizes ranged from 6 to 13 in the Northern Range samples and from 12 to 26 at Tamana. Adult male body size was similar at all sites. Tadpoles carried by male C. trinitatis at Tamana were significantly smaller (mean length 14.2 mm) than those carried by males at the five Northern range sites (mean length 16.4-16.7 mm). The smallest clutches and largest tadpoles were found at Mount St Benedict, where there was evidence of size-selective predation on tadpoles by fish. Tamana, where clutches were large and tadpoles small, differed from the Northern Range sires in terms of the physical environment (cave vs forest) and the abundance of invertebrates. We discuss possible ultimate and proximate causes of the differences in clutch size and tadpole size, particularly size-selective predation and availability of food.

   WOODLICE; ZIMBABWE
AB Measurements of reproductive allocation, fertility and iteroparity were made on females of four species of woodlice (Isopoda: Oniscidae) From southern Africa. In three of the species between-population comparisons were made. The average body mass of reproductive females was smaller than in temperate woodlice and because of a positive scaling between body mass and fertility: brood sizes were rarely larger than 30 young and usually between 5 and 20. Reproductive allocation ranged from 16 to 27% of Female pre-birth live mass and differed significantly between species. Associations between reproductive allocation and body mass were all positive although only significant in two of the populations. A small number of females produced more than one brood during the study and iteroparity appears the most likely reproductive tactic in these species.
   In woodlice a restriction on body size results in lower fecundity as brood size is ultimately determined by the size of the marsupium. It is postulated that a tactic of repeated reproduction, with a relatively conservative allocation of resources to each reproductive event to enhance survival probabilities, would be favoured, particularly in an environment where juvenile mortality and the chance of complete brood failure is high.

AB The habit, shade-tolerance and dispersal agent of 19 bromeliad species were studied in a rainforest community in order to relate specific traits to the spatial occurrence of the species. Highest density was found in riparian forest (RF), followed by restinga scrub (RE), rocky shore (RS) and dense canopy forest (DF). Terrestrial bromeliads occurred in open sites (RE and RS), epiphytes were absent in RS and facultative species occupied ail four habitats. Bird-dispersed bromeliads occurred in the upper canopy, whereas those dispersed by mammals were low in the forest profile. Bromeliads which are dispersed by similar fauna fruit sequentially through the year. Differences in traits may allow the sharing of habitats and strata among species.

AB During the course of a population study of small mammals in a Brazilian coastal shrubland we calculated the movements between successive captures, the residence time, the indices of aggregation and the kinds of movements of the live most common species of small mammal. A capture-mark-recapture study was undertaken over two years, quarterly. Philander opossum, Akodon cursor and Proechimys iheringi presented low mobility, with a high proportion of restricted movements, long residence time and larger coefficients of aggregation. Didelphis aurita and Metachirus nudicaudatus presented higher mobility and exploratory movements, short residence rime and small coefficients of aggregation. The species with lower mobility had permanent populations within our sampling grid, while the species with higher mobility used areas outside the grid, presenting no local populations but occupying portions of regional metapopulations.

TI THE ROLE OF THE WHITE-EYED VIREO IN THE DISPERSAL OF BURSERA FRUIT ON
   THE YUCATAN PENINSULA
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE AVIAN ENERGETICS; BURSERA SIMARUBA; FRUGIVORY; MIGRATORY BIRDS;
   MUTUALISM; SEED DISPERSAL; VIREO GRISEUS
AB White-eyed vireos (Vireo griseus) winter in the forests and secondary growth of the Yucatan Peninsula where Bursera simaruba (Burseraceae) is an abundant tree. Twenty-five per cent of all white-eyed vireos observed foraging visited Bursera trees. In addition, presence and abundance of territorial white-eyed vireos in small forest patches were correlated with the size of the Bursera crop. Vireos were the most reliable dispersers of Bursera seeds. These birds visited 32 of 35 trees observed for at least three hours. They accounted for approximately half of all bird visits, and two-thirds of the seeds dispersed. Most of the other species rarely visited (<5% of visits) or failed to remove seeds from the tree.
   Peculiarities of phenology and fruit structure may contribute to the tendency of Bursera to be dispersed by relatively few species. The capsules of Bursera fruits do not open when the fruit ripens; birds apparently locate ripe fruit using visual cues, although these are few. In addition, only a small portion of the crop ripens daily over a 7- or 8-month period. The vireo-Bursera simaruba relationship, found regionally on the Yucatan Peninsula, may result from the prolonged fruit ripening period (October-March), the relatively depauperate frugivore community and the relatively high density of small Bursera trees in the hurricane-disturbed dry forests.
   Small trees at ail rimes, and ail trees from October to February, depend upon territorial vireos for continuous, highly efficient local dispersal of a small number of fruits. In March and April residual fruits ripen rapidly and synchronously, attracting a greater variety of visitors for broad spectrum dispersal during a period of food scarcity. Thus, Bursera has an unusual two-phase phenological pattern, perhaps alternately to take advantage of both specialized and opportunistic dispersers.

AB Seeds of Dryobalanops aromatica and D. lanceolata (Dipterocarpaceae) were sown in gaps and understorey on a ridge and a valley in a Bornean rainforest. Germination rates were 92-100% regardless of site and species. On the ridge, the proportion of seedlings that opened primary leaves was larger in D. aromatica (19-30%) than in D. lanceolata (7-19%) due to higher root predation on D. lanceolata. In the valley, on the other hand, the proportion was larger in D, lanceolata (71-74%) than in D, aromatica (56%). After primary leaf production, seedlings of both species had higher survivorship in the gaps than in the understorey. Interactions between predators, soil conditions and light environment and their effects on seedling establishment are discussed.

DE DRY SEASON; RAIN-FOREST; SOIL ATMOSPHERE; SOIL INFILTRATION RATE; SOIL
   OXYGEN; SOIL STRUCTURE; SOIL WATER CONTENT
AB The effects of irrigation and the rainy season on soil gases, water and physical properties were studied in a lowland moist forest in Panama. Two control plots experienced a normal four-month dry season and two experimental plots were irrigated during the dry season. The forest soils were well aerated. The average soil oxygen content at 20 cm never dropped below 15%. Irrigation in the dry season resulted in treatment effects on soil oxygen and water that persisted throughout the rainy season. The late rainy season soil oxygen content at 20 cm was 18.2% in the control plots and 16.8% in the irrigated plots. The late rainy season soil water content al 0-10 cm was 0.34 m(3) m(-3) in the control plots and 0.36-0.37 m(3) m(-3) in the irrigated plots. In the control plots, in the absence of any experimental manipulation, the soil physical properties changed within a single rainy season. Specifically, soil oxygen dropped and soil water increased during the eight-month rainy season.
   The observed alterations in soil physical properties probably resulted from changes in soil structure and the abundance of large pores. The rainy season or irrigation may decrease soil porosity by dispersing aggregates of soil particles, whereas soil desiccation during the dry season may enhance the formation of aggregates and large pores. As a result, the irrigated soils held more water and were less permeable to gas and water than soils experiencing a normal dry season. We conclude that the dry season may play an important role in maintaining soil structure.

TI LEAF AND CANOPY CO2 ASSIMILATION IN A WEST-AFRICAN HUMID SAVANNA DURING

DT Article
DE COTE DIVOIRE; GRASS; HYPARRHENIA DIPLANDRA; NITROGEN USE EFFICIENCY;
   PHOTOSYNTHESIS; SAVANNA
AB Leaf and grass canopy photosynthetic rates were measured in a west African humid savanna during several stages of the early growing season. The results obtained on the dominant grass species Hyparrhenia diplandra and data published previously show that C-4 savanna grasses exhibit a remarkably high leaf photosynthetic capacity despite their low nitrogen content. A variation of leaf photosynthetic capacity in relation to leaf rank on stems is observed which is interpreted by ageing and shading effects within the canopy. Seasonal variations of the canopy CO2 assimilation rate is explained in relation to variations of leaf area index and canopy nitrogen content. Despite low nitrogen content or low leaf area index, maximum canopy net photosynthesis was high (24 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) for LAI = 1.5). The high photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency exhibited by leaves of humid savanna grass species is a major attribute explaining high photosynthetic rates of the grass canopy in this environment. This result sustains the emerging opinion that tropical savannas could be highly productive despite the generally low nutrient status they experience.

AB The Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve protects a variety of primary montane forest communities on volcanic parent materials. We describe the structure and composition of the forest to provide background information for epiphyte and nutrient cycling studies and for comparison with other tropical montane forests. In a 4-ha study plot in leeward cloud forest, density of stems (2062 individuals ha(-1) for stems >2 cm dbh, 555 individuals ha(-1) for stems >10 cm dbh) and stem basal area (73.8 m(2) ha(-1) for stems >2 cm, 62.0 m(2) ha(-1) for stems >10 cm dbh) were high relative to other montane forests. Stems in a subset of the plot (c. 1/3 of the area) were identified and assigned to 47 families, 83 genera and 114 species, which is rich compared with other montane forests. Large stems had a higher spatial variability of structural and floristic characteristics than small stems.

AB Scientific and commercial collecting have documented high levels of abundance among several species of marine snakes. Estimates of first-year mortality in populations of marine snakes range from 40 to 90%. The primary cause of this mortality is unknown. Storms, currents, sun exposure, dehydration and fire are abiotic factors that may control populations of marine and amphibious snakes. Disease, malnutrition and predation are biotic factors known to affect populations. In the literature there are isolated reports of predation by marine mammals, birds of prey, fish and invertebrates. Sharks in Australian waters are known to be predators on sea snakes. Our studies show that in the estuaries, intertidal mangrove creeks and mud flats of southeast Asia decapod crustaceans are important snake predators. Microhabitat overlap, exoskeleton armour and a respiratory advantage in an underwater standoff argue for their potential as potent predators. Field observations, a survey of crab stomach contents and encounters between snakes and crabs under laboratory conditions support this hypothesis.

AB Windthrow was assessed following a convective storm in a stand of tropical savanna in Kakadu National Park, northern Australia. Over an area of 3 ha, 79 out of 810 trees (9.8%) were damaged; 27 of them were either uprooted or snapped off at the trunk. Logistic regression showed that both species and tree height were significant determinants of the probability of wind damage. Branch loss and either uprooting or trunk snapping was highest in the canopy subdominant Eucalyptus porrecta. Damage was lowest in the sub-dominant trees Erythrophieum chlorostachys, a species which is relatively resistant to termite damage, and Terminalia ferdinandiana, a deciduous species which is generally shorter than the main canopy dominants. Damage was intermediate in the two most common canopy dominants, Eucalyptus tetrodonta and E. miniata. Wind damage was greatest in trees taller than 9 m and relatively minor in trees below this height. Wind disturbs savanna trees in a manner opposite to that of fire, because wind damage is greatest in taller trees, whereas fire damage is greatest in smaller trees. This, coupled with significant within-patch variability in the extent of wind damage, may act to increase small-scale environmental heterogeneity in savannas.

In contrast, rainfall had little effect on the proximity of nesting habitat to water bodies in a region of isolated lakes (Nhumirim Ranch). There was a strong positive correlation between female body size and clutch size Snout-vent lengths of females on Campo Dora Ranch were significantly larger than those from Nhumirim Ranch which probably accounts for the larger mean clutch size than in the region of isolated lakes. Hatchling size was correlated with egg size, but there was no relationship between egg size and female size or egg size and clutch size.

DE BOLOMYS; BRAZIL; FIRE; GROWTH; REPRODUCTION; RODENT; SAVANNA
AB Reproduction by Bolomys lasiurus is strongly seasonal in the Amazonian savanna of Alter do Chao, Para, Brazil. No pregnant or lactating females were recorded during the early dry season (July-September). Relative growth rates showed a similar though less consistent pattern. These patterns do not appear to be due to a direct effect of rainfall as high reproduction and growth were recorded during the late dry season (October-November), even though rainfall and the availability of fruits of shrubs were low during that period. It is likely that reinitiation of reproduction during the dry season is due to an increase in the availability of invertebrates and/or wind-dispersed seeds. Fire at the end of the dry season appears to affect the diet of the rats, causing an increase in the ingestion of invertebrates during the following wet season. However, our data do not indicate that fire affects individual reproductive output or growth.

AB Life table studies were conducted on the flowers, pods and seeds of the tree Pithecellabium pallens to assess the extent of damage by the seed predators Slater limbatus and Merobruchus insolitus (Coleoptera: Bruchidae). Brachyacma palpigera (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) was also found to feed on the seeds of this tree. Seed predation and herbivore damage destroyed 41% of the seeds. Pods were taken to the laboratory and seed predators within were reared and identified. B. palpigera and M. insolitus were major causes of mortality, whereas damage by S. limbatus was slight. The growth ratio of pods to seeds did nor indicate a rapid development of seeds as an evasive strategy against bruchid attack. Experiments showed no successful attack by bruchids on seeds exposed on the ground after dispersal from the tree.

DE GILBERTIODENDRON DEWEVREI; JULBERNARDIA SERETII; MONODOMINANT FOREST;
   PREDATOR SATIATION; SEED PREDATION; SEEDLING PERSISTENCE
AB The central Ituri Forest of Zaire is characterized by monodominant stands of Gilbertiodendron dewevrei (mbau forest) within a matrix of mixed forest where Julbernardia seretii is subdominant. Both species produce supra-annual, synchronous (mast) seed crops. The relationship of mast seed production to monodominance for the two tree species was evaluated by investigating: (1) the relationship between seed density and seed survival, (2) the relative impact of mammal versus insect seed predators in high and low seed density areas, and (3) post-germination survival in the understorey. For the latter, tagged seedlings were monitored over 10 years and both species were censused in different understorey size classes. Percentage seed survival was significantly greater for Julbernardia (but not for Gilbertiodendron) in areas of high conspecific seed density. Generalist fruit- and seed-eating mammals were the principal predators on seeds of both species when removed to al eas without seed-fall. In mast areas high seed densities appeared to satiate mammalian seed predators but not the specialized beetle seed predators that were the major cause of seed destruction. Gilbertiodendron seedlings survived longer in the forest understorey than did seedlings of Julbernardia. Furthermore, Gilbertiodendron made up a greater proportion of the larger subcanopy size classes in monodominant forest than did Julbernar, dia in mixed forests. These results suggest that, irrespective of mortality to seeds, the ability to persist in the understorey may confer on Gilbertiodendron a greater probability of reaching and dominating the canopy.

SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE BATS; CHIROPTERA; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; ECHOLOCATION; WING MORPHOLOGY
AB The most diverse known communities of insectivorous bats in the Palaeotropics and Neotropics are similar in alpha diversity (number of species). However, they show distinct differences with respect to wing morphology and the echolocation behaviour of their component species. In the Palaeotropics, most bat families are clearly separated in wing morphospace. The morphological niche of Rhinolophbidae is vacant in the Neotropics, but primitive echolocators using sound primarily for scanning the environment rather than for prey capture are much more frequent there than in the Palaeotropics. In our opinion, a large portion of this difference can be traced to the different evolutionary histories of the respective communities. Bat families of different geographical origin are involved and their foraging styles obviously evolved differently in the Old and New World.

DE MONODOMINANCE; NEW CALEDONIA; NOTHOFAGUS; TROPICAL RAIN-FOREST;
   ULTRAMAFIC SOILS
AB Nothofagus species dominate small patches of rainforest on ultramafic soils in New Caledonia, forming an almost monospecific upper canopy on some sites. These stands are commonly bordered by rainforests of greater floristic and structural complexity, also on ultramafic soils. In two lowland stands, the population size structures of Nothofagus aequilateralis stems greater than 50 cm high had an approximately skewed bell-shaped distribution with a modal size class of 15-25 cm stem diameter, and with no evidence of old trees. This indicates that the establishment of Nothofagus has occurred over a limited time span, without sufficient recent regeneration to allow the future replacement of the existing canopy trees. The factors initiating the major period of regeneration are not certain, but large-scale disturbance is implicated and evidence of past wild-fire on both sites is consistent with this hypothesis. It is unlikely that significant regeneration of Nothofagus will occur as the stands mature and canopy gaps are created by the death of old trees, since saplings of other species already occur at high densities in the understorey and will probably pre-empt the resources made available by canopy gaps. Two Other study sites were situated above 900 m asl. At Dzumac, in an apparently older stand dominated by, codonandra, there is some evidence of recent regeneration, predominantly confined to a single large canopy gap. The population size structure of N. baumanniae on the fourth site, on the summit of Mt Mou, shows a closer approximation to a reverse-J curve. Seedlings, how ever, are relatively uncommon on this site, and the numerous saplings may be suppressed rather than young.
   Analyses of topsoil provided no consistent evidence to suggest that mineral content is controlling the distribution of Nothofagus across vegetation boundaries.
   The environmental factors promoting the formation of these monodominant canopies are uncertain, but appear to involve large-scale disturbance by windstorm or fire. The population size structures suggest that the canopies of the two lowland stands, al least, are likely to become more species-rich, with a progressive decline in the frequency of Nothofagus. Therefore, these lowland monodominant forests cannot be regarded as equilibrium communities, irrespective of whether more detailed studies reveal environmental differences across the community boundaries. The status of the two high altitude sites is less certain.

   The rate of loss of dry matter was fastest in Celtis zenkeri which was significantly different from the other species, while potassium was the most rapidly released element from ail species with more than 50% being released in the first two months of the experiment. Nitrogen and phosphorus showed initial increases in bagged leaf litter independent of dry weight losses and while nitrogen was later released phosphorus continued to increase reaching 2-3 times the initial concentration. Decomposition constant (k) of litter on the forest floor was found to be 2.23 whereas the mean decomposition constants of the different species were as follows: Celtis zenkeri 4.18, Cola lepidota 2.18, Desbordesia glaucescens 1.60 and Ceiba pentandra 2.16 For the two experiments.
   Termites were found to have a very great influence on the decay of the wood of Terminalia superba with decay due to micro-organisms being negligible.

AB Analysis of litterfall, nutrient return and floor mass dynamics was made in mature and recently harvested bamboo savanna sites in a dry tropical region in India. The total annual litterfall was 590 and 267 g m(-2) in mature and harvested sites, respectively. Of the total litterfall, 58-77% by weight was contributed by leaf litter. Although litterfall occurred throughout the year, as much as 72-83% of the leaf litterfall was recorded during winter (December-February). Seasonal distribution of total litterfall was: rainy 12-22% of annual, winter 64-65% and summer 13-22%. Nutrient concentrations in bamboo leaf litter were low compared with the other species growing in the same region. Annual nutrient return through litterfall amounted to: 28-49 kg N ha(-1), 1.3-2.9 kg P ha(-1), 33-85 kg Ca ha(-1), 1 2-32 kg K ha(-1) and 1.4-2.8 kg Na ha(-1). While maximum accumulations of fresh litter on the ground occurred in summer, the partly decayed and particulate litter categories peaked in the rainy season. Decaying litter categories showed 1.5-3 times greater nutrient concentrations than the concentrations in fresh leaf litter. Marked immobilization of N and P occurred in decomposing leaf and particulate litter. The mean annual nutrient content of the floor was (kg ha(-1)): N 29-40, P 1.0-1.9, Ca 13.8-23.9, K 14.6-15.3 and Na 0.85-0.99. The annual turnover in litter layer was: 63-81% for dry mass and 64-90% for different nutrients.

AB We mapped the occurrence of canopy gaps periodically between 1978 and 1990 in a 1.5 ha study plot within a 70-year-old (in 1978) Neotropical forest on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Republic of Panama. The total area of the forest under canopy gaps in the plot averaged 4.3% (3.1% to 5.7%, 95% CI). There was high year-to-year variability in the rate of new gap formation. On the basis of repeated observations for four yearly intervals, the annual rate of new gap formation ranged from 0.45% y(-1) to 6.5% y(-1) Most gaps were small. The mean size of individual gaps originally was 79 m(2) (range: 8-604 m(2)). However, large gaps (greater than or equal to 150 m(2)) occurred more frequently than expected for a secondary forest on BCI. Gaps closed rapidly the first year after formation but the rate of closure slowed thereafter. Despite the absence of any obvious environmental gradients, gaps were spatially clustered. Even in this relatively small plot, there seemed to be distinct gap-prone and gap-free areas.

AB In this study four species of the genus Shorea section Doona were investigated.  All occur together as canopy trees in the Sinaraja rainforest of south-west Sri Lanka.  Partitioning of the regeneration niche can be one explanation for the co-existence of ecologically similar canopy tree species within a forest.  Seedlings were planted in plots located in five zones that represent a range of forest groundstorey microenvironments found adjacent to and across canopy openings of three sites - valley, midslope, ridgetop.  Experiments were designed to monitor survival and growth of planted seedlings for two years.  At the end of two years percentage survival was calculated, height increment recorded and destructive samples taken to measure dry mass gain of root, stem and leaves.  Comparisons were made of establishment and growth performance of seedlings planted in the different plots and sites.  Results demonstrated clear differences in survival and growth among species.  These differences appeared related to availability of soil moisture and groundstorey radiation regimes.  Disturbance patterns that determine species co-existence are suggested.

   MOISTURE; TROPICAL FOREST; VEGETATION STRUCTURE; VPD
AB We investigated the influence of a four-year-old forest edge near Manaus, Brazil, on soil moisture and vertical profiles of air vapour pressure deficit (VPD) within the forest.  Soil moisture was measured (with a neutron probe) 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 150 and 200 m into the forest from the edge, in undisturbed control areas, and in the pasture.  Control soil moisture was better explained by rainfall in the previous 2 or 10 days than by longer-term totals.  Soil water potentials less-than-or-equal-to - 1.5 MPa occurred at some forest locations during the driest period.  The variation in soil moisture with distance from the forest edge was complex, with higher values just inside the edge and depleted zones at the edge and 40-80 m inside it.  At a given height, VPD (standardized relative to measurements in the open) was not related to distance from the edge, but VPD increased more with height near the edge than in control areas.  The complexity of the edge's influence and the contrast with earlier data from the same edge can be explained by the changing vegetation structure near the edge.  Regrowth 'seals' the edge with more leaves that transpire and deplete soil moisture, while protecting the understorey just inside the edge from desiccating conditions.  A mosaic of gaps of differing ages develops behind the edge, increasing the variation in microclimatic conditions near the ground and consequently in evapotranspiration and soil moisture.

AB Vertebrate attack accounted for 98.4% of all seed loss during the two months following dispersal.  This accounted for, across all habitat types, 94% of Bursera, 76% of Spondias, 37% of Swietenia and 25% of Erythrina seeds artificially dispersed.  Bursera, Spondias and Swietenia seeds in early successional habitat suffered significantly greater predation than in either older abandoned (30 y) or mature forest plots.  Erythrina showed generally low loss to predation in all plots.  Seeds attacked were more often removed from, rather than buried or eaten at, the dispersal site.  In young secondary habitats, however, seeds of Bursera and Spondias were more frequently eaten at the site.  Seeds dispersed individually rather than in larger aggregations (5, 10) were more likely to survive in mature forest and late secondary habitat.  This advantage was lost in Bursera and Swietenia when they were dispersed to younger successional habitats.
   At the early seedling stage, recruitment of Bursera and Swietenia was highest in the older secondary habitats.  Seedlings of Erythrina showed the lowest overall losses to any of the mortality factors identified during the first two months of establishment.  Seeds of forest tree species arriving in secondary habitat were more vulnerable to attack by non-flying vertebrates than in mature forest.  Survival of seedlings of these species was most closely related to the moisture-conserving status of the habitat.

AB An index of canopy closure was used to estimate closure above the crowns of all trees greater-than-or-equal-to 10 cm dbh in 11.11 ha of undisturbed lowland tropical forest at La Selva, Costa Rica.  To correct for the effects of tree size on canopy closure, we used the residual of the regression of the canopy closure index on tree size.  Analyses were carried out for the 104 species which had greater-than-or-equal-to 6 individuals; a total of 3224 trees were included.  Nine species were found to have their crowns in significantly more open conditions than expected by chance and five species were found to have their crowns in significantly more closed conditions than expected by chance (P < 0.05).  The remaining 90 species (86.5% of the assemblage) were distributed at random with respect to canopy closure, occupying the available light conditions indiscriminately.  Species occurring under higher light levels did not show a narrower range of tolerance than did other species.  Most species were found to occur over a substantial proportion of the canopy closure continuum present in the stand; overlap among the great majority of species in the assemblage is extensive.  The results support the view that tropical forests comprise assemblages of generalist tree species, and raise questions about the classic notions of gap-phase dynamics.

AB Bolomys lasiurus is the only species of rodent commonly found in the savanna of Alter do Chao, central Amazonia.  Peak densities during 42 months were less than have been reported from the cerrado biome of central Brazil.  However, the population at Alter do Chao appears to be more stable than those in other areas and we never recorded zero densities.  Many animals were captured over periods greater than 7 months, indicating that either mortality or dispersal was less than in previous studies.  Mean home-range size of females was inversely related to the proportion of females that were gravid or lactating.  Female home ranges were mutually exclusive and averaged 35% (SD = 8.2%) of male home ranges.  Male home ranges overlapped extensively.  Indices of home-range size varied seasonally and among years.

AB Spiders from 10 rainforest tree canopies in Borneo were sampled by knockdown insecticide fogging.  Spider density ranged from 2.0 to 10.1 m-2 on different trees, and species numbers ranged from 16 to 62; species diversity, as measured by William's alpha, ranged from 26 to 92.  Similarity of the spider assemblages on individual trees was low, whether measured by the number of shared species or the Morisita-Horn index of similarity.
   The contribution of five descriptor variables of tree taxonomy and structure to the similarity of the spider assemblages on different trees was assessed using stepwise multiple regression.  No variable made a significant contribution to the variation in similarity indices for the spider assemblages and it was concluded that either other factors were important in determining similarity or that the measurement of these variables was too imprecise.  In particular, there was no evidence that taxonomic similarity between tree species influenced the similarity of spider assemblages.
   Results were compared with similar data from tropical and sub-tropical rainforests in Sulawesi and Australia.  Species densities in Borneo and Sulawesi were similar but lower than in Australia.  Species richness and diversity were markedly higher in the Bornean rainforest than in Sulawesi or Australia.

AB Phenological patterns of herbaceous and woody plants well represented in the Sudano-Sahelian savannas of northern Cameroon were studied in relation to water availability in three contrasted soil types.  Mean annual precipitation in this region is 800 mm, entirely restricted to the period May-June to September-October, but redistribution of rainwater by varying soil substrates leads to considerable heterogeneity in available water resources for plants.  Results are discussed in terms of probable competition for water resources among co-occurring plants and the adaptations shown by observed patterns to prevailing environmental conditions.  Water stress is seen to be a limiting factor to plant growth but does not constitute the sole trigger for the phenological phases observed, nor is it the principal factor responsible for the preponderance of annual species in the herbaceous stratum.

AB We investigated the daily activity patterns of four species of small mammals in an area of cerrado habitat in central Brazil.  We checked live traps at 3-hour intervals during the night.  Bolomys lasiurus and Calomys tener (Rodentia, Muridae), two potential competitors, differed significantly in their daily activity patterns.  Bolomys lasiurus had peaks during the twilight, whereas C. tener had a more constant activity through the night, with a peak between 2200 and 0100 h. Thalpomys cerradensis (Rodentia, Muridae) was more active immediately after sunset and in the last three hours before sunrise.  Thylamys velutinus (Marsupialia, Marmosidae) was strictly nocturnal with greater activity early in the night.  Other factors, such as predation pressure or diet, may be important in determining the activity patterns observed in this study.

AB The mass of fine litterfall and nutrient circulation through litterfall were determined in four Metrosideros polymorpha/Cibotium spp.-dominated rainforests that differed in substrate age, parent material texture and annual precipitation on Kilauea and Mauna Loa volcanoes on the island of Hawaii.  Three of the sites had rates of litterfall of 5.2 Mg ha-1 y-1; the fourth, which was on the most fertile soil, produced 7.0 Mg ha-1 y-1 of litterfall with higher concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus.  Tree ferns of the genus Cibotium cycled relatively large amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium through litterfall; their contribution to nutrient circulation was disproportionate to their mass in the forest, or in litterfall.  The forest on the youngest substrate, which also had the lowest concentrations of nitrogen in litterfall, was fertilized with complete factorial combinations of nitrogen, phosphorus and a treatment consisting of all other plant nutrients.  Additions of nitrogen increased the quantity and nitrogen concentration in litterfall during the second year following the initiation of fertilization, while no other treatment had a significant effect.  Additions of nitrogen had no effect on litterfall mass or nutrient concentrations in the most nutrient-rich site.

The estimation of fresh fruit mass varied greatly with the census method used.  Moreover, the fruiting phenology recorded using the fruit-trap collection and raked-ground survey methods showed a delay of one to two months compared with the platform observation method.  Any of the three methods can be used for the approximation of annual fruiting phenology, but that of fruit-trap collection is suited to measure the annual fruit production, and that of platform observation offers the best estimation of the quantity of fruit in tree crowns at a given time.

AB Five forest plots of differing disturbance levels were sampled qualitatively for termites in the Mbalmayo Forest Reserve, southern Cameroon, using 100 m belt transects. Results showed a large reduction in species richness in two severely disturbed plots compared with a Near Primary plot, but little difference in two less disturbed regenerating plots; there is some evidence for a slight increase in species richness in the regenerating plots. Soil-feeders predominate in the primary and regenerating plots, but are greatly reduced in the severely disturbed plots. Wood-feeders appear to be more resilient to disturbance than soil-feeders, although their species richness is low in the most disturbed plots. The Termitinae are the dominant taxonomic group in the Near Primary plot, the Apicotermitinae in the less disturbed regenerating plots and the Macrotermitinae in the clear felled areas. There appears to be no secondary invasion of plots by savanna-associated species, and the small apparent increase in species richness in the less disturbed regenerating plots appears to be due to the influx of forest species usually associated with natural gaps.

The study site is located in Fazenda Agua Limpa in Brasilia, Federal District, Brazil. Trees greater than or equal to 31 cm gbh (10 cm dbh) were measured every three years from 1985 in 151 (10 m x 20 m) permanent plots in Gama forest. The mean annual diameter increment for trees greater than or equal to 10 cm dbh was 0.25 cm y(-1). Variability was high with coefficients of variation c. 100% or more. Light-demanding and large upper storey species tended to grow faster than shade-tolerant and lower storey species. Mean increments for the community increased with increasing diameter classes. The mean annual mortality rate for the community was 3.5% y(-1) while the recruitment was 2.7%. The community was dynamic with 86% of all species either suffering mortality or gaining recruits or both during the six years. The net difference between recruitment and mortality was zero for 55 species. The recruitment compensated for the mortality of most of the abundant species.

AB The chemistry of epiphytic lichens was determined in two Venezuelan cloud forests adjacent to the Caracas Valley at Altos de Pipe and El Avila National Park. This is the second component of a two-part study examining the chemistry of fogs and their effects on sensitive biota in these forests. The widespread lichen Parmotrema madagascariaceum was chosen as an indicator of trace metal input. Background lichen collections and transplant experiments were tarried out to evaluate spatial trends in atmospheric depositon of trace metals at different altitudes and exposures of the two montane locations. Elevated concentratons of metals including Pb and Zn were seen in lichen tissue and associated bark. Lead levels in lichens reached 190 mu g g(-1) dry wt. Lichens transplanted from relatively 'clean' to more polluted sites showed significant increases of metals, particularly Pb. Increases of up to 6.3 mu g Pb g(-1)mo(-1) after 6 and 10 months were recorded relative to background and in situ lichen material. In contrast, when lichens were reciprocally transplanted in nylon net bags from less to more exposed sites there was a significant decrease in Pb and Zn concentrations after 6 and 10 months. With long-term exposure to elevated concentrations of these trace metals epiphytic lichens, as well as other sensitive cloud forest biota, may be at risk of decline.

AB The age of most temperate tree species can be estimated accurately by counting the annual rings revealed by concentric changes in their wood anatomy. In the tropics and sub-tropics, this growth periodicity is seldom clearly and unambiguously defined. This research investigates whether a wood anatomical feature is present that delimits annual periods in one of the most widely distributed genera in the semi-arid and arid areas of Africa, Acacia.
   Most research on this topic has been based on sample trees from natural stands, often the largest and putatively oldest trees. In contrast, the trees sampled for this study were actively sought from material of known age, particularly those for which the history of management was known. Several African Acacia species were examined for growth rings. These were apparent in most species as narrow bands of marginal parenchyma filled with long crystal chains. The crystals were subsequently identified as calcium oxalate through the use of a scanning proton microprobe. The number of bands formed annually corresponded to the number of peaks in the annual rainfall distribution. Ring widths were highly correlated with total annual rainfall.

   MANGLE; SEED SIZE VARIATION; SEEDLING ESTABLISHMENT
AB We investigated the intraspecific variation in propagule mass within red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) and its effect on carbon assimilation and seedling growth. Propagule sizes of red mangrove varied considerably at all three study sites along the south-eastern coast of Florida, with propagule fresh mass from 3.9 to 20.7 g for the scrub form and from 5.3 to 35.8 g for the tail form. Highly significant correlations were observed between propagule length and fresh weight at all three study sites and for two growth forms. The scrub form had significantly smaller propagules than the tall form. A greenhouse study showed that CO2 assimilation rates were not correlated with propagule mass, but total leaf area per plant increased significantly with increasing initial propagule mass in all three family lines of both the scrub and tall forms. Consequently, total carbon fixation rate by each seedling increased significantly with increasing propagule fresh weight in all cases, and the biomass increment significantly increased with increasing mass. Relative growth rate, however, was not correlated with propagule mass. The differences in leaf areas and biomass accumulation among seedlings from different sizes of propagules seem to have resulted from the differences in maternal reserve of hypocotyls. The considerable intraspecific variation in propagule size observed for red mangrove may have a significant effect on seedling growth and competitive ability.

   NEIGHBORHOOD; PHENOLOGY; POPULATION; REPRODUCTION; TRACHYPOGON PLUMOSUS
AB In a garden experiment we monitored tillering and flowering for target plants of two grass species, surrounded by one to five neighbours and compared them with control plants growing alone. We analysed the results using a non-linear regression. The species differed markedly in their seasonal patterns of growth but these differences faded when growing with two or more neighbours. The presence of neighbours had a significant depressing effect on both tillering and flowering in both species. Effects and responses were strongly asymmetrical concerning species and mode of growth. Andropogon semiberbis is in disadvantage against Trachypogon Plumosus concerning vegetative growth. However, T. plumosus is strongly affected in its reproductive growth by competition not only from A. semiberbis but also from conspecific neighbours. We conclude that the complexity of interactions between effects and responses as well as vegetative and reproductive growth could have a net result of competitive equivalence or compensating competitive abilities of these two species.

SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY

DT Article
DE BANGLADESH; DOMATIA; LEAVES; MITES; MUTUALISM; PLANT; SOUTH ASIA
AB Mites use the leaf domatia of many woody plant species in Australasia and North America. Different types of leaf domatia, including pits, pockets and tuft domatia, are present among plant species in disturbed forests, plantations and gardens of Bangladesh in South Asia. These structures are frequently occupied by mites. Pooling across all species, domatia were often (66%) occupied by mites and used by them for shelter, egg-laying and development. On average, 70% of all mites on leaves were found in domatia, and over three-quarters of these were potentially beneficial (i.e. of predaceous or microbivorous taxa) to the plant. Further, when species were pooled across sites, leaves of domatia-bearing plants had significantly more predaceous mites than those of plants without domatia. These results are consistent with the patterns of mite-domatia association reported in Australasia, North America and North Asia and with predictions of mutualism between plants and mites.

AB This study describes changes in the numbers of plant species fruiting during six years in 1 ha of Amazonian savanna on the right bank of the Tapajos River, Brazil. The work was based on fleshy fruits from tree and shrub-layer species eaten by birds. The area was burned in the first two years, protected during the following two years and burned again in the last two years. The number of tree species fruiting did not differ significantly between years with and without fire. The number of shrub-layer species fruiting. was markedly reduced in years with fire, but the responses varied between species. Data on changes in shrub cover after two consecutive years of fire indicate that species also respond differently in terms of biomass lost due to fires. The two most abundant genera of shrubs, Miconia and Myrcia, had their cover reduced by up to 95% and 72% respectively. The area made available by the loss of shrubs was occupied mainly by the grass Paspalum carinatum. The fires and the decrease in the availability of fruits occurred during the season in which most species of birds breed. An interval of less than three years between fires is insufficient for shrub-layer species to recover.

DT Article
DE APOSEMATISM; LEPIDOPTERA; MICROHABITAT STRATIFICATION; MIMICRY; PANAMA
AB I investigated the extent to which adult butterflies with different wing colours display preferences for flying heights within a lowland tropical forest.  Observations on eight colour groups, some of which comprised putative aposematic models and mimics while others contained non-aposematic species, were made from the forest floor and from a scaffold tower that reached above the canopy.  Two groups (yellow pierids and papilionids and orange heliconiines) were most frequently observed in or above the canopy, and other groups were most frequently observed in or below the canopy.  The evidence suggests that significant differences exist between some groups, but stratification does not occur among all colour groups.  In particular, flight distributions of some mimicry rings overlap considerably.  The light environments of different forest layers are variable, and the role that butterfly wing colours play in signalling or avoiding predation is little understood.  However, the general lack of fine stratification of colour groups suggests that flight preferences do not occur because wing colours and patterns are especially cryptic against the background of particular forest layers.

AB Bioassays of nutrient limitation were carried out for Melastoma malabathricum growing on soil from primary lowland dipterocarp rainforest in Singapore, and for Dillenia suffruticosa on soil from adinandra belukar, a nutrient-poor secondary forest type dominated by Adinandra dumosa.  Three questions were addressed.  1.  What is the nutrient most limiting to growth in primary forest?  2.  What is the nature of nutrient limitation under conditions of adequate P supply?  3.  Is there a qualitative difference in the nature of nutrient limitation under primary forest and adinandra belukar?  Results showed that there was a strong limitation by P availability in both primary forest and adinandra belukar under the experimental conditions used.  Once plants had an adequate P supply, all other nutrients became limiting to growth in primary forest soil.  These findings are interpreted as support for the hypothesis that P availability would limit the productivity of moist tropical forests in general in the absence of mycorrhizas; tentative conclusions are drawn on the assumption that most woody tropical plants are mycorrhizal.  It is argued that limitation by major cations may be common on old, highly leached tropical rainforest soils.

AB Mistnets were set at ground level and 11-30 m above ground in lowland rainforest at Kuala Lompat in peninsular Malaysia, and Sepilok in Sabah, to compare the abundance of fruit bats in the subcanopy and at ground level.  Capture rates in the subcanopy were up to 100 times greater than at ground level, averaging 3-7 bats per net-night.  Species diversity was higher in the subcanopy than forest understorey.  Two species that were frequently captured in the subcanopy, Megaerops wetmorei and Dyacopterus spadiceus, were previously thought to be rare.  The abundance of Old World fruit bats in the subcanopy indicates that their roles in pollination and seed dispersal of Malaysian forest trees may be greater than previously recognized.  Further research on foraging ranges, food selection and roosting habits is required to determine the overall importance of fruit bats in forest regeneration through seed dispersal, and the adequacy of existing reserves for their conservation.

AB The soil of remnant primary rainforest on granite in Singapore is very acidic (pH mostly 3.5-4.2 at 0-10 cm) and has unusually low total concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus, but the mean concentrations of N and P in the living leaves and freshly fallen leaves of the more shade-tolerant species are within the ranges found for other lowland forests on infertile oxisols and ultisols.  The concentration of Ca in freshly fallen leaves is very low.  The soil under secondary forest (belukar) on sandstone dominated by Adinandra dumosa (Theaceae) was degraded during use for agriculture.  It has the same pH range but even lower values of total N and P.  The mean concentrations of N, P, K, Ca and Mg in the living leaves are slightly higher than in leaves of the more shade-tolerant trees of primary forest, but lower than in the leaves of the species which require canopy gaps for establishment or early onward growth.  The few species sampled in both primary forest and belukar show no consistent trend in foliar concentrations.  The degraded soil has selected species with inherently lower foliar concentrations.

AB Timing of germination and flowering under different environmental conditions was investigated in four coexisting serotinous desert plants:  Blepharis grossa (annual herb), Geigeria alata, Geigeria ornativa (facultative perennial herbs) and Petalidium setosum (perennial shrub).  Germination patterns were similar under varying environmental conditions in the study species, except for P. setosum, which germinated later when conditions were less favourable.  B. grossa always germinated early, G. alata and G. ornativa later, which could be explained by differences in their seed dispersal mode.  Thus no obvious niche separation in timing of germination was indicated in the study species.  Flowering periods varied between seasons rather than between species and no niche separation in flowering times existed between the study plants.  This might indicate that either interspecific competition plays a minor role in a community of desert serotinous plant or that niche separation exists in other components of the plants' niche, such as seed dispersal, seedling establishment and/or microhabitat selection.

Although complete defoliation decreased annual growth rate, both in absolute and relative values, it also stimulated leaf production.  Mortality was observed only in individuals in the smallest size class, but was not statistically related to percentage defoliation.  Recovery of completely defoliated individuals was rapid and after one year over 70% of their initial number of leaves was present.  It is probable that insect folivory is not a direct cause of mortality of juveniles of this species.

DE POLLINATION; VOCHYSIA SPP; BRAZIL
AB Six Vochysia species occurring in cerrado vegetation or gallery forest in central Brazil were studied for their pollination biology and breeding system.  The species showed rather different flowering phenologies, but presented a relatively uniform floral morphology and attracted a mostly similar spectrum of visitors.  Principal pollinators were large Anthophoridae bees, but three species were also visited by sphingid moths while hummingbirds were opportunistic visitors to all species.  Some observations indicated that the slight differences in flower size or habitat between species may have influenced the relative importance of bees versus hummingbirds or sphingids as effective pollinators.  All six species were found to be self-incompatible with self-pollen tube rejection, usually accompanied by callose deposition, occurring in the mid-style.

   CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS
AB The relationships between soil properties, topography and tree species distribution were analysed in a tropical riverine forest at the margins of the Rio Grande, in Bom Sucesso, state of Minas Gerais, south-eastern Brazil.  The forest was sampled by three 0.18 ha plots, with each plot made up of eight contiguous 15 m x 15 m quadrats, four of which were placed at the river margin and the remaining four in the forest interior.  A canonical correspondence analysis indicated that the species' density distribution was significantly correlated with some soil chemical characteristics and topographical features.  The soils of the three sample plots showed statistically significant differences for the levels of Ca, Mg, K and pH, with the fertility (expressed by the cation exchange capacity) increasing from Plot I to Plot III.  These variations were mainly explained by the first canonical axis while the second was strongly correlated with topographical variables, separating the quadrats into two groups:  those of the higher and steeper sites from those of the lower sites.  The only soil property that was significantly different in lower and upper sites was the concentration of phosphorus.  No significant difference in tree species distribution was found between river margin and interior quadrats, certainly because this forest sector lies on the outer side of a curve of the river where erosion is currently building high and steep river banks and forcing the forest to retreat.  A tentative ecological classification of the 30 most abundant species according to their habitat preference in terms of soil fertility and topographical sites, and to their growth strategy in the forest dynamics, is presented.  It is suggested that these factors play an important role in promoting the coexistence of tree species in this type of forest.

AB Spiders were sampled by knockdown insecticide fogging from the canopies of tropical rainforest sites in Dumoga-Bone National Park, Sulawesi, at altitudes of 210 m, 300 m, 400 m and 1150 m.  The density of spiders in the canopies increased with altitude from 0.97 m-2 at 210 m to 14.6 at 1150 m-2.  Species numbers increased five-fold between 210 m and 1150 m but species diversity (alpha of the log series) was greatest at 210 m and least at 1150 m, partially due to dominance of the fauna by few species at the highest altitude.  Similarity between the spiders' communities (as measured by the Morisita-Horn index) was greatest between canopies at 300 m and 400 m and least at 400 m and 1150 m.
   Theridiidae were abundant in forests at all altitudes, Pholcidae and Salticidae in the lowland forests between 210 m and 400 m and Clubionidae, Linyphiidae and Oonopidae in the montane forest at 1150 m.  Theridiidae was the most species-rich family at all altitudes (22-30% of all species).  Other species-rich families included Araneidae (7-19%) and Salticidae (8-17%) in lowland forests and Clubionidae (12%), Oonopidae (10%) and Salticidae (12%) in the montane forest.
   Published information on density, proportion and diversity of spiders in canopies of both tropical and temperature trees is reviewed and the results discussed in relation to those from the present study.

   RAIN-FOREST; RARITY; SPECIES RICHNESS
AB A 100-ha quadrat of primary rainforest in French Guiana was censused over two consecutive years by the mapping method, and a 24-ha core area was intensively mistnetted at the same time.  More extensive surveys were conducted in successively larger areas including up to a large part of the forested interior of the country.  From a total of 441 resident species found in the rainforest zone, 248 were regularly recorded within the 100-ha plot, 157 of which had mean densities of more than 1 pair km-2.  The total estimated density of birds was at least 829 pairs km-2.  Only two dominant species exceeded 20 pairs km-2, while 52% of all the species were represented by less than 2 pairs km-2.  The distribution of body masses and niche characteristics among the bird community is given as well as the sample bias of the mistnet captures.
   Rare species were a key component of this primary rainforest community.  Several patterns of rarity were described and no marked and constant relationships were found between rarity and body size, habitat, diet, foraging behaviour or social system.  Among a wide set of environmental constraints, the population of each species may be limited by a different combination of factors.  Habitat heterogeneity, low, irregular and seasonal food availability, interspecific competition or heavy predation pressure were prominent and likely causes of the low density of most species which in turn facilitated the high species richness.

   MINERALIZATION; TROPICAL SEASONALLY FLOODED FOREST; VENEZUELA
AB Seasonally flooded forests represent a transition between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.  The Mapire river, a tributary of the Orinoco river, floods its surrounding forests during the wet season (May-December).  The soils are very acid and the total nitrogen concentration (0.1%) is only half that found in nearby soils flooded by Orinoco waters.  Ammonium-nitrogen predominates in the soil during the flooded period while nitrate-nitrogen concentrations are higher in the dry period.  Wide fluctuations in the inorganic nitrogen fractions did not considerably affect the annual course of soil nitrogen.
   The predominance of mineralization versus nitrification (56 and 5 mug N(inorg) g-1 soil month-1 respectively) and possibly the synchronization of nitrogen availability with plant demand could be considered as nitrogen conserving mechanisms.
   In synchrony with the hydrologic cycle, the seasonally flooded forest studied shows a nitrogen-cycle where inputs and accumulation are maximized when the system is under minimum stress (dry season).  During flooding, the system enters a period of dormancy making minimal use of nutrient and energy to avoid or tolerate anaerobiosis.

   VEGETATION STRUCTURE; INDIA (WESTERN GHATS); WET EVERGREEN FOREST
AB The wet evergreen forest of Nelliampathy in the Western Ghats of Kerala in India is a mixed forest with a high species diversity and basal cover.  In this relatively undisturbed ecosystem, canopy gaps are largely formed through single tree fall, but gaps through branch fall, crown fall, standing dead trees or multiple tree fall also occur.  Canopy gap formation is more (over 82% of the total gaps created) during the monsoon season.  The mean number of gaps formed in this forest is 1.13 ha-1 y-1 and the turnover rate is 83 years.  The majority of the gaps created (over 70%) are of smaller size (greater-than-or-equal-to 100 m2).  In this forest, while some top canopy tree species (those capable of exceeding 25 m in height at maturity) such as Palaquium ellipticum and Mesua nagassarium are well represented in seedling, sapling and mature tree stages, others like Aglaia exstipulata and Mastixia arborea are observed only as saplings and/or mature trees with no seedling populations.  The possible reasons for these two types of regeneration behaviour by top canopy tree species in the context of canopy gap size and seasonality in gap formation are discussed.

AB A study of seedling demography of three shade-tolerant canopy tree species (Quararibea asterolepis, Trichilia tuberculata, and Tetragastris panamensis) was initiated to integrate with long-term studies of tree fruit production and of tree population dynamics on Barro Colorado Island, Panama.  Over a five-year period, all seedlings (height <50 cm) and small saplings (height greater-than-or-equal-to 50 cm to dbh 1 cm) were measured and monitored in permanent tree-centred transects (N = 10-11 trees per species).  Survival rates increased with plant size class and were similar among species.  Maximum height growth rates increased with increasing plant size, but average growth rates did not; this disparity suggests the importance of release from understorey suppression for long-term recruitment success.  Among the three species, Quararibea had the lowest standing seedling densities and almost no sapling recruitment, whereas Tetragastris had the highest densities of both seedlings and saplings; Trichilia seedling and sapling densities were intermediate.  In all three species, a few trees produced very high seedling and sapling densities in comparison with the sample average.  All three species exhibited a year of exceptionally high new seedling recruitment during the study period; these good years were not coincident among the species but instead reflected the species' phenological differences.  Since seedling survival becomes relatively constant and high after the first few years of life (c. 80% y-1), such large new cohorts persist as a year-class effect in the seedling population and thus maintain seedling numbers over time.  The interspecific differences in seedling and sapling dynamics were consistent with overall 10-year trends of a declining Quararibea population, a stable Trichilia population, and an increasing Tetragastris population.

AB Patterns of bird species diversity within three vegetation types were investigated by the line transect method on Mundanthurai Plateau, South India.  Minimum numbers of species and individuals were seen in the study area during July and August.  Such seasonal variation was more pronounced in riverine and dry deciduous forest than in the secondary vegetation which was avoided by most of the winter migrants.  There was a greater species overlap between riverine and dry deciduous forest than between riverine and secondary vegetation.
   No relationship could be established between bird species diversity and tree species/foliage height diversity.  The secondary vegetation had fewer specialized forest species and more generalists.  Larger birds (>200 g) were rare but smaller ones (<50 g) were more common.  The paper emphasizes that the conservation status of avifauna in managed forests in India needs to be assessed and monitored.

AB The spatial distribution of canopy gaps was analysed on three sites (total 71 ha) in the tropical moist forest of Tai National Park, Ivory Coast. Pattern analysis revealed a clustered distribution of gaps for two of the three sites. Catena dependent gap formation processes might explain local differences in the occurrence and distribution of gaps. Gap densities, sizes and percentage forest area in gap phase are higher on the upper and middle slope than on the crest or lower slope. As a consequence, regeneration of gap dependent tree species might be directed to the catena positions with the highest disturbance regime. The spatial distribution of gap dependent species can be clumped, not only due to the regeneration within gaps, but also due to the clustered nature of gap distribution on its own.

AB The populations of two dominant isopod species in a Pinus merkusii forest on the southern slope of mount Ungaran in central Java, Indonesia, were periodically sampled during one year using Tullgren extractions from soil cores. The aim of the research was to collect more information about the life-cycles of tropical isopods by analysing size-class distributions of two sympatric isopod species, belonging to the genus Burmoniscus. Biomass of the populations was estimated from length-weight conversions established for each species in the laboratory. The efficiency of the Tullgren extraction method was estimated by comparison to hand sorting; no difference was found between these methods.
   The abundance of the two species differed significantly with time. Burmoniscus Sp. A was more abundant during the wet season, whereas the population fluctuations of Burmoniscus Sp. B were more spread over the year. Reproduction of both species took place in the wet season. Burmoniscus Sp. A had one generation per year, while for Burmoniscus Sp. B the situation was nuclear due to extensive overlap of size classes. Comparisons were made with isopod abundance in other tropical and temperate forests. The mean density of the two species found in this study was 258 m-2 for Burmoniscus Sp. A and 272 m-2 for Burmoniscus Sp. B, while biomass was 80.4 mg m-2 and 37.6 mg m-2, respectively. The data suggest that densities of isopods in tropical pine forests may be considerably higher than in comparable temperate ecosystems.

AB Patterns of fruit production were monitored over a 1-year period, from June 1990-May 1991, by counting the numbers of freshly fallen ripe and unripe fruits on five 5-km line transects located within 35 km of one another, in lowland tropical rainforest in the Lope Reserve, central Gabon.  A total of 195 species of fruit were found, representing at least 45 taxonomic families.  The majority of fruits came from trees.  Fruits were assigned to one of six categories which reflected their dispersal syndrome:  succulent, arillate, dehiscent, fleshy pods, wind-dispersed, others.  About three-quarters of all species had fruits characteristic of those dispersed by animals.  There was a marked seasonal pattern to fruit production, with both the diversity and number of ripe fruits available peaking in January, and lowest immediately before and during the major dry season.  The only climatic variable that showed a significant statistical correlation with fruit production was insolation.  Candidates for the role of keystone fruit species were identified from species which fruited during the major dry season, and patterns of fruit production compared with other areas.

In the small plot 511 trees and lianes of 116 species were found, and 175 trees of 48 species were present in the large plot.  The plots were then subject to commercial mechanised logging and the enumerations were repeated once logging had been completed.  The extraction rate was two trees ha-1 and in the large plot a total of 31 (17.7%) trees representing 20.6% of the total original basal area died.  Incidental damage in the small plot resuled in the loss of 10.8% of trees and lianes present, and 12.9% of the original basal area.  Canopy cover was reduced by 10%.  Damage levels were low compared with figures from most other tropical regions.  The relevance of these figures to forest management in Gabon are discussed.

AB The role of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) as seed dispersers in the Kibale Forest Reserve of western Uganda was assessed by analysing 1849 dung samples from two chimpanzee communities and by conducting germination trials on dispersed and non-dispersed seeds.  Of the chimpanzee dung samples, 98.5% contained seeds, and fig seeds were the most common.  The number of large seeds (>2 mm) per dung sample was often high, even for species with a relatively large seed.  For example, Mimusops bagshawei has a 15-mm diameter seed and had an average of 26.5 seeds per sample.  In addition, many seed species were found in the dung repeatedly over several months.  Germination trials demonstrated that the species of seed commonly collected from dung were viable.  Comparisons of both the rate and success of germination of chimpanzee-dispersed seeds with seeds collected directly from the parent trees, showed that gut passage increased the speed and probability of germination.  The number of large seeds dispersed by the chimpanzee population was estimated at 369 large seeds km-1 day-1.  We suggest that in Kibale, chimpanzees may play a more significant role in primary seed dispersal than implied by their low numbers and biomass.

TI THE RESPONSE TO SALINITY OF A POPULATION OF DACTYLOCTENIUM-AEGYPTIUM
   FROM A SALINE HABITAT IN SOUTHERN NIGERIA
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE DACTYLOCTENIUM-AEGYPTIUM; NIGERIA; SALINITY
AB The effects of salinity upon the growth, photosynthesis, ion and water contents of a population of Dactyloctenium aegyptium originating from a saline site in Nigeria were investigated. Growth was unaffected by a salinity of 10% artificial sea water, but was reduced by one third in 20% and by two thirds in 30% artificial sea water respectively. Initial adjustment to salinity was due both to increases in the concentrations of sodium and potassium per unit dry weight and to reduced hydration, the latter being the more important at higher salinities. The increase in ion concentration in the cell sap balanced the salinity of the medium at 10% artificial sea water, but was excessive at higher concentrations of sea water. Net photosynthesis was unaffected by 10% artificial sea water but declined at higher salinities. The potassium content of the plants did not fall below 200-250 mM, and the sodium to potassium ratio did not exceed three, even at the highest salinities. Variation in the concentration of nutrients (potassium, nitrate and sulphate) in the medium in the presence of 23% artificial sea water had significant effects upon growth, but these were small in relation to the inhibitory effect of the salinity.
   The reduction in growth could not be attributed to lack of osmotic adjustment or to nutrient deficiency, and was probably due to ion toxicity within the leaves. The tolerance to reduced hydration, combined with the ability to germinate in saline conditions previously observed, could enable D. aegyptium to establish in a saline soil. The population did not exhibit any halophytic characteristics but did survive with a low growth rate at salinities up to 50% artificial sea water. It is concluded that the species was able to colonize the saline site because of its inherent adaptability, rather than the possession of an ecotype adapted to saline conditions.

DE RECRUITMENT; SEXUAL COMPETITION; ONISCIDAE; PORCELLIONIDES-PRUINOSUS;
   PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY
AB The population size structure and adult sex ratio were recorded for four indigenous and one introduced species of terrestrial isopod from southern Africa. Interspecific variation was considerable with either discrete or continuous distributions indicative of the production of separate cohorts or continuous recruitment. Intraspecific variation was also considerable particularly in species such as Aphiloscia vilis which can be found in diverse habitats. Sex ratios were consistently female biased, a result consistent with observations made on temperate species. These observations, and a consideration of sexual dimorphism based on body mass, suggest that phenotypic plasticity may be an important tactic in the life histories of tropical woodlice and that in some populations the potential exists for strong sexual competition and complex mating systems.

LA English
DT Article
DE AMAZONIA; BRAZIL; ECOSYSTEM FRAGMENTATION; HABITAT ISLANDS; ISOPTERA;
   RAIN-FOREST; TERMITE ECOLOGY
AB Intuitively, termites would seem to be a very suitable group to illustrate effects of ecosystem fragmentation. Being detritivores, they do not control directly the rate at which their resources are available, nor do they restrict the ability of the resources to regenerate. Consequently, termites do not mask the ecosystem depletion caused by fragmentation. With this in mind, we compared the communities of termites in undisturbed Amazonian forest with those of two isolated fragments nearby, aiming to show that the differences observed may have resulted from habitat fragmentation. Dissimilarities between communities in the undisturbed forest suggest natural patchiness in their distribution, which could lead to misinterpretation of the effects of fragmentation. Continuous forest had higher species richness and fewer rare species than the fragments. Guild structure in the forest was biased towards soil-feeding termites, which are subterranean and soft bodied, and therefore more sensitive to variation in microclimate. In the fragments, litter-feeders and species intermediate between soil-feeding and wood-feeding types were numerically more important. Habitats in the forest were more equally used than in the fragments, suggesting habitat unsuitability increased with fragmentation. It is suggested that the community composition of the fragments is a result of the intrinsic patchiness of the original forest and deterministic and stochastic extinctions caused by fragmentation. The need for manipulative experiments to test such ideas is discussed.

AB Growth in diameter and the relationship between age and size are analysed for 22 tree species in Amazonian Ecuador using growth simulation by a stochastic technique that projects the diameter-age relationships of a species. Maximum diameter growth rates varied from 1.2 mm y-1 (Grias neuberthii) to 20.0 mm y-1 (Cecropia sciadophylla). Minimum growth rates ranged from almost zero in Neea divaricata to 2.4 mm y-1 in Mollia lepidota. Median growth rates ranged between c. 0.5 mm y-1 (Grias neuberthii, Neea divaricata) and 11.6 mm y-1 (Cecropia sciadophylla). The maximum simulated life-span spent between a DBH of 10 cm and the largest DBH of a species varied from 54 y (Cecropia sciadophylla) to 529 y (Neea divaricata). Fast growing species and species that potentially can grow old showed a convex survivorship curve, whereas slower growing species and species that do not grow very old showed sigmoid, linear and convex survivorship curves. The species were grouped according to their DBH-height relationship and according to their maximum age, maximum growth rate, and maximum DBH. The groups probably reflect different light requirements. A negative correlation was found between maximum age and mortality rate. Growth rates vary within species, thus the largest tree is not necessarily the oldest.

AB The spatial distribution of displaying Malaysian peacock pheasants was documented at a site in Peninsular Malaysia. Calling males were clustered and, therefore, were not evenly distributed throughout the available habitat. The location of these clusters differed between calling periods. An objective method of assessing micro-habitat structure at the forest-floor level was devised to investigate habitat use by displaying males. Habitat structure was measured at 197 points throughout the study site, both in areas used by the pheasant and in those areas not used by the pheasant. A DECORANA ordination revealed that two gradients explained much of the variation in micro-habitat structure. Male calling clusters were located in areas that were away from the river and more stable (e.g. fewer treefalls). Within these clusters, display scrapes were sited in areas that were more stable and were more influenced by the rivers than elsewhere within the area used by the calling males. It is suggested that the environmental gradients described by the ordination are more likely to determine the position of the calling cluster than individual habitat structure variables. Within calling clusters, however, it seems probable that the presence or absence of ground-level vegetation directly influences the siting of display scrapes.

AB The fate of mature Acacia tortilis pods on the tree and ground and A. nilotica pods on the ground were investigated at a site in South Africa. Pods on Acacia trees were browsed only by giraffe whereas pods on the ground were browsed by kudu, impala, steenbok and duiker. In the absence of giraffe most A. tortilis pods fell from the tree to the ground. When giraffe were present they consumed most A. tortilis pods at tree level. Bruchids infested 21.6-54.0% of seeds within pods on the tree. Once fallen, in the absence of browsing ungulates, A. tortilis and A. nilotica pod and seed disappearance could be attributed to burial by termites and ants, seed consumption by rodents and to decomposition; when browsing ungulates were present they consumed most pods on the ground. Between 20.0-47.6% of A. tortilis and 31.0-58.0% of A. nilotica seeds on the ground were infested by bruchids. Ungulate browsing had no effect on bruchid infestation of seeds. This study exemplifies the importance of browsing ungulates as consumers of Acacia pods. Although survival of A. tortilis and A. nilotica seeds was greatest in the absence of browsing ungulates the survival of seeds following pod consumption by ungulates is unknown.

The study focused on several diverse and numerically important litter invertebrate taxa (e.g., ants, spiders, and beetles) that were effectively sampled using a combination of litter sifting and test tube pitfall traps. The mean altitudinal range of species was around 500 m (standard deviation 370 m) and approximately 50% of the species characteristic of a given elevation dropped out after a 300 m change in elevation in either direction. There was no evidence for distinct altitudinal zonation in leaf litter assemblages. Both species richness and number of individuals of most taxa showed a pronounced decline in the vicinity of the upward transition to cloud forests. The data also suggest a broad mid-elevation peak in sample species richness for the litter invertebrate fauna. The implications of the results for biodiversity conservation are discussed.

DE AMAZON; BIOMASS; COLOMBIA; DBH; LOWLAND RAIN-FOREST; REGRESSION MODELS
AB In a mature lowland 'terra firme' forest near Araracuara in Colombia, a study was conducted to determine the above-ground biomass by means of regression analysis. Dry weight, DBH (i.e. stem diameter at 1.3 m above ground level, or just above buttresses if these surpassed 1.3 m in height), total height and specific wood density were measured on 54 harvested trees, chosen in a 'selected random' manner. Nine different regression models were evaluated for statistical correctness, accuracy of the estimates and for practical use. The logarithmically transformed models with DBH2, and DBH2 x height as independent variables appeared to be the only models meeting the above criteria, the latter being the most accurate.
   The exclusion of big trees (DBH >45 cm) from the regression did not result in significant changes of the regression coefficients.

AB Germination success of Chlorocardium rodiei is low in large gaps. High light levels, however are beneficial for the survival of seedlings. (Partial) removal of cotyledons has a large negative impact on survival especially under low light conditions. Seedlings from large gaps are larger but not taller than those from the understorey, due to differential internode growth. Although growth of seedlings is improved by higher light levels caused for example by logging, great care should be taken with logging intensity, which may increase seed mortality.

AB Dysoxylum gaudichaudianum is an important canopy tree on the Krakatau Islands, and its ecology is of significance to an understanding of successional dynamics. It is abundant on Panjang and Sertung, but only locally common on Rakata. A study was undertaken of three aspects of its seed ecology in July/August 1992. The chief dispersers of D. gaudichaudianum are suggested here to be birds, with two species of pigeon and a bulbul prominent as fruit feeders over a short observation period. Bird activity dislodges large numbers of fruits and seeds which fall to the ground where they form a resource available to other animals. It was observed that seeds of D. gaudichaudianum suffer varying levels of attrition on the forest floor, with 40% of the total sample lost over a 12-day period, compared with 23% which had germinated. When mature, opening fruits develop a fishy aroma, which is attractive to insects. They hasten the decay process and release the seeds. The soft, rotting tissues of fallen fruits support a small, short-lived successional insect community. After about five days on the forest floor only the seeds and the outer fruit coat remain. Despite the abundance of fruit of this species during the dry season and its obvious attraction to frugivorous birds, D. gaudichaudianum has still colonized only a small fraction of the near-coastal lowlands of Rakata.

AB Effects of tree species heterogeneity on leaf fall were studied in a primary (4 ha) and in a selectively logged forest plot (2.5 ha) in the Ulu Segama Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysia, from April 1988 to December 1989. Leaf fall was collected at 30 sampling points in each plot, and identified to species,
   Dipterocarpaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Lauraceae, Fagaceae and Meliaceae are important tree families in both plots with regard to their contribution to total basal area, tree density and annual leaf fall. The total number of tree species was higher in the primary forest plot (267) than in the logged forest plot (218), although the number of climber species was higher in the logged forest (44) than in the primary forest plot (33). The overlap in species composition between the two forest plots was relatively small (49%) compared with that in family composition (88%).
   In the primary forest plot, the Dipterocarpaceae contributed 29% of the total basal area and 34% of the annual leaf fall. In the logged forest plot these contributions were much lower, 11% and 15%. The contribution to annual leaf fall made by climbers and pioneer trees was higher in the logged forest plot (34%) than in the primary forest plot (8%).
   In the primary forest plot, leaf fall was dominated by large emergent and main canopy trees, mainly dipterocarps, and occurred as regular large peaks. In the logged forest leaf fall was dominated by climbers and many, relatively small trees of pioneer species, such as Macaranga hypoleuca, and was more evenly distributed in time.

AB The diet of capuchin monkeys, Cebus apella, in a 250 ha semideciduous forest in south-east Brazil was studied for 44 consecutive months. Based on 367 feeding bouts the diet of capuchins was 53.9% fruit pulp, 16.0% seeds, 11.1% flowers, 6.3% leaves and new shoots, 1.5% roots and 13.9% corn from plantations surrounding the forest. Seventy-one plant species were consumed by capuchins. Food availability was markedly seasonal. During the dry season the fleshy fruit availability decreased, and at that time the capuchins became seed predators and flower-eaters. Several fruits eaten by capuchins in the dry season were not consumed by other frugivorous vertebrates, such as howler monkeys, parrots or squirrels, allowing capuchins to avoid competition with other arboreal frugivores. In semideciduous forests where fleshy fruits are less abundant than in the wet forests capuchins are important seed predators.

DE MASTOMYS; RODENTIA; MULTIMAMMATE RATS; SEASONAL REPRODUCTION;
   REPRODUCTIVE TRIGGER; TANZANIA
AB Reproduction of the African murid genus Mastomys, multimammate rats, is seasonal, starting after the rains and extending well into the dry season. During a two-year study in Tanzania, we tested three hypotheses to investigate the proximal causes of this seasonality. Food availability was no limiting factor since food supply could not induce continuous breeding. Temperature was always high and thus not a restrictive climatic factor. Diet was probably always sufficiently varied and protein-rich to allow reproduction. This contradicts earlier hypotheses that consider Mastomys as an opportunistic breeder in which reproduction is seasonally limited by poor conditions; environmental predictors were believed not to be involved since the animals live in an unpredictably unstable environment. However, although the occurrence of rain may be unpredictable, it is highly predictable that heavy rainfall will be followed by good conditions. Laboratory experiments show that sprouting grass has a stimulatory effect on reproduction, suggesting that breeding is triggered by new vegetation.

AB In humid forests tree buttresses and tree trunks are used as diurnal resting sites by phlebotomine sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae). When several species are present on the same buttress, the sandfly species are spatially segregated resulting in a pattern of vertical stratification on the buttress within 100 cm of ground level. A change in the distribution of one species induces a change in the distribution of an adjacent species. This is demonstrated under both natural and experimental conditions. Observations of sandflies at dawn and dusk have revealed that the buttress is used as a swarming site; this behaviour provides our favoured explanation for the patterns of vertical stratification on tree buttresses.

AB The effect of fluctuations in temperature and moisture supply on hard seeds of nine tropical coastal sand dune legumes, including herbs (Schrankia quadrivalvis, Macroptilium atropurpureum and Canavalia rosea), and shrubs (Acacia farnesiana, A. macracantha, Mimosa chaetocarpa, Indigofera suffruticosa, Crotalaria incana and Chamaecrista chamaecristoides), has been studied under laboratory and field conditions. Using a fluctuating temperature gradient bar seeds buried in sand were exposed to various amplitudes of diurnal temperature fluctuation over an extended period of time and seed germinability was examined at intervals. Germination percentage increased considerably in most species as a consequence of treatment with marked effects occurring at temperature fluctuations greater than 20-degrees-C and becoming detectable after 45 days. In several species the effect of applying wetting and drying cycles was to lower the amplitude of temperature fluctuation necessary to soften the seeds. Species can be grouped into physiological groups on the basis of differences in seed response to temperature fluctuations. It is suggested that these differences may help to explain the mechanisms distinguishing the different colonization patterns observed in tropical sand dune systems.

AB This paper examines the floristic changes that occur following human disturbance in mid-montane forest in the Wau area in Papua New Guinea. The study was restricted to a 1600-2400 m altitudinal range on Mt Kaindi, with disturbed forest, and Mt Missim, with undisturbed forest. Special attention was given to the status of Nothofagus pullei which is locally dominant on Mt Kaindi.
   A major change in floristic composition was observed between 1800 and 2000 m. The abundance and species composition of ferns and mosses above 2000 m characterizes the floristic differences. Nothofagus pullei was found to be a pioneer species with a long life-span, one which does not regenerate under its own cover. There were no other important floristic differences between Nothofagus-dominated forest and mixed mid-montane forest. Nothofagus pullei locally dominates the canopy and thereby suppresses the growth of other trees.

AB Most of the land surface of Metville Island, Australia's second largest island, is covered in Eucalyptus savanna. One exception is an area at Yapilika where a large tract of savanna is dominated by Acacia shrubs. An ordination analysis of 122 quadrats revealed that the boundary of Eucalyptus dominance did not correspond to a major change in floristic composition. Detailed transect studies at one site on the boundary showed that Eucalyptus trees were abruptly replaced by a band of Grevillea trees which gradually gave way to Acacia shrub dominance. There was a gradual change in the floristic composition of the savanna across the boundary. The distributional limit of Eucalyptus was found to be independent of any hydrological discontinuity. There was a slight decrease (<2.5 m) in altitude from Eucalyptus to Acacia savanna. The Acacia savanna soils were sandier and their surface soil had significantly lower concentrations of Ca and Mg and significantly greater concentration of Al compared with the Eucalyptus savanna soils. Eucalyptus seedlings planted in the three savanna communities were not found to be under drought stress (pre-dawn leaf xylem potentials of >-0.9 MPa) during the dry season. Over a 12 month period Eucalyptus tetrodonta and E. miniata seedling growth was not significantly different on the Acacia or Eucalyptus savanna, although this result may be due to the counteracting effects of greater soil fertility and tree competition in the Eucalyptus savanna and lower soil fertility in the treeless, and hence competition-free, Acacia savanna. This hypothesis is supported by the significantly greater growth of Eucalyptus seedlings on fertilized Acacia savanna soils. The limited production, dispersal and establishment of Eucalyptus seeds and the greater frequency of fires in the Acacia savanna probably explains the abrupt limit to Eucalyptus dominance along the edaphic gradient.

AB Numbers of lianas greater-than-or-equal-to 2 cm gbh were recorded on trees greater-than-or-equal-to 30 cm gbh in two 4 ha plots of dipterocarp forest. Associations between lianas and trees of the 12 commonest families and 16 commonest species were analysed. Liana density was 882 ha-1. Fifty-seven per cent of trees supported lianas and the mean number lianas per tree was 2.1. Lianas were highly aggregated on individual trees in most families; numbers of lianas per tree followed the negative binomial distribution for the Dipterocarpaceae but not Euphorbiaceae. Dipterocarpaceae and Euphorbiaceae differed in susceptibility, with 41 and 64% of their trees respectively supporting lianas. The proportions of trees with lianas (i.e. % trees laden) were correlated between plots at the species, but not the family, level. They were not related to tree girth; differences in proportions between families and species were maintained for trees in the 30-40 cm gbh class. At the species level, proportions of trees with lianas and the mean number of lianas per tree were significantly inversely correlated with mean branch-free bole height of trees in the 30-40 cm gbh class. Increased branch-free bole height and associated branch shedding may therefore decrease the susceptibility of trees to lianas and explain the lower susceptibility in the Dipterocarpaceae than the Euphorbiaceae.

AB The present study showed that the density of germinable seeds in the soil of a humid tropical forest ecosystem at Nelliampathy, in the Western Ghats of Kerala in India, fluctuates sharply at different times of the year. There were more germinable seeds in the soil during the monsoon season. Regeneration was activated after canopy gap formation and thus a decline in the soil seed density in 1-year-old gaps was recorded. However, soil seed density increased with gap age. Differences were found between primary, late secondary and early secondary categories of species with respect to their soil seed bank. There were more seeds of primary species in the soil of natural gaps than in selection felled ones, while the seeds of early secondary shrubs and herbs were more in the soil of selection felled gaps than in natural gaps. The soil seed banks of the primary forest species, being transient, are not an important conservation tool for these species.

AB Hong Kong is on the northern edge of the tropics and near the boundary of the Paleotropical and Holarctic floral kingdoms. The phenological states of 105 plant species in secondary shrubland were recorded weekly for three years. Community patterns of reproductive phenology are highly seasonal and vary little between years. There is a flowering maximum in May and a fruiting maximum in December/January. The winter fruiting peak coincides with diet switching by resident omnivorous birds and the arrival of partially frugivorous migrants from the Eastern Palearctic. However, wind-dispersed species also have a fruiting maximum at the same time, suggesting that fruiting in winter has other advantages.

AB In 14 forest plots (36 m2) all terrestrial plant species were recorded before slashing and burning of the vegetation. During subsequent cultivation with rainfed rice all resprouting plants were registered in permanent plots (72 m2). The fields studied (one per forest) covered all combinations of forest type and soil usually cultivated on local farms. Forest plots (total 409 specics) and field plots (358 species) had 226 species in common. Most resprouting plants were woody. Though nine forests in the sample were secondary, 70% of resprouting plants belonged to primary forest species and with three exceptions, these species did not regenerate by seed.
   Experiments in one field inlcuded: different intensities of initial burning, weeding (none, once, twice) and length of the rice cultivation period (1, 2, 3 y). Resprouting plants were monitored in permanent plots   (108 m2 ) during 3 y of cultivation and 2 y of fallow. More plants resprouted after a mild initial burning (5.8 plants    m-2)  than after a burn of normal intensity (1.4 plants m-2). Weeding and prolonged cultivation strongly reduced species diversity but plant densities were less affected because some climbers and trees were apparently stimulated and expanded.
   Fields abandoned after one rice harvest had, within six months, a closed forest canopy of pioneer trees emerging from the pre-existing seed bank and from the growth of resprouting trees. Prolonged cultivation (3 y) destroyed the pre-existing seed bank but affected sprouting plants less, these being the only component in the vegetation able to shade out weeds and forbs such as Chromolaena odorata.

AB We report long-term observations on leaf herbivory in the mangroves Rhizophora mangle and Avicennia germinans, on the Placencia Peninsula of Belize. We labelled and traced leaves and recorded the amount of damage appearing over a period of 3 1 0 days. Herbivores had damaged 1-4% of total mean leaf area within the first 10 days, but damage rates levelled off thereafter, to a final total of 4-10% damage. Herbivores did not concentrate on leaves of younger age classes. Rhizophora mangle growing in the high tidal zone (HHW) exhibited the highest initial and total attack rates at all but the final sampling dates. We also documented the dynamics of injury expansion and necrosis following artificial injury to seedling and tree leaves. Artificial holes in leaves were associated with higher subsequent rates of herbivory that varied among leaf age classes, and particular damage types were more prevalent in previously injured leaves. Artificial holes expanded significantly more in young leaves of both species. Holes in young leaves of both species expanded by up to 45.1% in area over 50 days, consistent with a similar study in Australia. Substantial necrotic areas developed around the injury site; a secondary effect of damage not often considered in herbivory studies. We discuss the implications of hole expansion and necrosis in estimating error in herbivory measurements. Temporally dynamic studies of herbivory are especially needed in tropical systems that show non-deciduous phenologies and long-lived leaves.

AB The species richness of pimpline ichneumonids was examined using catches from a network of Malaise traps operated throughout Costa Rica. More species were caught at some sites than at reasonably well-collected sites in other countries. When corrected for area, the species richness of 'Pimplinae' and Pimplini in Costa Rica as a whole is greater than that for virtually any other region recorded to date. The local richness of both groups appears to be a function of their regional richness. Many of the species found in Costa Rica apparently have large geographic ranges.

AB We sampled riparian frogs along 18 streams at eight localities in Borneo. At four of these sites we sampled during more than one year. Altogether 49 species were included in our study and total sample size was 13,249. We measured overlap in species occurrences and arrays of abundances within and among localities. Variation over the time span of our study was minor within communities. Overlaps between streams at a locality were generally higher than overlaps of pairs of streams from different localities. Environmental variation, particularly in stream width and gradient, had a clear effect on both intra-and inter-locality overlaps. Although rainfall varied between localities and within localities over time, that variation did not seem to affect overlaps among or within communities. Environmental factors did not account for all differences in overlaps between communities. Instead, regional processes, perhaps the timing of barriers or speciation events, appear to have been responsible for geographic restrictions of several species, leading to variation in overlap values.

AB The Neotropical tree, Pourouma aspera (Cecropiaceae), supports large lobed leaves on an erect stem which seldom branches below a height of 5 m. The prominent leaf scars are visible on trunks of mature trees and the distance between scars is highly correlated with the height growth rate when the leaves were produced. Relationships between height growth rate, internode length and light environment were determined from marked P. aspera saplings in a tropical wet lowland forest and used to infer the past growth histories of larger saplings and trees. Inferred growth rates were quite variable, both within and between individuals. Estimated passage times to grow from 0.7 to 2.2 m tall ranged from 0.6-23 y, with a mean of 4.4 y (N = 61). The study illustrates the importance of examining the distribution of growth rate over the length of the stem in addition to the more usual distribution of numbers of individuals per growth rate class. Species such as Pourouma, which respond strongly to light, complete much of their total juvenile growth during intervals of high light, even though most saplings are growing slowly in shade at any given time.

AB Light environment, leaf physiological characteristics, and growth were compared for forest-grown saplings of three species of tropical trees with known life histories. Light environment was assessed both by hemispherical canopy photography and a quantitative visual index of crown illumination. Leaf gas exchange characteristics were measured by infrared gas analysis. The species tested included Lecythis ampla, a species tolerant of understorey conditions, Pithecellobium elegans, a species found in relatively bright sites, and Simarouba amara, a fast-growing, light-demanding species.
   Annual height and diameter growth did not significantly differ between the three species, but highest average rates were found for Simarouba. Likewise, saplings of the three specics were found in similar low light environments although Simarouba saplings were found in slightly brighter sites and Lecythis saplings were found in the lowest light environments. Despite similar light regimes, the species differed markedly in leaf area and gas exchange. Leaf areas of Lecythis saplings were five and ten-fold greater than Simarouba and Pithecellobium saplings, respectively. Light-saturated leaf photosynthesis and leaf dark respiration rates of Lecythis were about half those of Simarouba; rates of Pithecellobium were intermediate. Lecythis had the highest leaf photosynthesis at understorey diffuse light levels. Measures of annual growth were positively correlated with estimates of both direct and diffuse light with the strongest correlations between sapling performance and diffuse light.

AB This paper introduces studies of nutrient cycling in disturbed and undisturbed rain forest plots in the upper catchment of Birthday Creek, near Paluma, North Queensland. The catchment is underlain by granite and has soils of comparatively low fertility. Differences between unlogged plots and plots disturbed 25 years previously by selective logging are still apparent. Disturbed plots have soils with higher bulk densities and pH, lower CEC, kjeldahl nitrogen and available phosphorus concentrations, and changed species composition. The data suggest that recovery from selective logging is dependent on soil fertility and intensity of disturbance.

AB Floristic and structural comparisons and a numerical classification were performed to identify the priority areas for conservation of genetic resources in central Brazil. The main type of woody vegetation, cerrado sensu stricto (savanna woodland with 10-60% tree cover), was sampled under a uniform methodology in six selected sites (total sample of 6 ha) scattered in a physiographic unit called the Pratinha Plateau located between 15-20-degrees-S and 46-49-degrees-W. A total of 6971 trees belonging to 139 species and 42 families was measured. Each site had a combination of 50-80 species and approximately 30 families but only 22 species from 14 families were common to all sites. Similarity decreased with distance, indicating the existence of geographical gradients as the physical characteristics were relatively uniform and the soils were dystrophic at all sites. The most dissimilar sites, in the localities of Patrocinio-MG and Paracatu-MG were recommended for the establishment of conservation units. The already existent conservation units are all clumped in the Federal District and are not enough to protect the genetic heritage of the plateau. Floristics and phytosociological surveys based on land system zoning were recommended as useful tools in planning conservation areas at a regional level to preserve the maximum biodiversity.

   SPATIAL ANALYSIS; TERMITE
AB Descriptions of the fine scale distribution of organisms have frequently been used to investigate various ecological phenomena. Unfortunately, the most widely used spatial analysis techniques are based on single index statistics, which convey only minimal information about the biological processes underlying the studied distributions. Such statistics cannot detect changes in pattern over different scales, and cannot identify some types of distribution. Additionally, both the use of such statistics on the distribution of individuals which have a non-negligible size, and the frequent failure to use an edge correction for points close to the boundaries of a sampled area, have led to the over-reporting of 'spaced out' ('regular') distributions. Using two spatial distributions recently analysed with a single index statistic (termite mounds, and earthmounds created by termites), I illustrate the benefits gained from using the spatial functions K(t), G(y) and F(x) to analyse both 'point events' and events which have a non-negligible size. These functions are considerably more informative about the nature of a spatial pattern and offer wide scope for the fitting of spatial models to biological distributions.

AB Rates of litterfall over a period of 3 y at one undisturbed site and two sites disturbed by selective harvesting are reported for a tropical rain forest area in North Queensland, Australia. Litterfall over a period of 18 months is also reported for a further undisturbed site in the same area. No significant differences were found in annual litterfall between the sites, with annual litterfall rates ranging from 5.0 to 6.0 t ha-1 y-1. These rates are considerably lower than those reported for other rain forest areas in Australia, and are within the lower ranges recorded for other tropical rain forests. Litterfall was found to be strongly seasonal at all sites with the maximum falls occurring from the end of the dry season to the end of the wet season. The between year variability of the sites was quite low, with the ratio of maximum to minimum production ranging from 1.05 to 1.20. The average percentages of leaves, wood and reproductive material in litterfall were similar at each site. Leaves were the dominant component of litterfall with the average proportion of the total litterfall ranging from 72% to 76% over the study period at each of the four sites. At certain times, however, the fall of wood and reproductive material was quite significant, comprising as much as 71% and 34% of litterfall respectively. A strong negative correlation was found between the fall of leaves and wood at all sites.

The proportion of woody and herbaceous material in the diet of the different species was determined by measuring the C-13 natural abundance in the fungus comb. The diet varied with season and biotope, especially tree density. The results confirm the flexibility of the food habits of the fungus-growing termites as a consequence of their exosymbiosis with the fungus Termitomyces sp.

AB Air and soil temperatures were measured during dry season heading fires in three different physiognomic forms of native vegetation common in Central Brazil: cerrado sensu stricto (dense scrub of shrubs and trees), campo cerrado (open scrub), and campo sujo (open grassland with scattered shrubs). The vegetation was protected from fire for 15 y in some areas, had been burned once every two years, and once each year in other areas. The temperatures were measured with type-k thermocouples and recorded at intervals of 22.5 secs. Air temperature measurements were taken at 1, 60 and 160 cm. Maximum air temperatures ranged from 85-degrees-C to 840-degrees-C, and the duration above 60-degrees-C varied from 20 to 270 seconds. In the soil, negligible temperature increases were recorded below 5 cm depth, whereas at 2 cm maximum soil temperatures varied from 29 to 38-degrees-C. Possible influences of fuel load and moisture on the recorded data and on the behaviour of fire in the cerrado ecosystems are discussed.

AB A high-diversity primate community consisting of 13 species was examined at an entirely undisturbed and remote terra firme forest near the headwaters of the Urucu River, Amazonas, Brazil. Twelve of these species used a 900-ha study plot, located 4 km or more inland from the river, and comprised a total group density of 16 groups km-2, an overall density of 146 individuals km-2, a crude community biomass of 381 kg km-2, and a metabolic biomass of 278 kg0.75 km-2. These species were occasionally found together within small (greater-than-or-equal-to 1 km2) areas of forest, so long as they included the full complement of available forest types. More frequently, however, only half the species co-occurred in a single habitat type at any one time, reflecting a relatively consistent pattern of subcommunity spatial organization. Habitat generalist species making extensive, year-round use of the predominant habitat type (high forest), were common, whereas habitat specialists were uncommon to very rare, and confined to minor habitats. Those species coexisting throughout the year in high forest were found to segregate vertically from one another. These and other modal patterns of community structure were disrupted seasonally by long-distance, inland movements by two 'igapo' forest species living in large groups - squirrel monkeys and white-face capuchins - to high forest areas, which apparently resulted from a food bottleneck in their habitat. Another species found in large groups - woolly monkeys - also exercised seasonally vagrant movements within the high forest matrix, which coincided with periods of greatest scarcity of mature fleshy fruits.

DE BRAZIL; LITTERFALL; LITTER LAYERS; MINERALIZATION; MASS TRANSFER
AB Data on litterfall, litter layers accumulated on top of the mineral soil and layer mineralization collected for three years in a tropical rain forest at Pernambuco, Brazil, were implemented on a simulation model. Litterfall was collected biweekly using 11 collectors 1 x 1 m. Every three months, 20 litter mat samples, 0.5 x 0.5 m, were collected, divided into the L, F and H layers and the CO2 evolution from each litter layer was determined in the laboratory. Litterfall, in the three years, averaged 7.8, 8.3 and 8.2 Mg ha-1 y-1, most of it leaves. Litter mat masses varied widely from place to place (15-90 Mg ha-1) and the overall averages were 5.6, 7.6 and 26.1 Mg ha-1 for the L, F and H layers, with CO2 evolution averages of 2.27, 0.507 and 0.123 mgC g litter C-1 day-1. According to the model, the L layer had a high turnover rate, losing 4.7 Mg ha-1 y-1 through mineralization and 3.4 Mg ha-1 y-1 transferred to the F layer. Values for the F and H layers were 1.4 and 1.2 mineralized and 2.0 and 0.8 Mg ha-1 y-1 transferred. Thus, it would take 2.1, 6.7 and 39 years for newly fallen leaves to be mostly fragments, to be transformed to humus and to be incorporated to the soil organic matter, respectively. Variations of litterfall throughout the three years would have little effect on the system which was not very sensitive to litterfall changes, except for the top layer.

AB Soil seed banks from four Mexican lower montane forests were studied. These forests are in the transition zone between neartic and Neotropical floristic regions. Soil seed bank characteristics were biased toward the dominant - temperate or tropical - phytogeographical affinity. The northern site (El Cielo Biosphere Reserve, Tamaulipas) had the lowest seed density, 720 seeds m-2. The eastern (Rancho La Mesa, Veracruz), western (Sierra de Manantlan Biosphere Reserve, Jalisco) and southern (El Triunfo Biosphere Reserve, Chiapas) sites all had much higher seed densities (2291, 2901, and 2341 seeds m-2, respectively). Germinated tropical species seeds were more abundant than temperate species seeds at all four sites, and were higher for southern and intermediate sites when compared with the northern site. On the basis of family, El Cielo appears to be different. The tropical family Melastomataceae was absent from this northern site, whereas it represented >30% of total germinated seeds at the other three sites. Trees were the most abundant life form at the southern site but were particularly poorly represented in the eastern and northern sites. Herbs were very abundant in the eastern, western and northern sites but were poorly represented in the seed bank of the southern site. The four seed banks differ between themselves and resemble seed banks of neither temperate deciduous nor tropical forests. In some ways they are unique, at least with respect to floristic composition, seed density, and life form representation.

AB This study focused on relationships between a tropical forest grasshopper and a major group of its host plants. Microtylopteryx hebardi (Acrididae:Ommatolampinae) at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica, feeds on understorey palms as well as other understorey plants. We assessed leaf damage levels in populations of three geonomoid palm species (Geonoma cuneata, Geonoma congesta, Asterogyne martiana), investigated feeding response of M. hebardi to the three palms, and examined leaf characteristics presumed to be important to herbivores. In understorey and gap-edge habitats, total leaf damage did not differ significantly between palm species. In the centre of small light gaps, where M. hebardi was most abundant, total leaf damage and total herbivory on G. cuneata was equal to that on the other species, but herbivory attributable to grasshoppers was significantly greater. Female M. hebardi showed strong preference for G. cuneata over the other palm species in laboratory feeding trials. Experiments to elucidate the proximate basis for this feeding preference showed that grasshoppers preferentially bit filter paper discs containing cuticular wax extract of G. cuneata. In consumption and digestibility experiments, grasshoppers consumed more fresh weight of G. cuneata and gained more weight per unit time spent feeding on this species. Leaves of G. cuneata had the highest percentage water content, highest fresh and dry mass per unit leaf area, and the lowest percentage crude lignin among the three palms studied. These factors may partially explain the preference of M. hebardi for G. cuneata, which was reflected in higher herbivory rates incurred by G. cuneata in sites where M. hebardi was locally abundant.

AB Present theories of tropical rain forest regeneration dynamics suggest that different tree species specialize on the microclimates of different sizes of canopy gap. A detailed analysis of the microclimates of closed forest and 10 canopy gaps of different sizes was carried out in lowland dipterocarp rain forest, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. It reveals that gaps exhibit considerable spatial and temporal variation in microclimate. As a consequence the relationship between microclimate and gap sizes is not simple. Gaps of the same size do not necessarily have the same microclimate and may favour the growth of different seedling species. Chance location and timing of gap creation play an important role in regeneration dynamics.

The large, yellowish-cream, brush-like flowers are pollinated mainly by glossophagine bats (Glossophaga soricina and Anoura geoffroyi). Three non-glossophagine bats (Phyllostomus discolor, Vampyrops lineatus and Carollia perspicillata) and two short probosisced hawk moths (Erinyis ello and Pseudosphinx tetrio) may also act as occasional pollinators. Caryocar brasiliense is self-compatible although it sets significantly more fruits when crossed than when selfed. The natural fruit set (fruit/flower ratio) and seed set (seed/ovule ratio) are 3.1% and 1.0% respectively. Most of the fruits and seeds are formed through the action of the flower visitors, despite the fact that about 20% of the non-visited flowers receive self pollen on at least one stigma.

AB The ecology of the Sri Lankan elephant in the Wasgomuwa Strict Nature Reserve and its environs is reported for the first time. Seasonal changes in the availability of grazing sites influenced changes in the home range of elephants. Availability of such sites in the wet season was limited by agricultural activities. Paddylands, after the harvest of the rice crop in the late wet season, became important dry season grazing sites. In the Reserve and areas outside its southern boundary on the left bank of the Mahaweli River, (a) female herds were seen more often than solitaries (b) female herds were larger and had a higher than expected number of juveniles in the dry than in the wet season (c) about 45% of the individuals were juveniles and (d) 7.4% of adult and sub-adult females had calves. Conflict between elephants and farmers will be most intense along the southern and eastern boundaries of the Wasgomuwa National Park, established in 1984 by the addition of new areas predominantly to the northern part of the Wasgomuwa Strict Nature Reserve.

AB Orchid diversity, distribution and host specificity were examined in a tropical water-shed in the Luquillo Experimental Forest of Puerto Rico. Eleven orchid species occur in the area. The low diversity is attributed to island isolation and large-scale hurricane disturbances. Pleurothallis ruscifolia and Maxillaria coccinea were by far the most abundant species in the area and occurred on the largest number of host species and host zones. None of the orchids were host specific or host zone specialists although preferences for hosts and vertical host zones were encountered.
   Only 8.2% of the 426 trees and shrubs and 24.4% of the 45 species surveyed were orchid phorophytes (= hosts). Examination of host distribution by diameter at breast height (DBH) showed that 80.5% were greater than 16 cm DBH, Orchid species in the area tend to occur on rough bark hosts, but their preferences are not statistically significant. Guarea guidonia (Meliaceae) and Dacryodes excelsa (Burseraceae) are the two most important orchid hosts in our study site comprising 62.9% of all host trees. Careful management of these two tree species is suggested, since these species may be crucial to the maintenance of orchid abundance and diversity in the area.

AB Different C4 photosynthesis pathways may influence plant response to shade and/or moisture stress. In the savanna of south-eastern Botswana, seedlings of PCK C4 type grass species were frequently observed to emerge in shaded habitats. The species Digitaria eriantha subsp. pentzii, which shows the NADP-ME pathway, was also found to be associated with the tree canopy. Species emerging in habitats exposed to full sun often showed the NAD-ME C4 pathway. Seedlings of Aristida congesta, Eragrostis rigidior and Tragus berteronianus which normally emerge in full light, showed higher relative growth rates and/or unit leaf rates compared with seedlings of Panicum maximum and Urochloa panicoides which are associated with shaded habitats. Seedlings of the latter species, however, survived low light conditions. Relative growth rate of the seedlings appeared to be negatively related to caryopsis weight. Light response analysis of leaves of Digitaria eriantha subsp. pentzii, grown under low light intensities, showed similar trends in light saturation to those reported for the PCK type in Panicum maximum. Mesophyll rather than stomatal limitations appeared to induce light saturation at higher light intensities in leaves grown under shade conditions.

DE BORNEO; FOREST CANOPY GAPS; FOREST LIGHT CLIMATE; HEMISPHERICAL

AB Study of forest dynamics commonly requires measurement of canopy gap size. Hemispherical photographs can be analysed to provide various measures whereby gaps can be ranked in order of size. For ten artificial gaps in a Bornean tropical rain forest these measures were better correlated with gap microclimate than gap area measured physically on the ground. All these measures are however relative. For detailed (e.g. ecophysiological) studies the greater detail provided by absolute measures of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) are required. Long term PAR values can be computed from hemiphots so long as measurements in the open nearby are available. Correction for cloudy weather is essential. Computed and measured PAR are compared for the test gaps. Both have inherent limits which means that below c. 15% canopy openness, differences in PAR between gaps cannot be assessed accurately.

AB Dung beetles attracted to howler monkey (Alouatta palliata) and coati (Nasua narica) dung were studied for an annual cycle in the tropical rain forest of Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. Pitfall traps set for 24 h month-1 captured 1567 dung beetles of 21 species. The species Canthidium martinezi, Deltochilum pseudoparile and Canthon femoralis accounted for 62% of all individuals captured. While species overlap was high (> 80%) between diurnal and nocturnal samples and between howler monkey and coati dung baits, coati dung attracted species such as C. martinezi, D. pseudoparile and Onthophagus rhinolophus while species such as C. femoralis and Copris laeviceps were numerically dominant at howler monkey dung. Thirteen non-ball rolling dung beetle species and eight ball-rolling species accounted for 43% and for 57% of all beetles captured respectively. Dung beetles were present and active in all months of the year, but occurred in higher numbers between the months of March and October, when temperatures were higher. Relative abundance of howler monkey and coati dung in the rain forest of Los Tuxtlas was estimated at 11.2g (fresh weight) ha-1 day-1 and at 13.0 g ha-1 day-1 respectively, a seemingly low amount for the large number of scarabs attracted to the dung.

AB Eight species of Myzolecanium Beccari (Hemiptera: Homoptera: Coccoidea: Coccidae) are reported from ant nests in stem cavities of living lowland rain forest trees in Papua New Guinea. The coccids are confined to this microhabitat but are associated with a taxonomically broad range of ants and host trees. Attendant ants belonged to six species in three genera and two subfamilies: Anonychomyrma Donisthorpe (Dolichoderinae), Crematogaster Lund (Myrmicinae) and Podomyrma F. Smith (Myrmicinae). Host plants belonged to at least five families and included both apparently specialized (with domatia) and unspecialized species. Saplings containing the nests of Anonychomyrma scrutator (F. Smith), Anonchomyrma sp. 1 and Podomyrma laevifrons F. Smith were dissected and the structure of nest chambers and their contents recorded. Only some chambers had entrance holes, but many were interconnected by transverse passages. The coccids were in low numbers and fairly evenly distributed between ant-occupied chambers. The characteristics of the Myzolecanium-ant association, the role of the coccids as trophobionts, and the nature of the plant associations are discussed. Taxonomically, new combinations are proposed by P. J. Gullan for three species previously placed in Cryptostigma Ferris: Myzolecanium endoeucalyptus (Qin & Gullan), M. magnetinsulae (Qin & Gullan), and M. robertsi (Williams & Watson).

AB Two kinkajous (Potos flavus) were equipped with radio-transmitters and tracked during a 14- and a 7-day period in a primary forest of French Guiana. Both individuals were strictly nocturnal. They moved between food patches (flowering or fruiting trees) during c. 65% of the night, visited food trees during c. 20%, while the remaining time was devoted to rest. Rest time tended to peak in the middle of the night, whereas distances travelled peaked at the beginning and the end of the night. Minimum and maximum home range areas, estimated from minimum area and minimum convex polygon methods respectively, reached 15.7 and 17.6 ha in the female, 26.6 and 39.5 ha in the male. Mean daily activity area amounted to 5.5 ha in the female, 11.3 ha in the male. Distances travelled in a night averaged 1495 m for the female, 2540 m for the male. In contrast to the female, the male used the periphery more intensively than the centre of its home range. Both individuals occupied' several roosts located in the canopy, but one far more frequently than the others. The male's roosts were all situated in the periphery of the home range.
   Kinkajous were observed feeding on flowers or fruits of 15 plant species. Among the 10 species exploited for fruits, at least seven were dispersed. Dispersal distances averaged 200 +/- 75 m (13 seed dispersal occurrences for 16 defecations), while seed transit time varied from 45 min to 3 h 35 min. P. flavus appears to be nocturnal, solitary, a generalist fruit and flower-eater and an important seed dispersal agent.

DE CRABS; DECOMPOSITION; DETRITIVORY; LITTER; MEXICO; NUTRIENT CYCLING;
   SEASONAL TROPICAL FOREST
AB The effect of the red land crab (Gecarcinus lateralis) on leaf litter biomass and nutrient transformation was investigated in a semi-deciduous tropical forest on coastal dunes using access and exclusion plots observed for six months. Crabs were in burrows during drought, but began foraging immediately after rainfall. Crabs accelerated litter disappearance significantly during the wet season at one site located beneath Brosimum alicastrum, but had no effect beneath a nearby Enterolobium cyclocarpum. The difference is tentatively attributed to small leaflet size in the latter species which crabs were unable to handle and consume. At both sites, litter in exclosures had approximately doubled by the end of the ensuing dry season. At the Brosimum site it is attributed to sporadic crab detritivory occurring after dry seasonal rains. At the Enterolobium site it is attributed to preferential retention of litter in the exclosures during strong dry season winds. The nutrient content of litter exposed to, or protected from, crabs was not significantly different at either site and differences in litter nutrient pools reflected differences in litter biomass. Accelerated nutrient mineralization due to crab detritivory was concentrated early in the wet season before leaching began from the soils, and it is suggested that this altered seasonal pattern of mineralization may reduce the loss of nutrients from the site in percolating water.

The community was variable in species composition with respect to space (between sites 1-5 km distant) and time (between early and late wet seasons). Differences in species composition attributable to spatial heterogeneity and to seasonal variation were of a comparable magnitude when examined by the CCA ordination. Auchenorrhyncha density, estimated by sweeping, was generally low, at 1 to 2 individuals m-3 of vegetation. There was a negative correlation between the species' population size in the early and the late wet seasons.

AB The reproductive process of two species of Kielmeyera, K. coriacea and K. speciosa, sympatric in savanna areas in central Brazil, has been studied. The trees have similar pollination systems and dispersal mechanisms but distinct phenological behaviours. Fast germination after the beginning of the wet season, early root swelling forming a xylopodium which enables survival during the dry season, and recurrent sprouting from the swollen root system during the first years of development were features of an establishment syndrome common to both species. The seedling survival after establishment was high; after five years 64% of the seedling cohort of K. coriacea was still alive. These seedlings, in natural conditions, remain poorly developed and resprout recurrently from the soil during some years. The recruitment of adult plants seems to occur from this 'seedling bank'. The reproductive process was higher in K. coriacea during most stages of the reproductive process which may explain the smaller population size and distribution range of K. speciosa. For both species, the reproductive process as a whole was mainly affected by biotic factors in the wet season and not by seasonal drought or periodic fire.

AB The effects of forest habitat, canopy light condition, vertebrate herbivory and species mean seed size on growth of tree seedlings were evaluated for six widely different species of North Queensland tropical rain forests. Two forest localities differing in size and rainfall intensity were used for the trial. In each forest, seedlings were transplanted three weeks after germination into small to medium-sized canopy gaps and into the forest interiors, with half protected by cages and the other half unprotected. Growth measurements were made over a period of 16 months. All growth parameters examined differed significantly between the six species. At the end of the study period, for most species, forest site and protection from vertebrates did not affect seedling biomass. For all species, growth was higher in gaps than in forest interior, but most biomass allocation patterns did not differ between the two habitats. This was attributed to the small difference in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) levels between the two habitats (interior, 0.48-2.53% PAR; gap, 3.58-7.09% PAR). Between species, seedling growth in the forest interior and sensitivity to increasing light were significantly correlated with initial mean seed size. The growth ability of the six species in and out of canopy gaps is discussed in terms of regeneration status of forest tree species.

AB Density and biomass of four ungulate species, elephant (Elephas maximus) and seven other mammal species were estimated in an area of about 50 km2 in a dry tropical forest in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, western Thailand. Density estimations employed line transects, using either direct sightings or indirect signs. Total biomass of these ungulates and elephant was 1450 kg km-2 which was lower than that found in a well protected and managed area of similar forest, Nagarahole National Park, in India. This is due to the intensive poaching activity and the lack of wildlife management in this study site. Three species of ungulate, banteng (Bosjavanicus), gaur (Bos gaurus) and sambar deer (Cervus unicolor), contributed over 70% of the estimated herbivore biomass. This situation is similar to that found in other parts of Asia. The high biomass of a subterranean mammal, Cannomys badius, has not been documented elsewhere in Asia; this species probably influences the forest dynamics and ecology of small carnivores in this area.

AB The seasonal patterns of surface activity and behaviour were recorded for three species of juliform millipede in a savanna habitat in south-east Botswana. Initially, surface activity followed rainfall events but this association weakened as the season progressed and, although significant, the correlation between the magnitude of rainfall events and activity was weak. Activity also occurred on moist, relatively cool and cloudy days, particularly in Alloporus uncinatus which was much larger than the other species. The onset and duration of surface activity varied between species. Observations of feeding behaviour suggested that millipedes in semi-arid savannas did not subsist exclusively on tree leaf litter but appeared to select a range of food types. Mobility is necessary to obtain these patchy resources but differences between the sexes in patterns of behaviour are more likely related to the mating patterns of these species.

DT Article
DE BRAZIL; CERRADO; SAVANNA; MURUNDUS; ISLAND BIOGEOGRAPHY
AB The 'campos de murundus' (earthmound fields) are typical landscapes of the cerrado (savanna) region of Central Brazil and are characterized by many rounded earthmounds called 'murundus' which are scattered over a grassland surface. As these areas are normally liable to seasonal water-logging, the earthmounds are true habitat islands capable of bearing woody plants typical of the cerrado, which are normally very intolerant of root inundation. The vegetation of an area of murundus field at Cuiaba, in the State of Mato Grosso, Central Brazil. was surveyed for the purpose of evaluating the island-effect on the plant community growing on the mounds/islands. Two main aspects were considered: the influence of the size of the mound and the differences between the types of cerrado occurring on the mounds and on the areas surrounding the murundus field. Most plant species occurring on the mounds were also present iii the flora of the surrounding cerrado. However, only a fraction of these species was able to colonize the mounds successfully. The number of species on the mounds was found to be significantly correlated with mound area. Species-area relationships were better described with the power model S = C(A(z)) than with the exponential model S = C + z (logA) (fitted with linear regression). The mound size also had a strong influence on the spatial distribution of the species on the surface of the mounds. The species were organized in an increasing number of concentric topographic belts corresponding to a gradient of soil depth above the flooding level.

AB The habitat distribution and relative abundance of 113 species of Gramineae were documented by releves in 82 stands near Concepcion, Santa Cruz, Bolivia. A factor analysis was used to compare the floristic similarity of stands situated in semideciduous forest, cerradao, cerrado, campo rupestre, valley-side campo, pantanal complex or on granite outcrops. Individual grass species usually had a preferred habitat and occurred with decreasing abundance in stands judged to be transitional by physiognomic, edaphic, and floristic criteria. Stands situated in cerrado vegetation were most similar to one another in grass species composition. Cerradao was transitional to semideciduous forest and cerrado but certain grasses were characteristic of this vegetation type. The floristic composition of the single campo rupestre locality was somewhat similar to cerrado; however, several of the more abundant grass species of this vegetation type did not occur in any nearby cerrado stand. Granite outcrops had a distinct grass flora and showed little similarity to other vegetation types. In savanna wetland communities, grass species distribution was influenced by water regime. Differences between stands on valley-side campo corresponded to topographic position on a gradient of increasing water surplus. Seasonally humid/dry stands on valley-side campo and pantanal complexes had a high degree of similarity. Stands lower on the catenary sequence of pantanal complexes and valley-side campos were increasingly dissimilar, a result of the different edaphic conditions of the seasonally flooded soils of pantanal complexes when compared with the permamently saturated (but never flooded) soils of valley-side campos. Pantanal complexes had the richest grass flora of all vegetation types because their microtopographic variability creates numerous micro-habitats with distinct water regimes, each supporting different grass species.

AB A life-form classification from Neotropical Gramineae is proposed for 113 native species from eastern lowland Bolivia. A factor analysis was performed on a correlation matrix of 51 vegetative attributes to identify 'character suites,' which were then used as the basis for the classification. The principal types are arboreal, liana, shrub-like, forb-like, bunch grass with basal foliage, bunch grass with basal and caulescent foliage, caespitose annuals, elongate rhizomes, turf grass, stoloniferous, and decumbent (the last category is further divided into subgroups: -perennial, -indefinite, -floating aquatic, and -vine-like). A key component of the life-form classification is the morphology of leaf blades, with five major patterns recognized: elongate and inrolled, elongate and conduplicate, elongate and flat with an attenuate base, short and broad with an amplexicaule base, and short and broad with a pseudopetiole.
   The distribution and relative abundance of three major photosynthetic categories were compared with life-form and habitat preference. Photosynthetic type of individual species was identified based on leaf anatomy. C4-(XyMS-) species predominated in cerradao, cerrado, campo rupestre, valley-side campos, and seasonally inundated savanna, as well as on granite outcrops. C4-(XyMS+) species were relatively rare in all habitats, but were significantly more abundant in the xeric micro-environments of granite outcrops. C3 species predominated in semi-deciduous forest and increased in relative abundance in wetland habitats. Caespitose annuals and bunch grass species were predominantly C4 type, while arboreal and liana species were uniformly C3 type. Grasses classified as decumbent or shrub-like were predominantly C3 type, while rhizomatous, stoloniferous, and forb-like grasses were a mixture of C3 and C4 type.
   The intent of the study was to group morphological characteristics objectively in order to derive a life-form classification specific for the Gramineae. Comparisons of the relative abundance of the various life-forms in a broad range of habitat types provide a descriptive assessment of the adaptive value of these characteristics.

AB Tropical forest vegetation occurs within a narrow corridor along the semi-arid tower floodplain of the Tana River, Kenya. An inventory of the woody flora and ecological study of 12 forest areas in the Tana River National Primate Reserve (TRNPR) describe the composition and structure of this riverine forest ecosystem and identify patterns of regional and local diversity. Only 175 species in 49 families are recorded in the woody flora, but the geographic affinities of 98 species are from four major floristic regions in Africa: Zanzibar-Inhambane (31%), Somalia-Masai (16%), Guinea-Congolian (12%), and Zambezian (1%).  Ten species are rare and/or disjunct. Forests have a disturbed physiognomy characterized by a low mean height (14.4 m), high species importance attributable to a few trees, low density (409 ha-1) and coverage (23.1 m2 ha-1) of trees > 10 cm dbh, and an abundance of palms and lianes. Changes along the river in sediment deposition and hydrology explain the high diversity of landforms and corresponding forest types in the TRNPR vicinity, but the absence of trees which are most important near Bura, Acacia elatior, and near Wema, Barringtonia racemosa, suggests that the regional diversity of the ecosystem is inadequately protected. Preservation of key resources, such as the endangered primates, should be coupled with protection of the forest heterogeneity that characterizes this dynamic landscape.

AB This paper presents the quantities of macro-nutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg and S) released from the ground layer vegetation to the atmosphere during six experimental burnings, in a Brazilian open savanna, named 'campo-cerrado'. The values were obtained by comparing the amounts of nutrients in the fuel and in the ash resulting after the burn, in three different seasons. On average, 20.6 kg of N, 1.6 kg of P, 7.1 kg of K, 12.1 kg of Ca, 3.0 kg of Mg, and 3.2 kg of S ha-1 were transferred from the plant biomass to the atmosphere, representing mean percentages of 95% for N, 51% for P, 44% for K, 52% for Ca, 42% for Mg, and 59% for S. The burn season showed no significant influence on the amounts of nutrients transferred to the atmosphere. Some relationships involving the quantities of macro-nutrients released, fuel moisture, the combustion efficiency during the burns, and the initial standing biomass in the area were also tested. Comparing the average output of macro-nutrients to the atmosphere obtained in this study with their inputs via rainfall, in the same area, it was estimated that three years would be an adequate interval between prescribed burnings for this campo-cerrado, to speed up nutrient recycling without impoverishing the system.

AB The endangered Gouldian Finch Erythrura gouldiae is the only Australian finch to nest exclusively in tree hollows or, more rarely, in termite mounds. It is sympatric with the abundant Long-tailed Finch Poephila acuticauda which nests frequently in tree hollows. The aim of this study was to define the characteristics of nest sites and breeding areas of Gouldian and Long-tailed Finches to determine whether nest hollows were in short supply, and where finches fed relative to their nest sites. The Gouldian Finch chose hollows with smaller, more northerly entrances than Long-tailed, or randomly chosen hollows, nested deeper down the hollow and on steeper bill-slopes. Both species preferred single to multi-trunked trees of larger diameter than trees with randomly chosen hollows. Discriminant analysis classified 22-25% of the randomly chosen hollows and 28-38% of Long-tailed nesting hollows as Gouldian hollows. Gouldian Finches were more specific in their choice of nest sites than Long-tailed Finches. The vegetation at the two sites differed floristically, but within each site there was no floristic distinction between feeding or breeding sites or sites chosen at random. Gouldian Finches chose feeding habitat where trees were more spaced, on less rocky, barer ground than around breeding sites.
   On the basis of the criteria measured, there was no shortage of suitable hollows available to the Gouldian Finch for nesting. The overlap between feeding and breeding sites indicates the importance of managing breeding habitat for conservation.

AB The volcanic island of Anak Krakatau emerged from the sea in 1930. The antlion Myrmeleon frontalis has only become established on Anak Krakatau within the last five years, despite having been present on the other Krakatau Islands for at least 50 years.
   The appearance of the antlions on Anak Krakatau seems to have coincided with the construction of a shelter hut in 1986 which provides a suitable under-floor habitat of dry dusty soil for the larvae to construct their pits. From the hut site they have extended into sub-optimal locations around the bases of clumps of wild sugarcane, Saccharum spontaneum, on the adjacent lower slopes of the outer cone ash fields.
   The soil around the Saccharum clumps is variable. Fine deposits are suitable for antlion larvae. more gravelly soils are not. The antlion larvae inhabiting the Sacharum clumps are disturbed by rain which destroys their pits.
   These two habitats, the hut and Saccharum sites, are the only places on the island that are occupied by the antlion larvae. They have quite different micro-climates so that the two populations are out of synchrony with each other.

AB The cohesion of the arthropod community associated with the rain forest tree Argyrodendron actinophyllum was studied in a warm subtropical rain forest in Australia. The distribution of most arthropods was contagious on the foliage of A. actinophyllum. Chewers and phloem-feeders were more clumped than epiphyte grazers and parasitoids. Arthropod predator-prey ratios were high and relatively constant over time, as revealed by measures of their activity. However, similar ratios in abundance and species-richness of arthropods foraging on foliage showed high variability in space and no consistent trends. Species associations on the foliage were difficult to predict and did not constitute either a single, well-united community or well-delimited subcommunities. Most of the data suggest that on the foliage of A. actinophyllum, the cohesion of the arthropod community is not extremely strong. Apart from methodological constraints, possible reasons for this include the influence of host-tree phenology, and the high arthropod-diversity of the rain forest environment.

AB This study demonstrates that forest elephants (Loxodonta africana) play a kev role as seed dispersal agents for the upper canopy forest tree, Balanites wilsoniana. Seed that passed through elephants had a much greater probability of germinating (50.7%) than seeds from fruits collected directly from the tree (3%). Of 515 seeds that were collected from under parent trees, 89.1% were rotten at the time of collection, 2.6% had been eaten by forest pigs, 2.8% had been killed by squirrels, and 0.7% had been killed by insect damage. The remaining 4.8% of the seeds were still alive. In 150 hours of focal observations on B. wilsoniana trees, two fruits were seen to be destroyed by squirrels, no fruits were seen to be consumed by potential dispersers, and no evidence of scatter hoarding was found. Experimental seedling stations placed out under parent trees and away from parent trees indicated no significant effect of dispersal on seedling survival. Although elephants are not essential for the successful germination of B. wilsoniana seeds, they do greatly increase probability of germination and play a vital role in their dispersal, suggesting that this is a highly interdependent plant-animal seed dispersal system.

AB In the Cerrado of Itirapina, Brazil, 34% of the shrubs of Didymopanax vinosum (Araliaceae) were colonized by the honeydew-producing homopteran Aconophora teligera (Membracidae) which was found exclusively on this species of plant. Correlations were made between membracid density and ant frequency, as well as between these parameters and plant damage. We found that: (1) ant frequency was higher on branches with membracids and both were more frequently found near apical meristems; (2) herbivore damage was lower on apical meristems where the membracids concentrate than on ones where they are absent; (3) the presence of membracids on the plant was correlated with a reduction in the occurrence of other potential herbivores, especially on the branches housing membracids; (4) plants with more tillers tended to have a larger number of membracids. The data suggest that the presence of A. teligera and associated ants probably reduce herbivory on apical meristems of D. vinosum.

AB The present study reports on the exploitation of the nectar of Mabea fistulifera (Euphorbiaceae) by two platyrrhine primate species (Brachyteles arachnoides and Callithrix flaviceps) in the Atlantic Forest of south-east Brazil. Nectar-feeding by both primates was observed between late April and May, during which a peak in the floristic activity of M. fistulifera was recorded, in terms of both the number of trees flowering and the number of flowers available on each tree. Phenological records indicate, by contrast, that edible fruit was relatively scarce during this period, the early dry season at the study site. On the days when nectar was consumed, it accounted for 25% of records of plant feeding for B. arachnoides and 29% for C. flaviceps, although the former species was observed nectar feeding over a much longer period. The evidence indicates that M. fistulifera is a valuable, but not essential resource for both primates at a time of year when edible fruit is relatively difficult to obtain. M.fistulifera, in turn, can be seen as an opportunistic plant whose floral characteristics permit pollination by a wide range of volant and non-volant vertebrates, including primates.

   SEASONALITY; SEEDLINGS
AB The survival, height and leaf production of seedlings and juveniles of Aspidosperma fendleri and Richeria grandis were measured monthly for three years after germination. During the first year, some seedlings and juveniles of Aspidosperma fendleri were collected and the number of rootlets, the primary root length and the shoot : root ratio were determined.
   Both species show periodicity in growth but their relative growth rate differs between species. For Aspidosperma fendleri, the highest relative growth rate (0.313 y-1) was found for individuals grown under greenhouse conditions followed by individuals growing in an old forest gap (0.143 y-1) and finally individuals under the forest canopy (0.137 y-1). For Richeria grandis, the relative growth rate under the forest canopy was 0.261 y-1. Leaf production for Aspidosperma fendleri in the forest (natural conditions) was 4.39 total mean leaf number for five years and 5.46 total mean leaf number under greenhouse conditions. For Richeria grandis it was 5.34 mean leaf production for four years. The root : shoot ratio for Aspidosperma fendleri was constant during the observation year. Aspidosperma fendleri showed a lower number of rootlets than did Richeria grandis. There was an inverse relationship between growth and survival during the dry season. During this period, mortality was higher and the highest mortality occurred during the first year when the total relative growth rate was highest.
   Slow growth is evident in both species. This mechanism may represent an adaptive advantage to remain dormant until there is an opening in the forest canopy. Since the seeds of Aspidosperma fendleri and Richeria grandis are highly vulnerable to predators and pathogens, slow growth as seedlings and juveniles allows them to survive, and contributes to regeneration in cloud forest.

DE NIGERIA; SAVANNA; SOIL FERTILITY; TREE CANOPY; TREE HEIGHT
AB The effect of tree canopy cover on soil properties was studied over three periods: mid-dry season (January), mid-growth period (August) and peak-growth period (October) in three 1 ha plots in savanna of north-west Nigeria. The objective was to find out whether tree canopies change the nutrient status of the soil under them relative to adjacent grasslands. Soils under tree canopies were found to have significantly higher levels of organic matter, calcium, magnesium, potassium, total exchangeable bases, cation exchange capacity and pH than those in open grasslands. Nitrogen and phosphorus were slightly higher in soils under tree canopies than those in the open grasslands. Trees 7 m and above had more influence on soil properties than smaller trees. Differences in soil properties among the study plots were due to differences in their soil texture. Seasonal trends were observed in organic matter, carbon : nitrogen ratio, cation exchange capacity, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, total exchangeable cations and percentage base saturation.

Four previously identified soil series corresponded well with the ordination, and statistically significant differences in soil variables were found among the soil series. Dominant canopy tree species Dacryodes excelsa and Manilkara bidentata were negatively associated with the first ordination axis and positively associated with dry soils having low concentrations of Ca and Mg and low pH. The palm Prestoea montana was positively associated with the first axis and with wet soils having high concentrations of Ca and Mg and higher pH values. Another canopy species Sloanea berteriana was associated with the second ordination axis and with lower slope positions having higher concentrations of Mg.

DE CROCODILE; CROCODYLUS; LIBERIA; OSTEOLAEMUS; WEST AFRICA
AB A representative sample of waterways in Liberia was surveyed for crocodiles, and all three species of African crocodiles were observed. Contrary to previous reports, only Nile crocodiles inhabit the Monrovia mangrove swamps and brackish-water mouths of rivers; there are no slender-snouted or dwarf crocodiles in these habitats. There is partitioning of habitats among the three species in Liberia: Nile crocodiles in mangrove swamps and river mouths (brackish water); slender-snouted crocodiles in rivers through rain forest (freshwater); and dwarf crocodiles in small streams through rain forest (freshwater), some entering the adjacent river. Dwarf crocodiles utilize burrows in the stream banks.
   Nowhere are crocodiles abundant, and there is an apparent absence of adults. Although 40% of Liberia is forested, deforestation is occurring rapidly by foreign timber companies and slash-and-burn agriculture practised by the largely rural population. Hunting with firearms, although illegal, is widespread, both for subsistence and commercially, without concern for depletion. Mangrove ecosystems near human population centres are being destroyed. The combination of the above factors has apparently depleted the crocodile populations in Liberia.

AB Psittacanthus robustus (Loranthaceae) is a Neotropical mistletoe which grows mainly on species of Vochysiaceae in Brazilian 'cerrado' regions. Its parasitizing pattern involves: (a) the height and the aspect of the crown of the host-plants; (b) the presence of sticky substance in the fruits of the parasite; and (c) the feeding behaviour and habitat selection of the dispersal agent, the swallow-tanager Tersina viridis viridis. The feeding behaviour of this bird on fruits of P. robustus facilitates seed release and seedling establishment; its foraging habit and habitat selection account for high concentrations of the parasites on their preferred host-plants.

AB Fifteen species of Lepidoptera occurred in large numbers in spring and early summer after the passage of Hurricane Hugo over the north-cast of Puerto Rico. Spodoptera eridania (Noctuidae) was the most common of the larvae and fed on 56 plant species belonging to 31 families. All the Lepidoptera fed on early successional vegetation. Some of the plants represent new host plants for these species. The outbreaks appeared to be based on the flush of new foliage that developed in the Luquillo Mountains after the passage of the hurricane. The end of the S. eridania outbreak was concurrent with the consumption of its preferred host plants and to an apparent increment in parasitism by ichneumonids (Hymenoptera). Parasitism by tachinids (Diptera) may have contributed to the reduction in abundance of other Lepidoptera species that were temporarily very abundant. Natural enemies of S. eridania were recorded for the first time in Puerto Rico.

AB This paper describes estimates of canopy openness and associated light availability in the understorey of a north-east Australian rain forest before and immediately after a tropical cyclone. On the basis of 20 hemispherical (fisheye) canopy photographs it was shown that direct, diffuse and total site factors increased significantly as a result of the slight-to-moderate canopy disturbance caused by the cyclone. In the understorey, median total site factors ranged from 2.5-3.4% before the cyclone and from 6.0-8.6% after the cyclone, representing a 2- to 3-fold increase in potential light availability. Following the cyclone, mean relative gap frequencies increased substantially at all altitudes but particularly at canopy positions more than 70-degrees above the horizon. Cyclone-induced canopy disturbance not only reduced the complexity of the understorey light regime but may have also increased the seasonal variability of light within the understorey of the forest during the interval of canopy recovery. The implications of these results for the ecophysiology of understorey tree seedlings and saplings at several temporal scales are discussed.

AB Greylag (Anser anser) and Barheaded Geese (Anser indicus) wintering in the Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur, India, have habitat and food preferences which are comparable to overwintering geese in other parts of the world. These geese preferred to eat the dominant grass species in the Park, Paspalum distichum, as determined by a comparison of the mean proportion of Paspalum of the total food eaten by Greylag and Barheaded Geese (0.932 & 0.97 1, respectively) with the mean availability of Paspalum in the wetland (0.795). However, based on a habitat study at the end of their overwintering season in February 1986, both species of geese used sites with the same amount of Paspalum distichum cover (c. 14%) as sites that they did not use (c.14%).
   The means of habitat characteristics of sites geese used versus sites they did not use, respectively, are given here in order of their relative preference based on rankings of their standardized means. Greylags preferred sites which were grazed concurrently by other species of herbivores (frequency = 0.9 & 0.4), were farther from trees with Painted Stork nests (Mycteria leucocephala; 981 & 887 m) and from trees in general (49 & 26m), or had deeper water 61 & 49cm). However, Greylags did not prefer sites which were farther from open water (65 & 223 m), had been cut by hand (frequency = < 0.1 & 0.1), were farther from vegetation dominated by Vetiveria zizanioides (668 & 842 m), had been bulldozed (frequency = < 0.1 & 0.1), or had any amount of cover of the exotic aquatic weed, Eichhornia crassipes (0.0 & 0.3%).
   Barheaded Geese preferred sites which were remote from the Park boundary (1156 & 757 m), were farther from any road (423 & 235 m), had been grazed by geese in 1984 (0.3 & < 0.1), had higher covers of droppings (0.4 & 0.1%), or had been burned in the previous summer (frequency = 0.2 & 0.1). They did not prefer sites which had deeper water (25 & 61 cm), had been grazed by geese in 1985 (frequency = 0.0 & 0.5), were farther from vegetation dominated by Vetiveria (511 & 733 m), had been bulldozed (frequency = 0.0 & 0.1), or were farther from open water (29 & 115 m). This information can be used to construct management plans for Greylag and Barheaded Geese overwintering in the Keoladeo National Park and other parts of northern India.

AB Litterfall (leaves, woody < 5 cm diameter, flowers and fruits) was estimated monthly using 20 litter traps, each 1 m2 , and litter standing crops were collected every three months using 20 samples of 0.5 m2, for Altitudinal forest (AF) and Semideciduous forest (SF) in south-east Brazil (Serra do Japi, Jundiai, Sao Paulo State) from March 1985 to March 1986. The total litterfall was 7 t ha-1 y-1 for AF:4.9 leaves, 1.8 woody, 0.13 flower, 0.16 fruits; and the total for SF was 8.6 t ha-1 y-1:  5.5 leaves, 2.1 woody, 0.5 flower, 0.4 fruits. Litter standing crop was 5.5 t ha-1 y-1 for the two forest sites studied with a turnover coefficient (K1) of 1.3 for AF and 1.6 for SF. Litterfall occurred throughout the year but was greater during the dry season (August-September); seasonality of litter and leaf fall was greater in SF than in AF but in both followed the litterfall patterns of other south-east Brazilian forests.

AB The adult Auchenorrhyncha community within the understorey of a montane tropical forest in Vietnam is described. A total of 1132 specimens representing 223 morphospecies and 16 families was found in a 4300-sweep sample. None of the species exceeded the 5% dominance level. More than half the species are represented by single individuals within the 309 m3 of vegetation. Spatial community pattern is mosaic-like at a scale of hundreds of metres as the similarity of 100-sweep samples does not depend on their spatial distance. Areas 1.5-3 km distant from one another differ markedly in their Auchenorrhyncha communities. These between-site differences exceed the intra-site community heterogeneity. Population density of Auchenorrhyncha species is not correlated with their body size. The Auchenorrhyncha community within a forest markedly differs from the community of an adjacent ruderal area. A transitional zone between these habitats is intermediate in Auchenorrhyncha species composition.

AB A study of small rodents was conducted in a small lake-shore forest (Lunyo) in southern Uganda between April 1970 and December 1972. Using capture-recapture methods, data on population changes and breeding of six murid species were obtained. At the beginning of the study, populations of Lophuromys flavopunctatus and Praomys jacksoni were higher during the mid-annual dry season (june-September), but later fluctuated with rainfall. Breeding coincided with rainfall in all species but in Praomys jacksoni and Oenomys hypoxanthus breeding occurred in both wet and dry months. The growth rate of laboratory reared Praomys jacksoni and Lemniscomys striatus was comparable to that in the forest within the 20-60 g weight ranges. The growth rate of Lophuromys flavopunctatus in the laboratory was lower than in the forest. Nonsignificant differences in growth rates were observed between individuals of different litters of the same species. Except in L. striatus, testicular descent in males occurred at an earlier age than vaginal opening in females. The average litter size ranged from a high of 4.5 for L. striatus to a low of 2.7 for O. hypoxanthus.

DE EXPLOITATION; FOREST UTILIZATION; FOREST DEGRADATION; FOREST STRUCTURE;
   INDONESIA; MOUNTAIN VEGETATION; PLANT COMMUNITY
AB Natural forests on java have been generally cleared and remnant, are now confined to mountain areas. Although legally protected, these forests are used by local people for products like firewood, timber and fodder. Locally, such exploitation is carried out daily by hundreds of people, whose livelihood depends on forest products. Using a landscape-guided approach, a 15,500 ha area of montane forest in East java has been sampled and analysed at the sylyatic mosaic level. Vegetation types, sociologic species groups and vegetation structure are described for landscape units. The most accessible landscape units have the most degraded forest with basal area values < 15 m2 ha-1 and a canopy closure of < 20%. The least accessible units have relatively undisturbed forest with basal area values of > 45 m2 ha-1 and a canopy closure of > 60%. Human activities such as tree cutting have altered species composition and modified forest structure to such an extent that large stretches of forest have been replaced by woodland or shrubland. Forest degradation is described as a human-induced process in which basal area and canopy closure are ultimately reduced, in Spite of regrowth. Comparison with other forest areas on java shows that degradation as a result of tree cutting is a widespread phenomenon.

AB Nanophyes shoreae (Coleoptera, Apionidae) is a pre-dispersal fruit-predator of dipterocarp trees in South-east Asian rain forest. These trees frequently abort a large part of their fruit-crop soon after anthesis, coincident with N. shoreae oviposition. Fruit parameters, related to the incidence of weevil attack, were investigated by examination of fruit collected from host trees and through observations made in the canopy. Fruit size and the incidence of prior oviposition determined whether beetles initiated attacks. However, many fruits were attacked without oviposition occurring and this is discussed with respect to chemical stimuli.

DE DISTURBANCE; DOMINANT SPECIES; HURRICANE HUGO; PUERTO-RICO; TABONUCO;

AB Hurricane Hugo of September 1989 caused severe damage to the rain forest in the north-east corner of Puerto Rico. We assessed the severity of damage distributed in space, species, and size-classes of trees in the Bisley Watersheds of the Luquillo Experimental Forest. We analyzed pre- and post-hurricane data for vegetation from transects established in 1987 and 1988. The severity of damage was significantly greater in valleys than on ridges and slopes. All the species except Dacryodes excelsa, Sloanea berteriana, and Guarea guidonia showed 100% severe damage. Large trees (> 70 cm DBH) were highly susceptible to hurricane damage, but there was no clear pattern in the small size-classes. D. excelsa (tabonuco) was the most resistant to damage by the hurricane. Tabonuco which has extensive root-grafts and root anchorage to bedrock and subsurficial rocks, apparently can survive frequent hurricanes and continue as a dominant species in this montane tropical rain forest. The high frequency of hurricanes, which can override other ecological and topographic factors, may largely determine the overall spatial pattern of species in this rain forest.

TI FLOODPLAIN MURUNDUS OF CENTRAL BRAZIL - EVIDENCE FOR THE TERMITE-ORIGIN
   HYPOTHESIS
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY

DT Article
DE BRAZIL; CERRADO; EARTHMOUNDS; TERMITE; SAVANNA
AB 'Campos de murundus' are a typical landscape of Central Brazil characterized by countless rounded earthmounds (the 'murundus'), which are covered by woody 'cerrado' (savanna) vegetation and are found scattered over a grass-covered surface (the 'campo'). A detailed study was carried out in the region of Cuiaba, state of Mato Grosso on a particular campo de murundus (area of 5.065 ha) lying in a sedimentary depression where the earthmounds are true islands during the annual floods, allowing the colonization both by cerrado plants and by termites. The mounds were mapped and measured for their size and shape. Mounds' diameters ranged from 0.2 to 22.0 m and heights ranged from 0.1 to 1.1 m. The 445 smaller mounds (< 0.8m diameter) were found to have a clumped distribution, occupying 0.1% of the area. They are actually small termite nests built by Armitermes euamignathus. The 80 larger mounds (> 0.8 m diameter) were uniformly distributed, occupying 6.3% of the area. These mounds are colonized by Cornitermes snyderi and Cornitermes bequaerti which build big ter-mite nests on the summit of the mounds. Soil analyses indicated a close similarity between the campo and the surrounding cerrado whose soils had coarser texture and were poor in nutrients. Soils of the earthmounds and termite nests showed finer texture, lower pH and higher amounts of mineral nutrients. It is suggested here that this particular type of campo de murundus is formed mainly from the localized activity of nest-building by termites, followed by nest degradation, during many generations of termite colonies.

AB Surveys of the microhabitat distribution of adult butterfly species were undertaken at three rain forest sites in North Queensland, Australia, encompassing a range of rain forest vegetation types. These surveys found little evidence for a specialist canopy fauna. Most species recorded in the canopy were often seen close to the ground. At all sites, most species were observed at the edge of the rain forest habitat; within the rain forest, more species were observed near the ground than in the canopy.

AB We studied the population structure, density and biomass of seven ungulate and two primate species in the tropical forests of Nagarahole, southern India, using line transect sampling and roadside/platform counts, during 1986-87. The estimated ecological densities of large herbivore species in the study area are: 4.2 muntjac km-2, 50.6 chital km -2 , 5.5 sambar km-2, 0.8 four-horned antelope km-2, 9.6 gaur km-2, 4.2 wild pig km-2, 3.3 elephant km-2, 23.8 hanuman langur km-2 and 0.6 bonnet macaque km-2. Most ungulates have female-biased adult sex ratios. Among common ungulate species, yearlings and young of the year comprise about a third of the population, suggesting relatively high turn-over rates. Three species (muntjac, sambar and four-horned antelope) are solitary, while others form groups. The study area supports a wild herbivore biomass density of 14,744 kg km-2. Among the three habitat types within the study area, biomass is lower in dry deciduous forests when compared with moist deciduous or teak plantation dominant forests. Using our results, we have examined the factors that may contribute towards maintenance of high ungulate biomass in tropical forests.

   REHABILITATION
AB The ant species were sampled in one campo (grassy shrubland), one mata (semi-deciduous rain forest) and 11 rehabilitated bauxite mine plots at Pocos de Caldas, in the humid sub-tropical climatic region of Brazil. Rehabilitation was either by planting Australian Eucalyptus spp, the Brazilian Mimosa scabrella tree, or by planting mixed mata trees. Sixty eight ant species were recorded, of which 26 were exclusively found in the native vegetation and 16 were confined to the rehabilitated plots. Ant species richness built up most rapidly in areas rehabilitated with mixed mata species and least rapidly in areas with Eucalyptus. Younger rehabilitated plots appeared to be developing a campo-type ant community, although evidence indicates that more mata ant species will colonise once tree canopy closure takes place. Rate of ant return in Australia is positively correlated with the quantity and distribution of rainfall - the rates in the current study concur with those from humid sub-tropical climatic zones within Australia, suggesting that similar constraints to the succession may be operating. If found to be the case, this would have practical implications for planning and evaluating the success of rehabilitation.

AB Phytomass was determined for a tropical deciduous forest in Chamela, Jalisco, Mexico. The mean canopy height was 6.9 m, and the total basal area was 25.6 m2 ha-1 (dbh > 3.0 cm). The estimated phytomass for this forest (85 Mg ha-1) is among the highest values for tropical dry forests with similar seasonal climates. A stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that phytomass can be predicted firstly by basal area (R2 = 0.88), then by wood specific gravity (R2 = 0.91), and finally by the inclusion of tree height in the regression (R2 = 0.92). Each new independent variable explained significant variance in the phytomass estimation.

AB Small mammal live-trapping was carried out in a dry tropical forest mosaic in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, central Thailand. Trapping was done in two forest types in three seasons. Maxomys surifer was the dominant species in both plots. The three most abundant species in each plot accounted for > 90% of all captures. Community structure, density, relative abundance, biomass, age structure of populations, and habitat usage of some small mammal species varied by forest type and season. The dry evergreen/mixed deciduous forest type supported a greater abundance and biomass of small mammals than the mixed deciduous/dry dipterocarp forest type in all seasons, although species richness was the same. The greatest density, biomass, and home-range, size for Maxomys surifer occurred in the rainy season in both forest types. Seasonal changes in ratios of adults and subadults of several species suggested a breeding peak at the end of the dry season or beginning of the rainy season. The mixed deciduous/dry dipterocarp forest showed a drastic drop in numbers, density, and biomass of small mammals six weeks after a fire burned through it.

DE AMAZONIA; AMPHIBIANS; BRAZIL; FROGS; LITTER HERPETOFAUNA; RAIN FOREST
AB Abundance and distribution of frogs inhabiting the litter layer of an area of primary lowland rain forest in Central Amazonia were studied over a period of 15 months by sampling 498 plots each 5 m x 5 m.  The litter fauna of the area consists of 23 species, but only 12 of these were encountered in the plots, and 84% of the frogs encountered belonged to only six species.  Total abundance and diversity within the plot data are strongly seasonal and peak in the late wet season.  Both are positively correlated with litter volume and moisture.  Most of this variation is due to seasonality of reproduction, as indicated by patterns of occurrence of juveniles of the most abundant species.
   These results indicate that the plot sampling method does not sample the entire fauna adequately.  Since, this technique has been used to study other tropical forest litter herpetolaunas, however, comparison with other studies may be useful.  Species diversity of litter frogs appears to be approximately the same in lowland primary forest sites studied, averaging around 20 'regular' species.  Abundances, however, vary widely.  Central American communities contain 14-15 frogs (100 m)-2, African 9-10, South American 4-6, and South-east Asian 1-2.  These differences may be due to differential nutrient availability in forests of different ages and/or on different soils.

AB The dispersal of seeds by howler monkeys (Alouatta palliata) and the activity of dung beetles in modulating the fate of the dispersed seed were studied at Los Tuxtlas, Mexico.  Howlers consumed the fruits of 35 species of plants.  The seeds of 28 of these were dispersed by the monkeys.  The majority (greater-than-or-equal-to 90%) of the seeds dispersed by monkeys were destroyed by rodents.  Rapid relocation and burial of dung by dung beetles resulted in accidental relocation and burial of large numbers of seeds shortly after deposition.  Faecal clumps (20 mg) remained on the ground for an average of only 2.5 h (range 1 3 h).  Ball rolling beetles transported balls up to 5.0 m from the site of deposition (range 1-5 m).  Burrowing and ball-rolling dung beetles buried seeds at depths ranging from 2.5 to > 12.0 cm.  The deeper a seed is buried, the less likely it is to be found and eaten by rodents.  Eighty percent of the species used by Alouatta as sources of fruit at Los Tuxtlas benefited by the dispersal and post dispersal service provided by howlers and dung beetles respectively.  Seasonality in dung beetles abundance in the forest may influence the number of seeds per species escaping post-dispersal predation during the year.  Dung beetles play not only an important ecological role in the recycling of matter and energy in the ecosystem, but also in the process of rain forest regeneration.

All the termitaria were mapped and opened for identification of the species present.  Their spatial distribution was studied using the nearest neighbour method (Clark & Evans 1954).  We found 46 termine species in 450 nests.  The majority of them were wood feeders.  The general distribution of termitaria was regular.  The distributional patterns of grass and litter feeders were not significantly different from a random distribution.  Soil and organic matter feeders were contagiously distributed.  The distribution of wood feeders was also contagious.  Their spatial distribution was largely influenced by the distribution of the species Nasulitermes sp. 1 and Armilermes euamignathus.  These two species occurred in two distinct patches, suggesting resource partitioning.

DE COMPETITION; FIRE; INTERFERENCE; PATTERN; NIGERIA; SAVANNA; TOTAL
   COVARIANCE
AB All woody growth was enmerated in three transects, each 960 m x 20 m, in derived savanna in the Olokemeji Forest Reserve in south-west Nigeria. The data for species density, species basal area and stem girth classes were analysed by nested-block analysis of variance and convariance. The use of 'total convariance', the sum of all covariances at a block size, contributes to understanding of the pattern present.
   Three scales of pattern were evident. Patchiness at 160-320 m is interpreted as a response to soil differences or to the pattern of previous farming, which may itself have been determined by soil differences. Patchiness at 20-40 m is atributable to varying intensity of burning. At the smallest scale, of 10 m, there is evidence of regularity of distribution resulting from interference between individuals, possibly due to competition for water.

TI RESPONSES OF AMAZONIAN RAIN-FOREST BIRDS TO HABITAT MODIFICATION
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY

DT Article

AB Bird species were surveyed in a variety of habitat types in a lightly populated area of western Brazilian Amazonia.  Habitats surveyed were unlogged forest, selectively logged forest; 'capocira' (scrub regenerating on cleared land), cropfields, and an isolated 35 ha forest 'island'.  All habitats were within a few kilometres of each other.  Many bird species were found to occur in all of most habitats, although the similarlity of the species assemblages dropped with increasing levels of disturbance of the natural vegetation.  Certain understorey insectivores common in unlogged forest were rarely observed in other habitats; disturbed areas contained higher numbers of flycatching insectivores or birds feeding on both insects and fruit, some of which were open-country rather than forest species.  The avifauna of the forest 'island' was more similar to that of regenerating scrub than to that of tall forest, and the persistance of forest species was attributed to their ability to move to and from nearby continuous forest areas.

AB Population energy budgets of four sympatric isopods, Burmoniscus ocellatus, Burmoniscus sp. (Philosciidae), Formosilla raffaeleri and Orodillo maculatus (Armadillidae), were calculated at two sites in a Hong Kong mixed forest.  Mean population standing stock of the four species ranged from 1.25 to 13.61 kJ m-2.  Mean total isopod biomass at the two sites was 0.85 and 1.85 g m-9.  Annual production of the four species varied from 4.24 to 30.43 kJ m-2 with 5.2-26.4% (energy content) allocated to reproduction.  Annual production of the four species combined at the two sites was 23.22 and 50.15 kJ m2.  P/B ratios varied from 2.24 to 4.27.  Annual population consumption on mixed litter by the four isopod species ranged from 28.4 to 183.0 kJ m2.  Total annual consumption by all species at the two sites was 233.7 and 360.2 kJ m-2 (1.96 and 2.53% of annual litter fall).  Isopod respiratory rates were proportional to body weight, with an exponent ranging from 0.68-0.78 at 23-degrees-C.  The annual population metabolism of the four species varied from 14.62 to 86.11 kJ m2.  Total annual isopod metabolism at the two sites was 116.33 and 185.95 kJ m-2.  These results are discussed with reference to the role of isopods in litter breakdown and energy flow in the Hong Kong Forest.

AB Using data from forest sites in Sarawak, East Malaysia, a demographic comparison is made of pioneer species in the genus Macaranga with understorey trees of the primary forest in the closely related genus Mallotus.  In primary forest, saplings and trees of these genera are uncommon and have low growth rates.  For the six years following disturbance by logging, a Macaranga population was characterized by high rates of diameter growth and recruitment.  Eleven years after disturbance, seedling and sapling abundance had declined sharply.  In contrast, the Mallotus population was stable in size class distribution and increased slightly in total population size during the 11 years after logging.  Growth rates of Mallotus trees increased after logging but were still much less than Macaranga trees.
   A morphological comparison shows that most Macaranga species, in contrast with Mallotus species, have large hollow twigs that are occupied by ants and have larger, hairier, thicker, more toothed leaves with longer petioles, axillary inflorescences with more flowers, infructescences with more fruit, fruits that are smaller in size and smaller seeds.

DE GATUN LAKE; ISLANDS; PANAMA; PROECHIMYS-SEMISPINOSUS; RODENTS; SPINY RAT
AB The insular distribution and abundance of the spiny rat (Proechimys semispinosus) were studied by live-trapping rats on 50 small forested islands in Gatun Lake, Republic of Panama.  Rats were found on 29 of these islands.  Rat abundance was not correlated with island size or isolation, in contrast to temperature rodents, and may be due to the highly patchy nature of tropical forests and the differing floristic compositions of the study islands.  Rat occurrence on islands was related positively to island size and negatively to island isolation.  All islands greater than 2.1 ha contained spiny rats, whereas most islands less than 0.9 ha did not contain rats.  The relationship between occurrence, size, and isolation are illustrated by a three-dimensional response surface.  Results suggest that colonization and extinction regularly occur on these islands and that (1) larger islands with year-round fruit production, regardless of isolation, will have persistent populations of rats, (2) small isolated islands will never or only very rarely have rats owing to a lack of a year-round food source and the difficulty of immigration, and (3) small near islands frequently will have rats when fruits are present.  No other species of mouse- or rat-like rodents were captured on the islands.  We suggest that P. semispinosus is a better colonist than other sympatric forest species, is more of a habitat generalist, and has a more flexible demographic structure allowing persistence in heterogeneous and changing environments.

AB In comparing the population structure of epiphytic and saxicolous Tillandsia species I found no significant differences between polycarpic species.  T. ionochroma populations had a higher seedling:adult ratio than saxicolous T. ionochroma populations, but the difference was not statistically significant.  Tillandsia ultriculata, a monocarpic epiphyte, had a significantly higher seedling:adult ratio than the polycarpic species.  T. utriculata's higher ratio may result from its greater seed production and lack of vegetative propagation.  Unlike the polycarpic species, all adult-size rosettes grow from seeds in T. utriculata.  Tillandsia sphaerocephala, an obligate saxicole, occurred in larger clusters (i.e. more rosettes per genet) than T. ionochroma.  The increased tendency for vegetative reproduction in T. sphaerocephala suggests that spatial patchiness is less of a constraint than with epiphytes.

AB A comparative analysis of earthworm populations in seral Khasi pine forest represented by Pinus kesiya 5- and 35-year old stands, and a climax broad-leaved mixed forest represented by a sacred grove was done at altitudes of 1500 m in Meghalaya in north-east India.  Tonoscolax horaii occurred under all forest types whereas Amynthas diffringens and Eutyphoeus festivus were confined to pine forest stands only.  Perionyx sp. and Drawida assamensis were restricted to the sacred grove.  T. horaii had larger numbers in all three different forest types.  This species offers possibilities of vermiculture for biologically improving soil fertility in manmade ecosystems because of its wide range of tolerance.
   Generally earthworm populations were more active during the monsoon season; A. diffringens was however, more active during the winter, thereby conferring an advantage on this species as it was enabled to avoid competition during the monsoon season when other species dominate.  Earthworm activity was generally higher in the sacred grove than in the pine forest stands.  Population size was significantly correlated with soil moisture, temperature and pH.  Wormcasts had a higher pH and nutrient status than the soil.
   In the highly leached soils of the humid tropics where there is a large concentration of fine root biomass in the surface soil layers, earthworm activity is beneficial because it helps incorporate detritus into the mineral soil rapidly and locally concentrates nutrients in the surface layers.

AB A population of Garra ceylonensis in a rocky, hill stream was studied by monthly sampling over a period of two years.  The monthly population density, which varied from 1.28 to 4.16 m-2 with a mean of 2.37 m-2, was negatively correlated with the water speed.  Asymptotic length (L infinity) and the growth constant (K) were found to be 180.5 mm total length and 0.62.  Maximum size observed was 174 mm, which is attained in about five years, but 99% of the population had a life expectancy of less than 3.4 years.  The overall male to female ratio of the population was 0.58.  The sex ratio was 1.0 in smaller size classes but decreased steadily with increasing size.  There was a major spawning season following the main rainy period in contrast to the trend of most tropical freshwater fish species, which show enhanced breeding during the rainy season.  The mean length and age at sexual maturity in females appear to be 109 mm and eighteen months.  Fecundity varied between 740 and 4390.  Average longevity and natural mortality were 4.8 years and 1.86.  The mean biomass, average annual production and turnover ratio of the population were about 23.7 g m-2 wet weight, 41.2 g m-2 and 1.7, respectively.

AB Soil microbial biomass (C(mic)) and its relation with soil carbon and nutrient contents in a tropical rain forest (Bawangling Nature Reserve, Hainan Island, P.R. China) were studied.  C(mic) was determined by the substrate induced respiration (SIR) method; bacterial and fungal fractions were measured using a selective inhibition technique.  For the A horizon, C(mic) ranged between 350 and 700-mu-g g-1 soil in April (beginning of the rainy season) and 250-600-mu-g g-1 in October (end of the rainy season).  C(mic) contents of the AB and B horizons were lower, ranging from 80 to 350-mu-g C(mic) g-1 soil.  On average, 75% of the biomass was bacterial, in the AB and B horizon this was slightly higher than in the A horizon.  C(mic) was closely correlated with C(org) and N content.  N and P contents as well as the respiratory response upon glucose addition indicated that towards the end of the rainy season compared with the start the soils were depleted in nutrients.  These observations stress the importance of microbial biomass as a factor for nutrient retention in tropical forest ecosystems.

DE HERBIVORY; HONG-KONG; KANDELIA-CANDEL; LEAF LONGEVITY; MANGROVES
AB Natural levels and consequences of insect herbivory were studied for a Kandelia candel (Rhizophoraceae) dominated mangal at the Mai Po Marshes, Hong Kong.  Grazing insects (mainly lepidopteran larvae) consumed, on average, 10.3% of the leaf area on K. candel, with > 90% of the leaves suffering < 30% loss.  Natural median leaf longevity was significantly different between winter and summer-exposed leaves, being, respectively, 423.2 and 269.6 days.  Observations showed that herbivore damage caused a reduction of leaf longevity, as severely damaged leaves were abscissed before intact, older leaves on the same branch.  Experimental leaf area removal suggested that leaf life span reduction was significantly influenced by leaf age and degree of damage.  However, the reduction was only significant (> 40 days) when area loss was > 40%.  Leaves produced in summer were also more sensitive to damage than those produced in winter.  As < 5% of the leaves suffered > 40% of area removal by insect grazing in nature, insect herbivory is considered an unimportant regulator of leaf litter dynamics for K. candel.  At this intensity level, herbivory consumes 2.8-3.5% of the net above-ground primary production of the mangrove.  There was also no significant difference in the final number of leaves and twigs produced by the branches with various degrees of leaf area removal.  Other observed impacts of insects on the structure and function of the K. candel mangal are discussed.

TI DIVERSITY OF SOIL FAUNA IN THE CANOPY AND FOREST FLOOR OF A VENEZUELAN

AB Arboreal and terresterial soil and litter were sampled for macro- and microinvertebrates at two locations in a Venezuelan cloud forest.  Fauna were most abundant in forest floor soil and associated litter.  However, media suspended in the canopy and particularly those trapped in bromeliad shoots were most densely populated, while the diversities of the arboreal and terrestrial soil fauna were indistinguishable.  Rates of leaf litter decomposition in the arboreal and terrestrial soils were similar, but the arboreal soils contained higher concentrations of mineral nutrients and carbon.  Implications of these findings for the definition of soil in humid tropical forests, and related differences between temperature and tropical forests are discussed.  The similarities in diversity and differences in species composition between arboreal and terrestrial soil fauna raise questions concerning the evolution of tropical soil fauna, as well as the estimate of global biotic diversity.

AB Litterfall was sampled during one year in two undisturbed Andean forests at altitudes of 2550 and 3370 m in the Colombian Cordillera Central.  Total small litterfall at 2550 and 3370 m was 7.03 and 4.31 tha-1 y-1 respectively, of which 4.61 and 2.82 were leaves, 1.06 and 0.76 woody parts, 0.66 and 0.27 reproductive parts, 0.22 and 0.23 epiphytes, 0.47 and 0.23 unclassified.
   Clear differences were also found in nutrient concentrations, both between different litter fractions from one site and between equivalent litter fractions from different sites.  Weighted mean concentrations for total small litterfall were (mg g-1, at 2550 and 3370 m respectively):  11.7 and 7.3 for nitrogen; 0.86 and 0.44 for phosphorus; 8.4 and 3.1 for potassium.  Comparison of nutrient concentrations in crown leaves and shed leaves indicated important reallocation of nitrogen (39% at both sites) and phosphorus (45% at 2550 m, 65% at 3370 m) before leaf shedding.
   The results for litterfall amounts, litter nutrient concentrations and reallocation of nutrients in the two forests are consistent with such data obtained in other montane forests in the wet tropics.

   COMPETITION; RESERVOIR; SELECTIVE PREDATION
AB The competitive interactions between two species of characins (Astyanax fasciatus and Astyanax bimaculatus) were investigated by studying their horizontal distribution, relative abundance and feeding habits in littoral and limnetic zones of Americana Reservoir, southern Brazil.
   Differences in horizontal distribution of the species mainly as adults led to their partial habitat segregation.  Most adult A. bimaculatus were littoral dwellers, whereas A. fasciatus adults were distributed from inshore to offshore waters, but with most in the latter region.
   Both are faculative zooplanktivores in the reservoir, feeding mostly on planktonic crustaceans, insects (chiefly chironomids), some higher plant material, detritus and even fish scales (A. bimaculatus).  Food overlap coefficients, considering adult and juvenile stages of both species are large in dry as well as wet seasons, although in the dry season the overlaps are significantly reduced for juveniles of both species and for juveniles of A. bimaculatus versus adults of A. fasciatus.  Both species prey more on cladocerans than on cyclopoid copepods, and the adults selectively take larger forms (Daphnia gessneri and Moina micrura) in the reservoir (as in previously reported enclosure experiments).  Juveniles prey heavily on Bosmina longirostris.
   These two formerly riverine species may reduce competition, in the reservoir, by partial habitat segregation in older stages, a mechanism to avoid competition, which may have existed in their previous interactive history in rivers.

   FRUGIVORY; PHYLLOSTOMIDAE; RADIOTELEMETRY; REPRODUCTION; TIME BUDGET
AB The frugivorous phyllostomid bat Carollia perspicillata is closely associated with specific fruits which are found and picked in flight, then eaten at a feeding roost.  Each fruit eaten corresponds to a single flight.  An apparatus designed for this study permits the simultaneous tracking of 10 bats equipped with double rhythm transmitters (slow rate corresponding to resting position and rapid rate to flying bouts).  (1) The number of flights, (2) the percentage time spent flying and (3) the range of activity were recorded for different categories of animals during two periods of fruit production.  Heavier males displayed high activity, while other males, non-breeding females and females in early pregnancy displayed a similar pattern of flying behaviour.  Full-term pregnant females and lactating females performed almost as many flying bouts as non-reproductive females, but these flights were much shorter.  This unexpected feeding strategy can be interpreted as a means of shifting energy to reproductive effort from exploratory behaviour (non-breeding females performed longer flights which combine the survey of environment and the fruit collection).  This strategy, based upon the optimization of flying bouts, is in contrast to those of non-flying mammals and probably is only compatible with periods of high food production.

AB Soil nutrient concentrations under Acacia albida and Kigelia africana trees growing in Zambezi riverine woodlands were compared with soils in the open, beyond tree canopies.  Concentrations of N, C, P and K were higher under tree canopies.  Concentrations of Ca and Mg were unchanged.  Soils were slightly more acid under A. albida trees relative to open soil, but were less acid under K. africana.  Soil P concentration was higher under K. africana than under A. albida.  Otherwise, the two species had similar effects on soil fertility.  Despite previous claims, A. albida is probably no more efficient at increasing soil fertility than other savanna trees.

DE AUSTRALIA; LEAF; LIANES; LITTERFALL; PRODUCTION; RAIN FOREST;
   SUBTROPICAL; SUCCESSION; TREES; VINES
AB Leaf litter production by lianes (= lianas) and trees was compared in an evergreen rain forest in subtropical Australia.  Several successional stages were represented at the main site.  Lianes contributed 2.2% of total basal area (69.6 m2 ha-1) of this site, but 24% of leaf litterfall (5.9-6.5 t ha-1 y-1 over two years.  Minor year-to-year variation in litterfall was attributed to incidence of severe storms, and drought.  Lianes were responsible for about 17% of leaf litterfall in spring, 21% in the summerpeak, and 40% in autumn, more lianes than trees being deciduous.  Leaf litter production by 23 individual species of liane, in relation to their basal area within the main site, was, on average, 15 times as great as that by 34 tree species, but declined more steeply between the species-groups of early and later succession.  Tendrillar lianes, unlike twiners and scramblers, were confined to the 'early' successional group, and their foliage was spread across canopy surfaces, maximizing light interception.  It was concluded that this contributed to greater production of leaf litter, per unit basal area, by tendrilar than by other climbers, and to the successional decline in leaf litterfall from lianes.

DE BAGRIDAE; ECOLOGY; FISH; NIGERIA; RIVER; TROPICS
AB Some aspects of the ecology of bagrid catfishes in River Ase, southern Nigeria were studied for a period of two years.  Nine species of Bagridae were recorded and these accounted for 15.0% of the number and 24.4% of the weight of all fish captured.  Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus and Chrysichthys auratus longifilis were the principal species.  C. nigrodigitatus was a rainy season species, while C. auratus longifilis was abundant in both dry and rainy seasons.  Both species showed a major peak in catches between 0600 and 0900 h.  C. nigrodigitatus exhibited a minor peak in catches between 1500 and 2100 h, while C. auratus longifilis showed a minor peak between 1500 and 1800 h.  The spatial distribution of C. nigrodigitatus and C. auratus longifilis populations was heterogeneous.  Bagrid fishes were an important component in the fish yield of the study river and its species composition has been compared with those of other Nigerian waters.  The distribution and abundance of C. nigrodigitatus and C. auratus longifilis are discussed in detail.

AB Mean annual quantities of solar radiation absorbed during various stages of regeneration of a tropical rain forest in the upper Rio Negro valley of Colombia and Venezuela were estimated for the consecutive intervals between clear-cut and 1, 3, 10, 20, 35, 60, 80 and 200 years of growth.  Forest phytomass and litter fall data from each of these stages were used to calculate the mean annual net dry matter production per unit of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), the PAR conversion efficiency.  The quantities of PAR absorbed by the forest stands were calculated from the leaf area index values with an extinction coefficient for PAR of 0.74, a PAR albedo of 0.04, and an annual mean incoming PAR of 2.86 GJ m-2 y-1.  Efficiency decreased with increase in successional stage.  During the first 10 years of regrowth, the efficiency of conversion of PAR into above-ground phytomass averaged 0.23 g MJ-1, decreasing to 0.07 g MJ-1 over the following 50 years.  Inclusion of annual root production in the calculations resulted in a small increase in PAR conversion efficiency; however, efficiency was more than doubled for some periods when the annual leaf and twig litterfall were included.  Efficiency values for above-ground production were much lower than PAR conversion efficiency values estimated for above-ground production of temperate forests.

AB Data on the taxonomic composition of the arboreal arthropod fauna of 10 Bornean lowland rain forest trees are presented, based on samples obtained using insecticide fogging.  Combined samples from all trees comprised 23,874 individuals of at least 3000 species.  The mean number of species on each tree was 616.7 with one tree sample containing more than 1007 species.  The relative rank of the major orders of arthropods in terms of both species and individuals was remarkably constant across the trees.  Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera and Hemiptera were the orders with the most species and individuals.  Formicidae, though not particularly species rich, was the most abundant family in terms of individuals and the commonest species in six of the 10 trees was an ant.  Refogging of one of the trees 10 days after initial sampling showed that the arthropod fauna had not completely recovered.  What many arthropods are doing in the canopy is discussed.

AB The fruits of Cola lizae, an endemic tree with a limited geographical distribution, have been a major food source for lowland gorillas in the Lope Reserve during part of each year over a six-year period.  Faecal analysis indicated that 11,000-18,000 Cola seeds km-2 were deposited by gorillas during the 4-month season in 1989.  Gorillas are the only important dispersers of this species:  other primates consume the succulent mesocarp, but do not swallow the large seed; elephants do not eat Cola fruits.  Observations of Cola seeds in gorilla faeces showed a very high germination rate and, despite initial high mortality, 18% of seedlings still survived six months after deposition.  Survival of seedlings was significantly better in faeces left at nest-sites than in other areas of the forest:  40% of seedlings were viable at nest-sites six months after deposition.  This suggests that the open areas of forest, preferred by gorillas as nest-sites, are advantageous to the propagation of this species.

AB In tropical seasonal forests, mass seedling death may incidentally occur early in the rainy season following untimely germination provoked by an isolated heavy rainfall.  We hypothesized that, in a soil with little moisture retention capacity, irregular rainfall patterns would result in large fluctuations of water supply and, in the early wet season, drought episodes could cause seedling death.  This hypothesis was tested in a seasonal tropical forest in Mexico where seedling density is low and the soil consists of almost pure sand with a low water retention capacity.  Various patterns of simulated rainfall were applied in the forest to seeds and seedlings of three common tree species.  Overall very little difference in germination and seedling survival was observed between the various rainfall treatments.  The results showed that rainfall patterns and the soil texture may interact in a much more complex way than was initially hypothesized, and that water availability to seeds and seedlings is not necessarily predictable.  The absence of seedlings of the three tree species might be better explained by high seed predation and low light level in the understorey.

DT Review
DE NUTRIENT BUDGETS; NUTRIENT CYCLING; TROPICAL RAIN FOREST
AB Atmospheric gains and hydrologic losses of calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen for 25 tropical forest sites on a variety of geological substrates are reviewed.  The data set comprised 19 lowland and six montane sites.  Twenty studied were subjected to further analysis after initial quality control.  These were subdivided into forests on (1) very infertile soils (N = 5), (2) (moderately) infertile soils (N = 5), (3) moderately fertile soils (N = 4) and (4) fertile soils (N = 4).  Two studies pertaining to large river basins were treated separately.  Although variation in nutrient fluxes was large, reflecting both natural and methodological factors, scatter plots of annual calcium, magnesium and potassium losses v. annual runoff for small catchment areas revealed four groups with characteristic nutrient export patterns that corresponded closely with soil fertility levels.  Element losses from the two large basins were much higher than those recorded for small basins in the same areas and were interpreted in terms of depths of weathering front, river incision and root network.  Phosphorus accumulated in virtually all cases, reflecting the low mobility of the element.  Nitrogen budgets were generally very incomplete.  There is a need for more and careful studies of tropical forest nutrient budgets, especially for nitrogen.  Standardization of methodology is essential if comparability of results is to be improved.

AB In May and June of 1989 data on elephant (Loxodonta africana) dung density were collected in the main forested areas of the Central African Republic.  A total of 147.0 km of line transects (N = 14 transects, xBAR = 10.50 km, SD = 3.79) was completed.  Dung was recorded in 37.4% of the 294 sectors of 0.5 km each.  The overall dung density was estimated to be 266 piles km-2 (xBAR = 382, SD = 383.7).  The highest dung density was found in the proposed Dzanga-Sangha Reserve in the extreme south-west with 1166 piles km-2 (N = 12 sectors of 0.5 km).  The south-eastern forests were found to have an intermediate dung density of 336 piles km-2 (N = 215 sectors of 0.5 km, xBAR = 419, SD = 308).  In the eastern section of the south-western forests no dung was recorded along survey transects (N = 67 sectors of 0.5 km).  These data indicate that elephant populations are still relatively high in the forests of south-western and south-eastern Central African Republic, while the population in the eastern section of the south-western forests has diminished to a very low level.

SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY

DE AUSTRALIA; SAVANNA WOODLAND; SEED-HARVESTING ANTS; SEED PREDATION; SEED
   VIABILITY; SPECIALIST FORAGING
AB Ant species in the genera Chelaner, Meranoplus and Pheidole were found to be seed-harvesters in a tropical savanna woodland in northern Australia.  Despite the availability of other seed types (legume seeds in particular were abundant), all five seed-harvesting species studied are specialists in that they store only grass seeds.  Depot experiments, in which seeds were placed along foraging trails, also indicate a preference for grass seeds over legume seeds.  At least for some ant species the handling efficiency of legume seeds may be less than that of grass seeds.  Marked differences in seed composition of granaries were observed among different seed-harvesting ant species and among colonies of the same species at different sites.  All ant species studied, except Pheidole sp. 1, stored only one type of grass seed in granaries at any site despite the availability of other seed types.  This contrasts with studies conducted elsewhere in Australia in which generalist foraging by seed-harvesters was found to be common.  With the possible exception of Pheidole, dietary specialization does not appear to arise from a low diversity or abundance of seed supplies.  In addition to differences in seed preferences, species of seed-harvesting ants also exhibited some differences in temporal foraging behaviour and some partitioning of resources may be occurring among these co-occurring species.  Temporal overlap in foraging, however, was much greater than dietary overlap.  The viability of granary seeds was very low for three ant species suggesting that seeds stored by these ants were largely predated rather than dispersed.

AB Carollia perspicillata and Sturnira lilium are two species of abundant and widely distributed phyllostomid bats.  Both are frugivorous and frequently found coexisting in the same areas.  A study on feeding habits and morphology of C. perspicillata and S. lilium was conducted at Serra do Japi, Sao Paulo, south-eastern Brazil, investigating the mechanisms associated with their coexistence.  The two species are fairly similar in morphology and feeding habits.  Analysis of faeces produced by captured bats revealed that there is a significant difference in diet between the two species.  C. perspicillata tends to specialize in fruits of the genus Piper and S. lilium specializes in Solanum fruits.  The fruiting periods of the four species of Piper eaten by bats at the study site are successive, with little overlap and high productivity.  The species of Solanum have long and overlapping fruiting periods, with very low productivity.  Piper and Solanum provide food resources almost all year, allowing the food specialization that may be an important mechanism of resource partitioning between C. perspicillata and S. lilium.

AB Soil mineralization and nitrification rates were measured in (1) undisturbed and felled gaps of varying size in terra firme forest, and (2) along a forest - savanna transect, on Ilha de Maraca in northern Brazil.  Both rates were similar to those found in studies of other forests with a marked seasonal rainfall pattern.  However, rates were much lower than those of tropical forests where there is little seasonality in rainfall.  A major finding was that the highest rates were during the transition between dry and wet seasons, implying that wetting and drying may be an important initiator of soil nitrogen flux.  Felling had little effect on either process up to a gap size of 2500 m2.  In the forest-savanna study, nitrogen mineralization was lower in the savanna in all seasons, but in the wet season when the savanna soils were water-logged NH4+-N was immobilized.  Experimental additions of nutrients identified two important results; first that added NH4+-N was quickly immobilized rather than nitrified - this may be an important nutrient conservation mechanism, and second that soil calcium appeared to be a limiting factor, either directly or through a pH effect.

AB The red land crab (Gecarcoidea natalis) is the major collector of fruits and seeds from the rain forest floor on Christmas Island, Indian Ocean.  At three sites, they rapidly removed fruits and seeds of 17 species tested (usually within 12 h after placement) and most were taken to crab burrows.  Direct observations of seed predation, and application of estimated chelar forces of red crabs indicated that seeds of many species, especially those with thin seed coats, are likely to be killed through handling.  However, removal of some resistant seeds to burrows may be favourable for seedling establishment when canopy gaps occur.  Fruit removal rates by crabs were positively related to nitrogen concentration in fruit tissues but negatively correlated with condensed tannins.  These observations suggest that seed predation by land crabs may affect the success of colonization and the relative abundance of plants on oceanic islands.

It germinated well in the three soil types used but germination in humus and sand was significantly better than in red earth.  There was an increase in germination with an increase in burial up to 1.5 cm, thereafter germination levelled off.  There was no germination in water-logged conditions and there was an increase in germination as soil moisture decreased.  Alternating temperatures of 31/21-degrees-C and 31/15-degrees-C favoured germination while 21/15-degrees-C inhibited germination.  The results are discussed in relation to the phenology and distribution of the species.

AB A comparison is made of the light acclimation potential of seedlings of three canopy species of the tropical rain forest of Los Tuxtlas, Mexico:  Cordia megalantha, Lonchocarpus guatemalensis, and Omphalea oleifera.  These species showed similar growth rates in a range of microhabitats.  Gap dynamics were simulated by transferring plants between three environments:  beneath a closed canopy, a small gap, and a large gap.  Plants of all three species were able to adjust their morphology and growth rates in response to changes in light availability.  Growth rates increased when plants were moved to a (larger) gap, and decreased when plants were moved to a more shaded environment.  Shade-grown plants were able to acclimate faster to increasing light availabilty than sun-grown plants to decreasing light availability.  Also, plants moved from shady to sunny conditions showed higher relative growth rates than sun control plants, whereas sun-grown plants when moved to the shade showed lower relative growth rates than shade control plants.  Species differed in their response to gap dynamics.  Omphalea could not acclimate morphologically to shading, but reacted faster than the other species in response to the occurrence of a large gap.  Acclimation potential seemed to be related to plasticity in physiological rather than in morphological traits.  Suppressed seedlings of all three species performed well in the shade, and were able to acclimate rapidly to gap-conditions.

AB An assessment of carnivore species richness and food habits was carried out in a 100 km2 area of dry tropical forest in Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary, Thailand.  Twenty-one carnivore species of five families were found to be feeding on at least 34 mammal species, as well as birds, lizards, snakes, crabs, fish, insects, and fruits.  Forty-four percent of the prey identified in faeces of larger carnivores, primarily leopards, consisted of barking deer, Muntiacus muntjak.  Sambar deer, macaques, wild boar, porcupine, and hog badger were important secondary prey items.  In faeces from small carnivores (< 10 kg), murid rodents accounted for 33% of identified food items.  The two most frequently encountered mammalian prey species were the yellow rajah rat, Maxomys surifer, and the bay bamboo rat, Cannomys badius.  Non-mammal prey accounted for 21.3%, and fruit seeds for 12.4%, of all food items found in small carnivore faeces.

AB Nanophyes shoreae is a pre-dispersal fruit-predator of several species of Dipterocarpaceae.  The timing of oviposition of this weevil was monitored in six trees in Pasoh Forest Reserve, West Malaysia from September 1986 to February 1987.  A flowering event occurred during this period.  Oviposition started within 12 days after peak anthesis, and continued within any one tree for 11-39 days.  Host trees of N. shoreae flowered over a 75 day period.  Intra-specific flowering synchrony was high but different species flowered sequentially.  The behaviour of N. shoreae and the period of the oviposition 'window' strongly suggest that this pre-dispersal fruit-predator 'tracks' the sequence of flowering shown by its host species.  The implications for predator satiation through mass-flowering of the Dipterocarpacea are discussed.

TI FRUIT PRODUCTION BY ACACIA-ALBIDA TREES IN ZAMBEZI RIVERINE WOODLANDS
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL ECOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
DE ACACIA-ALBIDA; FRUITS; PRODUCTION; ZAMBEZI
AB Fruit production by Acacia albida (Leguminosae:  Mimosoideae) trees in Mana Pools National Park, Zimbabwe, was monitored over eight years.  Timing of ripe fruit-fall varied between years, as did fruit production:  production of ripe fruits by the same tree varied from 5.4 kg in 1983 to 290.1 kg in 1988.  Baboons reduced fruit production by feeding on unripe fruits and the mass eaten each year was negatively correlated with rainfall.  Potential fruit production (i.e. production in the absence of baboons) was high when the late wet season was wet or cool and when fruit production in the previous year was low.  Late wet season rainfall and temperature probably determined the degree of defoliation by caterpillars:  in 1983 and 1987, when the late wet season was hot and dry, the trees were almost completely defoliated.  During the late dry season, A. albida fruits were an important component of the diets of waterbuck, eland, elephant, buffalo and kudu; they were seldom eaten by hippopotamus and were ignored by zebra and warthog.

   SEED-DISPERSAL; TROPICAL RAIN FOREST; VOUACAPOUA-AMERICANA
AB A possible mutualistic dispersal system between a large-seeded tree of French Guiana, Vouacapoua americana (Caesalpiniaceae), and caviomorph rodents, Myoprocta exilis and Dasyprocta leporina, is described.  Mast fruiting of Vouacapoua at the beginning of the wet season coincides with scatter-hoarding seed dispersal.  During the wet season, almost 100% of marked seeds on three sites were removed:  nearly 70% were buried and the rest were eaten by mammals.  Unburied seeds were attacked by insects and/or lost their ability to germinate.  Rodents preferred ungerminated seeds, and had no interest in germinated seeds.  Seeds were buried individually near natural objects such as palms, branches, logs, lianas, roots and trees.  After predation by rodents, seedling distribution did not differ from seed distribution.  Most seeds were transported less than 5 m from the feeding plots but some were carried as far as 22.4 m.  Between 40 and 85% of dispersed seeds were retrieved during the following month by rodents and eaten.  The disinterest of caviomorph rodents in germinated seeds, because of rapid exhaustion of endosperm reserves, prevents feeding from hoarded Vouacapoua during the long dry season when resources are scarce.  Seedlings emerging from forgotten or abandoned cached seeds appear to increase the recruitment of Vouacapoua americana.

   FOREST; TROPHIC STRUCTURE
AB Bat communities in the understorey of primary lowland dipterocarp forest in peninsular Malaysia and Sabah were sampled with mist nets and harp traps to estimate their trophic structure.  Overall, 4 of 26 species (15%) at one site, and 6 of 33 species (18%) at the other site were frugivores, while the remainder were insectivores.  In terms of individuals, 7-12% of all captures were frugivores.  However, the true proportion of frugivores at both sites was probably closer to 1%, because the sampling procedures were strongly biased towards frugivores.  In contrast, previously published studies indicate that frugivores comprise 34-48% of species, and up to 80% of individuals in bat communities in the understorey of Neotropical forest.  These results support the hypothesis, developed from studies of bird communities, that the understorey of Malaysian dipterocarp forest supports relatively few obligate frugivores, at least in non-masting years.  However, further data are required on bats in the canopy, and on the foraging ranges of bats to compare the absolute densities of bats in Malaysian and Neotropical forests.

TI MINERAL NUTRIENT FLOW FROM AN INSELBERG IN SOUTH-WESTERN NIGERIA

DE ENRICHMENT; INSELBERG; NUTRIENTS; FLOW SIMULATION; SOUTH-WESTERN
   NIGERIA; RUNOFF
AB In a study carried out to find out if inselbergs enrich their surroundings with nutrients via drainage, amounts of total nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen and potassium in rainfall, drainage from bare rock patches and vegetation mats on an inselberg in south-western Nigeria were measured over one year.  43.3 kg ha-1 total nitrogen, 4.8 kg ha-1 nitrate-nitrogen and 10.7 kg ha-1 potassium were recorded in rainfall for the year of study.  The amount of total nitrogen in drainage from bare rock was 79% of that in rainfall whilst that in drainage from vegetation mats was 29% of the rainfall amount.  The respective values for nitrate-nitrogen were 57% and 13%; for potassium they were 90% and 38%.
   It was assumed that the loss of nutrients as water drains through vegetation mats and over bare patches was due to absorption by plants and soil in the mats and lichens in the bare patches.  It was therefore concluded that there was no net enrichment of rainwater with nutrients as it flows over inselberg slopes.  There is, however, a funelling of water along with contained nutrients from the inselberg to the surrounding areas.  This funnelling is additional to the nutrients and rainfall incident on these surrounding areas and may account for the vegetation around inselbergs being more lush than vegetation in the same area but further away from the inselbergs.
   A simple modelling approach was used to assess potential nutrient outflow from inselbergs.  The model shows that discharge of nutrients from the edges of inselbergs increases linearly with inselberg diameter.  The model further shows that if nutrient funnelling only affects an area near to the edge of the inselberg then nutrient addition is several times higher than would be expected from rainfall deposition alone.

AB Fruit production by an understorey tree, Miconia centrodesma, was monitored in treefall gaps and under intact canopy in a Costa Rican lowland rain forest.  Trees in gaps displayed much less seasonality in fruit production than trees of intact forest sites.  For example, ripe fruits were common on gap trees for a six month period (January-June) when few or no trees under intact canopy were in fruit.  The frequent and aseasonal fruiting of gap trees demonstrates that they are not constrained by phenological cueing mechanisms; the influence of such cues is overridden by habitat.  Trees in gaps also produced larger crops, had more extended fruiting episodes, and fruited more frequently than shaded conspecifics.  This level of intraspecific variation in fruiting behaviour suggests that treefall gaps play an important role in determining the reproductive success of M. centrodesma.  A substantial proportion of an individual's lifetime seed output may be produced during the brief period it occupies a gap.  In addition, the large and continuous supply of fruits produced in gaps by M. centrodesma and other understorey plants, may mean that gaps function as 'keystone habitats' by providing resident frugivores with fruit during periods of general fruit scarcity.

DT Article
DE LEAF-LITTER; LITTERFALL; MEXICO; SEASONALITY; TROPICAL DECIDUOUS FOREST
AB Continuous litterfall measurements were made from 1977 to 1982, at two sites with contrasting topography in a mature tropical deciduous forest in Chamela, Jalisco, on the Pacific Coast of Mexico (19-degrees 30' N, 105-degrees 03' W).  The climate is strongly seasonal with the annual rainfall (x = 748 mm) concentrated in six months (June to November) and a mean annual temperature of 24.9-degrees-C.  Results of the five-year study show that at the Valley Site (slope < 5-degrees) the mean annual litterfall was 6.58 +/- 0.15 (SE) Mg ha-1 y-1 composed of 73.3% leaves, 17.1% woody material, 5.6% reproductive remains and 4.0% finely fragmented debris.  At the Hill Site (slope 20-degrees-40-degrees) mean annual litterfall was 3.95 +/- 0.16 Mg ha-1 y-1, consisting of 68.8% leaves, 17.0% woody material, 9.4% reproductive remains and 4.7% fragmented debris.  At the Valley Site the year-to-year variation in total litterfall was not significant.  In contrast, at the Hill Site it fluctuated markedly from year to year.  Litter production exhibited a pronounced seasonality:  at the Hill Site total litterfall peaked near the onset of the dry season; at the Valley Site it occurred two months later, apparently as a result of differences in soil moisture availability between the study sites.

AB One component of the high organismal diversity of tropical lowland rain forests is the existence of series of closely related, sympatric species.  For example, the six distinct tree species of the monophyletic Polyalthia hypoleuca complex regularly grow sympatrically in various combinations throughout the rain forests of Malesia.  Theoretical and empirical evidence has been presented indicating that the members of such series either (1) are well differentiated with respect to at least one major niche component; or (2) may lack differentiated niches.  In this study, certain sympatric members of the complex are shown to have clearly diverged in autecological characteristics that affect their distribution including:  (1) P. glauca, P. hypoleuca, and P. sumatrana differ in growth characteristics, height at maturity, seedling germination requirements, and are found on soils with differing degrees of hydration; (2) P. discolor grows to a different height and on different substrate types than does P. multinervis; and (3) P. glauca and P. hypoleuca seedlings differ in transpiration characteristics and response to flooding and drought.

AB There was fruiting of the dipterocarps of Pantai Aceh Forest Reserve, Penang, Peninsular Malaysia in September 1986.  The opportunity was taken to investigate the establishment and seedling survival of Shorea curtisii, Shorea multiflora and Shorea pauciflora over the subsequent year.  The germination and seedling survival of Shorea curtisii was compared between canopy gaps and forest understorey sites.
   Under the shaded conditions none of the species grew beyond the two leaf stage over their first year.  Shorea multiflora seedlings suffered a 72% mortality, significantly lower than that of Shorea pauciflora (89%) and Shorea curtisii (93%).  The major cause of mortality appeared to be drought, though Shorea curtisii was also prone to predation by small mammals.
   In a gap, Shorea curtisii seeds probably germinated less well but seedling survival (28% versus 7%) and growth was better than canopy-shaded conspecifics.  Seedlings in gaps escaped small mammal predation.
